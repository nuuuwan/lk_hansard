Order read for resuming Adjourned Debate on Question - [8th November] "That the Bill be now read a Second time" - [His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa] Question again proposed. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . 35 .

[10.33 a.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, nearly four years ago, when the LTTE was conclusively defeated, many Sri Lankans, even those who did not agree with the Government on the way the war was conducted in the final stages, were optimistic and hopeful that our country would at last achieve the economic prosperity, which has alluded our people since Independence. A window of opportunity, Mr. Speaker, presented itself to our war-ravaged nation to leave the mistakes of our past behind us and move forward to harness the bright and prosperous future that our people have been demanding for generations.

However, as we debate the fourth Budget of the Rajapaksa administration since the conclusion of the war, Sri Lanka, today, is a country in grave crisis. There is an unprecedented economic crisis looming in the horizon. The rampant corruption and economic mismanagement, the systematic dismantling of the rule of law, while trying to subjugate the independence of our institutions from Hultsdorf to Welikada to suit the agenda of the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

and also the international isolation because of the Governments refusal to honour its commitments by the international community, has turned Sri Lanka into a virtual time bomb today.

The peace dividend, anticipated by our people has yet to materialize for 99.9 per cent of our population, while a small group of family members, political cronies and a handpicked group or what I would call "tenderpreneurs" - not entrepreneurs but tenderpreneurs - are reaping the benefits of the peace dividend, making virtual paupers into dollar millionaires overnight. In fact, we know of advertising executives with limited incomes - who did not even have a vehicle six years ago - are now boasting that they are billionaires. While naval officers with the right family connections along with their siblings are listed as top shareholders in various companies.

In fact, I am not going to dwelve on that too much because I already tabled some documents. For, example, if you take the company reports of Ascot Holdings PLC for 2011, there are these young people who are in the top 20 shareholders list: Mr. Y.K. Rajapaksa, we do not know who he is but we hear that he is a naval officer and Mr. N. Rajapaksa, who owns millions and millions of shares in the stock market. As I told you, I have tabled these documents before and I am not going to table them again. In fact, the chosen place of play for this is 0.1 per cent - there is 99.9 per cent who are not reaping the dividends of peace time, while a very small minority, 0.1 per cent, is reaping all the dividends and for this 0.1 per cent, Mr. Speaker - their place of play is the stock market and the chosen sphere of business for this selected group is mainly land speculation, especially in Colombo. Their chosen mode of travel is, of course, flashy racing cars like Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Aston Martins. In a classic Marie Antoinette gesture, President Rajapaksa was audacious enough to grant a duty waiver -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, - [Interruption.]

1487 1488

2012 17

Wait, wait! You are trying to kill yourself through jealousy -[Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) It is not a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my point of Order is this. He said that "certain things have been done to suit the Executive" which cannot be told. Also, he referred to N. Rajapaksa. There is an N. Rajapaksa in this House. Therefore, Sir, all those must be expunged. He is talking with utter jealousy.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) He was audacious enough to grant a duty waiver to luxury racing cars, what I would call as a classic Marie Antoinette gesture by this Government.

In the face of such ostentations Sir, the billion-dollar question asked by many people is" where is all this money coming from? Mr. Speaker, as I said on the Floor of this House last week during the Adjournment Debate on KP Padmanathan, there are reasonable grounds to believe that part of the black money, which has flooded into the stock market in Colombo as well as some of the FDIs in Colombo, is LTTE blood money. In fact, it was after the arrest of KP, the only surviving member of the inner circle of Prabhakaran and, therefore, the only living person privy to the assets of the multi-billion dollar empire of the LTTE, that black money started flowing into Sri Lanka and what was a trickle in 2009, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, has become a deluge today.

In fact, today Sri Lanka has earned the dubious distinction of being one of the principal centres for money laundering, East of Suez. But, again I am not going to dwelve on this LTTE aspect because I think I dealt with this last week during the Adjournment Debate. But, of course, the other source of black money, according to informed sources, is the massive commissions which are coming to this country from the Chinese loans. In a website called "Chinese Loan Conditions" - I will, of course, even give you the reference - www.china powercontractor.cn gov-finance - I have the document here, Mr. Speaker. This is a Chinese website actually claiming that, I quote:

you as an agent to earn million USD commission....

This is their English, Chinese English, certainly not my English -

as others have achieved during the past."

In that document, it is stated, I quote:

Before your reading of the book, you never thinking of that you can also get Chinese Government loans, China finance or credit loans for your projects or you as agent to earn million USD commission....."

And, also it statess, if you are a commission agent,

"Government projects EPC and financing, you should have high profile connections with government officials such as National President, Minister of Finance (or related Minister of the projects.)"

They are actually saying that these loans are available and if you come forward as an agent for these loans it is even better if you have connections with the national President of that respective country or if you have connections with the Finance Minister of that respective country or the Project Minister - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What is the country? You name the country.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) This is in general. This is not for a country. This is for the whole world. It has nothing to do with Sri Lanka.-[Interruption.] If he does not understand English, Hon. Speaker - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) This is not for any specific country. This is an advice given to anyone, anywhere in the world. Anyone can actually access it from the web if they want to apply for a loan from China, But, at the end, they also said, I quote:

Other financed projects include....."

Talking about various projects which they have got they have also said -

Other finance projects include: 450 million USD for power plant and transmission projects in Sri Lanka (Puttalam Coal Fired 3 x 300 MW) and 2 x 350 MW in Sri Lanka, 120 million USD of telecommunication projects in Africa, 250 million USD for railway projectsin Africa."

1489 1490

I will table* this document and I hope you can include it in the Hansard.

I would also like to refer to an article written by a journalist in New Delhi, a renowned journalist and also a strategic analysts in Delhi, Mr. Rajeev Sharma and it was published in dbsjeyaraj.com. You want me to give the names, but according to the Standing Orders, I will not talk about certain names.

But, I will just censor this myself, while speaking to you, Mr. Speaker. It states, "Sri Lankan members may get US Dollars 1.2 to 1.8 billion as commissions for Chinese projects during 2005 to 2015." Happy Birthday! In fact, I must remember to wish the President today. Happy Birthday! Mr. President. Is it not his birthday today? When I talked about 2005, I suddenly remembered that it was his birthday.

Anyway, the website states, I quote:

"The Dragons shadow is lengthening over Sri Lanka with every passing day. China has committed since 2005 contracts and investments worth US Dollars 6.4 billion, as per Treasury records. So far, US Dollars 3.6 billion has been disbursed. Projects worth US Dollars 2.8 billion are waiting to be signed. In another three years, the Chinese investment in Sri Lanka will nearly double and touch US Dollars 12 billion."

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Member, D.B.S. Jeyaraj is an LTTEer. He is a well-known LTTEer.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Actually, he is at the moment, but - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) He is a well-known LTTEer. - [Interruption.] Do not refer to any LTTE sources - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am not. You had better - [Interruption.] That does not matter. - [Interruption.] Let me continue. I am quoting from his website and also if I may correct you, during the last few years - you ask Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa -

D.B.S. Jeyaraj has been one of the biggest defenders of the Rajapaksa regime. You had better read his articles. You are very much out of touch. He is a Tamil person, but he is the biggest defender of the Rajapaksa regime in all his articles.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) He is an LTTEer. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) You read it. - [Interruption.] Never mind but I am taking -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is another point of Order being raised by the Hon. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, there are over 600 websites in the world and one website is run by Mr. Mangala Samaraweera himself. Is he taking responsibility for that?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is the man who is running websites and he himself feeds them. Can he take responsibility? - [Interruption.] What about your website, your dirty website? You are sending untruths to the world. Shameless! Sir, being a Member of this House, he cannot have a website.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Shameless man!

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The website further states:

"Like in Africa, here also, commissions are paid to agents and front companies and these are really hefty probably because of the competition the Chinese are facing in grabbing local business."

- [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Available data - this is very important. Hon. Ministers, listen to this. It states, "Available data shows that Sri Lanka stands to receive in commission anywhere - the commission alone - between US Dollars 1.2 to 1.8 billion during 2005 to 2015". US Dollars 1.8 billion has been received as commissions. "It works out to an annual 'intake' of US Dollars 120 to 180 million per year from the Chinese Projects. An intricate web of front companies is in place to receive and disburse the commissions, as is the practice with Chinese loans".

In fact, it goes on to even name certain people - "Names of two businessmen figure prominently in the shady business deals with Sri Lanka. One of them is Bandula Weerawardena, then of course, Prabath Nanayakkara then, Prabaths mainstay, Dilshan Wickremasinghe, who is also the son of the Chairman of SriLankan Airlines and who is also fronting a company called 'Asset Networks (Pvt.) Limited and Asset International', both subsidies of Prabaths Asset Holdings (Pvt.) Limited and he is also fronting a company called 'Mitchell Consortium' which was recently given the contract in Sampur in Trincomalee". We have received all the information. We are doing our work very well. We have got international companies going after these secrets, Sir, at the moment. And, we know that most of these companies are actually nothing but fake companies; nothing but shell companies and nothing but front companies for some other people. While opening our doors to the robber barons of the world - robber kings of our own country are laundering their own ill-gotten wealth within our own country. Unlike kleptocrats of the past who eat their wealth in Swiss accounts, the new robber kings feel that their money invested within their own country is safer.

The stringent anti-laundering laws in the West, as well as their recent experiences during the Arab Spring where billions of dollars worth of assets belonging to Mubarak and Gaddafi were frozen and seized, it has made many corrupt leaders in Africa and Asia to loan their wealth within their own countries Mr. Speaker. Money laundering at its simplest - if I may say so, is the act of making money that comes from Source A, and looks like it comes from Source B. In practice, criminals are trying to discuss the origins of money through illegal activities so, it looks like it was obtained through legal sources. There are many methods of money-laundering but, the most commonly used method which is there again according to the World Bank is a method called round-tripping. In round-tripping, money is deposited in a controlled foreign corporation offshore, preferably in a tax haven where minimal records are kept and then, shipped back as a Foreign Direct Investment exempt from taxation. I am only quoting from a tip of an iceberg. In fact, in 2013, we will be able to reveal many more details about this.

Also, according to the StAR initiative of the World Bank, - Stolen Asset Recovery - which is a new unit of the World Bank, forming shell companies are a common method used by money-launderers. Shell companies are defined by the OECD in behind the corporate veil of 2001, as companies which are entities established not to pursue any legitimate business activity but solely to obscure the identity of the beneficial owners and controllers.

In fact, I must take this opportunity to recommend to all Members the House to read that World Bank publication - I am sure the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama has read it - it is called the puppet masters how the corrupt use legal structures to hide stolen assets and what to do about it. And as you all know, multinationals are reluctant to invest in Sri Lanka because there are well-known multinationals. I am talking about the serious established well-known renowned multinationals are reluctant to invest in Sri Lanka because of serious human rights warfare in the allegations and most of the FDIs which have come into Sri Lanka over the past few years have been from such shell companies. In fact, as I told you a minute ago, as Rajeev Sharma writes in that article, the Mitchell Consortium of Australia which was given the contract to set up a Heavy Industry Zone in Sampur could also be a paper company. In fact, in that article - again I take full responsibility for what I am saying - in the Trincomalee deal also, Prabath signed the agreement with the Board of Investment on 13th June, 2012, just recently. Asset Holding (Pvt.) Limited is a partner of Mitchell Consortium of Australia, which had won a contract for setting up a Heavy Industry Zone in Sampur.

Spread over 1,200 acres, the project will see an investment of US Dollars 2 billion. It will be completed in three phases and the Cabinet approved the project on 23rd February, 2011. The Mitchell Consortium comprises of four companies: Mitchell Group of Australia, Salva Corporation (Mining Services), Asset Holdings (Pvt.) Limited and an unnamed Brazilian partner. Inquiries, Mr. Speaker - this is what is very important - show that the Mitchell Group could be a paper company acting as a front for Prabath.

If so, could it be a case of re-routing the money earned by people in Sri Lanka in the Chinese projects with Prabath acting as the front man of an illegal empire? This is a round trip; this is what the World Bank calls "round-tripping" in terms of money-laundering. So, as I said earlier, because of the black money, on one side, from the LTTE and on the other, from this Chinese project, Sri Lanka has now become known as one of the most important centres for money-laundering, East of the Suez Canal. In fact, Sir, this new Rajapaksa economy based on black money has deprived the people to prosper in life within a level playing field.

There is the UNPs Radical Sstatement to be presented to the UNP Convention on 1st December, which states, I quote:

The UNPs Radical Statement specifically rejects the Colombo Stock Market capitalism based on the primacy of markets. We have again reiterated our belief in a highly competitive social market economy.

Therefore, the Radical Statement upholds the primacy of politics where the principles relating to the market economy is determined by the political process, which is committed to providing opportunity for all.

Today, under the new crony capitalist economy of this regime, the universal values of fairness have been sacrificed to the greed of a few. Joseph Stiglitz's famous caption "of the one per cent, by the one per cent and for the one per cent" describes the situation in Sri Lanka today where 0.1 per cent of racketeers, tenderpreneurs and corrupt politicians have hijacked our economy to become dollar billionaires overnight while 99.9 per cent of the population, including the legitimate private sector which is also suffering today, are facing hardships as never before and most of our citizens are seeing their standard of living erode day by day, hour by hour and minute by minute, Sir. As the Rajapaksa Government stands condemned and isolated other than for a few like-minded megalomaniacs from Africa and elsewhere quoting economic ruins for our country, the UNP believes that it is time to reposition our policies and values and start investing in our people. - [Interruption.] In fact, we are becoming increasingly more and more isolated and today, I think this Government is trying to make a new international order with some of the dictators and the discredited leaders of this world. We saw a few days ago the President of Uganda,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

who, like his counterpart here,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

In fact, Sir, the constitutional witch-hunt initiated by the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

against the Chief Justice has further eroded Sri Lankas credential as a civilized functioning democracy. The UN as well as many other members of the international community have expressed their deep concern about the Impeachment Motion against the Chief Justice. - [Interruption.] In a statement issued in Geneva -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Impeachment Motion .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , I am not talking about it but I have to mention that. - [ ] , , . - [ ] . - [Interruption.] I am quoting the UN Special Rapporteur -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I would like to quote from a news release about the concerns expressed by Ms. Gabriela Knaul, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, which states, I quote:

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, today expressed serious concerns about reported intimidation and attacks against judges and judicial officers, and warned that they might form part of a pattern of attacks, threats, reprisals and interference in the independence of the justice system in Sri Lanka.

'I urge the Sri Lanka Government to take immediate and adequate measures to ensure the physical and mental integrity of members of

1497 1498

the judiciary and to allow them to perform their professional duties without any restrictions, improper influences, pressures, threats or interference, in line with the countrys international human rights obligations',....."

Sir, I would like to say, as she correctly points out, that the misuse of disciplinary proceedings as a reprisal mechanism against independent judges is unacceptable. It is not a secret that the ruling powers perceive the Chief Justice and the Judiciary as a major stumbling block to the autocratic, dynastic agenda and that is why the shoddy charge sheet - shoddy, I say again - full of factual errors has been rushed to Parliament with its docile and obliging majority. - [Interruption.] From this charge sheet, it is obvious that the law of the jungle is also prevailing in the banking sector. Some of the charges are based on information taken from banks in violation of the banking secrecy laws. - [Interruption.] The officials of the NDB, who are accomplices to this constitutional witch-hunt, must be firmly dealt with by the law. In proceeding with this Motion, - [Interruption.] Sir, let me say one word. I want to advise you also, if you do not mind. The onus is now on the Speaker, who is also the current - [Interruption.] Sir, do not forget that you are not only the Speaker of this august Assembly, but also the current President of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and it is up to you to ensure that the proceedings are in line with the Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles on the Three Branches of Government. However, the Government has already violated some of the criteria agreed upon by all the Commonwealth countries including Sri Lanka. The Latimer House Guidelines for the Commonwealth states, I quote:

In cases where a judge is at risk of removal, the judge must have the right to be fully informed of the charges, to be represented at a hearing, to make a full defence and to be judged by an independent and impartial tribunal.

But, of course, the tribunal appointed for the purpose of examining the Motion is far from impartial and heavily loaded in Governments favour. - [Interruption.] Far from being independent and impartial, many of those appointed by the Government are akin to the fanatical inquisitors of the Dark Ages, as we see right before us at this very moment. - [Interruption.]

Finally, Sir, I would like to conclude my speech by stating what Shaveen Bandaranayake, the son of the CJ, wrote recently: The time has come for each and everyone of us to take a stand, a stand not merely to support Shirani Bandaranayake, but to stand for the independence of the Judiciary and a democratic society".

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) In conclusion, Sir, I would like to quote from this article titled "Excellent -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . [ ] .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to table* the article written by Shaveen Bandaranayake, an excellent article, from someone so young.

I think it must be included in Hansard. The concluding passage of his article states, I quote:

An individual can live his/her life seeing the injustice around them, show a blind eye and die a forgotten entity. Or, you can stand up against tyranny and make a stand. The Chief Justice of the democratic socialist republic of Sri Lanka is making a stand.

Which side you, the citizen takes, defines who we are as Sri Lankans!

Thank you.

[1.38 p.m.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you for granting me this opportunity to speak in the Second Reading of the eighth Budget of our Government. Before I delve into the Budget Proposals for the year 2013 presented by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, let me enlighten the House, particularly those in the Opposition and especially the TNA Parliamentarians, the miraculous achievement made by this Government since the armed conflict was brought to an end. I wish to place on record that the areas cleared from the LTTE were being developed by the Government even during the time the conflict was going on.

With the end of the conflict in May 2009, the Government was faced with new challenges. Large numbers of people were to be resettled; they were to be temporarily sheltered and fed until the demining is completed; the entire infrastructure of the North had to be rebuilt; the resettled people had to be provided with shelters and means of livelihood.

To meet these challenges, the Government embarked on a massive development drive. While extending welfare services to those large numbers of internally displaced in the welfare centres, various programmes were drawn up under the courageous leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. These programmes were collectively known as Vadakkin Vasantham. The words development, progress and prosperity of Northern

Province would have been confined only to the vocabulary, if not for His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksas vision and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksas mission in dealing with such a situation.

Today, I am proud to announce in this august Assembly that within this short span of three years, our Government has not only resettled the displaced civilians as fast as possible but also has built and is in the process of building roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and all other basic infrastructural facilities such as electricity, water supply et cetera. To be more precise, a staggering sum of Rs. 123,304 million has been spent and earmarked for completion by the end of this year for the development of the Northern Province since May, 2009; the details being Rs. 29,224 million for the Jaffna District, Rs. 28,706 million for the Kilinochchi District and Rs. 28,119 million for the Mullaitivu District, Rs. 26,376 million for the Vavuniya District and Rs. 10,879 million for the Mannar District.

It is a historic achievement. No government in the past has spent such a colossal sum towards the development of these districts. The Progress Reports available with the District Secretaries of these districts stand testimony to this statement. These Progress Reports further reveal that the mega infrastructure development drive geared towards these districts has resulted in yielding enhanced productivity and contributed towards the GDP of the country.

One TNA Member of Parliament, while speaking on the Floor of this House, stated that the Northern part of Sri Lanka has been completely ignored in this Budget. He has also said that out of the allocation made to Provincial Councils, he was not sure as to how much would be allocated to the North. He further stated that the Capital Expenditure allocated for the year to the Provincial Councils is only Rs. 14 billion. I table* herewith pages 246 and 247 of the Budget Estimates for the year 2013.

By glancing through these pages of the Budget Estimates for the Provincial Councils, anybody could see that the Eastern and the Northern Provinces have got the highest allocation of the Capital Expenditure of Rs. 5.1 billion and Rs. 3.8 billion respectively. These are the highest and the second highest amounts of Capital Expenditure allocations, compared to all other provinces. It reiterates the Governments policy of balanced regional development and development of hitherto underserved areas with particular attention to the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. I do not understand why this TNA Member of Parliament has made such a false statement. I am not sure whether that Member did not understand the contents of the Budget Estimates or was trying to mislead

this House, and through his media the outside world. That Member of Parliament had attended the DCC meeting for Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts and he is well aware of the huge sums of money spent for the development of these districts. They speak here for the Tamil Press. Although they address the Chair, Sir, the entire focus is on the Tamil media up in the gallery for their cheap political publicity.

He has also stated, Sir, that people have lost faith in the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jaffna, Prof. Vasanthy Arasaratnam. I wish to inform the House that when the present Vice-Chancellor took office, the Jaffna University was ranked 9,306 in the world and today it is ranked 5,662. It was in the 9th place in Sri Lanka and today it is in the 7th place. For the first time in the history of the Jaffna University, an International Research Conference was held under her Chairmanship. Are they not achievements? Will people lose faith in the Vice- Chancellor who had improved the standards of the University?

The Members of Parliament of the TNA are uttering untruths to the world and in this House too. It is the same Parliamentarian, who, decades ago swindled the money of innocent civilians. He was involved with a finance company called "Sabra Finance Company" that cheated people the same way "Sakvithi" cheated in the South. A number of people who deposited their lifelong savings finally committed suicide. He is the real murderer who is responsible for the suicide of many innocents; today he speaks in this House as a saviour of human rights. Out of the defrauded money only, they established a daily newspaper in Jaffna, which was responsible for inducing the youth to join the LTTEs destructive acts and ultimately leading to their death.

. .

Sir, what the LTTE and its allies have destroyed for over 30 years, the Government is trying to rebuild within three to five years. I am at a loss to understand why my TNA Colleagues do not see these positive sides. I take this opportunity to call upon the TNA Parliamentarians and other Tamil political parties not to hamper the massive development drive and reconciliation process, unprecedented in the history of our country, undertaken by our Government, by their illusive political utterances. Earlier they said that the LTTE were the sole representatives of the Tamil people. They induced and indirectly supported the terrorist acts of the LTTE. They even did not condemn the killings of their own leaders and members like Amirthalingam, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, Thangathurai, Pathmanaba, Sri Sabaratnam and many others by the LTTE. If they have got the guts,

let them stand up and say that their leaders were killed by the LTTE terrorists.

Last year, they said they were going to USA to meet the Secretary of State, Mrs. Hilary Clinton and that they would seek the help of the Americans to bring about a political solution to the Tamils. Recently, they went to India saying that they seek the support of India to resolve the political issues of the Tamils. Even in the past, they did the same but when the Government invited them to take part in the All-Party Representative Committee, they declined. The Government has requested them to nominate members for the Parliamentary Select Committee. Instead of taking part in the Parliamentary Select Committee in finding a solution, with the consensus of all political parties, they are flying around the globe making false statements and misinforming the international community. In fact, they go abroad to meet their families and friends and to collect money from the Tamil diaspora for their false propaganda activities. They say that they are the sole representatives of Tamils and the Government should talk to them only. I do not see any difference between their mindset and that of Prabakaran; he also said the same.

They never make use of available opportunities, and then they put the blame on the successive Governments. When we said, decades ago, to begin with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment in full and then improve upon it, the TULF Members laughed at us and told us that it was a rotten and outdated solution and to throw it into the dustbin. Today, they have picked it up from their dustbin and their legal luminary is speaking about the same solution that we have been advocating for decades.

I read an article written by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, Member of Parliament, recently in a website, inter alia, stating, I quote:

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution can be built upon and made meaningful.

'It has some fundamental features, which need not be rediscovered. But before that the existing provisions that are not implemented must be immediately put into practice', .

I am sorry, the Hon. Sumanthiran may not be aware of what has been said by the TULF Members about the Thirteenth Amendment in the past because he was parachuted into politics through the backdoors only very recently. I understand that the Hon. Sumanthiran referred to two criminals during the course of his speech in Parliament recently. I am quite sure that he referred to one criminal, keeping in mind the one who had deceived the innocent civilians in the name of Sabra Finance Company" and made many to commit suicide and is also responsible for provoking the youths to join the LTTE through his media campaign. Those innocent youths ultimately lost their lives. The other criminal referred to by the Hon. Sumanthiran, I presume, is the present day

guardian of human rights and formerly the Mandaiankulu leader, which means Skull group leader.

There is another TNA Member who is responsible for using the innocent civilians as a human shield to protect Prabhakaran in the final stages of the conflict in early 2009. He forced people to move up to Mullivaikkal and sacrifice themselves to protect his leader, but sent his family out of the Vanni well in time in a Sri Lanka Red Cross vehicle. He too subsequently escaped the scene in a Sri Lanka Red Cross vehicle secretly with large sums of stolen money, which are now being used to carry out media propaganda to mislead the Tamils once again to move towards the path of destruction. They are used to "fishing in troubled waters" to serve their own interests. I wish to request the Hon. Sumanthiran to look back at the track record of his party's Members of Parliament before slinging mud at others. I can cite more examples with regard to other TNA Members as well, if not for the time constraint.

It is only because of my good track record, that people have elected me with the highest preference votes, much higher than what the TNA leaders got. It is for that reason only they have been continuously electing me to Parliament since 1994.

The Hon. R. Sampanthan, in his speech the day before yesterday in this House, meticulously presented as to how the concept of devolution was embodied in the election manifestos of the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake and in the Mangala Moonesinghe Commission Report, the Draft Proposals of 1995, 1997 and of 2000, in the APRC Experts' Panel Report and the LLRC Report. With regard to the Draft Proposals of 2000, the Hon. Member stated in his speech, I quote:

. there were proposals made by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 1995, in 1997 and in 2000 which went far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment.

But, the Hon. Member failed to inform the House one important fact with regard to these developments. If, as stated by the Hon. Member, the 2000 Proposal had gone far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment, why was it when finally that proposal was put before the House, the TULF Members were instrumental in burning that draft in this House? If that was much better than the Thirteenth Amendment, why did we miss it? Who is responsible for ringing the death knell of that proposal? Who is responsible for such irreparable damage caused to the Tamil people? What is the point in blaming the Governments when we do not have the will and courage to make use of the opportunities, time and again? In a Memorial Day meeting in London, the LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham once said that there is good substance

in the Thirteenth Amendment. Today, the Hon. Sampanthan states that they had always felt that the Thirteenth Amendment must be built upon to bring about meaningful devolution. If that is so, the TULF should have supported the 2000 Proposal to get it passed in the House and any shortcomings could have been rectified subsequently. The Hon. Sampanthan praised the APRC and the LLRC Reports. But, when they were requested to take part in those committees, they refused saying that they do not believe those would produce any tangible results. If they really wanted to resolve the issues, they should have participated in those proceedings. They do not want to resolve the issues; instead, they want to thrive on those issues. I take this opportunity to reques the TNA -

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa - Minister of Economic Development) Sir, I will give five minutes to the Hon. Douglas Devananda from my time.

1549 1550

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay, you can take five minutes off the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa's time. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) No, I will take only three minutes.

Sir, I take this opportunity to request the TNA, particularly its leader, the Hon. Sampanthan, who is a veteran politician and a longstanding Parliamentarian, if you are really interested in resolving the longstanding political issues of the Tamils, please come forward and make use of the opportunity afforded by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa by taking part in the PSC. Not like the earlier instances, this time His Excellency the President has given clear guidelines and set a time frame for the PSC.

Sir, the development initiative of our Government is not confined to resettlement and infrastructure development only. The "Vaalvin Eluchchi" - "Divi Neguma" - programme is another brainchild of His Excellency the President for reviving the home-based economy executed under the guidance of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. The people of the North benefit the most under this programme. In Jaffna alone around 55,000 families directly benefit from this programme. In each of the the rest of the districts in the North, about one-third of the population benefits from it.

When the Government tried to introduce a bill to establish a department consolidating the activities carried out under the "Vaalvin Eluchchi" - "Divi Neguma", and "Samurdhi" programmes, the TNA challenged the constitutionality of the bill in the Supreme Court on the basis that certain clauses infringe the Thirteenth Amendment.

The party I represent has been campaigning for decades that the best way to resolve the Tamil issue is to start with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment in full and then improve upon it. I will always stand by this commitment. His Excellency the President, in his Budget Speech, also has clearly stated that the position of the Government is to make devolution more meaningful to the people.

In the meantime, with regard to the "Vaalvin Eluchchi" - "Divineguma" Bill, what I could say to the TNA is that we cannot be "penny wise and pound foolish". We have missed many opportunities in the past

to improve upon the Thirteenth Amendment and strengthen the devolution as I have enumerated earlier but now we are trying to block a major national programme that would benefit the poorest of the poor, in the name of safeguarding certain insignificant provisions in the Thirteenth Amendment. The best way to describe it in Tamil is " " which means, "Trying to pluck hair from an egg".

I wish to emphasize in this august Assembly, once again, that under the leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, we would definitely be able to resolve the political issue of the Tamils in a meaningful manner. Those days are not far away. Thank you.

[2.53 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Budget Debate for 2013.

One of the important factors that we notice is that a major portion of the Budget goes to the Ministry of Defence. The amount allocated is Rs. 290 billion. The war was over three years ago and we find that every year the amount voted for Defence is on the increase. The Budget shows the amount of expenditure and revenue we get for the particular year. Foreign debts have gone up to the maximum and we cannot go on begging for loans any longer. Sri Lankas debt has exceeded by one trillion rupees in the first six months of this year. Further, the Government intends to borrow another Rs. 129 billion in the coming year, which will increase further at the end of the year. It seems that the Government will have to have a fresh agreement with the IMF soon and it will push the country into debt and also raise taxes. As far as the revenue is concerned, I understand that 95 per cent of the revenue we get is spent to pay loans and interests.

The real problem we are facing is the cost of living. Formerly, prices were increased only in the Budget. But, this year, before the Budget itself the prices have been increased on consumer items. The price of flour has gone up and about 300 bakery owners have closed their businesses. Indian labourers who eat rotti are affected very badly. Middle-class people are also affected by the increase in prices.

When a budget is prepared by a department, it must correctly estimate the expenditure for the following year and avoid presenting Supplementary Estimates for the year. This year there were more than three Supplementary Estimates on almost all the heads of expenditure. Under Defence, two times Rs. 500 million was allocated for a building in Hambantota. The Government should have avoided going for Supplementary Estimates. It must curtail the expenditure and avoid going for supplementary allocations.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board lose heavily in billions every year. The

Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Cabraal has granted Rs. 500 million to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to pay legal fees in the UK. I do not know why this hedging deal was drawn and the people who were responsible for this hedging deal must pay for these losses. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation incurs heavy losses every year. This must be due to corruption, overstaffing and inefficiency. If you want a proper economic development, you must try to avoid losses in public enterprises. Then only you can find money for economic development. What we should do is to make a favourable political atmosphere in Sri Lanka to enable foreigners to invest money in Sri Lanka and develop the economy. As far as the ethnic question is concerned, until it is resolved, there cannot be economic development in the country.

Different Ministers say different things about the ethnic problem. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa wants the TNA to go to the Parliamentary Select Committee, where we will be given only a Panchayat Raj. Another Member of Parliament wants the Government to do away with the Thirteenth Amendment. Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa also wants the Thirteenth Amendment to be repealed. I want to ask the Government as to who is responsible in the Government to solve the ethnic question and who is running the Government. Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is the Defence Secretary and a top public servant and he cannot involve himself in politics just because he is a brother of the President.

There does not seem to be collective responsibility in the Cabinet. I want the Government to take appropriate steps and talk with the Members of the TNA and come to an agreement to solve the ethnic question. This is what the foreign countries also want the Government to do.

Economy in this country took a downward trend with the nationalization of the estates by the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike. This was a colossal mistake. When someone asked the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike whether he would nationalize the estates, he said that he was not prepared to kill the goose that lays golden eggs.

The Committee n Public enterprises - COPE - has investigated several Government-owned Public enterprises and have found that those public enterprises lose in billions. It was found that every enterprise that the COPE examined was running at a loss.

The purchase of The Finance Company shares by the National Savings Bank at an inflated price of Rs. 390 million was done on the recommendation of an illegally appointed sub-committee.

The Central Bank, which is responsible for management of the economy, invested money on the controversial Greece Bonds which resulted in a loss of

1567 1568

[ ]

2012 17

Rs. 2.14 billion of the public funds. The EPF was also used to buy shares from the companies which were running at a loss.

With regard to education, Sir, I would like to say that money allocated for the Ministry of Education is not sufficient. The UNDP Regional Director, Mr. Ajay Chhibber, states that university education in Sri Lanka does not cater to the needs of the modern economy. He further states that Sri Lanka urgently need to develop a higher education system that produces graduates capable of taking on complex tasks, with the ability to learn and to adapt quickly, undertake independent research and generate a steady stream of world class technical innovations. He also added that in 2009, more than 100,000 students, around 83 per cent of those who qualified for university education, were forced to abandon their ambition to study because the State-funded universities could not accommodate them. The entire education system should be reformed. In schools, teachers are only asked to write reports about the students.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) , ! English England ! , ! ; !

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is his choice. He can speak in any language that he prefers. Please do not disturb him. Please respect his age and give him due place.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) In the present system, all students go for tuition but this must be stopped and education in universities must be vocationally bent. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Please do not disturb the Hon. Member.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, the Government says that 95 per cent of the displaced people have been resettled. This is not correct. In Valigamam North, about 30,000 people in 24 villages have not been resettled. In Keppapulavu, about 250 families have not been resettled. They were taken out of Menik Farm and dumped in a jungle. - [Interruption.]

With regard to the release of prisoners, Sir, people who were holding very high positions in the LTTE have been given amnesty and are now holding very high positions in the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Exactly. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) About 1,000 Tamil prisoners who merely got orders from the LTTE are now languishing in jail. I kindly request the Government to give amnesty and release them.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member you have one more minute. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, I will finish in one minute. I want the Government to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment and bring back the Seventeenth Amendment so that that there can be an independent Judicial Service Commission, independent Police Commission, independent Human Rights Commission and an independent Election Commission.

I will be failing in my duty if I do not appreciate the work done by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, for providing drinking water facilities to the rural areas in the Jaffna District. -[Interruption.]

As an Attorney-at-Law who has been practising for the last 25 years and as a Parliamentarian, I criticize this Government for taking steps to impeach the Chief Justice, the honourable lady. I request this Government to reconsider this decision. The Members who signed the Impeachment Motion cannot sit in judgement.

The loss of the GSP Plus concession from the European Union may have cost the countrys garment industry US Dollars 1 billion.

1569 1570

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to conclude now. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sri Lanka lost its GSP Plus entry to the European market in August 2010 and it resulted in the closure of a number of garment factories. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Speaker, according to the Hansard of 6th November, 2012, the Supreme Court Determination on the Appropriation Bill that you have read out in Parliament states, I quote:

This Court therefore determines that clause 7 (b) of said Bill in effect, contravenes the full control of public finance which belongs rightfully to Parliament.

[Interruption.] - Could I please explain?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) According to the Supreme Court Determination, in terms of Article 148 of the Constitution, only Parliament and no single Member of the Executive could make a Determination.

Mr. Speaker, what I want to know is, on what basis will the Vote be taken this evening or what the Amendments are going to be on the Appropriation Bill prior to taking the Vote, so that we can vote in a manner which is consistent with the Constitution? That is the clarification I need.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, page 4 of the Supreme Court Determination states, I quote:

We find therefore that clause 2 (1)(b) constitutes an abdication of the power of control by Parliament over fiscal matters, especially the control over the source of the finances which creates a debt of the Republic, as envisaged under the terms of Article 148 of the Constitution .

They have suggested an amendment because if you do not amend it this way, you cannot even pass it with a two-thirds majority since Parliament cannot abdicate its powers. A similar statement has been made under Clause 7 (b). If it is a question of whether it is a simple majority or a two-thirds majority, it is another matter. But, we cannot proceed unless the Government says whether they are going to agree to these amendments or not. That is all we are asking. Otherwise, you cannot pass it.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . amendments . -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) That will be considered at the Committee Stage.
