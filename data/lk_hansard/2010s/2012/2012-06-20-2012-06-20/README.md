"Report of the Committee appointed to look into the matters related to the proposed Private Medical School (SAITM) at Malabe - 28th February, 2012." Dr. Ravindra Ruberu, Secretary, Ministry of Health was the Chairman of that Committee. That is the first Report that I would like to table*.

Then, I would like to table* Institutional Review Report of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Management - 22nd and 23rd February 2011 and Programme Review Report of the Faculty of Medicine, South Asian Institute of Technology and Management -24th and 25th February 2011.

There are many professors including Prof. Tilak Weerasooriya and the Emeritus Prof. Dayantha Wijesekera. Then, also, we have the GMOA Report and I think it will be fair to table* that Report also because they also have their views and I think we have to participate in this Debate by taking all these views into account.

[4.30 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion. Right at the outset, I wish to formally place on record a disclosure with regard to this institution that is being discussed today. I have, as a legal professional, tendered legal advice and I think it is only proper that I make that disclosure before I speak though I am not speaking in that capacity now. This is an important issue that is being discussed in this august Assembly because as to how we handle this issue may be symptomatic of how things are happening in this country and as the matter has now come to Parliament, the way we deal with it from now on will also determine how other important issues such as these are handled.

I agree with the Hon. Members who have said that this is not a Debate about private education or about free education. The Debate is about this particular institution. It is true that there must be some discussion at length about privatization - if you want to call it that - or about changes to free education as we have known it. I agree with the Hon. Member who spoke just before me that the models we have of private enterprises or private individuals in education has been not one of profit-making but non-profit motives. The Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources rightly pointed out that the first Medical School was established in Jaffna by Medical Missionary, Dr. S.F. Green. That institution is no longer a Medical School but the "Green Memorial Hospital" named after Missionary Green and it is still functioning in Manipay in Jaffna. Now, that was not a profit-making institution. Prior to Missionary Green, there was another Missionary also in Jaffna called Dr. John Scudder, the father of Ida S. Scudder, who started a Christian Medical College in Vellore and that was the first hospital in the village of Pandatharippu and we still have that house named after him. It is called the "Scudder House". We have had the rich tradition of people who had given from their own resources for medical services and for educational services. And, if we are ever to discuss private enterprise in education, that is a model that we need to discuss at length.

Now, I come back to the matter under discussion. All concede that this institution commenced and has carried on thus far without any of the formal approvals that are necessary.

That is a startling and shocking state of affairs. So many students have registered and a lot of money has

915 916

[ () ]

2012 20

been paid supposedly for their medical education and this has gone on, the owners of this institution actually holding out to prospective students that there is formal approval. An Hon. Member showed some newspaper publications where they have said that this is approved when, in fact, all of us know that there is no approval from the Ministry of Health. Even the BOI approval made it a requirement that the approval of the Ministry of Health must be obtained. That has not come.

With regard to the Sri Lanka Medical Council, I was also disturbed that the Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources spoke in that manner with reference to the Sri Lanka Medical Council. The Sri Lanka Medical Council is the authenticating body; it is the body that sets standards for medical education in this country; that licenses medical professionals in this country and I do not think it is fit for anyone in this House to speak in that manner with reference to the Sri Lanka Medical Council. That has been established by law of this Parliament. We have given them the law to follow and it is that law - the Sri Lanka Medical Ordinance - which prohibits SAITM from being supervised and standards set by the Sri Lanka Medical Council.

The law with regard to that matter is very clear. There is no provision in the Medical Ordinance for the Sri Lanka Medical Council to actually supervise and set standards to this institution for the simple reason that it was not envisaged that a twining programme, where part of the education is within the shores of Sri Lanka and the other part is outside Sri Lanka, was ever contemplated in the Sri Lanka Medical Ordinance. Therefore, there is no provision for that and this has been pointed out time and again by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. If that has to be rectified, if that needs to be changed, we must amend the law. I am not for a moment saying that what was not contemplated a hundred years ago must still hold true. Those changes that are necessitated by changes in the world we must incorporate. That is why Parliament is here for. If a necessity arises for amendment to the Medical Ordinance, we must effect that. But, what has happened is, there is a tendency now to forget about the law, to put that aside. Oh! yes, that is there - but that is all right - we will circumvent the law and carry on nevertheless. The Sri Lanka Medical Council has pointed out the provisions that prevent them, not only by written communication with the parties to the Ministry, but even by way of public advertisements, time and again, to prospective students as well saying we are prohibited by law to enter into this fray. Something must be done about that.

That is why the Minister of Health appointed a Committee of medical professionals. The Committee was headed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Health. They have gone into the matter and they have come up with a Report dated 28th February, 2012. Now, having appointed a Committee and obtained a Report, why does the

Government not follow the recommendations of that Report? I do not need to table it. I believe the Hon. Member of the UNP has already tabled the Report. The Report clearly identifies and establishes that this institute is carrying on now for three to four years without any authorization whatsoever. But, they have also made recommendations with regard to how you handle students who have already entered this institute. I am not for a moment suggesting that you close it and throw those students on to the streets. That would be very irresponsible. They have made recommendations as to how that can be handled. If your own Ministry appoints a Committee that goes into it, makes a study and makes recommendations, I urge the Government to follow the recommendations of its own Committee appointed by the Minister of Health and not to circumvent the law.

It was a fashion. Now, it is the order of the day to circumvent the law. The rule of law has broken down drastically in this country. One example of that is what happened, two days running in Jaffna - yesterday and the day before - when proper, ordinary, democratic processions and demonstrations had been stultified and prevented by the police. Now, it has also become a fashion, a practice, for the police to run to the Magistrates Court and get an order by whatever means before the event to stop a democratic demonstration. Never heard of this before in this country. Sir, Article 14(1)(a) -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am referring to the conduct of the police in violating the fundamental right of the freedom of expression and therefore, there is no point of Order. That has been overruled. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) His speech has nothing to do with the Medical Council. It is about the riots and the police.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Not only do they do that - [Interruption.] I am talking about the breakdown in the rule of law that you find at the Malabe Private Medical College, and that we see everywhere outside, most recently in Jaffna in the two demonstrations that were held, one at the Jaffna bus stand and the other at Tellippallai yesterday after the -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, shall I quote the Standing Orders? According to the Standing Orders, the Hon. Member is completely out of order. He cannot discuss about the riots and the police in Jaffna in this Motion. He must confine - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am raising a point of order of propriety. The Hon. Member does not have the right to question the Chair in that manner as to whether he should coach the Chair. He also sits in that Chair. I am raising - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) I have overruled it. Hon. Sumanthiran, please continue with your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am of the opinion that he should be reprimanded. He must recognize the Chair. He is not there to coach the Chair. - [Interruption.]

Most importantly, yesterday, after a peaceful demonstration when the people who had not been able to resettle in their own homes for 25 years were going back to their welfare centres in buses, men in motorbikes, armed men in motorbikes - one knows who does that in Jaffna - threw huge boulders at the bus, broke the windscreens, threw black oil into the bus, damaged the property and injured the people. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, the Hon. Member has the right to speak in this House. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is the persons who are attached to the military intelligence and other paramilitary groups operating in

919 920

2012 20

Jaffna who are doing these things. I am bringing this matter to the notice of the Parliament to demonstrate that the Malabe Private Medical College is also one such example where you have a problem. I recognize that there is a problem with regard to the Malabe Private Medical College. There is a problem where students have been admitted without formal approvals. But, the way to get over it is not to circumvent - [Interruption.] He need not go to Malabe; he has got to go a little beyond that - to Angoda. The way to get over that problem is not to circumvent the law but act purely within the law and find solutions. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is referring to my conduct. This Hon. Member has come out of Angoda. Nobody in this House - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Committee appointed by the Ministry of Health has already made recommendations. So, I would urge the Minister of Higher Education not to circumvent the law but to follow his Colleague, the Hon. Minister of Health, and rectify this situation in terms of the law.

Thank you.
