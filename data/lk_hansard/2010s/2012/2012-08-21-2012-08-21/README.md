Hon. Minister, it says that the cost of production per kilogram is Rs. 24.10.The profit per acre is Rs. 1,039. The average yield per acre is 1,478 kilogram. If you calculate, you get less than one rupee. There maybe some places where you get seven rupees. There are some places where you get ten rupees also. But, what I am saying is, there are areas where you get a net profit of one rupee.

Like you said, you do a sample survey or whatever and find out what is expected in the future. Then, if you are expecting a certain policy to be maintained in the future with the Government saying, yes, this is our policy, but they do not follow it, then what happens? The confidence falls. That is why I want to talk about it in the next five minutes that I have. . . , .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , , .

Mr. Presiding Member, since 1945, when education in our country was made a free service, Sri Lanka was able to proudly boast that it had one of the finest education systems in the world. In fact, they said that we had the finest education system East of the Suez Canal and as a result, we possess one of the highest literary rates in Asia. Many of the brightest and the best who have served in this country in various fields have been the products of this system. This system, as you know, has been the envy of many South Asian countries and even today, many of those who hold top positions in the State sector as well as the private sector are products of it. That is why all governments, since Independence, gave the utmost priority to protecting and nurturing our education system. But, unfortunately since 2005, the priority given to education has rapidly dwindled.

In fact, since 2005, the Governments spending on education, as has been mentioned earlier, has been slashed from 2.9 per cent to a shocking 1.9 per cent of GDP today. Even our neighbours who used to look up to our education system as a role model are investing more and more on education in their countries. Just take a look at the Maldives. You know that many of the Maldivian leaders were educated in this country because they thought we had a better educational system than many other countries in this region. But, today when we are investing 1.9 per cent of GDP; the Maldives is investing 8.7 per cent of GDP and if you take Nepal, it is 4.7 per cent; in India, 3.2 per cent; in Pakistan, 2.9 per cent; in Bangladesh, 2.4 per cent and as a matter of interest, even Sub-Saharan Africa is investing roughly 4.7 per cent of GDP on education.

The cynical attitude of the Rajapaksa regime towards education and the educated is further highlighted by the fact that the Governments spending on universities was also slashed from 0.56 per cent to 0.27 per cent of GDP in 2010 and I believe it is going down further and further every year. Because of the low salaries, some of the best lecturers are compelled to seek greener pastures while the others who continue to serve their motherland are labelled as thugs or as terrorists by this Government.

Sir, in fact, the Rajapaksa regime, instead of coming to grips with this calamitous situation in the education sector today, is busy trying to find scapegoats to justify its own inefficiency while trying to cover up its own secret plan to destroy the free education system, as we know it. Like most authoritarian regimes, the Rajapaksa regime is very weary. That is something which I have noticed of educated persons and the intelligentsia who are seen as an obstacle to their autocratic agenda. In fact, if you look at the type of persons who are running this regime, it is obvious that what is appreciated by the leaders is brawn and not brains.

Even in the Z-score fiasco, various scapegoats have been put forward to justify this shocking tragedy where over 6,500 Advanced Level students have had their hopes shattered due to the sheer incompetence of the Executive.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Some blame the Ministers; some blame the Ministries; some blame the bureaucrats and the examiners, but the real culprit, as far as I am concerned, is sitting elsewhere.

Sir, as you know, the Z-score system was introduced in the year 2000 by the Government in which I was also a Minister and since 2001, this system was used for nearly 10 years without a flaw, without a hitch until 2011. At that time, we felt that using the aggregate of raw marks for university admission was an unreliable and obsolete method. It had been discarded by most countries and was

proving to be a great injustice to many students. In fact, that is why the former President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appointed the Presidential Task Force on General and University Education of 1998, which proposed as its recommendations, to allow students to take three subjects instead of four, introducing General English and a common general paper as mandatory, to bring forward the exam from April to August, that the A/Ls could not be the sole criteria for university admissions and to broaden the criteria as done in the United Kingdom.

The UGC, the Department of Examinations and experts from several universities participated in developing such a system and in the year 2000, an accepted system of standardization was recommended, namely the Z-score system, which was approved by the then President and the Cabinet and subsequently, it was also approved by the Government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe in 2001. In fact, in 2001, the first batch of A/L students experienced university admission selection under the Z-score criteria. The Department of Examinations became fully geared and thoroughly prepared itself to face this new challenge. The computer systems were upgraded and new technical expertise was introduced well ahead of the exams. The UGC and the Ministry worked in close partnership to ensure that the students would not be penalized during this critical transition.

The exams faced by the students who did four subjects and those who did three subjects were taken as two separate exams - I think this is where our people went wrong recently - and two sets of Z-scores were calculated. Thereafter, all the Z-scores from both sets were ranked together into one group and admissions were processed very smoothly and efficiently during that transition year. After that, the same system was repeated, as I said earlier, without any problem whatsoever until a similar situation arose in 2011 when students from two types of syllabuses sat for the exam. This time, the authorities were ill-prepared and did not foresee the eventualities that were to follow. Unlike in 2001, at the last years exams, the marks of all the students from both groups were pooled and common Z-scores were formulated. Many students from the previous syllabus got higher scores whereas many from the new syllabus got left out. Certain students who had scored very high results were deprived of university admission as a result and when the Department of Examinations realized this situation, it was too late and attempts to remedy this situation needed time.

This is where the mistake happened. I am not trying to protect my old Friends. It is not the fault of any of these Ministers. The mistake happened when the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

1151 1152

of this country, when the President

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

of this country, perhaps in order to please the parents who said the A/Level results were getting late, used his executive powers despite protests -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you cannot make that remark.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Why can I not do so?

( ) (The Presiding Member) You are referring directly to the Executive [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

which is against the Standing Orders. Therefore it will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am not talking about the Presidency. I am talking about a historical fact.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is not the Presidency. The Chair can understand it very well. Please refrain from -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) If you look at the newspapers of 26th of December 2011 -

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is a different thing.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) - all the newspapers carried the headline that the President

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

This is not the time for acrimony. We have to look for solutions. Six thousand five hundred students are out there on the streets going from one court to the other, going after lawyers. Their parents have invested all their savings because they hoped that these children would be able to go into the university. So, what I am trying to say is, we must look for remedies and not for scapegoats. Many of the experts who handled the Z-score are still there today. In fact, there is Mr. A.M.R.B. Amarakoon. I was also the Deputy Minister of Education from 2004 to 2006. So, I know some of these people like A.M.R.B. Amarakoon, Shirley Perera et cetera. They are former examiners; people of the highest calibre.

I would recommend to the Hon. Minister to get their services. They are willing to help. They are willing to actually give their input, free of charge, because they are very unhappy with the situation. You must call them and many of them feel that this can be sorted out in three weeks; I do not know but they have told me that this can be sorted out in three weeks. So, I would ask the Government to swallow the pride for the sake of these students and get them to revisit the 2011 exam marking system and access all the raw marks plus the Z-score for an extensive study and analysis. Within three weeks, they could be asked to do fresh calculations on the two sets of Z-scores and fresh rankings could be done. This is a doable task provided, as I said, there is no political interference. Let them get on with it. You can find a solution, I assure you, within three weeks.

Not only the students, the academics are also out on the street. FUTA with its membership of over 4,000 has two sets of demands, very reasonable demands. The first is the outstanding salary-related demands and the other relates to the state of education in this country, today. Both are very reasonable demands. They demand on the complete implementation of Prof. M.T.M. Jiffry and Prof. Malik Ranasinghe Proposals of 2008 and an increase of the Government's spending on education to 6 per cent. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one minute.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No. You took most of my time. Frankly, Mr. Presiding Member, you took my time.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You must understand the Standing Orders. You are a senior Member of Parliament.You must understand that. I am going only by the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No, it is not for you to - ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) . . [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) You are only asking me to expunge whatever you say.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) But, I need more time because you actually took a lot of my time. ( ) (The Presiding Member) I cannot give you more time. Both sides have agreed on the time.

1157 1158

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) As I said, these are very reasonable demands. Since I do not have time, I would like to take this opportunity to table* a presentation made by the University of Moratuwa Teachers Association. It is an excellent, little presentation, very simple, very credible and I would ask all Hon. Members from both sides to spend two minutes - it will not take more than two minutes - and go through this document.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would also like to say just one last word about some of these university lecturers. Do not treat them like terrorists; do not label them as thugs; do not label them as foreign conspirators because some of the brightest, the best lecturers are the leaders of this campaign. They are clever, young and committed.

In fact, I would like to conclude by reading a little bit from an article written by Dr. Dileni Gunewardena, a Senior Lecturer of the University of Peradeniya, under the caption, Who will suffer if FUTA loses? It states, I quote:

The most striking feature of todays university trade union leadership is that it comprises academics with outstanding scholarly credentials. A search in scholarly research databases for their names reveals them to be authors of international repute, award-winners for Ph.D. and postdoctoral research, with impeccable track records of international research publications. They represent the best in Sri Lankas university system today. Among the few I know (of) are an internationally published historian, a distinguished young evolutionary biologist, an outstanding macroeconomist with a Ph.D. from East Asias best university, a brilliant mechanical engineer,..

Mr. Presiding Member, I will bow down to your request. But, I will again request you not to expunge anything from my speech.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Chair has made the Order and the Order shall -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I will challenge the expunction.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You can challenge wherever you like. But, the Chair has made an Order according to the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) This is democracy. This is not Swaziland; this is not Zimbabwe.
