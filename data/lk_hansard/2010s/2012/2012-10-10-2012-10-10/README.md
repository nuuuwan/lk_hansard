(b) Registration and supervision of Pre-Schools is a subject delegated to Provincial Councils under the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Actions are being implemented presently by each of the Provincial Authorities to register the Pre-Schools which hitherto remained not registered. Accordingly, actions have been taken for provision of physical facilities to the Pre-Schools that have not reached the minimum standards introduced by the Child Secretariat.

Further, the National Committee on Early Childhood Protection and Devlopment has held discussions on conducting a General Test or a Training Course and ensuing registrations based on such tests or training courses. Joint actions will be taken together with Provincial Councils to standardize these teachers and Pre-Schools.

(c) Regarding this payment, a decision has not been taken up to now.

(2) A supplementary question must not introduce matter not included in the original question."

So, if they want a discussion on the Public Petitions Committee or COPE, they could have it. But, this has nothing to do with that. They are violating the Standing Orders.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, I must thank the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, who had been the Chairman of the Select Committee and had spent hours and hours deliberating on

a new system of elections in this country. I must say that no electoral system can ever be perfect. I must also thank His Excellency the President, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Leader of the Opposition, for having agreed that the Members to be elected by Proportional Representation is to be increased to 40 per cent, which would immensely help scattered minorities living all over the Island and also may help minor parties to return their members to the local authorities. I believe that that assurance given by the Minister is a significant one and that would be undertaken at the time we introduce amendments after the delimitation is done. Even the delimitation process, I would prefer it being done in an open and transparent manner, where public and political parties can make representations regarding the creation of wards and multi-member constituencies.

With those comments, I thank the Hon. Leader of the House and other Party Leaders for having assisted in the process of enacting this historic piece of legislation. Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . . rose. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, I am thankful to you for giving me a few minutes to speak. This is a landmark Bill that has been passed in modern Sri Lanka. We must place on record our deep appreciation of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa who told us to pass this Bill, to hurry up with the Amendments and pass those Amendments in the House.

We have the oldest democracy in the world. We have the oldest local body in the world - the Colombo Municipal Council - which has even gone beyond 150 years of existence. I am very happy, Sir, today, that even the present Mayor, Mr. A.J.M. Muzammil is helping Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development in order to beautify the Colombo City and make it the most beautiful city in the whole of Asia. We have been to several other countries and the Colombo City will match any city in the world. See the Diyawanna Oya, I think we have to create another Sandeshaya.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will finish Sir. We must also place on record the name of our Minister, the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah. His name would go down in history as the father of the modern Local Authorities Bill and also the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena for spearheading the campaign for such a long time. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me one moment, please. I am a little more than surprised that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition thought to address the Visakhian girls today. I thought he normally addresses the blue-eyed Royalist boys. Anyway, that is a change in heart and attitude, I should say.

So, Sir, that is the subject matter of the Motion. Then, it continues to state, I quote:

"....by commission or omission constitute executive and administrative actions within the meaning of Article 17 and Article 126 read with 27 and 28(d) of the Constitution, which said acts have infringed and are like to infringe the fundamental rights of the Petitioner and the citizens of the country, guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, let the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris speak. I will speak thereafter. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, there is no requirement that leave to proceed should be granted. The matter is before the court. The court is going to convene shortly for the purpose of deciding whether to grant leave to proceed, but the material is in the hands of the court. The court has fixed a date to consider this matter. So, the court is going to apply its mind to the averments that are contained in the application that has been submitted to the court by the Hon. Member of Parliament. Sir, I think it is very necessary to bear in mind the rationale underpinning the sub judice rule. Why is there such a rule? The rule is there to prevent a situation in which Parliament expresses views which overlap with a matter that is before the courts. That is the pith and substance of this sub judice rule. - [Interruption.] Give me one moment. Sir, in my respectful submission, it is certainly not the case that the sub judice rule applies only after leave to proceed has been granted by the court. The court has fixed a date to consider the matter.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) The court has heard the counsel on the first day. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, the court has heard the counsel. The court is adjudicating upon the matter and that process has started. So, it is therefore quite wrong, in terms of principle, to suggest that Parliament has a right to debate the very matters which form the subject matter of the action before the court. I think that would be a flagrant violation of all the fundamental principles that are contained in the sub judice rule.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , . . , 2012 17 . . . . . I quote Column 55 of Hansard dated 17th July, 2012:

(b) The decision was influenced by the fact that at that time, there was a robust framework in place for crisis management in Europe supported by a Financial Stability Package".

. . - European Council - 24 .

Like the IMF, the ESM will provide financial assistance to a Member State when its regular access to market financing is impaired. Reflecting this, Heads of State or Government have stated that the ESM will enjoy preferred creditor status in a similar fashion to the IMF, while accepting preferred creditor status of IMF over ESM.

- [Interruption.] I am raising a matter of Privilege. They can speak on that later. I am not interested in that. Hon. Speaker, all I want to say is that on the 5th of April, the Greece Bonds had junk status. When it was purchased, it had junk status. Now, how do you buy one when it had junk status? The creditors could not recover money. They had given money to the European Stability Mechanism. The Hon. Minister has misled the House on this issue. . , . . 24 . . ,- [ ]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is bringing into the Debate a matter which is before court and is to be adjudicated. He is canvassing that, Sir, which is a point of Order that the Hon. Leader of the House raised in this Parliament. So, the Hon. Member cannot move that Motion according to the stand we have taken. My good Friend, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe has put the cart

before the horse. If that Motion came before you went to court, okay, that would have been allowed. But, now the position is different. There is a matter before the court to be adjudicate upon and you have asked the Supreme Court to proceed. Her Ladyship the Chief Justice, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake and Their Lordships Justices K. Sripavan and P.A. Ratnayake will be sitting and hearing this case. Also, I would like to draw your attention to - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . [ ] . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, you may recall, in 1990, when Richard De Zoysa was murdered, the Opposition, at that time, brought in an Adjournment Motion to discuss the matter. The Government took up the position that since the matter is before the Magistrate's Court, it cannot be discussed. By that time, only a "B" Report had been filed and the case had not been taken up for inquiry. So, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed who was the Speaker at that time ruled that the mere filing of a case is not enough to stifle debates in Parliament.

Then, Sir, this is a civil matter and not a criminal matter. If there is a civil matter in a district court and if issues have been raised, it cannot be discussed. This matter is before courts but leave to proceed has not yet been given. So, the mere filing of a case does not preclude Parliament from discussing it.
