II INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO VAVUNIYA PRISON INCIDENT

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on a matter of urgent public importance.

Several prisoners were badly assaulted in the Vavuniya Prison on 29th of June, this year. It would appear that some prison guards were held in captivity consequent to a prisoner having been tortured earlier. They were freed consequent to tear gas being used and the assault that the prisoners suffered has taken place subsequently when there was no need or justification for the use of such excessive force.

Several prisoners were grievously injured; some are hospitalized; one is in a state of coma, and one person has succumbed to his injuries and come by his death. The name of that person is Nimalaruban. He died at the Mahara Prison Hospital on the 4th of July. A postmortem has been held but the postmortem findings have not been made public. The body of the prisoner who has been killed is not being delivered to his next of kin to enable his next of kin to perform the necessary funeral rites in accordance with his religious observances. This is a very serious matter.

This whole episode constitutes a very serious infringement of the fundamental and human rights of this particular prisoner and impacts his family. The family is unable to take charge of the body to perform the final

1653 1654

2012 06

rites in regard to the prisoner. That is a right of the family which must be granted. Therefore, I would appeal to the Government to look into the matter immediately and take steps to ensure that the body of the prisoner is delivered to the family to enable the funeral rites to be performed.

I might mention, Sir, that there must be an independent investigation in regard to this whole matter, and the persons responsible for the commission of a grave crime - not merely assaulting people but even murdering a person - must be brought to book. They must be taken before court. I raised this matter in Parliament on the 22nd of May and there was an assurance given by the Government that within a period of one month, the position in regard to all prisoners would be brought to an end; that there would be some finality. But, that has not happened and this particular incident has taken place after the expiration of one month from the date on which I raised this matter in Parliament.

I think the Government should, at least now, not kill anymore people but grant them an amnesty and free them. If you want to prosecute some of them, that can be done. But, an amnesty must be granted towards other people and they must be freed.

I want to again impress upon the Government that immediate steps must be taken to hand over the body of the dead prisoner to his family.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Rajan Asirwathan passed away on the 24th of November, 2011. He was a Member of Parliament, appointed on the National List by the United National Party to the Third Parliament from 25th August, 1994 to 18th August, 2000. In the Third Parliament, he served as a Member of Parliament for six years. The Hon. Rajan, during his period as a Member of Parliament, was an active Member who participated in debates, making useful contributions to the subject matter debated in the House.

The Hon. Rajan, who was a Member of the Ceylon Workers Congress, started his active social life as a trade unionist as far back as 1958. He worked as the District Chairman of the CWC and was entrusted with the task of handling trade union activities. In 1986, he was elected Vice-President and served in a number of Wages Boards.

He had his early education at the English Free School in Maharagama where he studied up to the Senior School Certificate Level.

He was elected a Member of the Ratnapura Development Council in 1981 and thereafter entered the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council as a Member in 1988 and 1993.

Sir, on behalf of the United National Party, we express our sadness and I would appreciate if you would convey our condolences to the members of the family of the late Hon. Rajan Asirwathan.

Thank you.

Hon. Speaker, kindly allow me to raise a matter of profound significance to the community that the Hon. A.M.D. Rajan served so tirelessly throughout his life by first being a trade union leader and later as an Hon. Member of this august Assembly from 1994 to 2000. I am sure if our Colleague, the Hon. A.M.D. Rajan was alive, he would have highlighted this issue before anyone else, since he clearly understood the pulse and fate of our own people. Before going any further, let me quote from the newly-released Executive Summary of the general Census carried out early this year. It states, I quote:

One of the most important highlights observed in the population growth rate during the intercensal period of 2001 and 2012 in the 18 districts covered at the 2001 Census is the significantly low growth rates reported from Nuwara-Eliya and Badulla districts. These two districts which represent the upcountry estate sector reported growth rates of 0.05 per cent and 0.39 per cent respectively. Out migration from these districts to other areas due to lack of employment generation in estates, return to their original homes of those who have moved due to conflict situation in Northern parts may be some possible reasons for the decline of growth rates observed in Nuwara-Eliya and Badulla districts.

In fact, I am certain that this trade union leader par excellence, the Hon. A.M.D. Rajan, who followed the footsteps of our beloved late leader, the Hon. Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, may have noticed this trend and addressed the underpinning problems very much relevant to the people he represented, by being a National List MP from the CWC.

1661 1662

Thus, let me conclude by conveying the profound appreciation of our people for the great service rendered by him. Hon. Speaker, let the bereaved family of the Hon. A.M.D. Rajan receive a copy of todays Proceedings.

Thank you.

The Hon. Rajan was also a well-known sportsman in the area. He encouraged sports in schools and through clubs. At times, he wanted me also to help him. Since I was so close to him, I was able to help him through my Decentralized Budget at that time. He was a great sportsman. He played cricket with a straight bat in the manner it should be played. He did not play any sweep or reverse shots; he always played straight drives and got runs for his people that brought large benefits to them.

When I speak about sports, Sir, I also remember the amount of interest he took about the billiards game. The other day, Sir, I had occasion in Parliament to mention that Mr. M.J.M. Lafir was the first Sri Lankan champion in the game of billiards. But, I inadvertently referred to the late Mr. Lafir on that occasion as a member of the Moors' Sports Club. The MICH drew my attention to this error. I know very well that he was very much a member of the Moors' Islamic Cultural Home. Mr. M.A. Nawaz and Mr. M.H.M. Nazeer were also taking a lot of interest to promote him on that occasion.

It was one of our former Speakers, distinguished and colourful sportsman himself, the late Hon. K.B. Ratnayake, who received Mr. Lafir and had a civic reception in the City of Colombo at the MICH hall in Fort. The Hon. Rajan was very much pleased about this great fete of a Sri Lankan. He came to see the function along with me. I must also mention that Mr. Cader M. Ali, a former MMC, was promoting him to win the world championship.

Therefore, Sir, all in all, here is a person who excelled in sports as well. Whenever I meet him I would say

". I call him " although he is younger to me. That is the way that we respectfully address another person in Tamil. I used to tell him, Why do you not come to Parliament again?. He said, If God wills, one day I will come again. But, unfortunately he could not do so because God willed otherwise.

Sir, he was a distinguished Member of this House who had a total service for 6 years and 26 days.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, we conduct the Business of this House according to the Standing Orders and according to certain traditions that have been built over the years. We are following the Westminster System of Parliamentary Governance. You will also, very soon, be presiding over the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in this country.

Erskine May is the authority. I went through his book. I know the pages. In many pages, he has very rightly pointed out to all Parliamentarians and to those who value Parliamentary democracy, that a subject that has been spoken about and questions raised on it cannot be raised again because it falls into the category of redundancy in Parliamentary procedures. The Hon. John Amaratunga should be aware of it.

Sir, Standing Order No. 31(6) states, I quote:

A question must not refer to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law or to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending.

Then, Standing Order No. 31(7) is very pertinent. It states, I quote:

A question may not ask for an expression of opinion, or for the solution of an abstract legal question or of a hypothetical proposition.

Further, Standing Order No. 31 (11) states, I quote:

A question fully answered must not be asked again during the same session.

So it is very clear. .

These healthy traditions have to be maintained. If you go through the magazine that comes from the CPA, I think you will be very much enlightened. Therefore, we must not allow a new Debate, a new argument as pointed out quite rightly by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and by the Hon. S. B. Dissanayake. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . 83 .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, Standing Order No. 83 states, I quote:

When a question for debate has been proposed, debated,......." - . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) It was not debated.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That is how you interpret what a debate is. Give me the chance to submit my clarification to the Hon. Speaker. You submit your own argument to the Hon. Speaker. Sir, I quote further:

and disposed of, it shall not be competent to any member, without the leave of Mr. Speaker, again to propose such question in the same session, nor shall it be competent, without such leave, to revive in any debate matter upon which Parliament has come to a conclusion during the same session.

Then, I would also like to refer to Standing Order No. 31 (11) which states, I quote:

A question fully answered must not be asked again during the same session.

So, Sir, we fall into this plus the conventions of the House, not just ad hoc. The Minister, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake clearly stated that the matters raised by the Hon.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, as you asked me a clarification on Standing Order No. 83, I will clarify it. Standing Order No. 83 states, I quote: When a question for debate has been proposed, debated, and disposed of, it shall not be competent to any member, without the leave of Mr. Speaker,..

You must give leave for them to raise it. Then, it goes on to state:

again to propose such question in the same session, nor shall it be competent, without such leave, to revive in any debate matter upon which Parliament has come to a conclusion during the same session.

Why these clauses have been included in the Standing Orders of this House, the British House of Commons and the Commonwealth Parliaments all over . , . , - [ ] , . .

. Z-score . 2012 01 "The Sunday Times" :

In 2001 Peradeniya University senior Professor of Statistics R.O. Thattil and a panel of experts introduced the Z-score formula for university admission. When the new calculation was introduced, I pointed out that there will be issues in merging results of two syllabuses and the Z-score marks will be erroneous. It is incorrect to put two populations together; its like adding biology and history. Every single paper had two syllabuses, both had a different number of questions and the marks allocated have a difference too, Prof. Thattil told the Sunday Times.
