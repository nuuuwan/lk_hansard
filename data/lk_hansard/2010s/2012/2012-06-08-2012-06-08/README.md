This is a specific tax to prevent people from acquiring household lots particularly by the sea. At no time was there an intention to impose this tax on people who help the economic growth in this country. This was agreed to by you. You all voted for it when this was brought to

2012 08

Parliament and we have subsequently brought the strategic investment law, which gives not only that but even more tax holidays for people who come and invest in this country. It was brought before the House; we have discussed it and you have voted for it. Having done that, now you ask all sorts of questions.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, people do not agree with it. These are all your tags told only for the media. You want to get them published. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, let me pose the third Supplementary Question. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, please restrain yourself. Listen to the third Question that I am going to ask and then provide your Answer. You are mature enough to realize that. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is third Supplementary Question? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My third Question is, at a time when the economy is stuck in this country, why do you not offer the same type of tax benefits that you are giving these foreigners to all the domestic companies like John Keells and Aitken

Spence? Waive off the Ports and Airports Levy and the corporate taxes. Why do you give it to people who are coming to Hambantota only for certain projects? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Have you raised your third Supplementary Question? Hon. Member, this is not the time for a debate or a discussion. You frame your Supplementary Question. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is very clear that my good Friend is on the wrong track because all these Sri Lankan companies, whether it is John Keells, any other company or your own company, are not subject to this tax. It is crystal clear if you just read a common-sense approach to this. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you do not give other tax benefits to Sri Lankan companies. There is the Ports and Airports Levy and other corporate taxes. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, you are on a fishing expedition. You asked the Question and I have given you the Answer. If you want to ask about any other subject, please bring it up as a different question. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The question was raised and answered.

2012 08 529 530

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, the first Supplementary Question, please.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It will be asked by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Regarding the National Savings Bank Fund Management Company Limited, you would know that the fiasco over the share issue in The Finance Company Limited has led to erosion of the confidence in the Stock Exchange. As a result, the Government so decided and withdrew the sale. The shares that were sold were taken back. But, do you know that Mr. Anura Fernando, who is a Director in The Finance Company Limited, has sold 50,000 shares at Rs. 50 per share just one week before and that has not been taken back? This is part of the National Savings Bank Fund Management Company Limited and this has been at the expense of the general public, whose monies were invested there. Would you ensure that this is also corrected? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The first thing I want to say is, as soon as this matter was brought to the notice of His Excellency the President, prompt action was taken. There was the resignation of the Chairman and the Board of Management. The SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been asked to investigate, is now continuing to investigate this matter. They have taken certain actions; they have suspended one of the traders and as you rightly mentioned, the monies of the NSB have not been utilized under this transaction; some others may have, but that is a different matter.

So, as far as your statement is concerned - we will look into that at the conclusion of the SEC inquiry and, I can assure you, that the Government would take the strongest possible measures on this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My second Supplementary Question is this. Was the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka basically induced to buy

shares of Ceylinco Investment Company Limited which was the holding company? You know that the Chairman of EDB, Mr. Janaka Rathnayake has bought 35 per cent of shares of Ceylinco Investment Company Limited. In that process, he wanted the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka to buy shares and 50 per cent of shares was bought by him and 50 per cent was bought by the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka. As a result, this individual is now controlling almost 22 per cent of the Ceylinco Group of Companies, which was held by the Ceylinco Investment Company Limited. I ask you, - the Government, that has been rather slow in acting but now basically moving forward - how are you going to ameliorate this situation where a person is holding the Chairmanship of EDB on this issue. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) As far as we are concerned, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been given wide powers. We have now, a Chairman in whom I believe all of us have great confidence since he has been - ( ) (An Hon. Member) And, the former Chairman - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, the former Chairman also.

But, this is now under the ambit of the present Chairman. I think we all agree that he is an impartial person and he will look into this matter. So, once it is investigated, we will take necessary steps.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You did not answer the Supplementary Question. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is the answer. That is the answer I can give you at this time. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That answer is granted. Next is, the third Supplementary Question. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) When matters are under investigation, we have to await the findings of that.

531 532

2012 08

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, the third Supplementary Question is that the Government, in 2011, under the expropriation Act took back certain assets that were basically privatized. In the process, there was another Fund Management Company where the insurance fund was there, as you mentioned, and this company has a subsidiary which was proposed to be a subsidiary called Sino Lanka Hotels Holdings (Pvt.) Limited. Imagine a Rs. 9.2 billion company - the Ceylinco Celestial Residencies - has been given to a Rs. 40 capital-nominated registered company to go forward. Would you please ensure that this is corrected, where such a company that does not have a capital base, is permitted to buy a Rs. 9 billion company at Rs. 3.5 billion? Can you correct this situation as well? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am very glad that you have given this information. We will take that also into consideration and if there are any mistakes made, we will certainly rectify it. We must go by the law. The law is there. So, that has to be invoked by any concerned party. You never invoked the law earlier also. I do not want to go into that because that will lead to another debate. But, our position is, if there are misdemeanours and if there are mistakes like this, there is sufficient provision in the law, which can be evoked. So, please look into that as well and in addition to that, you can present in the House whatever material that you have in a very responsible way. I must be thankful to you as you presented that in the House; it will be published in the Hansard and we will certainly take note of that.

Thank you.

559 560

2012 08

This is a timely Motion that has been brought before Parliament reminding us that all Private Members Motions which are debated and approved, must be taken seriously. Once it is approved by Parliament, it ceases to be labelled as a "Private Members Motion" because it is something that Parliament agrees with. Therefore, from that point onwards, there must be some seriousness attached to it and the Hon. Member has suggested that the Cabinet of Ministers must sanction them within six months and implement those, so that Members of Parliament contribute constructively to various matters that are brought to this Parliament and this Parliament itself agrees and approves them as being relevant.

It is not only Private Members Motions that are debated and approved and then forgotten about but there is a general tendency for Ministers to give various undertakings on the Floor of this House and then, matters deteriorate. Those assurances are not respected and I like to mention two examples of this happening right at this moment.

On the 16th of December last year, the Hon. Leader of this House presented to this House, the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and at the time of placing that before this House, he made an important statement highlighting the recommendation of demilitarization that was made in the LLRC Report. He said that action will be taken immediately to ensure that the military engages only in security-related matters and not involve themselves in any civilian affairs. That was an assurance given by no less a person than the Leader of the House, not in answer to a question, not prompted by the Opposition but all, on his own accord.

I can state in this House with responsibility that contrary to that undertaking given last week and this week, the military in Jaffna particularly is involved in large-scale land grabbing. We have read this in the newspapers and I am personally aware that in areas like Nallur, Kondavil and many other places, the military has been visiting peoples private residences asking for their deeds and telling them to come to the army camp. This happened two days ago; that is, on Wednesday. They summoned people to an army camp. Then, took them in their own vehicle to the Divisional Secretarys office and told them that the military has decided to take over some of those lands and that they are not to step into their own land. Fortunately, the officers of the Divisional Secretarys office did not go along with that suggestion and they have said that these are private lands and they cannot survey them and hand them over to the military. But, this is happening. This is happening in broad daylight. This is happening in a way that grates the feelings of the people there. This is happening contrary to the undertaking given in this House by the Hon. Leader of the House.

The second example that I want to draw your attention is to the assurance given in this House on the 21st of October last year, by the Minister of Economic Development with regard to persons who have been displaced from the village of Sampur. When this issue was raised at an Adjournment debate by my Party Leader, the Hon. Minister rose and gave an undertaking, saying that apart from the land that is required for the coal power plant, people will be resettled in the rest of the lands. Now, the area has been demarcated and agreed upon as to where the coal power plant will be situated. That is about 500 acres of land. Not even one house falls within that area, we have examined the maps. So, nobody will be displaced as a result of that Indian coal power plant coming up there.

But, on the 17th of May this month, action has been taken to demarcate another 508 acres as BOI land and to exclude people from entering that area. This is wholly contrary to the assurance given to this House by a responsible Minister on the 21st of October, last year. Even after the Minister gave that undertaking, a question was asked of him, "Why then, are the people being forced to go to alternate places?" His reply was, No, they do not have to go to alternate places, they can remain there. But, by December last year, pressure was brought on them. They were told that if they did not go to alternate places, their food supply will be cut short and from December last year, no dry rations have been given to them in the various welfare centres that they are located in now.

So, enormous pressure is being brought by officials despite assurances to the contrary that are given in this House. Similar to the Private Members Motions being approved by Parliament, which are not implemented, I wish to draw the Governments attention to the fact that when Ministers give assurances in this House, those must be taken very seriously. There is a general decay; Parliament is increasingly becoming irrelevant. We must stop that tide. We cannot allow that to happen. If Ministers who are responsible for subjects stand up and give an assurance, we take that assurance; we take their word for it because those assurances are not just made on public platforms or election platforms, those are given in this House and there is sanctity attached to that.

Therefore, I would like to urge the Hon. Ministers that when they give those assurances, they should also follow it up and see that no countermanding orders are given by other persons that the Government must be theirs. If a subject has been assigned to them, they must be in full control of that subject. They must not allow brothers and sisters and family members, whoever they maybe, to countermand the orders of the Hon. Ministers and the assurances they give in this House.

Thank you very much.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, you can second the Motion now. [3.59 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my Friend, the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, through his Motion, calls for a healthy mind in a healthy body. That is the crux of the whole issue.

If the children are brought up in a proper way with high moral aptitude and discipline, then, the society will be made safe; the country will be safe and the future of the nation will be secured. This is what "Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka" envisages. We want to build up sports bodies, clubs and also give facilities to schools throughout the island.

Sir, the Hon. Member has also very correctly mentioned a fair system devoid of racism and class divisions. That is very important. Sports are sports; children are children; schools are schools. You cannot divide them on the basis of caste, creed or racism. Now, if such a society could be built from the beginning, we will have a bright future and this country will really be the Wonder of Asia. We have already achieved that goal and we will be moving forward and forward.

Today, Sir, as I speak here, our President is meeting His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican. Last

569 570

night, he had a dinner with the Cardinals of Vatican and they were happy about todays position in Sri Lanka. His Eminence Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has also accompanied him. Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, a veteran journalist and Chairman of the SLBC made mention in the famous morning programme "Dasa Desin" as to how happy his Holiness the Pope is. The Vatican is overjoyed by the visit of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Sir, during the younger days, President Rajapaksa was a sportsman. That is why he is promoting sports. . colleges like St. Thomas', Royal, Ananda, Nalanda, St. Benedicts, St. Josephs and Zahira. .

I see here our good Friend, the Hon. Salinda Dissanayake who studied at Maliyadeva, Kurunegala, was a very good wicketkeeper/batsman. I think he can do that even now because he is in robust health. This is what is required by us. Therefore, when you take schools throughout the Island, especially in the Eastern and Northern Provinces, a large number of children take part in sports particularly cricket, football and volleyball.

Sir, through a Motion the other day, I urged this House that the Football Federation must give more thought and pay concentration at school level. I have got certain letters from the people of the Kalutara District. They complain that even the area which was represented by the Chairman had not been looked after well. They are making various types of complaints which I do not want to mention in this House at this moment. In the Eastern Province, where they have not seen a red cherry, a willow or two pads, they have taken seriously to cricket now. They are playing cricket in Kalmunai, Nintavur, Samanthurai, Sainthamaruthu and in all those Maha Vidyalayas like Al-Azhar Maha Vidylaya, Kalmunai Zahira, Pottuvil Maha Vidyalaya, Akkaraipattu Central College and even in Oddamavadi. M.M. Jasmin and M. M. C. Riyaz are two well-known promoters of the game.

As envisaged by my good Friend, the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, I think help and assistance must go to those far-flung areas that we will be able to produce great sportsmen in future.

Today, we remember in this House, Sir, with nostalgic memory that the first world champion was Mr. M.J.M. Lafir of the Moors' Sports Clubs. He was the person who brought the World Amateur Billiards Championship. He was the first champion produced by Sri Lanka in any sport. After my good Friend, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga brought the Cricket World Cup, I too went round the Galle Face in a van waiving a flag together with my other cricket friends expressing our joy and happiness of this great moment. They were shouting everywhere in Sri Lanka, Jaya Wewa. That was how Sri Lanka hailed this historic moment.

I would also like to say that there are a large number of Sports Clubs in the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia area - in Kohuwala, Kalubowila, Kawdana and in other areas of the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council. There are a large number of sports clubs where they play even softball. That is the nursery of a larger game. So, you must help them. Sir, here is a report which is alarming. When I speak about Dehiwala regarding sports, I should quote the headline from the first page of The Island newspaper on Wednesday, 6th June, 2012 :

Attempt to expel 23,000 Muslims from Dehiwela - UNP

This is a very serious and an inflammable statement that incite the people. It states, I quote:

The UNP yesterday questioned if the latest project of an extremist group in the government issuing ultimatums to religious institutions, including mosques and churches, to shut down, was to evict over 23,000 Muslims from Dehiwela.

What is happening there is, Dehiwala had been the bastion of the United National Party right along from Mr. S. De S. Jayasinghes time. Now, the whole character has been changed. In Dehiwala, a large majority and also the Muslims had thrown in their lot with the majority community, which was evident at the last election. Sir, that Mayor Danasiri Amaratunga romped home to victory with all the Muslims helping there, because of the leadership given by the President. Now, the UNP has no place there. Therefore, Sir, they are creating this type of communal disharmony. It further states, I quote:

......... that there were over 23,000 Muslims residing in Dehiwela and it had been their home for generations, but a constituent political party in the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, had gone berserk and was on a mission to close down places of religious worship that did not conform to its ideals and beliefs.

This was told by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. This type of responsible Members should not make statements of this nature. I totally deny and vehemently condemn the statement made by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. Then, Sir, the Mayor of Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia on the following day has denied that statement. That also appears on the first page of "The Island" newspaper on Thursday, 7th June, 2012 and I must thank them for it. The headline states, I quote:

"Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Mayor denies Karunanayake's assertion" . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) .

571 572

2012 08

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Azwer, there is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Ajith P. Perera.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I am only trying to say that this is not sports, this is not cricket.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Give the mike to the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, please.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , . . . , . TV .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please come to the subject.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, even sports is disturbed by such statements. I have a right and I must also say this, Sir. Do not incite people. Do not incite the Muslims against the Sinhalese and the Sinhalese against the Muslims. This is the latest tactic adopted by the bankrupt politician of the United National Party. According to this article in "The Island" newspaper, it states, I quote:

Dehiwala - Mt. Lavinia Mayor denies Karunanayakes assertion.

Dehiwala - Mt. Lavinia Mayor, Danasiri Amaratunga, referring to our news report, headlined Attempt to expel 23,000 Muslims from Dehiwala - UNP, published yesterday, says that it is factually incorrect, misleading and may cause racial disunity between the Mulsim and Sinhala communities. Hear! Hear! ! .

You have to tame your own Member. Ask him to be very watchful and to close his mouth. The fact is, a few weeks ago, a few persons organized a protest against illegal cattle slaughter at a place in Dehiwala. When I was informed of that protest, I informed the Dehiwala Police Station and the Secretary - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, now wind up, please. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . I will finish my speech, Sir. These people talk about international issues on the Motions passed in the -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, you have already taken the 10 minutes allotted to you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir. I will finish my speech. According to the article, the Police have given adequate protection to the place in question and any major problem was averted. Later it was found that there was no cattle slaughter at this juncture. On the instructions of the Defence Secretary, a discussion was held at the Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council because they were inciting the people at every turn and also the children who are taking up to sports. Last night, I met them at the Sri Saranankara Road Playground. They also want that playground to be built and modernized.

Sir, According to todays "Daily Mirror", I would only say that here is a person whose passport has been impounded for getting US Dollars 3 million from Ray Rajaratnam and depositing it in the Standard Chartered Bank by violating all the Regulations of the Exchange Control Act. This is what I want to say. Now, you are throwing stones at others while being in a glass house. Do not do that. You are standing exposed. You have no place in Colombo. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is working against the Colombo Mayor, Mr. A.J.M. Muzammil, and he is also not allowing the Mayor to carry on with sports activities and do his job.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. You have already taken the 10 minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am winding up, Sir.-[Interruption.] I am telling you that this is not cricket.

573 574

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) According to the time allotted, each Member can speak only for 10 minutes, but you have almost taken 13 minutes. So, please come to she subject. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I thank you very much for that.

I would say that all assistance must be given to schools so that a healthy society will be created in the country. Our worthy Deputy Minister of Education, the Hon. Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa, is beside me to make a good speech. Play cricket in the proper sense; hold the bat straight. I would say to people like the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, "Do not play foul in the cricket field and also in the political cricket field".

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to second the Motion brought by the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka. As a Member of Parliament from Nuwara Eliya, I am most grateful to the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka, my Colleague, for bringing this Motion. It is also nice to see at least the Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development available here, to answer this query. Like all the programmes of this Government, from "Mahinda Chintana" - I and II - which was proposed and abandoned half way; like the 50,000 houses they promised the plantation people out of which even 4,000 have not been completed even after seven years of "Mahinda Chintana" - I; we are looking at new proposals which are being brought and abandoned prematurely.

When the Hon. Sajith Premadasa raised the issue this afternoon, the Hon. Deputy Minister replied that this programme is now being implemented. He may not be knowing that this programme has come to a stop. It is very unfortunate that one Deputy Minister held a major function with TV, radio and everybody present to announce this programme but the Government had abandoned it within two days. It was as a result of milk being thrown on the streets of Hatton. So, immediately you brought a proposal, which I think is very amateurish, to collect this milk and supply to the students of schools. A programme to give a glass of milk to students in schools is a very welcome decision. But, it should have been done after studying the whole issue in such a manner that it can be sustained. It should not have been introduced in a hurry and abandoned in a hurry. The students of schools in Nuwara Eliya have been given a hope that they are going to be given a glass of milk everyday. But, so soon this has come to an end. Two days after starting the project, you abandoned it and the media reported your abandoning it also. The reason given was that those people who supplied milk to the Divisional Secretary were not paid the amount that was promised. The Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development has a basic guaranteed price or farm gate price of Rs. 50 per litre for the purchase of milk. The persons who supplied milk to the Divisional Secretary also were given only Rs. 50 whereas they demanded Rs. 65 for collecting at the farm gate price of Rs. 50 and supplying the milk to the Divisional Secretary.

So, this Rs. 15 had to be paid for the collection and delivery which the Government refused or the Divisional

605 606

Secretary refused because the Ministry of Economic Development was willing to pay only Rs. 50. Because of this Rs. 15, the programme has been abandoned and not implemented. But, look at the other side. The Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development has two institutions which are processing milk - Milco (Pvt.) Limited and NLDB. Milco and NLDB are buying the milk from the farmer at Rs. 50 but how are they selling that? The NLDB is selling 500 millilitres of milk at Rs. 55. This works out to Rs. 110 per litre of fresh milk. This pasteurized milk which goes through only one process of boiling and then cooling, is packetted into polythene bags. For this, the value addition the NLDB claims is Rs. 60 because they are selling at Rs. 110. Similarly, Milco is selling 450 millilitres of milk at Rs. 55. So, if you calculate, it works out to Rs. 121 per litre of milk. You are buying at Rs. 50, at farm gate price and selling at Rs. 120 with Rs. 70 additional profit for delivering it in a polythene bag. That maybe the value addition you are claiming from the people. You are charging Rs. 70 to deliver Rs. 50 worth milk to the doorstep or to the outlet of Milco. So, by doing this, you are gaining Rs. 70 or a contribution of Rs. 70 which is exorbitant. But, you are expecting the man who collects milk from the farm gate to deliver to the Divisional Secretary without addition of even one rupee or one cent, whereas he is asking only for Rs. 15. So, this is where you have failed to think of the consequences of the economy of buying this milk and supplying a glass of milk to the students in the Nuwara Eliya District.

When you consider all these, we feel that the Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development has no idea about how to cost liquid milk. You have a slogan, Drink more liquid milk! But, to bring that slogan to life, you have to supply liquid milk at a fair price. If you buy at Rs. 50 and sell at Rs. 120 making a value addition of Rs. 70, it is unfair. You have to compare that with powdered milk. When milk was flowing down the streets of Hatton, the Government thought this is the best time to increase its own revenue. They added Rs. 91 as duty or taxes on powdered milk that was imported to this country. So, you took advantage of the protest of the dairy farmers of Nuwara Eliya to gain revenue for the Government. Look at the economics of powdered milk. On a 400-gram packet of powdered milk itself, it is stated that you can make 3.2 litres of liquid milk from it. Earlier, the price of powdered milk was Rs. 244. So,dividing that price by 3.2 litres, you get Rs. 76. 25 per litre of liquid milk produced from powdered milk. So, by increasing your duty and allowing the milk powder companies to increase the price in addition to the duty factor, you increased the price of a packet of powdered milk to Rs. 312. If you divide Rs. 312, the current price of a 400-gram packet of milk powder by 3.2. litres, you get Rs. 97.50 per litre of liquid milk produced from powdered milk.

So, look at the economics. When you sell fresh milk at Rs. 120 a litre and powdered milk which can produce one litre of liquid milk at Rs. 97.50, why should anybody pay Rs. 22.50 more for the fresh milk supplied by you? Fresh milk is more cumbersome to use. You cannot store it; you cannot use it as and when required and keep the balance preserved. So, the desire of the people for more convenience is to use powdered milk not only because it is convenient but also because it is Rs. 22.50 cheaper to use liquid milk made from powdered milk than fresh milk. So, your slogans about using fresh milk in this country are all false.

How is powdered milk made? It is made from pure milk. The milk is bought, spray-dried and the powder is collected. Then, it is packed into an airtight aluminum package and put into a cardboard box. In addition to all that, the milk powder companies are indulging in heavy expenditure on advertising, distribution and on retailer commissions. With all that, they are supplying one litre of liquid milk made out of powdered milk at Rs. 97.50 after paying a duty of Rs. 91 to the Government. With all that, if they can supply a litre of liquid milk made from powdered milk at Rs. 97.50, why can the NLDB or Milco not give fresh milk they buy at Rs. 50 from the dairy farmer at about Rs. 70 to the public? Only if you provide fresh milk at that type of price, can the consumption of fresh milk be encouraged in this country. If you are going to shut your eyes and allow Milco and NLDB to indulge in all the corruptions and due to that, add high costs to deliver a litre of milk worth Rs. 50 at Rs. 120 to the people, then you will continue to suffer and that would have a serious impact on the public.

The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka regretted that you started this process in Nuwara Eliya and stopped it in Nuwara Eliya itself. The hope of the people and the students of this country was that, as the "Mahinda Chintana" stated, you would supply a glass of milk to every child, that this process would expand to the rest of the country where every child in every school will get a glass of milk everyday.

But, in two days, you have abandoned the pledge in the Mahinda Chintana and the delivery of a glass of milk to the students. That is very unfortunate. We hope your conscience would be touched by the Motion my Colleague has moved today and you would resume the supply of a glass of milk to every child, not only in the Nuwara Eliya District but all over the country.

Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I believe that milk is one of the most essential ingredients for the development of

man, and even animals. It is now being very much spoken all over the world that breast milk is better than any other form of milk for an infant. It is the scientists' conclusion all over the world. There is no doubt about it. From the time of the creation of man - it started with Adam and Eve - two children grew up by drinking milk from the mother. There is no other way. So, right along the human history, it has been continuing.

Sir, I feel a little bit disappointed that in Sri Lanka, the consumption of cow milk is not taken seriously throughout the Island. Take, for instance, India. I remember very well that when I first went there immediately after my wedding, my uncle Mr. M.M.A. Nawaz at Harleys Road in Madras - I still remember the address - said, The cow will come home. I said, We both have already come to your home. No, no, the real cow will come, he said. The next day, when we got up early in the morning, a cow was really there in front of his door. A lady was milking the cow and the milk was straightaway given to us. Such pure milk! That is the way India used to adept itself to the drinking of milk.

In Sri Lanka, that pattern or style or habit is not seen among all communities, I should say. But, I must say, particularly the Tamil community drinks more cow's milk - in Madras, India - the Hon. Yogarajan knows it very well. I was in the same flight when he flew back from Madras - there are what is called Amul Centres organized by the State. Amul milk is available aplenty to the people. In India, although it is a very large country, there is poverty in all the States. There, an ordinary family who does not have the means to have breakfast, carry only a "tiffin" - they call "tiffin" a light meal between breakfast and lunch - to work. In the tiffin of every school child, men and women who go to work, there is milk. So, they are a nourished community.

While participating in the Debate on this Motion brought in by my good Friend, the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka, I must also recommend to the Hon. Minister and the Government that there must be a concerted effort made in order to have milk selling centres in our country like the "Amul Centres". Earlier, from Polonnaruwa, the then National Milk Board started distributing milk throughout the country and there were milk-selling centres, in Colombo and the suburbs. Mr. M.B. Salman, Chairman of the National Milk Board, did that very well.

That was abandoned over the years due to so many reasons. Now, we have to start that all over again because as you said, the primary aim is the child. A child must be fed initially, up to the age of about two or two and a half years, with mothers milk; they must be breastfed. Thereafter, instead of all this milk powder from abroad, we must have pure cow's milk fed to the children.

As far as this matter in Nuwara Eliya is concerned, I do not think it is a problem. It was stopped for only two days due to certain practical difficulties. I hope the Hon. H.R. Mithrapala, Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development, would give you details about it. Now, it is not to be stopped. Within the next couple of days, they will start giving the milk. I think the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka has jumped the gun. You must wait until the gun is loaded. The gun is now being loaded and bullets would not come from that gun in Nuwara Eliya, but milk will flow from it.

I do not call it a trade for his own benefit because he is a man of means. He has taken great effort in order to give the children vitamins through yoghurt, cheese and milk. I went there with some foreigners and witnessed for myself how very well it is organized and carried out.
