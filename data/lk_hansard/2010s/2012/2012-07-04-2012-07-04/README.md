Under the Stockbroker Rules, Section 3 - Trading Practices and Conduct - I quote:

3.1 ACTING ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

When acting on behalf of clients, a Stockbroker Firm and employees of such Firm who deal with clients shall;

(1) observe the highest standards of professional conduct and integrity;

(2) act fairly;

?

, "Market Manipulation" . . "Market Manipulation" .

That is also defined under section 3.8.2 which states, I quote:

(1) Stockbroker Firms and employees of such Firms who deal with clients shall not execute or cause to be executed purchases of any Security listed on the CSE at successively higher prices,

It also states, I further quote:

"(b) unduly or improperly influencing the market price of such Security, or; ...."

Now, this is the allegation that has been made.

. -Colombo Stock Exchange - ? , ; ; . : Annex 5 of the Stockbroker Rules States, I quote:

(1) whether the proposed transaction will be inconsistent with the history of, or recent trading in, the security;

A lot of these things are inconsistent with the history. That is what I want to know. Then, there is a reference to a compliance officer. The compliance officer has to report on this. He is independent on that. Section 3.9.3 states, I quote:

The Compliance Officer shall carry out checks to ensure compliance with the law, rules and regulations as set out in Rule 3.9.1

The Colombo Stock Exchange can go into this matter. Under Section 9.2, they have the power to investigate. Section 9.2.1 states, I quote:

The CSE may conduct an investigation if;

(1) in the CSEs opinion, a matter involves a possible breach of the CSE Rules", and further states:

(4) in the CSEs opinion, the circumstances warrant.

Now, there are enough of circumstances for the Colombo Stock Exchange to go into it. The Stock Exchange is asleep like Rip Van Winkle. Why are they asleep? Were they involved in it? Are they protecting friends or is the Government telling them not to do it? That is the issue.

Then, you have the Securities and Exchange Commission - . Under that, you can grant a licence for stockbrokers and stock exchanges. They have defined what is insider trading. It is very clearly defined. They have all the power to regulate securities, go into any type of irregularity and they have to determine if a person is fit and proper to be in the trade. They have all the power. All they have been able to do is to go into one case of Mr. Dinal Wijemanne. If you open it, it is a can of worms. We know where it will go into? If you take Section 13 of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 36 of 1987, they have the power to investigate into any violation. But, why have they not done this?

This is what I would like to ask. What the Securities and Exchange Commission have done is not enough. Not only the securities, in my view, Hon. Speaker, they should act under Section 23A and take over the stock exchange which has failed to regulate the Colombo Stock Market. Section 23A empowers the Government to take over the administration and management of a licensed stock exchange. If they want to clean this up, they have to take over the stock exchange for some time and clean it up. We gave this power in an amendment which we brought in 1991. This is the body. Then, of course, there is another body.

, . . , the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka - . , Code of Best Practice ...... of Corporate Governance- -. , . .

1341 1342

[ ]

2012 04

They have prepared this. What have they said about the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics? They have defined Fair dealing under which it states, I quote:

Each director and members of the senior management team should endeavour to deal fairly with the Companys customers, suppliers, competitors..

That did not happen when you were fixing the price and you have to encourage the reporting of any illegal or unethical behaviour. Under the heading Encouraging the reporting of any illegal or unethical behaviour it states, I quote:

To encourage employees to report such violations, the Company must ensure that employees know that the Company will not allow retaliation for reports made in good faith.

I would like to read very much, the Foreword to this, where they have explained the history which is very important and I will just state what is there. I will not say anything else.

It states, I quote:

"ICASL is proud to be the pioneer in introducing Corporate Governance to Sri Lanka. The first Code; Code of Best Practice on matters related to financial aspects of Corporate Governance, was issued in December 1997. The sub-committee which developed the Code was chaired by Mr. Nivard Cabraal."

Then, the next paragraph states:

The project of revising the current Code commenced in 2005.

It further states:

The Committee was co-chaired by myself....

That is, Mr. Asite Talwatte.

... and Ajith Nivard Cabraal.

This is what they have put. This is what they want. Why is the Chartered Institute not going into it? Because it is not only the journalists, it is not only the people who are evaluating, some of these members, high-ups are involved in it. They kept their mouths shut. I know at times when Mr. Panditharatne and others were members they would not allow any illegality. Today, any type of fraud can go on. That is what has happened to the Chartered Institute and that is why they are in it. Today, there is no one looking into it. Then, should not the House go into it.

LOLC . ? LOLC shares LOLC . LOLC shares .

The LOLC was started by the UNP |Government. We all were involved in it. Mr. Ronnie de Mel moved for it. The Bank of Ceylon had its shares; the NDB had its shares; the DFCC had its shares. Finally, the Government decided to sell those out. So then, why do you want to go and invest in it again? This is not the LOLC of Shari de Silva. Look at the Board of Directors of the LOLC. Of the seven |Directors, leaving out the Japanese Director, one is a member of the Board of Directors of the LOLC Group of Companies, the Browns Group of Companies as well as of Taprobane Holdings. Another is a member of the Board of Directors of the LOLC Group of Companies, the Browns Group of Companies and the Ishara Group of Companies, which is the one that is dominating this. Two others are members of the Board of Directors of the LOLC Group of Companies and the Ishara Group of Companies. One other member belongs to the Board of Directors of the LOLC Group of Companies and the Browns Group of Companies. Then another member, in addition to that of the LOLC, is also a member of the Board of the Mercantile Merchant Bank. The last one, while being a member of the Board of Directors of the LOLC, was also a member of the Sovereign Ratings team and the Sovereign Debt for Sri Lanka appointed by the Governor of the Central Bank. So, look at how they all are linked up. I do not want to mention the names now.

1343 1344

But, if you are not going to give these details, the House will have to debate all that with the names. If any Member is concerned about the document from which I am reading out, I can give him a copy. But, I do not want these things to be put into Hansard yet. The time will come when we may have to put that into Hansard.

Secondly, look at the share structure of those organizations, as if we do not know. We are putting money into the LOLC and the Browns Company, but kindly look at the share structure of those two organizations. I would like to send some documents for the Ministers also to look at.

You all are doing business. Now, you take the Gal-Oya Plantations (Pvt.) Limited. Then, the Hingurana Sugar Company. Fifty one per cent - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This is not a point of Order that you are raising. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) They can reply. - [Interruption.] No, no, I have finished that. Now, I am speaking on this. - [Interruption.] You can reply to me. Sit down and you reply to me later. - [Interruption.] Fifty one per cent of shares of the Hingurana Sugar Company is owned by the Government. The rest is equally owned by the Browns Group and the LOLC, 24.5 per cent of shares each. Then, what? The LOLC has investments in the Browns Group. Then, the Ishara Group invests in Taprobane and the LOLC. Others are also there. So, when you look at it, it seems that the Board of the LOLC is more powerful than the Monetary Board. . What is this Mafia? ? , " , ." . ; . - - . , . . ? , . . ? . . , ? Why is that we, in Sri Lanka, are silent? Why is that you cannot act? Be like Mr. David Cameron and Mr. Ed Miliband. They all said, Yes, go into it, go into it. "Go into it", said all the three parties.

But, here the Government would not go into it. They would not give the facts; they would not give the figures and they are hiding those. This is a very serious issue, which we have to go into. Hon. Speaker, we have to decide whether we are to have a Select Committee to go

into this or not. I think we have come to that stage now. That is all I have to point out. I did not give the names; I did not give any individuals name. I can talk of it later on. I do not want to do anything of that sort now. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Mr. Anura Fernando, an old friend. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Yes, an old friend and still a friend. You know that. He was there and you know what happened. Others will tell you.

So, that is the question we are asking.

One request I am making from the Government is, - we will keep on agitating; the trade unions are worried - do not let these two Funds make any investment in the Stock Exchange until we have cleared this out. We do not want any investments in the Stock Exchange until we clear this out. If the Government needs money, invest in Treasury Bills. They are much safer. Invest in Treasury Bills. We are not saying that the Government must not make money. We are saying, "Invest in Treasury Bills". Do not take peoples money. If anyone in the Government says, You must invest in the Stock Exchange, you put your own money. At the end of the day, we are putting in money as an investment in Hingurana Sugar Industries Limited, the land of which anyway belongs to us; the factory belongs to the people. So, what are you putting in money for? For whose benefit? ? . I would like it if the Chief Government Whips father was there because he would have been the first to

[3.04 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity given to speak on the Orders that have been placed before the House for approval under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act and Stamp Duty (Special Provisions) Act.

But, before I commence, with your permission, I want to mention a very sad incident that has happened in this country in the early hours of this morning. A political prisoner named Nimala Ruben died in the Ragama Hospital consequent to assaults he received at the hands of prison and police officials at the Vavuniya Prison a few days ago.

As Parliament is aware and the country is aware, there was a particular situation in the Vavuniya Prison, which was sought to be handled by the Special Task Force and a special force of the prison officials, which resulted in many Tamil political prisoners being very seriously injured; many with fractures. All of them were evacuated from the Vavuniya Prison to Anuradhapura and several were hospitalized. From Anuradhapura, many have been transferred to the Mahara and Bogambara Prisons. Several had been admitted to the Ragama Hospital and other hospitals around those prisons. But, unfortunately, one of them, Nimala Ruben, succumbed to his injuries this morning. So, he has died not only as a prisoner while in custody but also as a direct result of assaults by the officials and I want to record our strongest protest in this regard, the inhuman way in which these prisoners are being treated.

I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that on the 23rd of May, in consequence of a question raised by

our Party Leader, the Hon. Leader of the House gave an assurance to this House and to the country that within a space of one month, this issue of long-term Tamil political prisoners would be resolved. He stated that many of them will be released, yet others who volunteered to go for rehabilitation would be sent for rehabilitation and only the balance who will be charged will be tried in special courts to be set up in Mannar, Vavuniya and Anuradhapura. Unfortunately, the one month time that was sought by the Government lapsed and it was thereafter that this particular stand-off situation arose in Vavuniya. If the Government had kept to its promise of resolving this issue within that one month, we would not have seen this unfortunate situation that we are in today, a life having been lost and many others in very critical condition in hospitals and also still in prison.

I am asking the Government to immediately inquire into this matter; the circumstances that led to this issue as to why so many prisoners sustained these serious injuries but more than anything else, to grant access to lawyers for these persons who have been assaulted so that they can have recourse to legal proceedings if the necessity arises. So far, lawyers have been barred from meeting these persons. I am also asking that the relatives of these prisoners be informed of their whereabouts. Almost all of the relatives of these prisoners who were in Vavuniya to date do not know where these prisoners are being kept.

Having dealt with that matter, with your permission, Sir, might I move on to the subject at hand. We are debating today the Orders that have been made under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, where certain taxes are sought to be exempted on certain transactions. When the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, Senior Minister of International Monetary Co-operation presented these Orders earlier in the day, he said that with regard to share certificates on the issue of any shares to the Government of Sri Lanka and share certificate on the transfer or assignment of any share which belongs to the Government of Sri Lanka, there is an exemption being brought in from payment of Stamp Duty. He told this House that that is because it is just an administrative arrangement that this Stamp Duty need not to be paid by the Government to the Government. But, that is only half the story;that is only half the truth.

If the purchaser is liable to pay Stamp Duty, then, when the Government of Sri Lanka purchases shares, that explanation he gave would be valid. But, it will not be valid when the Government of Sri Lanka sheds those shares, transfers those shares to third persons because at that point in time, the party that is liable to pay Stamp Duty is not the Government of Sri Lanka, it is the other party that purchases those shares. So, now we have a situation where the Stamp Duty Ordinance can be sought to be circumvented if "A" sells and "B" purchases certain shares, it can be routed through the Government of Sri

1357 1358

[ ]

2012 04

Lanka. "A" can sell the shares to the Government of Sri Lanka; then the Government of Sri Lanka can sell those shares to "B" and both the transactions will be exempt from Stamp Duty. This is a very serious issue. You cannot exempt both transactions from Stamp Duty and the explanation given to this House is not correct.

With regard to the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, ad hoc Orders are being sought approval. Particularly with regard to motor vehicles, what is being sought is a blanket provision that enables His Excellency the President to decide who can be exempt from such Excise Duty. This is contrary to all norms of governance, of equality, of equal protection before the law for such powers to be granted to the Head of the country to discriminate between persons. There are permissible discriminations that are laid out in the Constitution, being the supreme law. Even when that is exercised, that can be tested in the Supreme Court as to whether it falls within those permissible positive discrimination. But, now we have before us, Orders that seek to grant that power which hitherto vested as a judicial power in the Supreme Court to test and approve as to whether it is permissible discrimination or not, in the hands of the Executive. This is not something that can be approved. This makes serious holes in the governance structure of this country where equality and provisions for equal protection of the law will be seriously dented.

This also makes provision for motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons including Station Wagons and racing cars. Why racing cars? Why are racing cars being exempted from the payment of this Excise Duty?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) For the development of sports.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. We know the sports that you indulge in. You are a good sportsman. We all know that. We also know the sports. - [Interruption.]

In a country where transport costs have escalated, in a country that can ill-afford the cost of fuel for legitimate transport purposes, encouragement of motor racing is to be frowned upon. Now, motor racing, worldwide, is frowned upon because there is a very serious dent into the natural resources of the world that are wasted. We all like to view motor sport, there is no question about that. But, if we are responsible citizens, if we are responsible human beings who want to preserve a world for the next generation, then we need to be careful about the carbon

footprint. We need to be conserving the energy sources that we have and it is downright irresponsibility for any government to be promoting motor sport that wastes so much fuel which has become so rare and precious a commodity that needs to be preserved for the later generations for no reason at all. I can understand if it is for air transport, for mass transport or for legitimate movement of people, then, even though fuel is precious, it has to be used. But, in motor sport, fuel is only wasted; it is not used. And, the question arises why at this juncture would we want to exempt racing cars from this Excise duty that is levied from other vehicles? Who is interested in this motor sport, in racing? We have had a few night races and so on, a waste of public resources and we know who is behind it. Is this the way this country is going to move forward? Are we going to give in to the childish ways, to the whims and fancies of our irresponsible children who get a kick out of racing? Merely because one of our three children is fond of racing, are we to amend the laws of our country and waste this precious natural resource that we have for the whole world, not only for this is country? So, this is symptomatic of the type of governance that we have in this country at present, irresponsible and giving in to the demands of a few coterie of people who have come to think that this country belongs to them. In point of fact, if we observe carefully, the country is slowly changing hands of ownership from people to a family.

Many of the lands that are sometimes acquired, sometimes taken by force and sometimes under the BOI are given over to companies hiding behind the corporate veil and when one raises that corporate veil, one sees only one family. So, the Order that has been placed before us to exempt racing cars from Excise Duty - such an irresponsible act as I said earlier - is giving in to the whims and fancies of children, of family members and that arises from their belief, which is soon becoming a reality that this country actually belongs to them. A large portion of the lands are controlled by one family and as the Hon. Leader of the Opposition cautioned us earlier in the day, many of the transactions in the Stock Exchange are manipulated for the benefit of this small coterie of people. The corporate veil is abused; Orders that are made by Ministers under statutes are being abused and what has been placed before Parliament today is only a good example of that.

Therefore, I am urging the House today to look at these specific Orders under the Stamp Duty (Special Provisions) Act and the Excise (Special Provisions) Act a little more carefully and see the small print or read between the lines and understand where this is taking the country. This is yet another, maybe a small step, but definitely a step in that direction of depriving the people of their legitimate due for the benefit of one family.

Thank you very much.

, . This is, - Sri Lanka : Letter of Intent - given to the IMF on 15th March, 2012.

. , Ms. Christine Lagarde

.

It states, I quote:

Though economic fundamentals were healthy, there were emerging signs in the third quarter that the balance of payments was coming under pressure. A stronger-than-expected rebound in the growth of credit and domestic demand,

as well as higher-than-expected oil prices, led to a significant increase in imports, and despite healthy growth in exports and remittances, the current account deficit widened sharply to 7 per cent of GDP.

. .

.

Business Today

. : In a cover story interview with the Business Today magazine in September, the Governor went on to say the following regarding the balance of payment and I quote:

We will have a surplus this year. It will be sufficiently high, which will be encouraging. Even in the last few years, other than in 2009 which was an extraordinary difficult year and we had a balance of payments deficit, we have recorded comfortable surpluses.

IMF . . Business Today , " . ." . .

In The Island newspaper dated 20th October, 2011, he states as follows and I quote:

What is important is for us to have a clear picture in relation to our current account balance, and the capital and financial account balance which finally leads to the balance of payments. Although we have a trade deficit, the other inflows have more than adequately compensated for this shortfall, and therefore we expect the balance of payments to record a comfortable surplus by the end of the year.

[5.20 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Mr. Presiding Member, as you are aware, our UPFA Government, under the vision of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, as stipulated clearly in the "Mahinda Chintana" has a strong and clear objective towards strengthening the State corporations and other institutions of such nature that were not functioning as expected, due to several irregularities having taken place under previous governments. However, the well-defined objective of our Government is to facilitate these institutions towards progress and get them back to the main stream of economy to play a meaningful and productive role for the benefit of the general public.

Sir, as Members of this august Assembly are aware, these State institutions play a vital role in our national economy today. Most of these institutions are of strategic importance and essential for the development, well-being and welfare of the general public and also essential elements from the national security viewpoint. The services provided by these institutions are not necessarily based on pure profit-making but on wider social responsibility.

As a responsible Government, we are always sensitive to the needs of the general public. We always feel the pulse of the nation. A prosperous nation could be built if the people are satisfied with the economic conditions and also have decent livelihoods. For this purpose, services of these State institutions are an integral part of the whole mechanism that delivers essential services to our people. In assisting these institutions to better re-integrate to the economic process while pursuing the public policy of the Government, it is required that these State institutions enlist their equity shares to the Government Treasury in exchange for the financial facilitation role. Such a transfer of shares to the Treasury also ensures efficient use of the resources and implies empowerment of supervision on the said State institutions. Thus, transfer of shares to the Treasury is of utmost importance in reviving these State institutions back to their full capacity.

Unfortunately, in such transfers, additional costs can occur that can violate the sole purpose of the transfer itself. For example, the Stamp Duty arising in such instances, though a procedural step, is an example of an unnecessary burden on the public as well as a waste of time, skills and expertise of such ventures since it would also penalize their profit and loss accounts. These are valuable funds that otherwise could be used for further beneficial activities or could be reinvested for multiple benefits in future. Similarly, when the Government

1397 1398

[ () ]

2012 04

decides to transfer equity or shares held by it, in State ventures, to other State ventures, though a procedural step, for the purpose of better portfolio management, in actual fact, payment of such stamp duty would be an unnecessary expense in regard to transactions between two State institutions, burdening the public with an unnecessary cost, which are valuable funds that otherwise could be used effectively for development.

In the light of this, we believe it is important that by certain gazetted provisions to this end, we can overcome such unnecessary costs and save unnecessary expenses. The outstanding contributions are made by, among others, two gazettes. The Gazette No. 1752/ 17 of 4th April, 2012 provides Stamp Duty exemption for share certificate on the issue of any shares to the Government of Sri Lanka and the Gazette No. 1757/ 4 of 9th May, 2012 provides Stamp Duty exemption for share certificate on the transfer or assignment of any share belonging to the Government of Sri Lanka. The amended provisions stipulated in the two Gazette notifications would be of immense use in this regard and are expected to facilitate smooth operations avoiding unnecessary costs for the benefit of the nation when such transactions take place.

, , Ruchir Sharma "Breakout Nations : In Pursuit of the Next Economic Miracles" Report Sri Lanka's Peace Dividend . He states, I quote:

I first visited Sri Lanka in 1997, shortly after a rebel bombing of the central bank headquarters had thrown the financial system into chaos. Military checkpoints made travelling around the capital City of Colombo rather punishing, but the overwhelming impression was of an utterly charming island and talented people trapped inside a seemingly endless civil war.

He further states, I quote:

The civil war is over, the process of healing is under way, and there is every chance that Sri Lanka will again become a breakout nation. Despite slowing sharply during the war years, the economy continued to grow at an average pace of nearly 5 per cent.

The economy was running on one engine - the prosperous Western Province where Colombo is located, and where the well-educated young population was producing strong growth in industries and services.

. . I quote:

Sri Lanka could be the country to move the region towards a new trade regime. Ignoring the lingering fears of Indian domination, the Government is proposing a grand deal that could unlock trade with India and provide a huge boost to the economy.

The opposition comes from Sri Lankan businessmen fearful of Indian competition.

Then, he further goes on to state, I quote:

At peace, Sri Lanka finds itself in a very strong position, courted by both of Asias emerging giants. There is some risk that the peace dividend could prove fleeting: the USAID study found that 40 per cent of nations that end a civil war will revert to

violence within a decade. There is a strong case to be made, however, that Sri Lankas peace will hold.

Sir, I should, at the outset, say that the Government is totally committed to eradicate this epidemic disease. It is clearly manifested through the efforts taken by our Minister in charge of health, the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, his able medical team, his Secretary and the other staff of the Ministry. All those in the hospitals throughout the Island are working around the clock in order to see that the nation is rid of this worst epidemic.

Sir, I should tell this House that any disease cannot be contained by man alone. Sometimes, you have to fight against nature. Diseases, floods, landslides, tornadoes, tsunamis and all those natural disasters are not man-made. What we have to do as human beings is to pray for the safety and good health of the people of the nation. Every religion teaches us this factor.

His Excellency the President himself has shown a very keen interest in this matter because he wants to have a healthy and vibrant nation and also a generation of children who would grow up in an environment free of epidemic diseases.

. . . . . .

Now, let us analyse the dengue update. During the last six months of this year, 12,454 suspected dengue cases and 75 deaths have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit from all over the Island. Approximately, 49.79 per cent of dengue cases were reported from the Western Province. The highest number of dengue cases were reported during the month of January. The situation warrants regular removal of possible mosquito breeding sites from the environment. It is also important to receive medical attention in the event of fever by day three of the illness.

Three factors must join together in order to eradicate this epidemic disease. They are, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Environment and the people themselves. Now, see what is happening? People must be careful for their own health. The Government, the Urban Development Authority and Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa can warn the people, can ask them to keep the city, the environment and their gardens clean but if the people are not adhering to such appeals, what can the Ministry or the Government do? So, the people themselves must learn to protect their environment, their children and their households as they do in Singapore and Malaysia.

The Sri Lanka Public Health Inspectors' Association has taken legal action against 5,000 individuals who failed to keep their surroundings clean, thus paving the way for dengue mosquito breeding during the last six months. I think it is a very dangerous trend. Let the people know this.

According to a spokesman from the Sri Lanka Public Health Inspectors' Association, legal action has been

taken against 4,456 individuals; of course, they should, they have to. There was one person who threw some papers on the road at night. The police - there is a special police - had arrested him. That person, who is about 70 years, is known to me. He said, See Hajiar, I have been taken into the police station. Please tell them to release me. I asked him, "Why?" He said, Because I threw some dirt on the road. Then I told him, We ourselves have told them to arrest people like you.

That is the way we have to be firm to eradicate diseases. There is another matter. When the Hon. Minister of Health was talking - it was very interesting - on the " " radio programme, he told about rambutan. I must add here durian also. , . . , . . - - .
