But, there are instances where they go on tourist visa and work in these countries illegally. Then, there is nothing that we can do for them.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe can address the House now. [1.00 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member. May I commence by stating for the record that I offer my felicitations as well as congratulations to His Excellency the President for presenting seven successful Budgets so far and for presenting the eighth Budget just a few days ago. I also want to place on record my appreciation to him for once again identifying the broad objectives of this Budget, his eighth Budget, as peace, reconciliation and development.

Sir, we know that today the world is facing an unprecedented economic downturn. When His

751 752

[ ]

2012 12

Excellency the President took over the reins of power by setting in place his Government way back in 2005, the challenges at that time were also surmountable. Although we had an average 5 per cent economic growth despite fighting in the North, a conflict which was present at that time even in the East, the other major economic indicators were quite bad. If you look at public debt at that time, it had exceeded the Gross Domestic Product. This was not a favourable position as far as economic development was concerned. Economic activity in other spheres was also suffering: unemployment was high; inflation was high and international reserves were down. So, he inherited a plethora of challenges as far as the reviving of the economy of this country was concerned and to his credit, today, he has been able to turn things around despite an international economic downturn that our country as well as other countries whom we trade with has had to face over the years, especially in todays context. So, he has to be congratulated for presenting, despite this unfavourable economic downturn internationally, a very conducive Budget to spur economic growth even further.

But, what I want to speak today is about the challenge that he faced when he took over as our President in terms of facing up to the challenge of the scrooge of terrorism that our country had faced over a period of 30 years. The country was torn to pieces; disunity prevailed; economic growth had suffered; investment had suffered; tourism had suffered and His Excellency the President correctly identified that to spur economic activities, to increase development in our country, he has to eliminate this scrooge of terrorism. Of course, he did try to engage them in discussions. Those discussions, we know, were used as an opportunity by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to consolidate their military positions even further and very soon, he saw that talks were not going to result in peace in this country, that he had to face up to the challenge of eliminating terrorism. And, he took upon this challenge.

He gave whatever has to be given - the encouragement, the political will and the resources to the forces in our country - and as a result of the dedication and commitment shown by the forces of our country by sacrificing their own lives at times, we were able to eliminate the scrooge of terrorism.

Now, it is a question of winning the peace. We eliminated terrorism, but the challenge does not stop at that. We have not overcome all the challenges; there are many challenges for us to overcome and he is now in the position of addressing each one of these challenges, one by one, so that we can move towards his stated objective even in this Budget when he presented it: peace, reconciliation and further development.

When he eliminated terrorism, one of the biggest challenges that he faced was to accept and look after the 300,000 Internally Displaced People, who escaped the scrooge of terrorism at the end of the conflict. Our

Government not only received those 300,000 odd IDPs, who are Sri Lankans, who are our brothers and sisters, but they were also looked after. There were several camps that were opened, welfare camps, as we call them. I was the Minister of Disaster Management at that time. Also, I had a coordinating role at the Consultative Committee on Humanitarian Assistance, which I chaired at the Defence Ministry every month. We had discussions with our partners in the international arena: the key ambassadors who were present here and who were part of the Co-Chairs to the peace process. The UN was round the table. Then, our key people - the Defence Ministry and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Minister of Economic Development at present and who, at that time, was a Senior Adviser to His Excellency the President - were round the table and we faced up to this challenge. We looked after those IDPs, who are Sri Lankans, who are our brothers and sisters, as I said earlier. We not only looked after them, but also faced up to the challenge of eventual resettlement.

Last week, when I was in Geneva for the Universal Periodic Review, I reported to the Human Rights Council that we have been successful in resettling 501,000 IDPs so far - 300,000, which was the new caseload and about another 200,000, which was the old caseload. There were IDPs even before the conflict really started, over the years because this is a conflict that had lasted for 30 years. There were IDPs who were identified as being old IDPs, the "older caseload", as long as 15 or 16 years, they were regarded as IDPs. They were being looked after by the GAs of those districts, assisting them, but they were not resettled. They were victims, once again, of conflict; they were victims of terrorism.

Of course, in the process of wanting to resettle them, we had to face many other challenges. One of the main challenges that we had to face was the demining of extensive areas which had been mined. The LTTE never kept records of the mines that they laid. So, the issue was even more complicated. At present, 2,061 square kilometres in those areas have been identified as hazardous areas. The area cleared is over 1,953 square kilometres. So, this is a formidable achievement within a period of three years. Over 900,000 hazardous devices had been recovered.

These include anti-tank, anti-personnel and IEDs amongst the recovered UXO. As of 25th of October, 2012, about 98 per cent of the areas identified for demining have been cleared and approximately 108 square kilometres of territory only remains to be cleared. This data refers to 10 districts in all, including 3 in the East, 5 in the North and 2 in the North Central Province. The Sri Lankan Army was responsible for demining approximately 75 per cent of this land. So, the bulk of the work was done by the Sri Lankan Army but, of course, for the rest of the areas, there were international mine clearance agencies who worked alongside with others

753 754

within the country and we have been able to achieve nearly 90 per cent or even more of the target that has to be achieved. So, this challenge, of course, continues because there are still some IDPs who need to be resettled and with regard to these IDPs, the Government has gone on record saying that we will resettle once these areas are cleared of the remaining mines, because we cannot resettle people in areas which have not been cleared and which are not safe for these people to go and live.

Now, Mr. Presiding Member, the other challenge, of course, we faced was the construction of houses so that the resettlement can be made sustainable. This was also a formidable challenge, because as a result of the conflict, lots of houses were damaged; they were destroyed, in fact. To aid in the process of resettlement, the total number of houses constructed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces up to September, 2012 was 124,184 at a cost of Rs. 33.34 billion from 2005. I am resorting to mention these statistics to underscore the point that especially after the conflict, we were faced with formidable challenges and it is in that context that this eighth Budget that His Excellency the President has presented should also be viewed. Needless to say, we are justifiably proud of our achievement. This is another example of implementation of a recommendation that was made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission that His Excellency the President put in place, to once again help us reach that objective of comprehensive reconciliation. We want to ensure that the people of this country will never have to face another era of destability of extreme terrorism which they faced for 30 long years.

From May 2009 to October 2012, the Army has constructed 4,652 permanent new houses, 6,171 semi-permanent houses and has renovated 7,454 houses through their initiative and efforts. This is not monies that they have got from elsewhere, this is their own funds that they have used, the labour at no cost, and this is to help the people of those areas whom they liberated. The Army has constructed 73 schools, renovated nearly 500 old school buildings and has constructed 23 school playgrounds. They have made a significant contribution to the improvement of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. The Army has also contributed to the socio-cultural needs of the people by building or restoring nearly 250 places of religious worship belonging to all faiths in the North and the East; whether it be Buddhist places of worship, Hindu places of worship, or Muslim places of worship, all these places which were destroyed have been reconstructed by the Army. This is a story that is never told. There are people who are agitating for the army to be withdrawn from those areas, but remember, that they have not only fought to ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our nation, but they have also, after the conflict assisted in helping the people whom they liberated. This should never be forgotten. Of

course, it has also contributed to the repair 11 main roads and 43 minor roads during this period.

Livelihood assistance has also been facilitated by the Army. A number of medical clinics have been held, and assistance provided for the conduct of religious, cultural and other festivals. The Sri Lanka Navy and the Air Force also facilitated similar projects. Now, I am not making out a case that they should get involved in these things in the future. Their job now is to ensure the security of those areas, bearing in mind, that this has been a conflict-ridden area for the last 30 years. Of course, the civil administration must now take over and ensure that everything that needs to be done in the future is done and the Army, of course, will ensure that security is maintained so that we do not have to face any threats in the future.

Mr. Presiding Member, another challenge that we faced was the number of ex-combatants we received and had to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. This was the stated position of the Government because a large number amongst these ex-combatants were child ex-combatants, and we identified them not as perpetrators, but as victims. These are children who were recruited unfortunately and they were victims rather than perpetrators.

As of 22nd of October, 2012, the number of persons including 594 LTTE child soldiers who have been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society is 11,012. Now, this is a formidable achievement. Of the approximately 12,000 persons identified as ex-combatants and provided rehabilitation, as of 22nd of October, 2012, only 782 beneficiaries are undergoing rehabilitation and 262 are continued to be looked after. So, this is once again, Sir, a formidable achievement, which we are justifiably proud of, because what we want to do is to restore economic activity in the North and the East.

Now, I would like to state for the record the impressive economic growth targets that have been achieved in the North and the East since the end of the conflict. At the end of last year, the growth rate was 8 per cent. The economic growth rate in the North alone was 22 per cent. So, you can just imagine the potential that is there and the potential that is being realized so that the entire country benefits as a result of peace being returned to those areas. This year, Sir, economic growth is estimated to be 27 per cent in the North and the East. The rest of the country has had to face a slight adjustment in terms of the growth rate that we achieved last year. I think what is estimated is just below 7.5 per cent at the end of the year; once again because of external factors and this has had an impact. We are not a country that is not dealing with the international community. There are trade relations that have to be maintained and we have, of course, suffered as a result of the economic downturn internationally. But, yet, an impressive growth rate will

be achieved at the end of this year despite the fact that there is an international economic downturn that a lot of countries, especially countries in our sub-region have been experiencing.

The other fact that I want to state for the record is, we are interested and committed to looking at accountability. One of the questions that was put forward to me when I was in Geneva last year week was, Are you looking at accountability? Yes. We are looking at accountability and that is why we have put into place the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. The Report was received by His Excellency the President and he took the bold step of releasing it immediately through this very Parliament to the general public.

A Task Force spearheaded by the Secretary to His Excellency the President has been appointed. An Action Plan has been prepared, and we are now in the process of implementing the Action Plan.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I am winding up, Sir.

In addition to the LLRC Action Plan that is being implemented by the Task Force, the Sri Lankan Army has also set in place a Court of Inquiry and an Inquiry Board to look into references that are made to the Sri Lankan Army in this LLRC Report. They have identified 50 such references and are looking into each one of these 50 incidents that have been reported. So, what else does anyone want us to do in terms of accountability?

Of course, the Court of Inquiry has met on 30 different occasions up to now and the report will be submitted to the Commander of the Army and he, under the Sri Lankan Army Act, will take the next step. If there is evidence and if there are proven cases by this Court of Inquiry, then certainly the next step of Court Martial or whatever else that needs to be done will be done so that accountability issues can also be looked into and perpetrators brought to justice.

So, in summary Sir, what I wanted to establish was that it was not an easy ride for our Government. His Excellency the President fulfilled the task, uppermost in the minds of the people of this country, to ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our nation and the elimination of one of the worst forms of terrorism this country has seen. Now, he is building on that and as I said earlier, we have not stopped at eliminating terrorism. We want to win the peace and to win the peace, economic development has to be ushered into this country,

especially in the North and the East; people have to be looked after and I express the hope that through this Budget as well, we will be able to work even faster and harder to ensure further growth in the conflict-affected areas. Thank you very much.

Whereupon THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER left the Chair, and THE HON. R. YOGARAJAN took the Chair. [3.01 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) The Budget Speech delivered last week, Mr. Presiding Member, lays down a range of imaginative and constructive policies and it is an honour for me to support them. The hallmark of great liberal governments at a time of social change was the pursuit of reforms that promoted opportunities for all, and this is the basic principle behind the proposals made in the Budget Speech. Amongst those of immense importance are the commitment to promote school enrolment among low income families and the determination to improve transport facilities for this purpose. Twinning this with mechanisms to ensure connectivity to market places is symptomatic of the understanding that social services must also aim at empowerment, not simply handouts.

It is also important that healthcare services be extended. I have noted the comparative excellence of the Ministry of Health in not just restoring, but also improving services in areas affected by conflict. The concern that the Budget Speech makes clear for expanding such services to areas in need is most welcome, and also the understanding of the need for people's participation in improving conditions, as exemplified in the proposal to intensify knowledge- sharing programmes on child nutrition. In this regard, the development of the dairy industry is a timely step, and I hope the strides made in this regard over the last couple of years will be taken further. The same applies with regard to poultry farming and recent emphasis on this, and the concerted efforts made through the Divineguma initiative, provide a model of policy innovations carried out with practical efficiency.

With regard to the livestock industry, I am glad that the innovations of the late Hon. Savumiamoorthy Thondaman are remembered, and the collapse of that initiative is evident of the need to ensure policy continuity, whatever the political compulsions of individuals or governments. On a related issue, let me, on a personal note, thank His Excellency for recognizing the practical work done by the Sabaragamuwa University with regard to artificial insemination, and hope that agriculture faculties nationwide will adopt a similar creative approach in research and teaching.

I hope, Mr. Presiding Member, that we will see similar commitment on the part of other research organizations also to other areas in which the budget targets innovations. Forestry and environment conservation are vital in the context of rapid development, and the resources that the Budget provides must be supplemented by the many institutions the Government funds for scientific research. The same, I need hardly say, goes for the development of alternative energy sources. In this regard, mention of gliricidia cultivation is welcome, and I hope that we can ensure that agencies working on livelihood projects in the North provide some assistance in these areas. I should record in this regard, Mr. Presiding Member, the ready support of the Japanese government for such useful work, and I hope the programmes that they support through the Gandhi Centre, with their emphasis on empowerment of rural communities, can be replicated elsewhere too.

I need hardly add, Mr. Presiding Member, that emphasis on agriculture is vital, given the need for food security. The attention given to fisheries and aquatic resources is most welcome, and I must congratulate the Ministry of Fisheries on the support it has provided to fishermen nationwide, despite the difficulties of the post-war situation and the continuing incursion of fishermen from India. Problems in this regard, and efforts by some in the South too, who had not worked in the area previously, to take advantage of the difficulties of those in the North who are trying to get back to their traditional occupations, are constantly raised at divisional level meetings, but there is universal appreciation of the sympathy and support of the Minister in promoting fair settlements.

The support given to inland fisheries reminds me, Mr. Presiding Member, of the seminal work done in this regard by His Excellency the President when he was given the portfolio of fisheries, which was a subject with which I assume he was thought to be unfamiliar. I recall at the time remarking on energy he devoted to the subject, and introduced the innovations and, as with the backsliding with regard to livestock development, it was a pity that what he achieved then was not built on. I hope the current commitment will help us make up for lost time. In this regard, the programmes initiated to develop fish ponds in the North are another achievement that should be recognized.

With regard to agriculture, it should be recognized that, despite the difficulties caused by the drought this year, progress in the North has been fantastic since resettlement began, and this is appreciated by local communities. At the same time, this should be accompanied by skills training, as was noted by a lady in Musali who mentioned the need for training in marketing. I hope, threfore, that the welcome encouragement of small enterprises is accompanied also by training in marketing and entrepreneurship development, in

particular for value addition for agricultural products. Since I hope to speak later on Education at the Committee Stage Discussion, I will not say much in this regard, except to note the crucial need, as registered in the Budget Speech, to do much more with regard to human resource development.

Given the importance of agriculture, Mr. Presiding Member, I welcome the support provided for irrigation. I hope very much that the Ministry ensures consultation of farming communities, and proper follow-up and maintenance with regard to the various projects that have been and will be implemented.

I have written a couple of letters in this regard on the basis of worries expressed by farmers in the Eastern as well as the Northern Provinces, and I hope the Minister will ensure swift attention to the problems mentioned. Though, of course, decisions must be made by the technical experts in the Ministry, it is vital that affected communities are consulted and kept informed of the progress. One difficulty in ensuring this, I suppose, is that responsibility is exercised at different levels, which is why we must ensure better coordination between Central and Provincial Ministries. I hope that the structural changes needed to ensure this will be implemented swiftly, with the needs of local communities, and their right to be consulted and informed, being the key factors that administrative reforms should fulfil.

I am delighted, Sir, that the question of devolution should have been discussed in a Budget Speech, because for too long we have been dealing in this regard with dogma that takes account of neither financial nor practical realities. I believe that reform is perfectly possible within the framework of the current Constitution, provided we work on the principle of subsidiarity, which was the basis on which the Liberal Party first promoted devolution, when discourse on the subject was dominated by those committed to domination of geographical areas by one ethnic group or the other.

The simple fact that governance should be about people, not about the power of politicians, has been forgotten for too long, and I hope we can work rather on the principle of uniform National Policy - which the Constitution lays down as applying to all subjects - developed through consultation of all interests, along with implementation through units that can best promote the interests of the people within them. In this regard, I welcome the move to develop the potential of local authorities, and I hope the current responsibilities they fulfil are expanded to ensure more precise attention to basic needs. Health and nutrition, education and training, roads and transport, are best understood and promoted at local levels, in conformity, of course, with policies and programmes developed at national and provincial level.

Efficiency and effectiveness demand that duplication should be avoided, and responsibilities must be clearly defined. The financial savings that this would ensure are considerable. At the same time, we should apply the same principle to the central government too and work towards reducing the number of Ministries as well as Government Departments, since these are not only an unnecessary burden on the people whose taxes fund them, but also on officials who often do not act because responsibilities are divided. This has been a problem, Mr. Presiding Member, in the effort to expedite implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan, and I am sure those in charge of implementing the LLRC Action Plan have the same problem. I am glad in this regard that the Budget Speech pays due attention to the aspect of developmental needs.

The stress placed on training and human resource development for the Police is most welcome. For years I have argued that our armed forces in general behaved with exemplary decency in the midst of a war against terrorism of vicious intensity, but the same could not always be said of the police. In the last couple of years, however, I have noted increasing professionalism on the part of the police and the enormously positive attitudes to them now of the people I meet at Divisional Secretariat meetings in the North and East are testimony to the change that has taken place. The police, in general, do a commendable job in difficult circumstances, and the commitment not only to improving their capacity, but to giving them decent conditions to work, is timely.

The commitment also to fast track the reconciliation process is welcome, though I would also suggest that some funding should be devoted to ensuring that the good work done is communicated systematically. The website of the Peace Secretariat, along with the website of our Mission in Geneva, helped to refute unfair allegations during the period of conflict, and we must ensure that all our Missions have websites with similar communicative capacity in a context in which we are still victims of unfair allegations. For this purpose a dedicated website should be developed in Sri Lanka, and I hope the Presidential Secretariat will be provided with both financial and human resources to do this.

Finally, Mr. Presiding Member, whilst congratulating His Excellency on the range and relevance of the initiatives outlined, I should strike a cautionary note in registering the need to establish mechanisms to ensure implementation of these excellent ideas. Last year, I remember welcoming the suggestions with regard to Prison Reform, but unfortunately very little was done in this regard. I appreciate the efforts of the Ministry in this regard, but concerted action was needed, in particular with regard to sentencing policy, but coordination in this regard did not take place. The tragedy that took place last

Friday at Welikada suggests that when good ideas are advanced, they should be implemented quickly. Then, I can only hope that the good ideas in this Budget Speech are implemented swiftly, efficiently and efficaciously.

Thank you. [.. 3.12]

60 . . "" . , , . . , . . . . [3.30 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, this Budget, on the whole, is meant for development other than in the Northern part of this country. I want a clear picture as to whether "Mahinda Chintana" is going to be the "Wonder of Asia" without the North or with the North? The entire Budget submitted to us reveals certain points which are indications. Last year, the budget allocation for the Provincial Councils was Rs.132 billion. It is the same this time. But, one could note that the Capital Expenditure last year was Rs. 31 billion and this year it is only Rs.14 billion. Everyone is aware that without Capital Expenditure, you cannot make revenues. More concentration is given towards certain other items than creating revenue.

Why I said that the North part of Sri Lanka is completely ignored is because there is a special allocation of Rs. 60 billion given to other districts but nothing to the North. In fact, the whole world is aware that the Northern part of Sri Lanka is a war-torn area and it needs special attention by the Government. All sectors should be equal. That is education, health et cetera. But instead, the allocation to the defence is very high. You cannot compare it with the other allocations. I could see that the Ministry of Economic Development has not even got one third of it.

The allocation for defence is Rs. 289 billion. Last year, it was Rs. 230 billion. Every year, it has been increasing. For which Ministry is allocation needed today? I do not understand the logic behind it. How are we going to become, in six years time, the Wonder of Asia? It is something that is not possible, I could see it.

Other than that, from the allocations submitted, I could see that Rs. 5,000 million would be allocated to three universities, one of which is the Jaffna University. I should say at this point, that especially in the case of the Jaffna University, today, people have lost faith in its Vice

803 804

2012 12

-Chancellor, Ms. Vasanthy Arasaratnam, a highly-intellectual personality. She is depending on the Minister, Hon.Douglas Devananda, and all advices are sought from him. In fact, the Deans or the entire Senate is against her. Not only that, she makes visits to the Ministers office and he summons the officials of the top educational institution there. I want the Hon. Minister of Higher Education to make note of it. In one incident, all the Deans were summoned and questioned. It was a very ugly scene. The entire Council is politicized and decisions are taken according to the Ministers wish. So, I do not know to what extent that big allocation would be used in a fruitful manner. Therefore, the Hon. Minister of Higher Education must make note of it and rectify this as quickly as possible.

The other point I wish to make here is, when they allocate Rs. 130 billion for the provincial councils, it is not clear, proportionately, how much is going to be allocated for the North because the Governor is also working according to the Ministers wishes. I am going to give more information at the Committee Stage Discussion, not at this point.

Out of the 335 Pradeshiya Sabhas in Sri Lanka, only 12 Municipal Councils get an income of Rs. 100 million. But, at this point, the Jaffna Municipal Council maybe the only Council which has a budget deficit. If you take its cadre, they have an excess. Four hundred people have been employed and they are supporters of the EPDP. They have even drawn the fixed deposits in the banks to pay the salaries.

They have not finalized it yet. The workers of the labour category and various other workers mainly do all types of jobs for the political party as well as the officers and the Mayor, and in their houses. So, this has to be noted. They have got temporary staff and are paying -

( ) (The Hon. Silvastrie Alantin) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Silvastrie Alantin) . . ,

. , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Silvastrie Alantin) , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I do not think he has understood what I said. What I say is, the Hon. Minister is intruding into all affairs. That is what I mean. He must understand that. I have not accused him directly.

Sir, they are paying almost Rs. 8 million for the temporary staff. Therefore, last time, the budget of the Jaffna Municipal Council was in deficit. It is also not transparent, I must mention. In fact, the North is virtually under the control, with the blessings of the Government, I suppose the Minister.

The other thing we have got to take note of is that nearly 3,000 people who were rehabilitated were given jobs by the armed forces in Mullaitivu. It is almost five weeks now, but they have not paid anything to them. The question arises as to why a civil work force of almost 3,000 people should work under an army. Also, a question arises whether all the rehabilitated people are going to be in this position. This practice makes the people highly worried and the process of reconciliation is going far beyond what is expected. I think you have to develop better approaches to achieve the reconciliation expected by the LLRC.

Now, apart from that, the President stated in his Budget Speech, - this also has to be made clear to us, - ...system is necessary to make devolution more meaningful to our people. Sixty years have gone and does it mean that no meaningful solution has been found up to now? I want to know what happened to the Hon. (Prof.) Vitaranas Report; there are so many other reports also. How can you make everyone a fool? It is not fair. The President further stated in his Budget Speech: Devolution should not be a political reform that will lead us to separation but instead it should be one that unifies all of us. Of course, if you devolve power and you recognize the minorities as equal citizens of yours, then reconciliation is very easy.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare)Hon. Member, there were times when the TNA said that the Thirteenth Amendment should be thrown into the dustbin. I have the paper-cutting with me. Your Parliamentary Group Leader said, "Thirteenth Amendment should be thrown into the dustbin". Even then, we said, No, Thirteenth Amendment must be there.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Why did they say so? ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Because you were scared of the LTTE. The LTTE was holding the guns onto your heads and saying, Throw that into the dustbin. That is the truth.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) No. They said so because the expected devolution was not there. Therefore, we want more devolution. That is why the bilateral talks -

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Today, you are saying that you want the Thirteenth. But, at that time you said that you do not want the Thirteenth because the LTTE was holding their guns onto your heads. When you said, Throw the Thirteenth Amendment into the dustbin, we said, No, we want the Thirteenth Amendment. I have the paper-cutting with me.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Okay. In that case, forget about the Thirteenth. Why do you want to abolish it and go for another one? You can come out with your devolution package.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Nobody wants to abolish it. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) What about the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka?

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Now they are saying, Throw the Thirteenth into the dustbin. Those days you said, Throw the Thirteenth into the dustbin. Whether you say it or somebody else says it, nobody can throw it into the dustbin so easily now.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, the TNA can join the Parliamentary Select Committee and discuss what you want to - we have discussed this for over one and a half years - and decide from there.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to decide whether you want to continue with this debate or continue to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Even the Hon. Member in the Chair agrees with what I said.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, I want to continue with my speech. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. According to the Standing Orders, if an Hon. Member is on his feet, we can get permission from him and then interrupt him.

( ) (The Presiding Member) If he concedes, yes. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) He conceded, Sir. It is not proper for you to say, Do not concede.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I just reminded him that it is his time. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, I will continue with my speech. Since this topic has cropped up, I have to say something in return.

The bloodshed of the Tamils and their sustained struggles made the Indian Government pressurize the Sri Lankan Government to bring in the Thirteenth Amendment in the hope that it would, to some extent, fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the Tamils whose struggle was and is for their fundamental rights to be restored to them. The repudiation of the Banda-Chelva Pact and the unceremonial repudiation of Dudley-Chelva Pact brought home to the Tamils a message that Sinhala Leaders were not and are not inclined to consider and implement the proposal of an actual devolution of power.

The Thirteenth Amendment was brought with the support, the blessings and on the instigation of the Central Government of India. Now, the senior Ministers of the Sri Lankan Government and the Defence Secretary speak about the repeal, nay the withdrawal of the Thirteenth Amendment which does not promise the Tamils but offers only some solutions to the perpetuated problem for which an armed struggle was launched and several thousands of lives and properties of the Tamils were wantonly destroyed. Now, Tamil Nation stands denuded of their rights while the reckless destruction of lives and properties bear no fruit save successive disappointments, despair and despondency of what the future of the Tamil nation would be.

History has it on record that it was India which was behind the Tamil youth and that India was behind the total destruction of the armed struggle now. When the Ministers belonging to the Sri Lankan Government, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka and others speak of the immediate withdrawal of the Thirteenth Amendment, the Indian Government maintains a discreet silence over this issue. Such a silence makes the Tamils have the hunch that it is India which is behind this move also. It is a suspicion which nobody can claim unfair or unreasonable because the Tamils have an excruciating experience of what India did and continues to do. They are determined to thwart their struggle for our rights as we are the protagonists of our own cause, which is the restoration of our rights that are cunningly denied to us.

We do feel that we have the right to ask the Central Government of India to disabuse our minds of the suspicion that we have by doing things in an honest manner without playing the dual role of speaking of a solution to the ethnic issue while patting on the shoulders of those in power in Sri Lanka to carry on what they have decided to do, whether their moves militate against the legitimate aspiration of the Tamils or not. We genuinely expect the Central Government of India to play a decisive role in a bid to find an amicable and enduring solution to the most vexed ethnic issue without any further dilly-dallying in the process.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, I would like to ask you whether you are expressing the official view of the Party as far as the Indian Government is concerned, because they have gone and met the Indian leaders and come back? Are you voicing their sentiments?

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. But, Hon. Member, if you like you can reply.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Today, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and the Hon. Champika Ranawaka resort to legal action to get the Thirteenth Amendment annulled in the same manner they dismantled the amalgamations. The North-East merger was dismantled by the former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva. I take this opportunity to say, it is in the hands of the Government to extend their magnanimity towards us to make us trust that the reconciliation process could continue. Instead, Government Ministers like the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and the Hon. Champika Ranawaka, we could see everyday that the newspapers carry what they say. It is appearing even in todays newspapers. The people are disturbed. The Tamil people think that they will never get anything.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who told you? . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) It is in the newspapers - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, I do not want to say like the Hon. Sumanthiran,] that there is card pack or something like that. But, I am telling the facts.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is exactly the position. That is why this problem cannot be solved because there is a fundamental division in the Tamil National Alliance - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please do not disturb. He has got only one more minute.

809 810

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Please let me speak. I am not accusing you - [Interruption.] This Hon. Member always disturbs and takes the other Member's time. He does that not only to me but to everybody.

Finally, I appeal to all the Hon. Members of the Government to go forward towards finding avenues for a proper solution and bring reconciliation.

Thank you.
