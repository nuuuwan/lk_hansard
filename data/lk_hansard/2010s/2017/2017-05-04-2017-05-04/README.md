asked the Minister of Post, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs:

(a) Is he aware that -

(i) there are 3,410 sub-post offices islandwide belonging to the Department of Posts; (ii) finding buildings to house sub-post offices has to be done by Sub-Postmasters themselves;

(iii) only a sum of Rs. 250 is paid to a Sub-Postmaster as the monthly rental to run a sub-post office;

(iv) most Sub-Postmasters have to pay a large part of their salary as the monthly rental since buildings cannot be obtained at such a lower monthly rental;

(v) employees of sub-post offices work bearing many hardships since the buildings rented for sub-post offices do not even have (sanitary facilities) toilets; and

(v) there are sub-post offices at which the aged, retired officers who come there to get their pension do not have enough space even to stand rather than to sit, while waiting?

(b) Will he inform this House -

(i) whether steps will be taken to construct buildings for sub-post offices taking the aforesaid situation into consideration so that both employees and the public will be provided with adequate facilities; and

(ii) whether action will be taken to pay a sufficient amount for the monthly rental instead of the current monthly rental of Rs.

: : COMPANIES ACT AND THE SOCIETIES ORDINANCE: REGULATIONS [12.03 p.m] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move,

That the Regulations made by the Minister of Industry and Commerce under Section 527 of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 read with Section 477 of the said Act and Regulations made under Section 19 of the Societies Ordinance (Chapter 123) No. 16 of 1891 read with the Societies Ordinance (Amendment) Act, No.11 of 2005 relating to the Companies (Fees) and Societies (Fees) and published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1990/12 of 25th October, 2016 which were presented on 24.01.2017, be approved. (Cabinet approval signified.)

Sir, the fee changes proposed by the Department of the Registrar of Companies are a follow-up step to fulfil the Proposals made in the Budget 2016. This Department is one of the most important institutions in the development of Sri Lankas private sector and entrepreneurship and therefore, it is critical for the reform vision of the Unity Government.

Sir, I am pleased to say that in 2016, the Departments income increased by a huge 182 per cent - to Rs. 1.78 billion from Rs. 632 million in 2015. Also in 2016, 8,289 new companies were registered in Sri Lanka, a 7 per cent increase from 7,762 in 2015. Registration of foreign companies in Sri Lanka also increased by 17 per cent - to 41 in 2016. Even new registrations of associations under Section 34 increased by 140 per cent - to 367 in 2016.

Also, to upgrade company registrations in Sri Lanka with modern technology, KPMG was selected as the software developer under the eROC Project. The Department is now open even on weekends. Every Saturday and Sunday, from 9.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m., the Department provides selected services.

Sir, the Proposal made in Section 419 of the 2016 Budget Speech was to review fees and charges made by different government entities every three years by all the Chief Accounting Officers and Accounting Officers including Revenue Accounting Officers in the public sector entities.

Fees for amendments to the constitutions of societies has been increased from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500. Fees for issuing certified copies of a society has been increased from Rs. 200 to Rs. 500, and fees for a file search of a society has been increased from Rs. 100 to Rs. 200.

We have not increased fees for re-registration of any existing company other than an overseas company. We have not increased the fee to file an annual return of a society. We have also not increased the Rs. 100,000 that is required to be credited to a bank to defray the expenses of an off-shore company for the purpose of its office in Sri Lanka. Considering the fact that there is a need to promote entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, we have reduced an important fee that is widely used in our business sector.

Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that as part of changes in fees, we have reduced the fee of registration of a Private Limited Company under Form 1, by as much as Rs. 11,000. In that we have reduced this fee from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 4,000 to develop entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka. All fee changes are effective from 1st January, 2017.

I am also pleased to inform the House that as a result of these amendments qualified Accountants can become Company Secretaries. Therefore, as a result of these amendments from 20th December, 2016 the CMA qualified Sri Lankans will become eligible to be appointed as a Company Secretaries as well.

Now, I shall explain the proposed changes in detail:

1. Fees for Societies

Implementation and regulation authority of the Societies Ordinance is vested with the Registrar of Societies and Registrar General of Companies that shall be the ex-officio of the Registrar of Societies.

Fees for Societies had been imposed by the Gazette Notices No. 10703 dated 13.09.1954 under the provisions of Section 19 of the Societies Ordinance No. 16 of 1891 (Chapter 123) and it was amended by the Societies Ordinance (Amendment) Act No. 11 of 2005.

These fees amendment Regulations have been made by the Minister of Industry and Commerce by using Extraordinary Gazette Notice No. 1847/02 dated 27.01.2014 under Section 19 of the Societies Ordinance No. 16 of 1891 (Chapter 123). As per paragraph 419 of the Budget Proposals of 2016, government fees should be concluded and action should be taken to amend it in every 03 years. Therefore, these Fees Amendment Regulations have been made by the Minister of Industry and Commerce by using Extraordinary Gazette Notice No. 1990/12 dated 25.10.2016 under Section 19 of the Societies Ordinance No. 16 of 1891 (Chapter 123.)

2. Fees Regulations for renewal and registration of Auditors

Fees Regulations for the renewal and registration of Auditors had been imposed under Sections 157(5), 477 and 527 of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007. Actually, the implementation and regulation authority of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 is vested with the Registrar General of Companies.

3. Introducing a new qualification to be registered as Company Secretaries

The Companies (Secretaries) Regulations had been imposed by the Extraordinary Gazette Notification

No. 471/6, dated 14th September 1987, which was made under the provisions of Section 448 along with Section 176 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 and the present Section 527 of the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 is in force in this regard. The qualifications to be registered as Company Secretaries were not amended and not considered as a new qualification for past years. The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka requested to consider their qualifications to be registered as Company Secretaries under the said Gazette Notice. Advisory Commission on Company Law reviewed the said request and agreed to accept the said qualifications to be registered as Company Secretaries. ( ) (The Hon.

Sir, I quote:

And democracy requires compromise, even when you are 100 per cent right. This is hard to explain sometimes. You can be completely right, and you still are going to have to engage folks who disagree with you. If you think that the only way forward is to be as uncompromising as possible, you will feel good about yourself, you will enjoy a certain moral purity, but you are not going to get what you want. And if you do not get what you want long enough, you will eventually think the whole system is rigged. And that will lead to more cynicism, and less participation, and a downward spiral of more injustice and more anger and more despair.

. , 100 . , " " . ? Even if you are 100 per cent right, democracy requires compromise. "Compromise" ? translators . , "compromise" . "Daily FT" SAITM , "compromise" translation . In the Sinhala language, there is no single word for "compromise". When a language lacks a word, it begs the question why. Is it that the people who speak Sinhala see no need for compromise? . .
