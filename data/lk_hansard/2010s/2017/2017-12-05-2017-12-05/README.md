. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Yes, Sir. The issue of Indian fishermen is still being continued. They are fishing almost Rs. 500 billion worth fish every year from our sea, and not allowing our fishermen to do their job properly. We have passed a law in this regard, but it is not implemented yet. Why is that?

[1.24p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset let me thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development.

Most of my speech - what I am going to deliver now - is a repetition of my speech which I delivered at the last Budget. As far as the Northern fishermens problems are concerned, the progress is very slow. We have got 20,900 fishing families which is almost 10.3 per cent of our population in Jaffna. In 1983, one third of the fisheries catches were reported from the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.

Anyway, I will speak in Tamil because the Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development is not here to answer me.

[1.40p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, domestic hydrocarbon represents a zero-cost resource as opposed to LNG and

2855 2856

[ 1 ]

2017 15

coal. In the case of LNG, we must pay the cost of gas, the cost of production, transport, storage and regasification and for coal, we must pay the cost at the mine, transport, storage and disposal. Our own resources come free, but need to be produced, which itself has a cost. But, in time, after the capital expenditure has been recovered and only the operational expenditure applies, the cost to consumer declines sharply. In addition, our own resources shield us from external market shocks. As such, exploration for, and production of our own hydrocarbon reserves should be the absolute endgame for Sri Lanka when it comes to energy security.

, 1 - resources- 1

The Cairn gas discoveries in 2011 prove the hydrocarbon potential of the Mannar Basin, and all that remains to attract investment in its development. Due to the initial need for expertise and funds, it is best for us to partner with international companies of repute in order to share the risk and the reward. 1 This requires complete alignment of Government policy along with all the other requirements for good quality FDI such as transparency, fair regulations, speed of action et cetera. Currently, we are trying to put the cart before the horse by allowing the new Petroleum Bill to be lying in the Attorney-Generals Department for the last five years.

, Attorney-General's Department 1 The National Gas Policy without political leadership is still languishing in draft form. National Gas Policy 1 , Parliamentary Budget Office 1 If we reverse this strategy, companies will automatically come. , 1 If we leave things as they are, they will never come. 1

Currently, Mannar Basin reserves have been very conservatively estimated at over 9 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of natural gas, and a few billion barrels of crude oil. Yes, a few billion barrels of crude oil. Of this, 2 TCF of gas was actually discovered by Cairn, and still awaits monetization, and 2 TCF of gas is enough to fuel 1 GW of power generation for 23 years. So, this is certainly something to prioritize. , 1

Sri Lanka should focus on energy planning based on renewable or indigenous energy. This is not only for economic reasons but also for the management of

environment and climate. However, there is no apparent planning for the transport sector other than by way of ad hoc projects, and in power generation, there is no indication that the Governments green policies have even been considered. 1 , 1 1

There is almost zero-industrial energy consumption in Sri Lanka due to the high cost of power, which leaves much of our raw materials like quartz, ilmenite, and phosphate to be exported for value addition overseas, and former dominant industries like cement, steel and ceramics are now almost dormant. 1 , 7 .. 1 , 'Dilmah' 'Mezawattee' market 1

Recently, several major international oil and gas companies have made efforts to establish a presence in Sri Lanka, in most cases by taking a significant risk. However, these have been repulsed by unrealistically stringent due diligence which questions Sri Lankas maturity in conducting global business, and creates doubt as to whether we actually know what we want. , 1 , 1 This stems from lack of confidence due to dearth of experience in the sector, and the decision to govern by committee. As you know, non-technical committees cannot and will not take decisions unless they are guided by professionals who explain things in a manner that they can comprehend. Is this happening?

1 So, what needs to be done? Sri Lanka needs to take proper ownership of the sector, energize the bureaucracy that is holding back essential milestones such as the new Petroleum Bill and Gas Policy and institute a Central Administrative Authority such as the Mahaweli Authority. - - 1 7 . , , , 1 This Authority should be staffed with professionals recruited from the industry, not politically placed and empowered while holding it accountable at the same time. Nothing will happen by accident. 1 1 , 1 7 ) , 1

, , 1 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization -FAO-, 14.6 per cent of the world's fish

2857 2858

stock is caught in the Indian Ocean Region which is around 36 million barrels per day. As an island nation, Sri Lanka is blessed with a coastline of over 200 nautical miles. It is imperative for Sri Lanka to declare breeding grounds for fishing. If we continue to catch fish indiscriminately, it will result in rapid depletion of resources. Therefore, it is important to implement a Quota Management System - QMS-. This will allocate an annual quota for fishermen to catch and trade fish. 1

, 1 Aquaculture could be benefited as well. In Philippines, export of seaweed is significant. Vietnam exports fresh salmon and lobster bred in farms. Sri Lanka could profit by research into aquaculture. Research is very important. The National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency - NARA 1- should be given more funding and their research findings should be made available to the public. 1

The Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation has tremendous potential in providing infrastructure and should support the backbone of the fisheries industry which are our harbours. Sri Lanka was the fifth largest exporter of tuna. This could change as we have the best three varieties of tuna namely, bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack. It is a shame that Sri Lanka imports sea fish cans. 1 1

It is vital that we protect our fisheries resource by safeguarding our corals, by not permitting bottom-trawling and other illegal practices. Illegal, unauthorized and unreported fisheries need to be prohibited. , dynamite fishing 1 1

The fisheries sector could improve the tourism industry as well.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have five minutes.

[4.51p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak since both the Ministries now under discussion are closely connected with my Electorate. The Hon. Minister of Power and Renewable Energy was speaking about the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant and the problems related to it. I am proud to say that it adds 900 megawatts of power to the national grid.

About three years ago, we had a big problem with dust, black ash and white ash. The people in the vicinity of the Coal Power Plant were suffering. This was going on for years and years. Thankfully, once the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister took over, we had long discussions and finally, six months ago, we formed a committee to arrest this problem. The measures taken have been 50 per cent successful. The wind barrier has not been started yet, but the Hon. Minister was able to get the machines needed to reduce the formation of dust. I request the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister, both of whom are very active and they come to our area once in two to three months, let us expedite the balance work so that this problem will be solved once and for all. I am sure that both of you will help us. I am also in that committee and once a month, together with the GA, we meet. As the wind pattern changes by April or May, we must be able to finish that project by that time so that we would not have this problem. As you know, there are 17,000 acres of farmland and the crops get spoilt. Sometimes the farmers are unable to cultivate. Therefore, I request you to complete what we have started and hopefully, we will be able to finish it by next March.

I must also thank the Hon. Minister for giving a solar power plant to the Thalawila Church. It is very successful. Since the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant in our area generates 900 megawatts, I hope you will give more help to other religious places in our area also - temples, churches and mosques.

I am sure that you remember that we went to the Muhaththuvaram village - both the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister came - and started a solar power project. Thereafter, I took you by boat across the lagoon. You were very helpful in giving that area a high tension line and the people there got electricity. There are some other villages surrounding Muhaththuvaram where hotels are coming up. You had visited the area and you have plans to extend the high tension line. I think it would be better if you could do that quickly since hotels are coming up in that area and if we have electricity, it would be useful for everybody.

Then, I have one other small problem. The Coal Power Plant is in Norochcholai. But, I am sorry to say that unfortunately - this is not your mistake, Hon. Minister - there are only a very few people from Puttalam working there. We proudly say that the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is in Puttalam, but there are so many

2913 2914

people in that area without employment. Recently also, you took in some new employees. Therefore, Hon. Minister, please be good enough to recruit people from Puttalam, at least, as minor employees so that I can face them. When they say, " 1 1 , I have to defend you as well take the side of my voters.

I am sorry, Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, I have no time to speak on the Votes of your Ministry. I must also thank you, Hon. Minister, because, whatever some people say, you have been doing a good job and I hope you will continue it in the future too.

Thank you very much.
