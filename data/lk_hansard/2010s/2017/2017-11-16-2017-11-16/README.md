Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, with regard to the Question under Standing Order No.23(2) asked by Hon. Douglas Devananda on 20th June, 2017, I like to inform that the Answer will be given as per the report of the Chief Secretary of the Northern Province.

The Pali Aru starts from Puliyankulam and flows in a north-westly course across Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and Mannar Districts and reaches the Palk Bay. The river collects the spilling water from minor tanks and feed the Vavunikulam major tank in Mullaitivu and thereafter reaches the sea. The river section from Moonrumurippu to Kalvilan area comes under Mullaitivu Districts purview.

After resettlement in 2010, small encroachments were found on both banks of the river downstream of Vavunikulam tank which is coming under Barathinagar of Mallavi area and these encroachments were immediately stopped by the Office of the Irrigation Engineer, Vavunikulam Division.

After that, during the regular field inspection on 9th May, 2017 some encroachments have been identified by the officers of Irrigation Engineer's Office. I table* Schedule I and picture 01 and 02 show illegal encroachments of river banks.

Since there is no proper land marking for the reservation, it is difficult for the Irrigation Engineer's Office to stop these kinds of illegal activities. Reservations have not been properly maintained by the Department during the prolonged war situation.

Anyhow according to the Central Irrigation Departments circular No. 08/2014 (Assets Management)

1091 1092

[U ( , ]

* m . * &"$  . * Placed in the Library.

2017 `5+ 16

Clause 2.5, now the Irrigation Engineer's Office has temporarily marked the reservation in that illegal land encroached area and I table * picture 03 and 04 in Schedule 1.

After making temporary land marks, Irrigation Engineer's Office has arranged a discussion with the illegal encroachers through farmers organization of the relevant area to get released the encroached land from illegal encroachers. The illegal encroachers agreed in writing to release the encroached lands.

To stop encroachment, it is better to arrange the reservation marking permanently of the tank and river according to Survey Department Regulations and Clause 8 of Government land law of 1947, chapter under Reservation.

Since the authority to stop deforestation comes under the purview of Forest Department they are taking action on it. , # . (  B 2) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) . ., M)$X * '  *'"$, .* .-7 6O5 " " ')$, . . 7 7 " 7*', )$", " )7 ) &' /"".  */ !7 ."$. , !  O5 ' &'" '"". ".

Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I want to commence my speech by congratulating the Finance Minister, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera who has presented his first Budget at a time when the countrys economy is in much difficulty. The Hon. Minister is an old, sincere Friend who has always been very progressive in his views on many crucial issues, particularly on the resolution of the National Question. Various Proposals made by him in this Budget are aimed at ameliorating the living conditions of segments of society deeply affected as a result of the

1099 1100

[U ,ZV > "S ]

2017 `5+ 16

Conflict, facilitating reconciliation and infusing hope in the lives of such people and help them towards resumption of normal life. It could be that much more needs to be done but, it must be acknowledged that there is a reasonably good beginning and that while whatever can be done under the current Budget Proposals should be implemented by the relevant ministries as early as possible. Much more, in fact very much more, needs to be done to which also attention must be paid as we go along.

A countrys economy is dependent on a number of factors. Our country and our people have been endowed by nature with many advantages. We are strategically located in the Indian Ocean Region. We can exploit our location to our economic advantage; we have vast opportunities in this area to which we need to pay much attention. To achieve all this, our economy needs to be healthy domestically.

We inherited a healthy economy when we achieved Independence. We were envied by other countries. We have frittered away those advantages. If a country is plagued with diseases which we bring upon ourselves, a countrys economy cannot be healthy. We all know the diseases that have afflicted our country : lack of unity, disharmony caused by inequality, injustice, discrimination and exclusion have been our main ailments. Legitimate political aspirations and demands for equality, inclusion, democratic empowerment were met with violence against unarmed civilians. Political commitments were not honoured, the rule of law was not enforced and these harmful developments resulted in counter violence and eventually an armed conflict of unexpected and unprecedented proportions which lasted several decades. We have spent very heavily on fighting a war that could have been well avoided if commitments made to democratic Tamil leaders were honoured and if there was reasonable political accommodation of legitimate Tamil aspirations on the indisputable basis that Sri Lanka is a multilingual, multi-ethnic pluralist society. The recognition of that reality was paramount for there to be national harmony and peace.

Expenditure on Defence continues to be our main commitment, both during the War and even several years after the War has come to an end. All this has had a very adverse impact on the Economy. In more recent years we have become a country in chronic debt. Egocentric policies and projects have been pursued irrespective of other considerations. We need massive investment. Without endangering our countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity, our doors and windows need to be opened to massive Foreign Direct Investment. Domestic investment should be encouraged to the maximum. We need to build a strong export-oriented economy. We have ample opportunities to achieve this objective.

We have vast nearby markets that we can avail ourselves of, if we can get our act together. I might mention, Sir, at this point of time that there seems to be a view in this country that foreign direct investment and even local investment is to a large extent being impeded by some corrupt persons who are demanding consideration to be able to award such opportunities to

people interested in undertaking such projects. I think, it will be sad if that is the truth and I think the Government has a responsibility by the country to ensure that such corrupt activities do not become a hindrance to investment that brings about development in the country and raises the living standards of our people. We appear to have substantial international support. We should not linger, we should make decisions early and implement them. The Government should do what needs to be done.

We need to look after our people who are engaged in self-employment in every sphere - whether it be agriculture, fisheries, livestock development, small and medium scale industries or whatever. They constitute the bulk of our people. We cannot ignore them. We need to look after the poorer segments of our society. They need to be helped. For our efforts to succeed we need harmony, reconciliation, peace and stability in our country.

We are currently engaged in framing a new Constitution. Success in framing a new Constitution is a pre-requisite to successful economic progress. If we are able to frame a new Constitution and bring about stability, permanent peace and harmony amongst our people, the potential for economic development would be immense. That achievement in itself would receive such favourable recognition both domestically and internationally so as to infuse vast economic development and benefits for our people; the prospects otherwise could be dismal. It is unfortunate that we are hearing discordant voices in regard to the framing of a new Constitution and that these voices are emanating from persons who should know better. Since this is fundamental to the future of this country, particularly our economy you will permit me, Mr. Speaker, to deal with this issue somewhat explicitly. I do so because I think that the people of this country need to be educated on all aspects of this issue, both past and present. This is also fundamental in the interests of this country.

The position being taken by our former President, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa both in Parliament and in the country, promotes disharmony amongst the people of this country. If he is against power being devolved, he should frankly say that power should only be exercised from Colombo as he sought to do under the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Such arrangements can perhaps be more beneficial to individuals in power, but it is certainly not beneficial to all the people in this country, who would participate more directly in the exercise of power, if power is devolved. Mr. Rajapaksa makes out that there are efforts to divide the country. I say categorically, Sir, that is absolutely false. The Proposals clearly state that the country will be undivided and indivisible. We have consistently, publicly stated this position. He should not, on a false basis, once again seek to divide the people of this country. That is not what we expect from a senior political leader. Such conduct, I state, is unbecoming of a senior political leader, particularly when the current President and the Prime Minister without in any way compromising on the future of Sri Lanka as an undivided, indivisible country are endeavouring to unite all the people in this country for the benefit of the countrys future.

+85,

It will be necessary, Sir, in the course of my speech, to refer to a few matters pertaining to the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and what he had to say when he was in power and when he endeavoured to resolve this problem. He addressed the inaugural Meeting of the All Party Representative Committee called the APRC and the Multi-Ethnic Experts Committee on 11th July, 2006. It will be relevant to see what President Mahinda Rajapaksa had to say when he addressed that joint meeting of the Multi-Ethnic Experts Committee and the APRC.

I will read just a few sentences, Sir, to indicate what his thinking was at that point of time. He said, I quote:

Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka.

That is what we are trying to do now. He further said, I quote:

People in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time. In addition, it is axiomatic that devolution also needs to address issues relating to identity as well as security and socio-economic advancement without over-reliance on the Centre.

He went on to say, Sir, I quote:

Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution -"

He further went on saying, I quote:

Given the ground situation, given the background to the conflict, it therefore behoves on particularly the majority community to be proactive in striving for peace and there must be a demonstration of a well-stretched hand of accommodation.

This is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, Sir, when he addressed the APRC and the Multi-Ethnic Experts Committee. I want to ask him very respectfully whether currently we are engaged in any process that is in anyway different. We all are yet concerned about finding a solution that is reasonable to all the people in this country within the framework of an undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka. When Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa made this speech, nobody said he was dividing the country. What is being done now is what he wanted to do.

The next matter I want to refer to, Sir, is the Joint Statement made by President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General of the UN. The Secretary-General of the UN came to Sri Lanka just after the end of the war on the 23rd of May, 2009. The Joint statement reads as follows. It states, I quote:

President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General agreed that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socio-economic development."

Finding a political solution was fundamental to ensuring socio-economic development.

It further states, I quote:

President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

He was interested in doing that in the interest of ensuring further economic development of the country for the benefit of the people of the country. What is the difference between what is now being done and what President Mahinda Rajapaksa endeavoured to do in 2009 when he made the Joint Statement with the Secretary-General of the UN?

Sir, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksas brother, Mr. Basil Rajapaksa, at that point of time, a powerful Minister, went to India in October, 2008. He had discussions with the Indian leaders and at the end of those discussions with the Indian leaders, there was a statement issued. It states, I quote:

Both sides discussed the need to move towards a peacefully negotiated political settlement in the island including the North. Both sides agreed that terrorism should be countered with resolve. The Indian side called for implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and greater devolution of powers to the provinces. Mr. Basil Rajapaksa emphasized that the President of Sri Lanka and his Government were firmly committed to a political process that would lead to a sustainable solution.

That is what the all-powerful Basil Rajapaksa said when he went to India in 2008, before the war came to an end.

Prof. G.L. Peiris, the then Minister of External Affairs, went to India, Sir, between 15th and 17th of May, 2011. Having had discussions with leaders there, there was a statement made. It states, I quote:

Both sides agreed that the end of armed conflict in Sri Lanka created a historic opportunity to address all outstanding issues in a spirit of understanding and mutual accommodation imbued with political vision to work towards genuine national reconciliation.

In this context, the External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties.

A devolution package building upon the 13th Amendment would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation.

This is what Prof. G.L. Peiris, the External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka said when he went to India in 2011, after the war had come to an end.

The Foreign Minister of India was in Sri Lanka from 16th to 19th of January, 2012. He had discussions with the Government, with the President and with the Prime Minister. This is what he said, Sir, when he concluded those discussions with the President and the Prime Minister. He made this statement in the presence of Prof. G.L. Peiris, the External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka. What the Foreign Minister of India said was, I quote:

The Government of Sri Lanka has on many occasions conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based upon the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution and building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers.

1103 1104

[U Q5 5,, ]

2017 `5+ 16

We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process. We believe that continuation of the dialogue between the Government and the TNA would pave the way for a political settlement including under the rubric of the Parliamentary Select Committee.

So, this was the situation that prevailed at that point of time.

When President Mahinda Rajapaksa was in power, when President Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a Joint Statement with the Secretary-General of the UN, when Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksas External Affairs Minister went to India and when the Foreign Minister of India came to Sri Lanka, there were statements made in the presence of one another. Maximum devolution, meaningful devolution of power, is what they wanted to concede. What is being done now by the present Government through the process of the Constitutional Assembly and the Steering Committee and Subcommittees is to do the same within the framework of a united, undivided country.

Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa who is now present in this House, Sir, as President also appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission comprising of many distinguished people in this country, from all communities mostly from the Sinhalese community. What did they have to say? I am quoting, Sir, from Paragraph 8.222 of the LLRC Report. They said, I quote:

All parties should recognize that the real issue of sharing power and participating in Government is the empowerment of the people and making the political leaders accountable to the people. This applies to Sri Lanka as a whole and includes the needs of citizens of all communities, Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and others. The effective functioning of the democratic system which fulfils these needs, together with a consensual framework of devolution will, by virtue of attributes and institutions intrinsic to it, also provide the answer to the grievances of minorities.

I also want to quote, Sir, Paragraph 8.225 of the LLRC Report which said, I quote:

The Commission wishes to underline the critical importance of making visible progress on the devolution issue, in order to ensure the success of any process of lasting and sustainable reconciliation. The Commission therefore recommends that the present opportunity be utilized to launch in good faith an effort to develop a consensus on devolution, building on what exists - both, for maximum possible devolution to the periphery especially at the grass roots level, as well as power sharing at the centre. This consensus should be one that will enable peoples participation in governance decisions affecting them and avoid costly and unnecessary duplication of political, bureaucratic and other institutional structures that hamper efficient, cost effective and transparent governance.

These were the recommendations of the LLRC. Why did you not implement them? You were the President. You appointed the LLRC comprising of very distinguished people of this country and why did you not implement the recommendations of the LLRC? In fact, if you had recommended the implementation of the LLRC, all that happened in Geneva and the UN Human Rights Council, would not have taken place. It was your failure to implement the recommendations of the LLRC that resulted in the Geneva process being started.

LLRC went on to make some other relevant observations, Sir, which I think, I should refer to and place on record. I refer to Paragraph 8.303 of the LLRC

Report and this is what it said. I quote:

The process of reconciliation requires a full acknowledgement of the tragedy of the conflict and a collective act of contrition by the political leaders and civil society, of both Sinhala and Tamil communities. The conflict could have been avoided had the southern political leaders of the two main political parties acted in the national interest and forged a consensus between them to offer an acceptable solution to the Tamil people.

The LLRC pointed out that the reasons for the continuance of the conflict was the inability of the Southern leaders to come to a consensus in regard to a political settlement relating to the Tamil people. LLRC went on to blame the Tamil political leadership too. I will not refer to that. It is not relevant in this context. But they also attacked and blamed Tamil political leadership for not having quite cooperated in the matter of evolving a political solution. But the fact of the matter was that they pointed out that the main reason for the non-evolution of a political settlement was the lack of capacity on the part of the two main political parties to arrive at a reasonable consensus.

Eventually, Sir, I refer to paragraph 8.306 where the Commission wanted its recommendations implemented. I quote:

"The Commission strongly feels that if these recommendations are not expeditiously implemented, the all-important effort towards reconciliation and lasting peace may not be achieved and the country will continue to face an uncertain future."

That is what the Commission said that if you do not implement the recommendations, the country will face an uncertain future. Why were the Commissions recommendations not implemented? Why did President Mahinda Rajapaksa fail to implement the recommendations of the LLRC?

I want to refer to President Mahinda Rajapaksas election manifesto when he contested the election in 2015. I quote what he said in the manifesto,

We have been battered for 36 years by the 1978 Constitution which was thrust upon our people and country, without an appropriate debate or discussion. We must also collectively acknowledge that our Constitution is now further distorted due to the various amendments over the years, some of which are not consistent with others. Therefore, instead of amending the Constitution further with piece-meal changes, I will take action to formulate a new Constitution that reflects the peoples ideas, aspirations and wishes within a period of one year.

This is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in the election manifesto that he will frame a new Constitution. He further said, Sir, I quote,

I will first submit the Draft Constitution which will consist of the proposals of these groups,-

He wanted certain groups appointed, experts and so on.

-for the Parliaments approval in accordance with the Constitution. Thereafter, I will present the Draft Constitution to a referendum seeking the approval of the people.

1105 1106

+85,

Nobody is now endevouring to do anything else. We are trying to frame a Constitution with a Steering Committee, Subcommittees, experts, public representations received. The whole matter is being considered at the Constitutional Assembly where things have been debated and it must be approved by Parliament by two-thirds majority and also approved by the people at a referendum. We do not want anything done behind the back of the people. So, why is President Mahinda Rajapaksa opposing what he himself proposed. When he contested the Presidential Election in 2015, he stated certain things. Why is he opposing what he himself said at that point of time?

Then, Sir, there was a Resolution in Parliament on the 09th of March, 2016. There was a Resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly. The Constitutional Assembly was to become a committee of the whole Parliament and we were to commence work on the framing of a new Constitution. That Resolution had been circulated amongst the Members of Parliament and it was adopted in Parliament on the 09th of March, 2016. I want to ask President Mahinda Rajapaksa, if you were opposed to framing of a new Constitution, why did you not come to that Session of Parliament and oppose that Resolution? Why did you not come and say the country does not need this? Why are you trying to stir communal feelings now? Why did you not oppose it at that point of time?

Now, the Local Authorities Elections are going to be held and you want to win the elections; you want to defeat the Government. Okay, that is your political activity; nobody can complain about that. But, in order to achieve that, you are trying to stir communal tension in this country by stating that through this Constitutional process, an effort is being made to divide the country. If that was your position, why did you not come to Parliament when the Resolution was adopted and oppose that Resolution? You did not do that.

I am sorry, Sir, that this is not the way to get about resolving the problems of our people. Now, Sir, we have a situation where there has been a Resolution adopted at the UN Human Rights Council in October, 2015 and that Resolution in paragraph no. 16 states, I quote:

Welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to a political settlement by taking the necessary constitutional measures, encourages the Governments efforts to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population;..

This is the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council, accepted by this country. Do you want that Resolution violated? You have given a commitment to the UN Human Rights Council that you will do certain things in regard to constitutional making, constitutional measures to ensure reconciliation and peace in Sri Lanka. We know that prior to 2015, throughout 2012, 2013 and 2014, our position in the United Nations became worse. We reached a point of time when this country could

have been subjected to economic sanctions and this country could have been in dire difficulties. That did not happen because under the new Government, there was a new direction. I want to ask you, are we not obliged to follow the commitment that we have already made to the UN Human Rights Council.

I want to, Sir, finally quote a statement made by the "Friday Forum" which is a civic body comprising of people of all communities - highly educated, highly respected persons of rectitude, people like Prof. Savithri Gunasekera and several others - and this is what they say in a statement they issued recently; the Statement issued on the 21st of August, 2017. , + (    ) (The Hon.

Sampanthan, please continue with your speech. , ;P  (   2) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) It states, I quote:

A new constitution has been mandated by the people and law makers must give it the highest priority. Any attempt to subvert this process for cheap political gain by those elected by the people, cannot and must not be tolerated. We urge the Prime Minister and members of the Steering Committee to ensure that the draft constitutional proposals are put before the Constitutional Assembly within the next three months at least, and are also made available to the public. We also urge all representatives of the people in Parliament, both in government and the opposition, to consider the proposals positively and in the best interests of all the people of this country. We acknowledge that the task of drafting a new constitution is not an easy one, given the multi-ethnic-religious constituency of the island nation. It is nonetheless imperative that the process is followed through to the end, and the voice of the people, made clear at the last two elections, be heard.

Before I conclude, Sir, I want to merely refer to certain matters which I think, are very important. I am happy President Mahinda Rajapaksa with whom I have had a very strong personal relationship over the years is present and will listen to me. I would appeal you to cooperate. We need your cooperation. You are a very senior political leader in this country. You command much respect amongst the people of this country and we will want you to be a party to the making of a new Constitution. I would appeal to you to support this endeavour.

[U Q5 5,, ]

President Mahinda Rajapaksa was in power from 2005 to 2015 which is for ten years. He was in the earlier Government of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga between 1994 and 2005. So, he was in power for almost 20 years. There was a Presidential Election and there was a Parliamentary Election in 2015. The people of this country did not elect him as the President; the people of this country did not elect him as the Prime Minister. Compared to the votes he received in 2010 at the Presidential Election and at the Parliamentary Election, the votes he received in 2015 diminished considerably, diminished seriously. The people very clearly did not want him elected as President or as Prime Minister. That was the verdict of the people. That must be respected. People have elected an SLFP President; President Maithripala Sirisena. People have elected a UNP Prime Minister; Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. What does that mean? The people want the two parties to work together for the benefit of this country. The peoples verdict is the clearest indication that the people of this country want the two parties to work together and that is what they are doing. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, you are a senior Member of the SLFP. I held your father in high esteem, the late Mr. D.A. Rajapaksa because he was one man who crossed the floor of Parliament with Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike when Mr. Bandaranaike crossed over. There were other senior leaders like A.P. Jayasuriya and several others in Parliament but they did not cross over with Mr. Bandaranaike. But, your father crossed over with Mr. Bandaranaike. Mr. Bandaranaike did not expect that. Mr. Banadranaike is supposed to have turned round, seen him coming and said, I thought that was my shadow. For that reason, from that date onwards, I held your father in the highest esteem. We would like to hold you also in the highest esteem. You must support the making of a new Constitution. I say to you, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, that is your fundamental duty; you must not fail in that duty. That is something which this country needs, unless you want this country to go back into darkness. If you want this country to emerge into light and move forwards, we must make a new Constitution for this country which unites our people, makes us all Sri Lankans, enables us to live in Sri Lanka, our country, as a united people in an undivided, indivisible, perpetually indivisible Sri Lanka. You must do that.

As I said before, Sir, if you want to capture power, capture power in some other way, we have no problem. But, do not use the Constitution as a means to come to power. That should not be done. I want to make an appeal to all SLFP Members. You all belong to a party started by Mr. Bandaranaike. We have supported your party at several elections. We have supported your Presidential candidates. In March, 1960, the Federal Party voted with the SLFP to bring down the UNP Government. We did that. When Mr. J.R. Jayewardene contested Mr. Hector Kobbekaduwa - Mr. Hector Kobbekaduwa was the opponent of Mr. J. R. Jayewardene in the 1982 Presidential Election - the people of Jaffna voted for Mr. Hector Kobbekaduwa.

, D (  ,4 1) (An Hon. Member) The UNP put his vote also in Kadugannawa. , ;P  (   2) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) So, do not think we are against you. Please do not be against us. I am appealing to the genuine SLFPers, please support the making of this Constitution. That is your fundamental duty. That is something you must do in the interest of this country. Do not let this country down. Join in the making of the Constitution. All of us must get together and work for the betterment of this country to make Sri Lanka a prosperous country, which we all would very much desire.

, U , Q , [3.38p.m.] , P (  2 ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me this opportunity. This is Hon. Mangala Samaraweeras

maiden Budget. < + - Sustainable Development - .

In this Budget, we see the Hon. Minister taking policy decisions to fix issues that has not been addressed by the previous governments. Therefore, we see this Budget not as an election budget - as you know, the next year will be a year of elections - but we seriously look at this as a development Budget. Therefore, as back benchers, as organizers and as Government MPs we are happy that such a Budget has been brought forward by the Hon. Minister of Finance.

This Budget aims to develop this country in economic and social spheres. Critics of this Budget can clearly criticize and say that it is a step towards liberalization. But, Sir, we must point out, given the circumstances of the countrys economy and the debt, this Budget aims to transform this country economically and socially. The Budget aims at getting the city as well as the village developed. Urban development is taking place; village infrastructure is taking place and self-employment is taking place.

I must especially thank the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, because this year alone, in my electorate, more than 30 kilometres of road development is taking place. I must also thank the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka for the urban development and the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake for the immense work that has been done in my district and in my electorate.

Furthermore, Sir, we see a reduction of taxes on small and mid-sized vehicles. This is actually a dream come true for the small man of owning a vehicle. Certainly, the luxury class or the large class cars have gone up in price. The reduction in taxes for hybrid and electric cars is also noteworthy.

Sir, I believe a countrys future is children. This Budget has introduced 6 per cent of the GDP for education just like last year, especially for the development works such as Langama Pasala Hondama Pasala programme. But unfortunately, in some Provincial Councils, they have spent three years allocation in one year. Therefore, in some of the schools, infrastructure development has come to a stop. But, overall, we must again classify this as a "knowledge-based, knowledge-building Budget". Development of agriculture, irrigation, transportation, plantation, information technology, estate development and housing have all been addressed in this Budget.

Sir, in terms of developing this countrys economy, this Budget has also targeted FDI investment into this country. There are shortfalls, but whatever it is, I think the Hon. Minister of Finance, given the circumstances, has done an excellent job. With regard to developing our natural resources, Rs. 4.7 billion has been allocated for the development of the fisheries industry. Shipping sector will also benefit from this Budget with the proposed liberalization, which is much needed. This Budget is in line with the Hon. Prime Ministers thinking that we should not to allow the next generation of this country to

bear the burden of these loans that have been taken by the previous government.

On the flip side, as a Member of the Committee on Public Finance, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister of Finance to really enforce the Revenue Administration Management Information System - RAMIS - which is yet to be done and also ask the Cabinet and the Government to help us in setting up of the Parliamentary Budgetary Office. Sir, the draft of this legislation has already gone to the Cabinet and we are awaiting the Cabinet approval to get this Parliamentary Budgetary Office off the ground.

In conclusion, Sir, I would say again, given the circumstances, the Hon. Minister of Finance and the State Minister has done an excellent job in preserving this countrys economy and developing it.

Mr. Speaker, when this Government came into power in January, 2015, Sri Lanka, as you know, was a country

that was desperately in need not only of political reform but economic reform as well. In fact we inherited an economy in shambles. I am not going to talk about that in detail because we have discussed that issue before.

The political crisis that gripped the country was very clear and apparent to all its citizens when the new Government of President Maithripala Sirisena came into office. The inhibition of freedoms, the environment of fear and repression was felt by everyone. What was more subtle was the economic crisis that had been brewing for many years. This economic crisis was neatly masked by glittery new infrastructure, impressive construction, and carefully manipulated macroeconomic data. In fact, even the Central Bank of Sri Lanka started to manipulate its data according to the whims and fancies of the Government of the day.

Beneath this was a structural failure of the economic model of the previous regime. Whilst post-war economic growth reached attractive statistical heights, this was driven by unsustainable fundamentals. Growth was dominated by sectors such as construction, domestic retail, the financial sector, and domestic transportation. These were all domestic market oriented sectors. Sri Lanka was once the most liberal and globally integrated economy in the region. In fact, in my Budget Speech, I talked about the golden era of our ancient forefathers when Sri Lanka was trading with the ancient Roman Empire with the Pharaohs of Egypt with imperial Rome and how Sri Lanka excelled when it dealt with the outside world. However, in recent times especially over the last decades, these reforms were rolled back and today Sri Lanka is one of the most protected economies in the region, creating this inward orientation.

Sri Lankas economy was surrounded by a wall of tariffs and para-tariffs, imposed upon the whims of narrow protectionist lobby groups that thrived in an anti-competitive environment.

In fact, some of these protectionist groups I hear are being active again in order to stop our liberalization programme. Economic inequality increased as wealth became concentrated amongst a few business cartels and corporates close to the regime. During this period, there was little or no focus on the external economy. In fact, Mr. Speaker, exports collapsed from 30 per cent of GDP in the 1990s to around 12 per cent by 2014. Foreign Direct Investments had come to a standstill and concentrated in a few sectors such as domestic services and real estate. The problem was that this construction and domestic market driven economic growth was financed primarily by expensive external commercial borrowings by the then Government. The economy was accumulating external liabilities in the form of foreign debt repayments, whilst its foreign earnings were dwindling all the time. It was like taking a US Dollar loan to build your house, while your salary was in Rupees. You would never generate dollars to repay the loan.

In many instances such as Mattala, these foreign debt funded investments generated zero returns, let alone Dollar returns. To make matters worse, during this period

Sri Lankas government revenue also collapsed amidst a plethora of exemptions, tax holidays and irresponsible fiscal management given again on the whims and fancies of the President and his sons and his brothers.

When our Government came into power, government revenue to GDP was around 11 per cent, easily the lowest in our region and amongst the lowest in the world. Sri Lankas economic structure was characterized by rising external debt, falling revenue and flat foreign exchange earnings. It was a matter of time, before this failing economic model collapsed. In fact, one of the reasons for President Mahinda Rajapaksa to call an early election was his belief that he could not continue with the economy and he wanted to get himself back on to his seat of power comfortably before all the problems started mounting. It was in this context that our Government came into power in 2015. Our first actions were to provide relief to a public that had been saddled with numerous economic burdens. We eased prices of a number of products, relaxed monetary and fiscal conditions and gave respite to a struggling populace.

Since then, we have gone about stabilizing the economy. We undertook a series of significant fiscal reforms; most recently, in September, the Inland Revenue Act. Revenue has accordingly increased from 11 per cent of GDP to 14.6 of GDP which is a remarkable achievement, and we believe with the implementation of the new Act in April, we would see the tax net widening and would be able to work towards our objective of having a 60:40 direct and indirect tax ratio. We are now on the cusp of a current account surplus in the Budget for the first time in decades. In fact, the surplus will be for the first time in 60 years. External reserves have stabilized after being decimated by the significant external debt repayments that had to be made to service the debts of the previous regime. The confidence of global markets has returned as indicated by the spike in foreign investments in debt and equity markets this year.

Macroeconomic conditions have now by and large stabilized and the economy is ready to take off once again. But, this economic take-off cannot happen in the same unsustainable manner as soon after the war. We cannot create artificial demand stimulus, and given the accumulated debt, there is limited fiscal space to engage in a public investment drive. The only avenue for sustainable growth is through private investment and the external sector. It is in this context, Mr. Speaker, that I set about the task of presenting this Budget. My task in doing so was clear. We had to set about developing an economy where growth is driven by private investment and an economy which generates foreign inflows through exports and FDI to finance our emerging external debt obligations.

This is why it is essential that we go about fast-tracking liberalization. We identified the key constraints and bottlenecks to investment, both domestic and foreign. Prime amongst these constraints include limitations in access to affordable and productive land, labour and

capital. There are vast tracts of land in the country that are tied up in completely unproductive use or are in fact, abandoned. The land legislative reforms that we propose are with a view to freeing up this unproductive or unused land for productive use for investment and for enterprise. This will in no way undermine the land rights of citizens. Today our farmers are not free to produce the crops that yield them optimal returns. We will give them the right to do so within the next year. We want these reforms to empower our farmers to have the flexibility to produce the crops that give them the best returns. In doing so, we will of course be sensitive to issues of food security, the environment and land rights as I reiterated in the Budget one week ago.

Todays labour laws dictate and restrict working hours of our women and men. They do not reflect modern working conditions including technological innovations that enable work from home or remote work. Our labour laws do not even include most contemporary jobs. So, we intend to modernize these laws to enable our men and women to have more choice in their working conditions and how they work. This will make it easier for companies to hire people and create jobs. In these labour market legislative changes, we will, in no way, undermine the rights of the worker and the dignity of labour. We will empower our workers with more freedom and more choice.

Our capital markets have miserably failed our SMEs and entrepreneurs. Today, a young entrepreneur with an exciting innovation will struggle to find a financial institution which will lend him or her money without asking for an arm and a leg in collateral. The next Google or Facebook, for example, could easily be developed in Sri Lanka, but in todays capital market, it will probably go unfunded and unnoticed.

This is why we need reform - we need to fix systems that are not working. The "Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme", which we will be introducing from the 01st of January, the SME Guarantee Fund and the new Development Bank, as proposed by the Hon. Prime Minister, will all work together to mend our dysfunctional capital markets. That is the kind of reform I intend to drive in this Budget.

Capital market liberalization does not mean unfettered opening up of markets. In the past, successive Governments' role in financial markets has been in owning and operating numerous banks and financial institutions. Most of these have failed to provide access to affordable capital for our SMEs and entrepreneurs. Therefore, the role of the Government ought to be in setting the institutions and the rules of the game whilst regulating the market to ensure competition, fairness and social equality.

The business of the Government is not in doing business. This is especially so when the Governments legacy in running SOEs is an accumulated debt of nearly Rs. 1.4 trillion. Sri Lanka must move on from the shackles of excessive State controls and return to its roots of vibrant, free enterprise.

Mr. Speaker, our history is rich with success as a nation of free enterprise. In fact, a few days ago at a Budget forum, someone asked me to describe the Budget in two words and I said, "Our Budget is about free enterprise." It is about liberalization; it is about globalization and it is about harnessing the success, which has eluded our country for so many years. In fact, our country is rich with success as a nation of free enterprise. It is only in recent years that we have retreated into an inward-looking, State-centric economy. Those who have succeeded in recent times are those who have had access to power, networks and connection. Wealth has been concentrated amongst a privileged few. In fact, what we had for nearly nine years is not an open market system, but a crony capitalist framework.

Meanwhile, todays youth await for a government job or for some form of handout to make ends meet. So, through this Budget, we aim to change that mindset by empowering all Sri Lankans to take their future into their own hands. This, I believe, will be the agenda of Enterprise Sri Lanka. We have allocated significant amounts of money in upgrading the quality of education, providing extensive market-oriented skills development schemes through the "13 Years of Education" programme and technical and vocational training institutions.

In this Budget, we have recognized those students who may not get through their Advanced Levels and may not get access to the limited places in our State universities. For the first time, a Budget is talking about the group of young people many Governments have forgotten so far. I am talking about the nearly 200,000 young people who come to the doors of the university and are turned back. In fact, these young people are turned back not because of their failures, but because the system has failed them and today, our Government want to extend a helping hand to this pool of unique talent; each person has a talent which needs to be empowered. This number of over 250,000 students per year is left with limited options due to no fault of their own, but due to the failings of our education system. The extensive reforms proposed in this Budget will equip our talented youth with skills and capabilities to thrive under Enterprise Sri Lanka. It is these youth who will, one day, form the tech-based startups and the innovative agribusiness ventures, which will drive the investment Sri Lanka certainly needs.

Sir, I am certain that this next generation of Sri Lankan entrepreneurs will not be clamouring for protection and insulation from competition like their fathers and uncles do now. They will be equipped with skills, access to knowledge and technology, and will most importantly have the self-belief and confidence to take on the world and win. The environment of a healthy, fair competition will bring out the best in us; it will drive innovation and development. Through this Budget, we want to create the platform to empower Sri Lankan business to enter global value chains and compete in global markets. Towards this end, we have proposed significant investments in encouraging the export sector. More than 20 per cent of our exports are agricultural exports and the Budget provides significant support to this sector. We need to empower our farmers to move beyond our limited domestic market and venture into

global value chains. Funds are allocated to develop tea, rubber, coconut, vegetables and fruits and we have laid a special emphasis on the fishing industry this time, especially with our "Blue Economy" programme. Allocations are also set aside to support research and development in the agricultural sector along with tariff removals for imports of high-tech agri-equipment to enable more value-added agri-exports.

In spite of the numerous measures proposed, Sir, to enhance their exports, these are unlikely to yield results unless we address the structural problems in Sri Lankas economy. After the economic liberalization of 1977 and the second generation reforms in the early 1990s, successive Governments have systematically rolled back these reforms.

We have become one of the most protectionist economies in the region with an array of tariffs and para-tariffs. In addition to driving up the cost of living and the cost of doing business, these tariffs have resulted in creating an anti-export bias and diverting economic resources to the non-tradable sector. It is no wonder that our exports have collapsed in the last 20 years.

It is in this context that we have embarked on a systematic trade liberalization agenda in this Budget. As we announced last week, we are removing immediately 1,200 para-tariffs as a starting point. This is a major reform and we intend to conclude it within the next three years. However, rest assured that these reforms are not being initiated in a vacuum. The Government has identified a core negative list of products, including sensitive agricultural and rural industry products, which will not be subject to the same liberalization programme. We are bringing in legislation to prevent unfair trading practices and the robust anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard laws are in the final stages of enactment. Together with strengthened consumer protection laws, Sri Lanka will have the legislative framework to address any negative fallout from the trade liberalization efforts.

Sir, it is clear that whilst we go about removing the fetters to free enterprise, we are conscious of the need to protect the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. Even in a free market, it is more important that we have a strong, social safety net for the poor and the disadvantaged. We will not provide open-ended protection to entrenched vested interests at the cost of consumer welfare and economic dynamism. That is why I am deeply disappointed to note that some among Sri Lankas established capitalist class are afraid of competition, in spite of being in business for decades and in some cases, for over a century. I personally believe that competition breeds success and excellence and now, Sri Lanka should really get ready to compete with the rest of the world. That is why I said in this House a few days ago that Sri Lanka can no longer be a "nanny State", protecting its capitalist entrepreneurs. They lack the same self-belief and confidence of Sri Lankas emerging entrepreneurs who, quite rightly, believe that they can take on the world and win, especially in their own backyard. Whilst some among us dwell in a mistaken ideology, quoting Ho Chi Minh or someone else, these very countries are embracing reform and modernization. Sir, I thought this is very useful for our Parliament too.

Given the inherited structural flaws in an economy dominated by domestic market activity, financed by external debt, with collapsing Government revenue and exports; there is no choice but to embark on a path of economic liberalization to unleash investment, entrepreneurship and exports which our Government has done, which we have been doing for two years and in the coming three years we will be doing it with greater vigour in order to achieve our objectives.

In this Budget we have proposed a remedy to a failed economic model. This Budget will empower Sri Lankas SMEs and entrepreneurs; it will inculcate our youth with knowledge, skills and technology to take on the world and win.
