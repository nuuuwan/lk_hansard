.. ( , , ) ( .. - , ,

) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Sir, I table* the Answer.

* : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) Muhamalai village located at Pachchilaipalli Divisional Secretary's Division in the Killinochchi District is consisted of Allippallai, Ittavil, Vembodukerny and Kilaly Grama Niladhari Divisions.

(ii) Land extent of this area is 25.86 km2 and the population is 13,585 persons consisting of 4,193 families (Male - 6,594, Female - 6,591).

(iii) As per the pre-survey carried out relevant to demining, this area was identified as a hazardous area and the following organizations are continuing demining. Details of that area are submitted herewith via a map as Annex 01*. Additionally, the countries indicated at the front of each organization are providing the necessary financial assistance for the said function. Details of the area where demining is carried out and staff deployed for demining by these institutions are submitted herewith as Annex 02*.

(b) (i) A Strategic Plan has been prepared and approved by now regarding the complete removal of mine impact from Sri Lanka including the area and as per the set time frame, Sri Lanka is expected to be mine free by the end of the year 2020.

As all the other organizations except Sri Lanka Army are functioning based on the assistance received by foreign governments for the process of demining, the set time frame of achieving the target may vary depend on the amount of funds received in future and also based on climatic impacts and unexpected situations.

(ii) 3,960 families consisting of 12,749 persons have resettled in this area and only 233 families consisting of 826 persons are yet to be resettled. As well, only 3.24 km2 of this area remains to resettle persons as 22.62 sq km is already cleared from mine. A majority of the remaining area could release to resettle persons by the end of the year 2018 and the balance of the land could be free from mine threat by the end of year 2020.

[10.38a.m.] .. ( , , ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman, unfortunately, all what the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake stated regarding the progress of my Ministry are false statements. I want to clarify that immediately because he made very serious allegations.

Under the purview of my Ministry, in the year 2016, 11,253 houses, 7,598 sanitation units and 1,293 common wells were constructed. Then, 2,216 houses partially damaged during the war were renovated. In addition to that, 187 internal roads have been constructed, 27 hospitals have been repaired, 66 school buildings have been renovated and 8,902 water connections were provided in the year 2016. Under the provisions of livelihood assistance, 12,757 families were provided with equipment worth Rs. 100,000 each. All this support was given to conflict-affected areas, to resettled areas last year and it has resulted in a reduction in the poverty level in the districts of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. So, I think the Hon. Member of Parliament should be more precise in what he states in this august Assembly without making wrong and false statements.

In 2017, Rs. 9,000 million has been allocated for the Accelerate Resettlement Programme of our Ministry. We have constructed 5,811 houses, 2,553 sanitation units and 348 common wells are being constructed with 905 partially damaged houses being renovated. Additionally, 53 internal roads, 29 hospitals and 264 school buildings are being renovated. Then, 3,313 water connections have been provided while 7,287 families were provided with equipment assistance for their livelihood in agriculture, fishing, livestock, the palmyrah industry and in self-employment. Also, 8,975 domestic electricity connections are being provided with. The construction of the Manipay and Chankanai Market Complexes in two stages and four rice mills have been started this year and 181 minor tanks are being renovated in the Northern Province. All these were done in the resettled areas which got completely destroyed due to the war.

After the fire accident that occurred in the Kilinochchi Market, Rs. 97 million was allocated to the Kilinochchi District to establish a sophisticated fire brigade. Rs. 80 million was allocated for the construction of the Kilinochchi Market and the UDA was assigned to design that with a request to revise the plan according to the demand. Meanwhile, for all the districts from which urgent requests came for housing, allocation have been made to construct houses. The Ministry has also taken necessary action to provide artificial limbs and equipment to support the conflict-affected disabled people.

I wish to state that the allocations made in 2016 and 2017 have been successfully utilized up to 92 to 95 per

cent. So, please do not give false information to this august Assembly, Hon. Member. I am not interested in how you got that documentation, but you have made false statements to this country.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Member of Parliament, at least, you should have the courtesy to check that with my Ministry and see what we have done.

[11.25 a.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Deputy Chairman, the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation is one of the key Ministries that come under His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. His Excellency the President serves as the Minister in charge of that Ministry.

The Ministry believes that a harmonious society is fundamental to a prosperous nation. Therefore, multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities and religious and cultural diversities are recognized as a source of strength, in which mutual respect and dignity of all the people to achieve durable peace and prosperity prevails.

The Vision of this Ministry is to respect and value diversity, promote integration, facilitate reconciliation and ensure non-recurrence of conflict to build a pluralistic and inclusive society. The Ministry has formulated a National Policy on Reconciliation, which is translated into a Reconciliation Action Plan with a clearly defined roadmap for the multi-ethnic and multi-religious groups to live with dignity and self-respect.

Under the directive of His Excellency the President, the Ministry has declared a National Integration and Reconciliation Week, which falls from 08th to 14th January every year. The Ministry has also established District Reconciliation Committees - DRCs - based on a Cabinet decision initiated by His Excellency the President to resolve religious and ethnic tensions at local level. These DRCs comprise of interreligious leaders, whom, we believe, could bring about a change to achieve unity, harmony, brotherhood and sustainable peace.

As a Ministry responsible for national reconciliation, action has been taken to implement an Integration-friendly Schools Programme, an Integration and Reconciliation-friendly Sunday Religious Schools

Programme, an Integration-friendly Media Programme, Reconciliation-focused Youth Programmes and a Reconciliation-focused Economic Empowerment Project. The Ministry has also initiated a 50,000 brick-and-mortar type housing programme and road development projects in all the conflict-affected districts in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The Reconciliation-focused Economic Empowerment Project aims at supporting the community in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces with livelihood and economic empowerment and it will contribute to establish a strong business linkage between the North and the South. The Ministry also undertakes healing programmes covering livelihood support, rainwater harvesting, anchorage facilities, economic and social infrastructure with a view to heal the trauma and the wounds of the conflict.

The programmes and projects undertaken by the Ministry are as follows: one, the "National Integration and Reconciliation Week". The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation declared the week from 08th to 14th January as the "National Integration and Reconciliation Week", which was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and the dates are aligned with the date of assumption of Office by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena. The main aim of the "National Integration and Reconciliation Week" is to promote unity, peace, brotherhood and harmony among different ethnic, religious, cultural and regional communities while respecting and recognizing the richness of the diversity. The concept is based on unity in diversity. Under the "National Integration and Reconciliation Week", many reconciliation and integration programmes were conducted island-wide among school children, youth, university students, media personnel, government officials, interreligious leaders, foreign missions, the private sector and Chamber of Commerce.

During that week, the following special activities were also undertaken: one is the development of the Declaration on National Integration and Reconciliation.

The Declaration on National Integration and Reconciliation was developed in close consultation with all stakeholders and the Declaration was institutionalized in schools, Sunday religious schools, among government officials in departments and Ministries, in the private sector and in the Chamber of Commerce.

Then, promotion of national integration and reconciliation among school children. That programme includes speeches on national integration and reconciliation by students of different ethnicities and religions, emphasizing its importance in school assemblies and classrooms and the Declaration is read in a collective manner to inculcate unity in diversity.

Also awareness creation and sensitization. Awareness creation and sensitization programmes on reconciliation were carried out in all three languages through print, electronic and social media among school children, Sunday religious school teachers, government officials in departments and Ministries, employees in the private sector and the general public.

Then, the land in Urani coastal area in Jaffna, which was under the custody of the Sri Lanka Navy, has been released for fishing activities by His Excellency the President to mark the National Integration and Reconciliation Week. A commemoration stamp was also released to mark the week by him. Leaders pledged commitment to national integration and reconciliation and a booklet on the Declaration was issued in all three languages. The declaration of the "National Integration and Reconciliation Week" symbolizes and marks the importance of integration by the Government and serves to mobilize support from all stakeholders.

Then, Sir, the Integration-friendly Schools Programme is another programme carried out by the Ministry. The Integration-friendly Schools Programme places at the heart of learning experience and makes reconciliation and peace-building an integral part of the school life. The integration-friendly schools are founded on the principles of respecting diversities in ethnic, religious and cultural non-discrimination, equality, human rights and ban on hate speech, ensuring inclusiveness in schools. School teachers and children become powerful catalysts for change. The teachers and children, under this programme, are imparted with Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices - KAP - to empower them as champions, change agents, messengers and advocates of peace.

The integration-friendly schools concept also focuses on bringing children with different ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds into a single school to get a better understanding, relationship, tolerance, forgiveness and empathy to ensure respecting diversity. The multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural approach enables students to be broader in their perspective as against the mono-cultural type schools.

The objective of this programme is to institutionalize virtues, values and ethnic and comparative religious studies in the religious curriculum and make the children holistic personalities, as better leaders of tomorrow. The children will also have a strong influence on national integration and reconciliation, not only within the school, but also at the family and community levels.

Circulars were issued to all schools island-wide to observe the Declaration by school teachers and children under this programme and the Ministry participated to witness the programme in a sample of seven schools. The sample of seven schools covered 7,700 children and 545 school teachers.

The third programme carried out by the Ministry is, the Integration-friendly Universities and Youth Corps. University students and youth can play a significant role as peace messengers and peace advocates and can influence the community. The objective of this programme is to provide the reconciliation and integration concepts and principles to the university students and the youth to enable them to provide leadership for peace, integration and reconciliation through knowledge, attitude and practice. It is necessary to observe the Declaration on National Integration and Reconciliation in all universities and youth corps and to actively involve them in peace

walks, human rights initiatives and sensitize and propagate peace through cultural programmes covering poems, music, sports, drama, cartoons, art competitions and peace photography. A programme on human rights is being organized on International Human Rights Day, which fall on 10th December by actively involving the youth in advocacy for human rights, peace and reconciliation. A programme for youth is being organized in collaboration with the Youth Council in Maharagama and it incorporates a special parliamentary debate and discussion on peace-building in the Youth Parliament. This programme is scheduled to be held in December, 2017.

4. Then, another programme carried out by our Ministry is the Integration-friendly Media Programme. Globally, it is acknowledged that media has an important and strategic role to play in national integration, reconciliation and peace-building. Media can contribute to conflict transformation, on one hand and also contribute to the escalation of conflict on the other. Therefore, it is generally understood that media can either make or break peace. The international experiences revealed that in Kenya, the media spread hate messages, which created atrocities and led to genocide in the early 1990s. Therefore, media influences to shape perceptions, conditions and behaviour and impacts on the minds, attitudes and emotions of the readers and the community at large. Fair and non-discriminatory reporting is a prime responsibility of the media. Ethnic, religious and cultural diversities should be respected and the media should not, at any point of time, attempt to disturb such enabling conditions for their own commercial and economic survival. However, journalists are truth tellers, but the media has a moral responsibility to promote reconciliation. Peace journalism is where editors and reporters make choices about what to report and how to report - to create opportunities to value non-violent responses to conflict. The professionalism of journalists gets eroded due to personal emotions, interests, prejudices, audience preferences, lack of ethics, being overly market-oriented or economic-oriented, being influenced by negativism or by elite groups, one-sidedness, socially irresponsiveness and failure to look at with a diverse perspective. Special programmes were conducted by the Ministry to give a wider perspective of the social responsibilities of the social media in peace-building, reconciliation and giving support to maintain a violence and tension-free atmosphere.

Seven district programmes were conducted for journalists on Peace Journalism, covering about 473 journalists and they discussed the role of media in conflict transformation, reconciliation and peace-building. A national level sensitization should be given to the top-level media personnel on disciplined reporting with social responsibility, especially on reconciliation, integration and peace-building. Also, action will be taken to institutionalize peace journalism and reconciliation-friendly media into the media ethics by working closely with organizations such as the Sri Lanka Press Council and the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media. Special media programmes with peace messages will be disseminated through the media to create a culture for

3253 3254

integration, reconciliation, human rights, inclusiveness, equity, tolerance, fairness and peace-building. Journalists actively contribute to build an enabling culture for peace by publishing articles related to peace-building, and national integration will be acknowledged and recognized.

The fifth programme of the Ministry is to institutionalize national integration and reconciliation in Sunday Religious School teachings. His Excellency the President, in his capacity as the Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, launched a programme in February, 2017 in Colombo to institutionalize the national integration and reconciliation concepts and principles into the Sunday Religious School teachings covering daham pasal for Buddhism, Araneri schools for Hinduism, Ahadiya schools, Muslim religious schools and Christian schools with a view to create a united, reconciled, conflict-free, harmonious society by respecting and valuing diversity in religion, language and ethnicity, thereby promoting an inclusive society. Under this programme, the principles such as kindness, love, compassion, forgiveness, equity, brotherhood, tolerance, human rights and mutual respect will be imparted through the religious teachings to form the children as better citizens of tomorrow. Religions are the precious guidelines of human civilization and all individuals should practise the teachings of peace, unity and patience, as taught in respective religions.

The programme activities included the following: imparting National Integration and Reconciliation - NIR - to Sunday school teachers of all faith with Knowledge, Attitude and Practice - KAP - to serve as peace messengers and peace advocates. The National Integration and Reconciliation - NIR Declaration is to be observed by all religious teachers and it should be put into operation in their respective Sunday Religious Schools.

Ethics, virtues and values such as love, kindness, compassion, equity, tolerance, respecting diversity and human rights should be taught in the religious school teachings. Religious fanaticism, language extremism, regional extremism and hate speech should be eliminated to inculcate peace among school children and teachers. We issue knowledge-based products on integration and reconciliation to school teachers to equip them with knowledge on reconciliation and peace-building, which, in turn, will be shared with Sunday School students. Five Reconciliation-friendly Sunday Religious School Programmes were conducted in this regard in Colombo, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Kurunegala, covering 4,854 Sunday School Teachers.

The sixth programme is on District Reconciliation Committees - DRCs. Although the conflict ended in May, 2009, there were isolated incidences of ethnic, religious and regional extremism at a very small-scale fuelled by very few extreme elements. In the recent past, few incidences of religious extremism, racism and communalism were reported in pockets of some localities.

These incidences, if unarrested, may escalate on a widespread basis creating interethnic and interreligious tensions. Therefore, it is important to resolve these issues through a proper mechanism to ensure national integration, reconciliation, co-existence and sustainable peace. The inadequate institutional mechanisms to address the issues were considered a serious concern. The tension had been manifested in a spate of attacks on religious places.

Therefore, the DRCs were established by His Excellency the President based on a Cabinet decision to resolve the said issues at the local level through conflict resolution, mediation and amicable settlement. A DRC comprises of the District Secretary as the Convener, interreligious leaders of all faith, the Superintendent of Police, retired judges and school principals and other relevant officials as Observers. The objectives of the DRC are as follows: one, study the background and causes of religious and ethnic tensions in the locality and formulate suitable strategy and approach to mediate the problem. Two, examine the tension created due to attacks on religious places and provide a rapid response to resolve conflicts. Three, examine the root causes for the religious and ethnic conflicts and invite all responsible parties including the perpetrators and victims and mediate through a conflict resolution approach. Four, review tensions and incidences in a more balanced perspective and negotiate between the groups to resolve the problems amicably. Five, maintain, with the support of the District Office, a database of incidences of tension, attacks on religious places and communal disturbances. Six, identify prominent layers and dynamics of the local context and undertake field inspections where necessary and mediate, negotiate and resolve conflict through appropriate methods and approaches and seven, address verbal attacks or hate speeches, which create problems and conflicts.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. State Minister, you have two more minutes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Then, I will table* the rest of my speech, because I need another 10 to 15 minutes to conclude my speech.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Okay, you can table it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Before I conclude my speech, Sir, let me thank especially His Excellency the President for his strategic guidance, the Hon. Prime Minister for his advice and support, Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Chairperson, Office for National Unity and Reconciliation for her advice and the Northern and Eastern Provinces' Development Committee for their close guidance and support.

I also wish to thank all the District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries for working with us closely to implement the programmes efficiently and effectively. Further, I thank the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Reconciliation and North and East Reconstruction, the Members of Parliament and the members of the Provincial Council for their continuous interaction. I wish to thank the Secretary, Mr. V. Sivagnanasothy, and all the other officials of the Ministry too for working to deliver results.

In addition to that, I would like to tell my good Friend, the Hon. Member who raised some issues related to the salterns and roads in his electorate, that we will consider taking them up next year, Insha Allah, and do our best. Also, I would like to reply to the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake that it is not fair to say that we have spent only 9 per cent of the money allocated for the Ministry, but we have spent almost 75 per cent of it. A special allocation of Rs. 1,500 million was made, out of which 75 per cent has been spent and the balance 25 per cent will also be spent before the end of the year.

Thank you. : :: Rest of the speech tabled:

The DRCs have been established and operational in all 25 districts to resolve ethnic and religious tensions and promote National Integration and Reconciliation at district level. The mechanism is currently in operation in all 25 districts. However, the DRC Members will be provided additional training and orientation on conflict resolution, mediation and amicable settlements. When incidence of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tensions are reported in the districts, the DRC get involved in solving the problems and issues. Any unresolved issues will be reported back to the National Reconciliation Committee (NRC) for suitable intervention. Cabinet Memorandum also states that this mechanism should not in any way disturb the law and order arrangements and individual rights in the country.

7. Reconciliation-focused Economic Empowerment Project (REEP)

The 30-year old conflict has resulted in large number of internally displaced families, refugee returnees and war-affected woman-headed families, missing persons families and rehabilitated ex-combatants who have been identified as highly vulnerable population in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The proportion of population below the poverty line is said to be 6.9 per cent whereas the conflict affected regions or district have very high incidence of poverty. For example, in Mullaitivu, poverty was reported as 28.8 per cent in 2016-2017. Therefore, there is an economic disparity which needs to be addressed on an urgent basis. The Government of Sri Lanka has given very high priority for reducing disparities and to address poverty and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In this context, the reconciliation-focused economic empowerment project aims to target the highly vulnerable population and provide them livelihood and income generation interventions to uplift their social and economic conditions. In this context, the proposed project aims to support the conflict-affected vulnerable families with livelihood support covering agricultural and fisheries development, small enterprise development, micro and small industries development, livestock development and home gardening and plantation development programmes. The project will provide technology training, working capital support, machineries and facilities, market facilitation, infrastructure access to credit and other related inputs to support sustainable family income of the conflict-affected vulnerable families. The production in the Northern and Eastern Provinces will be supplied to the Southern part of the country resulting in a strong business linkage between North and South. These business and economic linkages are expected to benefit the national integration, social cohesion and reconciliation.

A Cabinet Memorandum was submitted by His Excellency the President as Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation and has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers to initiate and implement this programme.

The Economic Empowerment Projects supported 11,596 families with livelihood assistance such as cattle and goat rearing, fish boat and equipment, palmyrah products, small-scale industry, agriculture, pottery and other self-employment assistance and other socio-economic infrastructure facilities for the conflict-affected vulnerable families. The Ministry has taken action in collaboration with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to conduct banking clinics in order to facilitate access to credit for beneficiaries.

The details of the REEP implementation progress on a district-wise basis with physical progress is given below:

8. Healing Mind Dignified life Initiatives.

Under the transitional justice initiatives, truth seeking, healing, reparation and non-recurrence have been identified as major components. The conflict has affected many people and resulted in trauma and other socio-physiological effects. It is important to ensure that the tragedies of the past does not ever recur again despite winning the war. We have yet to win the peace and in order to do so, it is essential that we win the hearts of the people in the war-affected areas.

In this regard, the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation has initiated many programmes to support healing, reparation and non-recurrence.

Support to construct school buildings, purchase laboratory equipment, establish computer lab, provided support to renovate school buildings and provided bicycles to school children for the conflicted-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces.

Renovation of Dialysis Unit and provision of two dialysis plants, upgrading the Special Baby Care Unit, supported to construct Cancer Home, provided ICU equipment for hospitals and provided urgent necessary equipment for Maternity Unit for the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces.

9. Establishment of Separate Dedicated TV Channel for Reconciliation.

A special dedicated reconciliation TV channel is being established to promote reconciliation and integration to foster and improve nation-wide peace and harmony among different ethnicity in Sri Lanka in partnership with Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. This channel will help to bring the voices of the voiceless and empower them to strengthen reconciliation.

In this regard, the Nethra Channel will be established as a separate transmitting network for reconciliation TV channel. Special reconciliation programmes are developed to bring integration and reconciliation.

10. Northern and Eastern Provinces Development Committee

This Ministry very closely works with the Northern and Eastern Provinces Development Committee which coordinates the development works in the Northern and Eastern Districts. The Committee works under the Prime Ministers purview to address development issues in the Northern and Eastern areas. The Ministry works closely with the Committee and addresses the development needs and priorities, bottlenecks, issues including projects and programmes. The Ministry also supports all Northern and Eastern Districts in the formulation of district development plans by introducing results-based management and Sustainable Development Goals initiatives.

11. Construction of 50,000 Brick and Mortar type permanent Housing

Programme for conflict-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces.

Government has initiated action to construct Reconciliation-focused Brick and Mortar type 50,000 housing programme in conflict-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces, focusing on displaced, war-affected refugee returnees and war-affected vulnerable groups. The programme will give priority to war-affected women-headed families, families with missing persons, disabled families and low-income vulnerable groups and socially reintegrated ex-combatants. The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to implement the programme in 2018 with foreign and local financing arrangements under contractor-driven modality. This is one of the land marks and largest intervention of the Government to the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern families as part of healing, reparation and non-recurrence programme of the transitional justice initiatives. The tender process is in progress. Criteria has been developed to select the beneficiaries and Appeal Board will be in place to address complaints to ensure fair prioritization.

12. Reconciliation-focused High Priority Road Projects.

The roads were totally dilapidated and are in bad condition partly due to the war on one hand and due to lack of maintenance on the other hand. High impact priority roads, bridges and jetties have been identified through a consultative participatory approach with the peoples representatives and these priority projects have been valued over US Dollars 400 million with soft financing arrangements. Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to implement this programme based on a Cabinet Memorandum submitted by Hon. Prime Minister and the tendering process is now being initiated.

13. Lessons Learning and Experience sharing Programmes in

Reconciliation.

The Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Reconciliation and North and East Reconstruction in collaboration with the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation and Westminster Foundation has organized lessons learning and experience sharing programme.

16. Reconciliation-focused Economic and Social Infrastructure Projects

The reconciliation-focused high priority economic and social infrastructure projects are aimed at upgrading, developing, improving and modernizing the infrastructure facilities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

The 30-year long conflict has affected the economic and social infrastructure in the Northern and Eastern Provinces especially in the areas of irrigation, agriculture, water supply and sanitation, health and education. After the war, the social and economic infrastructure has drastically deteriorated making the region geographically disadvantaged leading to poor accessibility, low connectivity and weak integration resulting in low income, high unemployment and increased incidence of poverty.

A Cabinet Memorandum on the proposed project which was submitted by His Excellency the President as Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. This project is aimed at addressing the social and economic infrastructure gaps in conflict-affected lagging regions in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The project proposal includes irrigation, water supply and sanitation and health covering laboratories, equipment, care facilities, expansion of healthcare facilities and coverage, education including IT Centre, water supply and sanitation, laboratories, classroom and facilities, sport facilities, vocational training facilities, pre-schools, fisheries infrastructure including anchorages, jetties, ferry services and agriculture especially market access, technology, access roads and rural roads and salt water extrusion bunds, social welfare such as market, elders home and other reconciliation related interventions in relation to social and economic infrastructure.

The tentative list of projects are attached in Annex I.

The project is envisaged to benefit directly about 72,000 beneficiaries and indirectly 60,000 beneficiaries in the North and 20,000 direct beneficiaries and 20,000 indirect beneficiaries in the Eastern Province on an annual basis.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) So, how long will it take? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) We have got the land now. It is somewhere close to Dompe.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) So, it will take another five to six years. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, it is only a question of building it. Once we start building it, probably it will take another two-and-a-half years time.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) By that time, your Government would not be in power, Sir.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Whichever the Government would be - ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Then, we can open it. Thank you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) The other thing is, we have also given a lot concession to the inmates. We are conducting yoga classes. We are having, as you said, correction centres. We are bringing in international standards. We are bringing in all those concepts. I know the problems that we are having. You said, "do not to allow them to take cigarettes". I totally agree with you. But, they are carrying ganja. The Department of Prisons is totally infested with corruption. It has been a continuous practice and not something that started today.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Your concept is very good. , , . , '' '' .

[3.22p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Mr. Presiding Member, at the outset I want to thank you for giving me 16 minutes to speak on the subject matters pertaining to the Ministry of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development; Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs; Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages and the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation. Furthermore, Sir, I want to thank the Hon. Speaker for appointing me to the Budget Committee in which we were able to discuss in detail with the officials and the respective Ministers the subjects which are being debated today. From a personal point of view, I must say that it was a noteworthy learning experience.

Sir, if we have learnt anything from the fancy titles of these Ministries that I just recited, it is that we have too many titles, too many Ministers and too many Ministries. This has also been the case in the previous Government, and this Government's leaders too have erred in its conduct by increasing the number of Ministries in order to massage egos of politicians.

In a letter I wrote to the Prime Minister regarding the new Constitution, I suggested that the new Constitution should spell out the number of Ministries subject-wise so that there will be continuity. I was also pleased when the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva in his speech in the Constitutional Assembly expressed the same sentiments. What happens, Sir, when we have too many Ministries is, it leads to inefficiencies. As it is the case in this instance, it can be seen in other subject areas too. Take for example, the case of not having a ministry of public utilities and instead having separate ministries for water, electricity, drainage and so forth. How many times, have we seen a newly-built road being deconstructed by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board because there is lack of coordination? In this instance too, I fear that too many Ministries will lead to inefficiencies. It can be seen as most of these Ministries have underutilized their allocations. So, I suggest that without waiting for the new Constitution, let us put this right. Let us bring in a legislation dividing Ministries subject-wise, so that they will not be changed by future governments.

Now, Sir, as time does not permit me to speak on all the subjects under discussion today, I will limit myself mainly to speak on the subject of National Integration and Reconciliation. Before that, I want to speak a word or two about the Ministry of Hill Country New Villages,

3329 3330

Infrastructure and Community Development. I want to congratulate the Minister in his efforts to uplift the living standards of the plantation community. I also want to remind the Minister that Plantation workers are not restricted to the hill country only, and in areas like Kegalle and Ratnapura, there are considerable numbers and their living standards are appalling. As we can all agree that the plantation workers are one of the most deprived communities in the country, I feel it is best to carry out a programme of affirmative action in order to accelerate the upliftment of their living standards.

I also want to take a minute to applaud the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, on his efforts to rehabilitate and resettle those people dispersed by the war. This is no easy task. Although the resettlement could be finished according to a given timeline, and rehabilitation could be accelerated, the scars of the war, however, will take much longer time to disappear, and no timeline can be imposed. It is also important that the Minister and the Government ensure that those who have been rehabilitated, especially the 12,000 odd former LTTE combatants, are equipped to earn a proper livelihood and they be given proper opportunities and ensure that they will not be drawn back to a life of violence or crime. Now, I also feel that the Minister is in a unique position of being able to help his community through the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement, and as his illustrious ancestors have done in the past, he too can serve the whole country through his Ministry. Perhaps, the Minister can leave a blueprint to future Tamil politicians, that if we are to truly believe in one nation then the politicians should not restrict only to matters pertaining to their community, but should engage themselves on matters common to all. I wish him well.

Sir, on the matter of reconciliation, the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation comes under the purview of His Excellency the President himself, and I believe the President has stumbled. He has erred in appointing Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga as the Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation - ONUR. Think of it. If Madam Kumaratunga cannot even reconcile with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is she the best person to have preaching us about reconciliation?

Now, I am aware that the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation has come up with a national policy on reconciliation, in which it talks of political power sharing, linguistic issues, rule of law, transitional justice and a whole lot of fancy political jargon, mainly incorporated by the NGOs, which has substance but which might not fit too well with the ground realities. So, what is the ground reality? The ground situation is that we are a deeply segregated society with historical roots that continues to divide us. We are a nation after a 30-year brutal war that continues to mistrust one another. We do not speak one anothers language. We do not intermarry. We want to promote our culture rather than a Sri Lankan identity. Mr. Presiding Member, reconciliation is a

complex problem, especially in a country like Sri Lanka which has long historical roots.

I remember a speech delivered by the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma on the same subject last year. He pointed out how historically Sinhala cinema has depicted Tamils as servants and the Tamil cinema depicts Muslims as servants or people of lesser being. We have derogatory terms for each other which we are not shy to speak out in the absence of the other. So, Mr. Presiding Member, reconciliation is a complex thing. And in order for us to work things out, we can look at how reconciliation has taken place in other countries such as South Africa, Cambodia, Rwanda, Colombia and so forth. And, we see that in most conflict-affected countries, reconciliation has not gone up to expectations, perhaps barring South Africa. But even there, we still find deep prejudice among racial lines. Compounding these issues are the external forces that are determined by the geopolitical circumstances. So, I believe we need to look at success of other countries in this regard and emulate where possible, but ours has to be a homegrown solution.

Mr. Presiding Member, we need to look at both short-term and long-term reconciliation. We can build the legal framework as a short-term solution and can stop any sort of discrimination at least legally. We see that in the United States, the derogatory word Nigger used by the Whites against the Blacks are said no more. This is not due to the legal framework, although in 2007, the New York City Council banned the "N" word, the usage of the word was stopped because America made a social rule that prohibited its usage. I think, the Hon. Member who spoke before me also talked about Hindu clergy that they have not been allocated a seat when they are travelling in the buses. But, the first seat in any bus is allocated for the clergy. If the seats are not given, it is not a question of legality, it is a question of tradition. So, I think these things have to be imposed.

We have also seen how countries like Singapore too have used social engineering for communities to interact. Singapore limits the number of ethnic minorities who can live in a neighbourhood or even in an apartment block. I am not saying we need to do the same here, but simply just like Singapore has done, we need to think of innovative ways to interact. One way could be to build a highway to Jaffna. If we build a highway, I think, we can go to Jaffna in about three hours time. Then, the whole country will become much smaller and then the communities will tend to interact. We also need to build on long-term measures such as trying to make the next generation bilingual or even for that matter trilingual citizens, who can enrich their souls by appreciating diversity.

I also think that if we can find common factors that cut across ethnic barriers, then we should exploit it. One major factor that help bridge communal barriers between Blacks and Whites in the United States was the influence of blank athletes, entertainers, actors and comedians had on the whole society as a whole.

3331 3332

[

2017 07

I think, we have all seen how television shows like "The Jeffersons" and "The Cosby Show" of the 1980s were appreciated by the white people. Athletes helped bridge the communal gaps. Similarly, the movie "Invictus" tells the story of how Nelson Mandela used glory at the Rugby World Cup to unite a nation.

Hon. Presiding Member, we also need to differentiate problems into different groups and find unique solutions to these problems. I see three types of problems that we, as a nation, will have to address. Firstly, the legal framework and the interracial community building activities need to be done. This should have both short-term and long-term objectives. Secondly, we need to address administrative issues such as the inability of a Tamil citizen to conduct or get anything done in Tamil in a Sinhala majority area or vice versa. Administrative issues such as this, I think can be solved through technological solutions. Now there is an application in most of the smartphones where languages can be converted. We need to make more use of these. Finally, we must address the issues of Tamil political aspirations keeping in mind the unitary nature of the State. Tamil aspirations have not always been reasonable, but we must admit that the Sinhala majority government's responses have not been adequate either.

Sir, we must also ensure that if we are to move forward, we need to bury the ghosts from our past. And in order to do that, we cannot keep digging old wounds which are about to heal. Whilst a Truth and Reconciliation Commission will aid people to find closure, any commission or any form of justice such as transitional justice mechanism that highlight atrocities of one side only will deepen the barriers further. Similarly, any form of justice that targets the security forces can result in more extreme views advocated and deep resentment to the other community.

It must be said that reconciliation cannot be created by creating laws only. We are a deeply segregated society and these gaps must be bridged if we are to find true reconciliation. Our historic roots have kept us separated and even within our communities, we have further managed to segregate ourselves more if not by race, then, at least by a caste system. If we are to overcome these barriers, there has to be a political will across the Floor of this House and on the direction, we should be moving in. We should have sincere efforts to bridge these differences.

There is also a section of the House who believe that reconciliation can be achieved through political power devolution. I say, Sir, let us not fool ourselves. Any devolution without reconciliation will only open wider the doors of separatism. And, I also believe that devolution should not only be between the Centre and the periphery but within the Centre too. Although we have a long way to go, I believe we too can be successful.

We only need to look at the United States for inspiration. In the United States, during the 1960s, there were restaurants in the South where people were not allowed to eat because of the colour of their skin. If you

were a black, you were not allowed to get into certain clubs, schools or universities. But we did observe that in less than 60 years, the nation somehow came to elect a black President. I do wish that in my lifetime, I too will get to see a Tamil or Muslim as the leader of this country, not because of his or her ethnicity but on the merits of what that person can do to this country as a whole. So, whilst wishing all the respective subject Ministers, I hope they find wisdom and energy to help us reconcile our differences and build a true Sri Lankan identity.

Thank you. [.. 3.35] . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Viyalanderan) , , , , , , , , .

3357 3358

[4.48p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for allocating time for me to speak on the Budget, 2018. A countys Budget is an outcome of its values and aspirations including action plans to transform its vision into reality. The people of this country have great expectations and confidence in the future of this nation. The Budget aims at creating a new economic and social order for the betterment of the country. The end of the war in May, 2009 has given a valuable opportunity to respect and honour diversity by winning the hearts of all the people of this diverse country.

The National Budget, 2018, under the theme of Blue-Green Budget, is to build our economy on an environmentally sustainable development strategy. The need of the hour is an economic, social and environmental transformation ensuring a better tomorrow for all Sri Lankans. I thank the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media for giving due consideration for post-war ethnic reconciliation by resolving issues of the people to give them new livelihoods. It is a very good Budget that touches upon youth and their training. It is an investment in the countrys future. It is the countrys first Budget that addresses key issues of this sector by allocating funds for a variety of socially relevant projects in the Northern Province.

I strongly believe that the National Government, under the united leadership of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, will continue to serve the nation with a commitment to create a better tomorrow for all Sri Lankans. This National Government has focused a lot on mending long-broken relationships and is genuinely trying to create a new nation where everyone is included.

The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation headed by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena plays a key role in this endeavour, addressing a lot of issues that were, for long, never addressed. This Ministrys scope, I believe, is very wide because reconciliation just does not happen by addressing issues, but by implementing solutions which include building infrastructure, which has been neglected for long, building livelihoods, bridging the gaps and bringing all the people back in to one Sri Lankan society, where everyone enjoys the same standard of living.

I think we have found a good way to analyze the problems by using a theory. The needs of the North can be broadly divided based on Maslows Hierarchy of Needs and then, we can start fulfilling those needs based on priority. In my opinion, true reconciliation must be based on the gap between the ground reality and the needs and wants: you find out the gaps and then start reconciling them. The gap is not just the language, but many other things. So, we are proposing a theory to understand the needs and wants, prioritize those and start solving them.

One of the key factors that I want to highlight today and bring to your attention is the urgency of reconciliation. The war ended in May, 2009 and it has been eight years since then. During this period of eight years, both this Government and the previous Government have done a significant amount of work to restore normalcy. Without mentioning the long list of deliveries, I would like to mention the fully constructed A9 Road and the resumption of the Yal Devi to connect the North and the South. I believe those two projects alone are sufficient to highlight the significant achievements, for which I want to thank and congratulate you all on behalf of the people of the North. I am proud to be a Representative of the people who are benefiting from those projects and also to be a part of both the Governments. The point I want to emphasize here is that these achievements illustrate that there had been and there is a genuine commitment on the part of the Government to resolve, reconcile and move forward. I take this message back to my Electorate and I make it a point to make the people of the North understand this because most of the messages they receive from various other political sources do not highlight the positive side of what has been done and what is being done.

As a Member of Parliament who is trying to bridge the communication gap, I decided to make this an opportunity to relay you the thoughts and sentiments of the people of Jaffna. My intention here is to bring you all up to speed on the ground realities. However, I want to emphasize a key fact here. Let us not process these issues only based on the facts and figures of the amounts invested on infrastructure, but also on human emotions and behaviours.

Let me start by bringing in a simple theory that I often use to understand the people and their requests, which I believe are specifically tied to their needs and wants.

I have found this theory to be very useful to identify the root causes and to formulate solutions. The idea of hierarchy of personal needs comes from Abraham Maslows Theory of Human Motivation, which, as I understand, states that people aim to meet their basic needs and then, they seek to meet successively higher needs in the form of a pyramid. Why that part of Maslows model is useful for my speech is to build my argument that, when the more basic needs of the people are not satisfied, people simply become dissatisfied. I believe that such dissatisfaction can come out in a society in various different shapes and forms; the higher the need, the bigger the problem.

In the case of the North, I believe the danger is high due to lack of alternative sources, in the eyes of most of the people in the North. It is a fact. I also believe that due to lack of understanding of the dynamics, our mainstream political parties have not been able to make inroads. We have solved a lot of problems, but there are more to be solved. We need to understand them based on the true needs and wants of the people and solve them. We need to understand the problems and prioritize them first, to decide where to start.

3359 3360

2017 07

Prolonged periods of dissatisfaction in a large group of people can create a perfect breeding ground for opportunists and extremism to take advantage of the situation. I believe that it is the nature of humans to always find someone else or something to blame for their problems and misfortunes. They may or may not be correct, but I propose that matters of the heart are beyond logical thinking. As Representatives of the people, we need to process these problems by analyzing millions of variables.

In this instance, the people that I am specifically referring to are the people of the North and I think it is correct for me to say that there, we still have a large group of people who are dissatisfied due to their unmet needs and wants. They being a minority, it is quite possible for them to feel that their being a minority is the reason for some of those problems. On certain issues, they may be right; on certain other issues, they may be wrong. So, I would like to propose that as Members of the Parliament, our focus should be on identifying the genuine needs and wants of the people and delivering solutions. It is our duty to close all avenues for opportunists trying to take advantage of these innocent people.

You may wonder about the connection of my proposition to the Discussion. What I want to highlight here is the gap between today's ground reality and the needs and wants of the people. So, we need to reconcile that difference and the reconciliation process must identify the elements and issues.

Moving back, the theory that we used earlier identifies the physiological needs of the people to be the most important and that they should be met first. Physiological needs include air to breath, water to drink and food to consume. Those are the basic needs. Now, let me connect that to my point. In the eyes of the affected people - it has been eight years since the end of the war - the Government has not yet solved the water problem in the Jaffna District, especially in the island areas. That is a basic need and it needs an urgent solution. Normalcy has returned to the lives of the people in Jaffna, but one of the major obstacles they face is the inability to obtain clean water. The people of Jaffna solely depend on well water to fulfill their drinking water needs. The tests on these wells show a high level of nitroxide. The coastal areas of the Jaffna Peninsula are the mostly affected areas due to this crisis. The programme on rain water harvesting developed and implemented by the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation and the Indian Government was proven successful. However, we need a permanent solution for this water crisis.

Sir, I want to speak a little bit about the problem of food as well, which is directly linked to unemployment, the low per capita income of the North compared to that of the rest of the country, the average household income and the problem of the large group of unemployed youth.

Sir, reconciliation is also about rebuilding economies. I believe that the disparity in income levels and opportunities was also a reason for the civil war. If we are to learn a lesson from the past, reviving the economies of

the North and the East to be on par with those of the other provinces is of immediate importance. On the other hand, the need for employees in many economic subsectors is on the increase, but the unemployment index gives a very low figure. More than 50 per cent of the income generation of the economy of the North relies on the fishing and the agriculture sectors. Investment in those sectors would create jobs for graduates. So, the increase of allocations to such sectors is vital at this juncture, I believe. Livelihood opportunities for disabled persons and rehabilitated youth have been lacking in the North. Therefore, I believe that a government-driven programme should be initiated for them. That will heal, mend and integrate them into the society. Again, I would like to reiterate that that would reduce the threat on the national security and the spending on defence as well.

Those industries and factories were active before the war and they were the main income generators for these families. This Government has started the saltern in Elephant Pass again successfully. The saltern is running profitably while providing employment to the local community. But, the KKS Cement Factory and the Paranthan Chemicals are still to be revived. There are a lot of cottage industries in the North, which still need a lot of focus. For example, a small shoemaking industry in the Vadari area in Vadamarachchi, which once supplied shoes to areas all over Sri Lanka including to the DSI, is now sinking due to lack of support. Therefore, those small industries in the Northern Province have to be revived with working capital and equity through the existing government-sponsored credit schemes to increase their production and to connect them with markets. The Government could provide grants to them and the introduction of a loan scheme with a low interest would facilitate them to move out of the debt trap.

Sir, the farmers in the North are really going through a lot right now; the droughts and the floods are continuously affecting their livelihoods. When the President came to Jaffna, they asked for two things: a potato subsidy and to waive off their agricultural loans due to the continuous natural disasters which destroyed their crops. Issues encountered by the farmers engaged in potato cultivation in the North were brought to the notice of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and those were solved immediately with a subsidy and they are satisfied with that intervention. The farmers who cultivate onions do not get the expected income from their crops because onions are imported in mass-scale during the harvesting season in Jaffna. This is also one of the main crops that farmers in the North cultivate, but their ultimate turnover impacts on them, incurring a loss.

Tobacco cultivation is another example. It is carried out in the islands of the Northern Province as a main crop. The cultivation is said to be discontinued in the near future due to the danger to the human health. Those island come under the dry zone, where other crops like chilies and onions would not grow. Therefore, the farmers would be rendered helpless and end up empty-handed once the tobacco cultivation is discontinued and the farmers may be considered for some payment or some alternative cash crop should be introduced to them. The

3361 3362

statistics indicate that 1,956 farmers are engaged in tobacco cultivation in 740 hectares in the North. Hence, an alternative cash crop is necessary.

Sir, once a persons physiological needs are relatively satisfied, his safety needs take precedence and dominate behaviour. Therefore, I want to connect the basic need of shelter with the problem of resettlement and the lands which are forcibly occupied. While making this point, I would like to reiterate that I am trying to bridge the communication gap and presenting you with the issues of the people to see how we can solve those.

Safe shelter is a basic need for everyone, including you and me. The 30-year war resulted in internally displaced families. I myself being an IDP, understand their pain. The private lands owned by the people have been occupied by the armed forces. There was progress made in releasing the lands to the original occupants, but some families are still living in welfare centres, with their friends, in rented homes or with relatives. The largest areas of land occupied by the forces are in Telippalai and Kopay DS Divisions. Highly populated areas like Palaly and Vasavillan are still inside the High Security Zone. President Maithripala Sirisena has directed to release the lands to the owners. Lands in the Telippalai and Kopay DS Divisions have been released in parts in the resettlement process. The present Government will enable the resettlement of displaced families and provide livelihood opportunities through agricultural activities in the Jaffna District. The release of lands to some displaced families to resettle in their original places of residence is really a milestone for the war-affected Northern Province. But still, 5,127 acres of household lands have to be released to the land owners. Seven hundred and fifty families still living in welfare centres are to be resettled. The resettled families have also to be provided with an allowance by the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs for land clearance and temporary shelter. The delay in releasing the lands in the High Security Zones to the owners was brought to the notice of Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and he has assured that the process of releasing lands will be expedited in a bid to facilitate resettlement. I believe that it is also one of the main priorities of the reconciliation process.

Immediately after solving the physiological needs, the next is the need for safety. People are still recovering from the 30-year war. After that long period with the absence of physical safety, they have a real need to feel safe in their own homes and for economic freedom. There has been a demand for a home for these resettled people so that they will not feel totally helpless.

The Budget, 2018 has taken a view on addressing peoples real issues and aims at promoting entrepreneurship among the youth and attracting tourists. There are many interesting proposals in the Budget targeting the less privileged sections in order to provide them with housing and livelihoods. Post-war reconstruction of houses and damaged or destroyed

resources have been costly for the war victims and because of that, many had to go deep into debt. Proper housing facilities for the North is our concern. Thanks to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, there is a proposal to build 50,000 new houses in the North and the East. We believe that would solve our housing needs.

The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation has been allocated a sum of Rs. 2.7 billion for the year 2018 compared to the Rs. 1.8 billion allocated for 2017. We appreciate that many programmes which directly benefit the war-affected, particularly the differently-abled women and ex-combatants, are included in the Budget.

The Office on Missing Persons, which will start functioning in January, has been allocated with a fair amount of money. A positive idea in the Budget is the identification of specific work programmes on the ex-cadres and reconciliation. The rehabilitated LTTE youth have sufficient livelihood options to extend their businesses. Ex-cadres of the militant groups are the most disadvantaged group in the North. This Budget has allocated money to give formal education to the rehabilitated ex-cadres who have adequate skills. A subsidy has to be given to encourage private enterprises to employ some former combatants and help them to get back to the society.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two minutes more. ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Okay, Sir.

The expectation of the people of our country for several decades to see a Sri Lanka free from terrorism have been realized following the end the war in 2009. I am thankful that the Budget has allocated funds to address the emotional and highly-political issue of missing persons. Although some investigations have been initiated in relation to the disappearances ten years ago, only a few of the suspects have actually been convicted. There were allegations of killing some of those who had surrendered. It should be looked into more carefully and I think the Unity Government is apt to do it. The Presidential Commission to Investigate into Complaints Regarding Missing Persons appointed to probe into the disappearances, abductions and arbitrary arrests which occurred during the war received thousands of complaints against the security forces, the LTTE, armed groups and unidentified parties, but there is no progress or results.

I believe reconciliation is about all parties forgetting the past and forgiving each other. The issue of political prisoners still prevails without solutions. These cases cannot be considered as coming under the purview of the Attorney-Generals Department alone since, up to a certain level, it has a political dimension. These

3363 3364

[

2017 07

circumstances make us address that issue politically, too. A policy decision is required to address this issue of political prisoners.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, since we are running out of time, if your speech is in written form, you can table it to be included in Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Please give me one more minute, Sir. I am going to summarize.

To summarize, reconciliation and national unity is a must to achieve our vision and to become a developed country. The Government has to continue its efforts to bring the people of all communities of our country together. We will strengthen reconciliation-focused livelihood development, economic empowerment and social infrastructure development. While focusing on the core mandate, I strongly believe that this Ministry must take the lead role in solving all the identified issues by coordinating with the other Ministries.

We are all fortunate to have His Excellency the President as the Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation. As the leader of the National Government, he is ideally placed to lead and direct us. I would like to end my speech by thanking the subject Minister, His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, the Hon. Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan and the Hon. Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, the Hon. Mano Ganesan for their achievements and also the Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, Mr. V. Sivagnanasothy for making genuine efforts to bring about this reconciliation.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

Prison reform activities are being carried out by my Ministry to meet the international standards to minimize congestion and overcrowding. The recently opened Angunakolapelessa Prison Complex has a number of modern facilities. Under the direction of the Hon. Prime Minister, the Colombo Welikada Prison Complex is going to be shifted to another premises, but our Ministry has been facing difficulties in selecting a suitable land for the relocation. However, a land was finally selected at Kandawatte. The extent of the land is 33.6 acres. The

3409 3410

Ministry has taken steps to overcome all obstacles with the consent of both organizers of the UNP and the SLFP.

Gathering and sharing of prisoners information immediately by the related Government institutions is challengeable. Hence, the Department of Prisons has developed a Prison Information Management System and action is being taken to gather biometric information with the assistance of the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure to exchange necessary information online.

Control of illegal activities within the prison is one of the biggest issues. An Intelligence Division has been established by the Department of Prisons to look into the illegal activities in the prisons. They have identified many such incidents and legal and administrative actions have already been taken. This is one of the positive signs to control the illegal activities in the prisons. So, we need to provide more support to the prison administration rather than criticizing the whole administration.

The Department of Community Based Correction was established by the Community Based Correction Act, No. 46 of 1999 to make provision for the imposition of Community Based Correction orders by courts in lieu of sentences of imprisonment.

Minor offenders are being corrected and rehabilitated by providing them with community treatment centres and vocational training through which they will be able to stay with their families in the same living environments unlike detained in correction centres. According to 2016 Report around Rs. 250,000 per head is needed to provide facilities for them. Hence, I suggest to promote the community based correction as it is cost effective than keeping them in correction centres or in prisons.

The Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority - REPPIA - has been performing numerous activities for the affected people since 1983 such as payment of compensation to damaged properties, death and injuries due to civil conflict and consequences of civil unrest. We have granted rehabilitation loans to the general public and socially reintegrated detainees. The major challenge for the prison authorities is lack of sufficient allocation from the Treasury. However, compensation is being paid on a first-come first-served basis. A sum of Rs. 3,500 million is needed to pay compensation for the suitable applicants who have sent the applications.

We have established the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation also.

Then, we have the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs. This year, we have renovated 548 temples altogether: 196 temples in the Northern Province, 173 temples in the Eastern Province and another 179 temples in other Provinces, and we have spent Rs. 92.8 million for that. As the Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran correctly said, this is not sufficient. We have got only

about Rs. 92 million for the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs and I request the Hon. Minister of Finance to consider giving us further grants to renovate the damaged temples throughout the island.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Then, shall I table this? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Okay. Thank you very much. I will table* the rest of my speech to be included in Hansard.

* : * : * Rest of the Speech tabled:

Bureau of the Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation

As an emergency need of rehabilitation of voluntary surrounded ex-combatants after ending of war, the Government has established the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation in 2009. Around 12182 ex-combatants have been rehabilitated and reintegrated with community and only seven ex-combatants are undergoing the rehabilitation programme in Poonthodam Rehabilitation Centre who have been directed by a court order.

It is in question that the rehabilitated ex-combatants have been actually accepted by community because they are facing many difficulties to get jobs and other support from community. The only permanent solution for real social integration is providing their basic needs to stay in their own with equal living standard without begging from others which help them to avoid frustration. However, livelihood programme of the Ministry has been extended for the last two years to ex-combatants too. Already 39 graduated ex-combatants have been accommodated into graduate schemes and action will be taken to accommodate another 30 graduated ex-combatants into graduate schemes.

Due to the services rendered for rehabilitation of ex-combatants, BCGR has been directed to undertake rehabilitation of the drug addicts. The enrollment of drug addicts for rehabilitation is gradually increased yearly. Therefore, sufficient infrastructure facilities are to be provided to cater them correctly in the Rehabilitation and Vocational Literacy Training Centres and needed special allocation with necessary facilities.

BCGR is unable to fulfill the needs of rehabilitated ex-combatants and drug addicts due to the organizational complication. The Ministry has obtained Cabinet approval to legalize the institution which is expected to include all the provision to support ex-combatants and drug addicts.

Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs

The Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs carry out constructive activities to serve Hindu society. Aranery education for children like Dhamma School is one of the important subjects to

generate better and honest community for future. Less than 20 per cent of children are receiving Aranery education through Sunday schools and is a current challenge for this sector. Hence, the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs makes constructive approach to promote Aranery education among children through conducting Sunday schools and competitions, publishing and issuing valuable books and promote culture. The service rendered by religious leaders for disciplined society is one of the major activities in this programme.

The thirty-year war has destroyed more than 1000 of registered temples including important and historical temples. Activities of armed groups were the cultural disaster which shall be regained by continuous and sustainable training programme, providing religious activities and rebuilding Hindu temples. These are urgent needs for mental relief and heal them for which my Ministry has taken steps and expected more allocation in the year 2018.

Activities of the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs have to be expanded to the bottom of the war-affected villages. It is functioning in rented building and the establishment of permanent building consist of Hindu museum, documentation and compendium facility shall be located in the area where Hindu people are more populated. As I said in my last Budget speech, action has been taken to acquire a land and construct permanent building for the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs which is believed to solve the need of permanent building and Hindu people believe that this will be achieved during the period of this Government.

The Ministry has established an Institute of Hindu Religious and Cultural Studies under the Hindu Cultural Fund Act No. 31 of 1985 under the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs for research and training to accomplish the needs of Hindu people. I expect to upgrade as a National Institution of Hindu Religious and Cultural Studies within the present Government to serve all Hindus in Sri Lanka.

Northsea Limited

Northsea Limited is 100 per cent Treasury owned Government fishnet manufacturing company established in 2001 under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. This company was a profitable agency. Then, Lunuwila and Weerawila factories were transferred from the Ceynor Foundation Limited with liabilities in 2011.

Current administration of this agency is trying its best to bring up the efficiency, 100 per cent operation is impossible until replacing the old machineries are completed. Although the Northsea Limited is registered under the Companies Act, it has to follow the rules and regulations issued by the Government from time to time. It creates additional financial burden and increases the production cost. Therefore, way of subsidy will retain the function of this agency.

Palmyrah Development Board

Palmyrah Development Board was established under the Coconut Development Act No. 46 of 1971 to carry out all functions in relation to palmyrah plantation. Around 100,000 underprivileged families fully depend on palymyrah for their day-to-day life. Most of the palmyrah trees were destroyed by war. As per the Finance Ministrys recommendation, population survey has to be carried out in order to replantation promotion. Population survey with GPS technology is conducted in first time in the history of the Palmyrah Development Board.

Even though toddy tapping is one of the major income generation of the poorest people in the area, the Excise Department has taken steps to amend the Excise Act without concerning my Ministry. It is unfair to this deprived community and necessary to give tax exception to palmyrah tree like kithul tree. I have already submitted a Cabinet Paper to rectify this mistake.

I proudly say that, after the new management of Palmyrah Development Board, market turnover has been increased significantly which was achieved due to the introduction of new marketing strategy.

Action has been taken for technology transfer from lab to land towards export market from cottage industries. Poor germination is the biggest challenge in palmyrah plantation and planting strategy has been changed with the involvement of security forces. Accreditation for chemical testing has been obtained for the Palmyrah Research Institute and formation of Palmyrah International Association with first Sri Lankan Chairmanship for technology transfer is another milestone of Palmyrah Development Board. Establishment of Palmyrah Training Institute is essential to disseminate the research findings through training and also provide palmyrah-based vocational education to upgrade cottage industries towards export orientation. Hence, sufficient funds have to be allocated to my Ministry without allocating to other ministries which will create unnecessary dispute among the ministries.

Rehabilitation of Thikkam distillery is one of the important activities for jobless and deprived community and it will create revenue to the Government too. It must be properly rehabilitated with new technology hence Ministry is in the process to select a competent consultant to design with new technology.

Task Force on Resettlement

The Ministry has taken stringent measures to resettle the protracted Internally Displaced Persons - IDPs - in their places of origin accommodating the recommendation of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission as a durable solution to their issues and problems.

Project Management Unit developed accelerated programme to complete the resettlement of protracted Sinhala and Muslim IDPs in the Northern Province comprehensively before the end of 2020 by providing housing for the protracted IDPs who are willing to settle in their original place of Northern Province and urgent infrastructure facilities to the resettled villages and livelihood assistance to the protracted IDPs.
