(iii) if so, the reasons for the aforesaid

situation?

(b) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Speaker, I table* the Answer. * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) This is a question that should be directed to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade.

However, the answer received from that Ministry is mentioned in Annexe 01.*

(ii) Yes.

(iii) The reason is that a formal procedure has to be followed in order to select students for Mahapola Scholarships.

That procedure is given in Annexe 02**. However, it is reported that plans have been made to implement an IT based

programme for selection of students for Mahapola Scholarships in future parallel to the IT based

programme, which is being launched for enrolment of students for universities. Accordingly, it will be able

to curtail this period further up to about 02 months.

(b) Does not arise.

Reason for Delaying Mahapola Scholarship

Payments

1. The selection of eligible students for Mahapola Scholarships is done by the University Grants Commission, and after the qualified students for university entrance have registered at Universities, the relevant applications are submitted to the University Grants Commission. Accordingly, relevant qualifications are scrutinized and the below-mentioned facts are taken into consideration.

I. Annual income of the family (Should

be less than Rs. 3 lakhs). II. The merit of the students at the Advanced Level examination. III. In the family, whether there are children studying for Advanced Level or studying at a university, and the distance to the university. It takes at least two months for finalizing the above scrutiny of qualifications and to send the finalized list of scholarship recipients to the Mahapola Trust Fund. 2. Mahapola Trust Fund again inquiries whether those scholarship recipients accept the Mahapola scholarships, and it takes

603 604

approximately 03 months period for the complete process including the time taken for printing of scholarship certificates and compilation of paying registries after having received those scholarship applications. Accordingly, from the time of commencement of academic activities of the students, approximately, 04 to 05 months have been lapsed when starting the payment of scholarship payments. Since the commencement of academic activities at universities is done at different instances within the year, students were granted the amount of 06 months instalments collectively at once, during the previous years. 3. Currently, since the selecting of students for universities has been computerized, the university admission is done promptly. Since the selection of students for Mahapola scholarships should be done, expeditiously, in parallel to that, the University Grants Commission together with the Mahapola Trust Fund has taken measures to introduce a computer software in that regard, and as its first step, it is expected to implement the pilot project through the University of Kelaniya. 4. As the selected scholarship recipients are scattered throughout the island, it is expected to prepare an awareness programme in relation to working combined with Grama Niladhari Divisions and Divisional Secretariats all over the country with regard to collection of data and computerizing them. Through that, it would be possible to get confirmed the relevant data for scrutinizing of qualifications of Mahapola scholarship recipients expeditiously by each Divisional Secretary. Through that, it is expected that it would be possible to perform the selection of students and payment of scholarship instalments within a short duration like two months after students are admitted to universities.

IMPORTS AND EXPORTS (CONTROL) ACT:

REGULATIONS [11.27a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, I move,

That the Regulations made by the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade under Section 20 read with Subsection (3) of Section 4 and Section 14 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969 amended by Acts, No. 48 of 1985 and No. 28 of 1987 relating to import license and standardization and quality control regulations 2017 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2032/10 of 15th August 2017, which were presented on 06.09.2017, be approved.

(Cabinet approval signified.)

According to the Electrical Incident Safety Report of Western Australia 2012-2013, the Fatal Injury Frequency Rate -FIFR, the probability of occurrence of death by accidental electrocution is 0.8, out of population of one million persons per year.

The above Report has stated that the deaths by accidental electrocution in Sri Lanka were 180 in 2012, eleven times the international index. To contain

617 618

2017 22

electrocutions to at most 20 persons by 2020, the Public Utilities Commission along with other agencies have been implementing various awareness programmes, campaigns and interventions. In this background, deaths by accidental electrocutions reduced to 77 by 2015, but not to an adequate level.

In this context, the Hon. Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs has submitted a Cabinet Memorandum No. MNPEA/2016/64 dated 27.07.2017 titled Implementation of a Single Standard for Plugs and Socket Outlets.

The Cabinet Decision No. 16/1487/706/056 dated 24th August, 2016, has been approved the said Cabinet Memorandum to implement the action in accordance with the observation of the Hon. Minister of Finance. The Hon. Minister of Finance agreed with the proposal with the suggestion to direct the Department of Import and Export Control to issue the relevant Gazette Notification under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act No. 1 of 1969.

However, the direction of the Hon. Minister of Finance and having identified that the use of numerous types of plugs, sockets and substandard electronic equipment, adaptors and extension codes as a prime cause of electrocutions, fires and also based on the recommendation from Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka - PUCSL - and the Steering Committee, the Cabinet has taken Decision No. 16/1487/706/056 dated 16th August, 2016, to standardize the plug and sockets in Sri Lanka. Type G, 13A plug and sockets outlet - rectangular pin plug and socket - was adopted as the single standard for plugs and socket outlet in Sri Lanka.

The following timeline was approved by the Cabinet in order to make the transition to the single standard more convenient to every stakeholder:

1. Adopting the Type G-13 ampere plug and socket as the unique and single standard for plugs and sockets in Sri Lanka.

2. Allowing a period of one year from 16th August, 2016: import or manufacture of plugs, sockets, substandard multi-sockets and extension cords, and appliance carrying plugs other than type G would not be allowed from 16th August, 2017.

3. Allowing a period of two years from 16th August, 2016: the sale of plugs, sockets, substandard multi-sockets and extension cords, and appliance carrying plugs other than type G would not be allowed from 16th August, 2018.

4. Existing wiring, as well as plugs and sockets presently used or sold within two years from the date of approval, will be allowed to remain in service, until the end of their useful life.

5. Existing wiring, as well as plugs and sockets to be used until the end of their useful life, to encourage manufacturers to provide in the market,

(a) A specially marked Type G socket, as a

replacement for any five ampere socket that needs replacement

(b) Adaptor to enable five ampere plugs to be

connected to 13 ampere sockets and vice versa (c ) Extension cords confirming to standards

The amendment of Import (Standard and Quality Control) regulation solely cannot restrict the import of substandard 13 plugs, sockets, adaptors and extension cords. Further, shaver sockets, universal sockets and travel adaptor will have to allow to be used in hotels and for sale in travel shop. Hence, those items are allowed to import under the supervision of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka -PUCSL- via Import Control License scheme.

The following Cabinet Memorandums and Gazette Notifications proceeded for the above purpose:

1. Cabinet Memorandum No: MNPEA/2016/64 dated 27, July 2016 Approval for (i) Adopt the Type G (widely known as the 13 ampere plug and sockets) as the unique and single standard for plugs and sockets in Sri Lanka (ii) Allow a period of one year from the date of the approval, after which the important or manufacture of plugs, sockets, multi-sockets, extension cords, and appliances carrying plugs other than Type G would not be allowed (iii) Allow a period of two years from the date of approval, after which the sale of plugs, sockets, multi-sockets, extension cords, and appliances carrying plugs other than Type G would not be allowed (iv) Allow all existing, as well as plugs and sockets presently used or sold within two years from the date of approval, to remain in service, until the end of their useful life (v) Enable existing wiring, plugs and sockets to be used until the end of their useful life, to encourage manufacturers to provide in the market, (a) a specially marked Type G socket, as a replacement for any 5 ampere socket that needs replacement, (b) adaptors to enable 5 ampere plugs to be connected to 13 ampere sockets, and vice versa, and (c) extension cords conforming to standards; and (vi) Facilitate the Gazette Notification to be issued under Sri Lanka Customs Ordinance and Sri Lanka Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9 of 2003, to implement the approval 2. Cabinet Decision No. 16/1487/706/056 dated 24, August 2016:

sometimes it may please the Opposition Members, but these are the problems that we face. But, I am sure, before too long, you will see that we will go forward.

As you know, Sir, we cannot run the economy with theoreticians, clerks and technicians. You have to have hands-on people with experience who are able to do that. I think this is something that we have to ensure and work consistently towards that goal. We should not tamper around this nor should we be fooling around this because you are playing with the economy, which is the most important aspect. We inherited an economy that was basically downtrodden, run down and the family who ruled that thought that it was only good for a couple of people to enjoy. But with the rectification, we were able to eliminate that and bring it into a better situation. So, I hope the present situation will also augur and able to increase the revenue, reduce the cost, bring meaningful expenditure and bring the economy back to a correct state.

, . [4.49p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity.

I think this is one of the most important Regulations under Imports and Exports (Control) Act, which we are discussing today. I was listening to the speech of a Member of the Opposition, the Hon. Indika Anuruddha Herath. He stated that the previous Ministers were unable to do the needful and questioned as to why they did not do that. He came out with lots of such accusations. He also spoke about the former Minister of Health, His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena. I was also in the former Government. It is a fact that he was unable to do anything because he was not allowed to do it. I know there were so many problems regarding the decisions made on tobacco products. The then Minister of Health made certain decisions, but he was forcibly prevented from carrying them out. The former Government did not allow him to do his work. That is the reason he was unable to implement the decisions taken.

I can now see that the present Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine is just walking in along with his Deputy Minister. I am very happy to say that they have done so much work to uplift the heath sector for the sake of the poor people of this country. So much of work has been done. As stated by the Hon. Member who spoke before me, prices of many medicines have been brought down. In the morning, the Hon. Members talked about cataract lenses. I am a member of the Lions Movement in Sri Lanka. Along with the help of the Lions, we were able to help the poor people to buy cataract lenses at low prices, because the ordinary persons were unable to undergo that operation since the prices of cataract lenses were so high. I know there were so many such cases. But, when the present Minister of Health took over, he brought down prices of medicine not only by 50 per cent, but by 60 - 70 per cent. He has even brought in stents for heart surgeries. Earlier, people found it difficult to get their surgeries done because some medical institutions delayed their operations and as a result, many people died. But, after the Hon. Minister took over, that has come to a standstill and their surgeries are being done on time.

I must also like to say that just one or two years back, almost 90 per cent of the laboratory tests such as urine tests or blood tests were done by private laboratories and it was a big problem for the ordinary person. But, I am very happy to say that that situation has changed now and 75 per cent of those tests are done in Government Hospitals and the poor ordinary person need not go around to the private medical intuitions. These are some of the work that the Hon. Minister of Health and the Hon. Deputy Minister have been doing and we are indeed very happy. However, I must tell the Hon. Minister, though the charges of those tests are low, the efforts made by you and the Hon. Deputy Minister have not brought down the standard of those tests to a lower level.

I must also thank both the Hon. Minister and the Deputy Minister for visiting my area in the Puttalam District and passing a large sum of money for the well-being of poor patients. The work has started and the people will be benefitted from it. The Hon. Ministers have visited the Puttalam Base Hospital also and have passed the money to fulfil all requirements in that Hospital. The work is going on with their help. The Hon. Deputy Minister also visited that Hospital.

Actually, as I have already explained to the Hon. Minister, the Puttalam Base Hospital is covering a very large area. Hospitals in adjoining areas such as Chilaw, Marawila, Negombo and Kuliyapitiya have four major hospitals within 25 kilometres. All facilities are available there and the patients are being treated well. As I said earlier, the Puttalam Base Hospitals covers a very large area; in one hand, there is Kalpitiya and other islands extending to around 40 - 50 kilometres; there is Wanathawilluwa area towards Mannar; in addition, there are about 20 camps. All patients from those areas are being treated at our Hospital. But, what is happening today, is, whatever decisions taken by Hon. Minister for the well-being of the patients in those areas, do not reach the patients when it goes through the Provincial Council level.

This is where we find it difficult. When the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister visited our Hospital, we gave them the list of shortages we have in the Hospital. I must tell you that the Puttalam Base Hospital is short of 50 per cent of the doctors. Today, the cadre for nurses is 225, but only 125 nurses are there. When we speak about the minor staff, the Provincial Council has appointed only a few from the Puttalam District and all the others are appointed from the Kurunegala District. Within six months they will go back. These are some of the difficulties that we are facing today. We found that there are around 60 nurses in excess working in Kurunegala Teaching Hospital. Though they are getting their salaries from the Puttalam Base Hospital, they are not working in that Hospital. Up-to-date, those nurses who are working in the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital have not been sent to Puttalam Base Hospital. I know this because I was a Provincial Health Minister. I did my level best earlier, but now we are unable to do that and we have now passed the baby on to the Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

I must thank the Hon. Minister because after his visit, he has taken a decision to appoint another 50 nurses to the Puttalam Base Hospital. Similarly, as I said, I must inform the Hon. Minister again that those 60 nurses who are supposed to be attached to the Puttalam Base Hospital are working outside, but they are getting their salaries from the Puttalam Base Hospital. I am sorry. I came to know about this only two weeks ago. That is why I could not inform you. Probably within two weeks, we will give you the list of names. Please see that these nurses are brought back to Puttalam because, as you said, there are some nurses who have been there for a long period. In the Puttalam Base Hospital, we have been doing all the operations.

Suddenly, there was a shortage of anesthetists. Then, we came to you. You passed a transfer order on to the Provincial Council. There were 12 anesthetists attached to the Marawila Base Hospital. According to the order, we requested two or three anesthetists to come over. Unfortunately, they have not yet been transferred.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please, wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Just a minute, please. So, they are unable to even perform routine operations.

We must thank the Hon. Minister once again because after your visit, so much of work has been done. You have passed Rs. 60 million. Work has been started. We are improving now. My request is that you go into these details. Because, what you decide at the top level, does not reach the poor people when it goes through the Provincial level.

So, I must thank the Hon. Minister for doing all these services. Whatever the Opposition may say and whatever the people may say, the ordinary man is feeling happy now not just because of the low prices of medicines but because of the good services rendered in hospitals due to the improvement of standards in hospitals.

So, as I said earlier, please, check on the Provincial sector in the future to make sure that your decisions reach the hospitals. Thank you very much.
