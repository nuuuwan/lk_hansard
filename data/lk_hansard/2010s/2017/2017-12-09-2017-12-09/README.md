Hon. Chairman and Hon. Members of the House, now I come to a very crucial segment of my address. Today, in addition to being the last day of the Third Reading of the

Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, is also the International Anti-Corruption Day. So, it is not only relevant, but it is incumbent upon us that each and every Member of this Assembly decides on the course of our nation - therefore, we must influence the course of our nation.

Sir, corruption, in the very sense of the word, has been eating into the fabric of our governing institutions. It has gone deep into the soul of our administrative machinery. In fact, it is impossible to differentiate between a corrupt practice and the usual government business transaction. Corruption has become a way of our culture; it has become a part of our culture; it is a culture that has replaced the lofty ideals of the nation once held with pride without prejudice. In such a corrupt background, the Government that came into power in 2015 is bogged down by the vagaries of politics and its corrupt practices, because we inherited an extremely corrupt system. That is a system that we inherited; a system that was made a tool by the practitioners of these corrupt practices. Those who held political power made every attempt to turn this system into a bottomless pit from which they could steel and plunder the country. This corrupt culture needs to be rejected; it needs to be discarded.

Hon. Chairman, allow me to illustrate very quickly how the corrupt system works . If a peon in the private sector is caught taking a bribe to facilitate an occasion to meet his boss, the peon will be fired on the spot; if a driver in the private sector is caught taking a santosam in order to gain some inroads into what was exchanged between his boss and another executive, that driver will be dismissed immediately; if an executive is caught taking a bribe from a contractor to facilitate an offer of a job to that contractor, that executive will be fired. Why will it be done? Because, the private sector company is answerable to its shareholders. To whom are we answerable? I saw a campaign saying, " ?" - - . Every voter and every citizen in this country is a shareholder of the institution of Government. We are all accountable to our shareholders. In that act of being answerable and accountable, we should hold our responsibility seriously. I cannot overstate the significance of this responsibility. No Member of this House, whether the Prime Minister, a Member of the Cabinet, a State Minister, a Junior Minister or just an ordinary Member of Parliament on both Sides of the aisle, should be spared of this responsibility. Even His Excellency the President is not spared of this notion of accountability and answerability. That is where the ultimate responsibility lies.

Hon. Chairman, this culture that has embraced and then desecrated our day-to-day lives must end. How can we achieve a better system? In the absence of any statute or legislation we must enforce at least a Code of Conduct that is applicable to all of us in this august Assembly; we must adopt a Code of Conduct. Our shareholders are watching us. They are sick of the prolongation of this corrupt system. They are disaffected by the blatant abuse of power by politicians to such an extent that very

3703 3704

practice of governance is hinged on this exercise. Is it not a disgusting spectacle that we are all being looked upon as a set of corrupt greedy merchants because of the behaviour of a few? . .

How can we be more sincere and forthright in our exercise of power? It is not a difficult task. It is not a monumental mountain to climb. But, it certainly is a long journey. What is looming is not just a collapse of a system, but it is the ripping away of the fabric of our society.

Hon. Chairman, I am going to conclude my speech now.

As I said, we have tabled a Code of Conduct on the 8th of August this year, but it is yet to be passed. I know our Prime Minister will take the leadership in seeing the Code of Conduct enforced for all our Ministers, our State Ministers, our Deputy Ministers and the Members of Parliament. We will start it from our beloved Party, the United National Party. It could be a beginning. On this International Anti-Corruption Day, let us set an example. Let us show the masses that our interest is to promote their own welfare. They want their children to be admitted to better schools without giving a bribe to politicos; they want to get their transfers effected without passing the buck into the hands of politicians and their henchmen; they want their land disputes be settled without oiling the palms of local politicians and their secretaries. This is an ugly picture and we want to change this picture. This is not the legacy we want. We want a better legacy.

The people rejected the corrupt system in 2015. They said, No to corruption; they said, No to nepotism. 2015 . 2015 . . . . Corruption should not be looked at only through the prism of financial corruption. Innocent men and women being abducted in white vans is corruption of political power; killing innocent protesters is corruption of political power; eliminating the term limit of tenure of office by manufactured two-thirds majority is corruption of political power and sending home the then Chief Justice without any plausible cause is also corruption of political power.

Having rejected all these types of corruption, we have now arrived at a decisive juncture. We cannot go back. We must go forward. We must satisfy the needs of the people. Hon. Chairman, that is the responsibility of all the Members of this august Assembly.

Thank you.

It is a strategic policy intended to cause a tectonic shift in Sri Lankas economy and Sri Lankas very being and destiny. Its very philosophy intends and denotes a shift from autonomy to irretrievable dependency. It is intended to shift ownership, power, preferences and resources from national to foreign, from medium and small capital to big capital mainly foreign, from the working people including the middle classes to big capital, and from the peasantry to the comprador capitalists.

. :

"Mr. Samaraweeras budget is filled with lies, half-truths, dangerous ideas and outrageously treacherous policy suggestions."

. .

" " . . . .

. . . . . . . . ; . . - a social welfare State; a social welfare economy - . . .

.

I quote:

Mangala Samaraweera has ruptured with this national consensus, has gone against the national grain and the Great Tradition of Sri Lankan developmentalism.

. .

I quote further:

"Not only is his stated outcome rapid growth, not development; not only does he turn his back on any notion of a successful and desirable Sri Lankan model of development based on its fairly unique experimentation with a creative policy mix; his entire reading of Sri Lankas development experience is one of negativism."

.

I quote:

Thus the Ranil-Mangala Budget is a budget of social warfare. Not social welfare.

I quote further:

"It embarks on social warfare, targeting specific social categories, and will trigger a response of social warfare.

That is in return. This goes on to state, I quote:

"The frontal attack on all these social classes will cause massive unemployment, povertization, proletarianization, decline of purchasing power, shrinkage of the domestic market and therefore economic crisis on the one hand and the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few foreign and local business interests on the other. It will be tantamount to a social genocide project. Social polarization of a sort that Sri Lanka always avoided and buffered itself against will appear and rapidly proliferate. " ( ) (The Hon.

How can we as a country suddenly pay US Dollars 4 billion in a year just for the external loans that we have taken? It went up from US Dollars 800 million to US Dollars 4 billion during your time. It is okay for it to go up to US Dollars 4 billion if the revenue has also increased to US Dollars 4 billion. But, the problem is the revenue has fallen.

I think perhaps the high officials of the Treasury would have read this article and the Cabinet would not have read this, because they are not interested in reading anything serious, except for my good Friend, the State Minister, to whom I have respect, though I do not agree with him.

I would like to quote from an article appeared in the Daily Mirror of Wednesday, the 25th of October, 2017, written by Mr. Mahendra Amarasuriya. He is a private sector top businessman who has had a long experience. . . Point No. 8 of this article states, I quote:

Unless the government focuses on the immediate future to increase production and productivity, bring down the cost of living, reduce the luxurious lifestyle of the huge cabinet and get down to working at grassroots levels, there can be no salvation from increasing the debt trap further.

(Mahendra Amarasuriya is former Chairman of Commercial Bank PLC and United Motors PLC, former deputy Chairman of Hayleys, former Chairman of Employees Federation of Ceylon, former Chairman of Planters Association of Ceylon, former Chairman of International chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka and former Chairman of National Agro Business Council and Joint Business Forum of Chambers of Commerce and Industry....

This is the view right across the business sector. However much you are trying to sell your Budget, this is the view right across the business sector today.

. 11 . . . . I think fiscal consolidation is something which has to be looked at. When we inherited the economy in 2015, one of the most difficult things was the dwindling revenue. The revenues were in the range of 10.4 per cent of GDP.

10.4 . 201 15 . . 40 ; 55 . 100 . . . . . .

. . .

I think there is a structural change in the approach that is being taken for white goods that are coming into the country. Now, there are some items that are basically being targeted for foreigners who come and buy and move out; especially the Indian community that comes into the country purchases certain items and then go out. One of those items is watches and another area is phones. Therefore, imposing taxes on those type of electrical items will only be counter-productive, because in most of the areas, if you impose a tax which is not durable, then what happens is smuggling will take place. Therefore,

3773 3774

2017 9

there has to be an equilibrium between what the country can earn and what the consumer can pay. My belief is that there was a successful adventure that was taking place in 2013 when there was a reduction in the prices in certain items; the reduction of duty for watches helped significantly to increase the trade volume in Sri Lanka. The revenue we got with the lower tax was much higher than imposition of a higher tax and getting less revenue for a less sales volumn. So, I basically impinge upon the Finance Minister to look into this area because there are certain structural changes that have been done which maybe inimical to the tourists that come in for this type of variant. I definitely know the Indian tourist comes in with the intention of purchasing these electrical items, watches et cetera. So, relooking at this strategy maybe more advisable since it may help in order to increase the tourist arrivals into this country.

Then the next issue is relaxation or the imposition of the benefit that was given under Clause 13 (ccc) for professionals that render services outside the country. At a particular moment, you have services that are rendered outside the shores of Sri Lanka which are tax free. Now, with the imposition of the new Inland Revenue Act, it basically cease to give that benefit. I must say the accounting bodies did speak to me in order to ensure that this benefit is going to cease for the professionals; whether it is law, accountancy or whatever it is. The benefit that has been given to them is going to be ceased from the 31st of March, 2018. So, my sincere belief is that there is a tremendous benefit that came into the country, billions of rupees were coming into the country because of these professionals. Owing to the fact that relaxation that was given is going to be re imposed under Clause 13 (ccc), and that would be basically detrimental.

Then the next issue is with regard to the SME sector. I know we fought very hard and reduced tax up to 14 per cent for the small and the medium enterprises. But the individuals, as you know, the professional services come from partnerships - partnership basically is not an incorporate company nor is it an SME. So, on this basis, it considers as personal incomes of all these individuals. So, the SME benefit that will be accrued if it was a company or whatever will now cease to exist if it goes on the basis of partnership, because the profits that come in would be on the receiver or on the individual capacity and then he will be paying up to 24 to 26 per cent. So, my argument is that this also has got to be relooked at from a SME concept because if you have the professionalism going to be taxed on the highest scale, once again, there will be evasion of the revenues that we can basically attribute to the tax coffers.

Then the other area that I would like to basically mention is the artificial rupee rate that is there, the exchange rate that is being pursued. I believe that we must have a very robust export growth.

. . 2015 201 . . .

. 2018 1 .5 . . . ? ? 8 . .

. . cost push inflation . . . 5 cost push inflation ? . . .

A level playing field is not being given for our exporters to play. When you borrow from a banks at an interest rate of 14 - 15 per cent, how on earth can you compete with the regional countries such as Bangladesh, Maldives, Pakistan which have an interest rate of 4 to 5 per cent ? You basically ask our exporters to export into the global market when the interest rates that you are affording to them is just not affordable by itself. Likewise, rates of electricity, water and so on are far in excess of what our competing regions are basically affording.

So, I would urge the Finance Minister, since we have a strong rapport between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, to ensure that the devaluation is put to rest. We will first get the economy moving and get the revenues coming in, so that we can show the signs of our exportability and then only we can look at re correcting our Rupee exchange rate. We must have a realistic exchange rate. But that should not impinge unnecessarily on the push that comes in from the Cost Push Inflation.

[4.32p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance and Mass Media) Hon. Presiding Member, I am delighted to begin my concluding speech with the good news that the Government received US Dollars 292 million, here in this very building, as the first tranche of the Hambantota Port, PPP joint venture at a ceremony presided by the Hon. Prime Minister this morning. This, Sir, is but the first step to realize the true commercial value of the Port after seven long years. In fact, the world's largest and the emptiest swimming pool can now become a world-class port bringing prosperity and development to the country, especially to the South.

The joint venture - PPP - with China Merchant Port Holdings (CMHP), a member of the China Merchant Group, which owns a network of 49 ports across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean, will enable Hambantota Port to benefit from the broader trade and shipping network that CMPH will provide access to.

These network benefits have already been demonstrated in the success of the Colombo International Container Terminal. CMPH has operated successful models of similar industrial ports in Asia and Africa and this proven track record gives us confidence that the partnership will result in vessel traffic and industrial investment enabling the Hambantota Port to finally generate the cash flows to make it a viable investment.

By linking with global value chains in goods and services and taking advantage of the trade investment

nexus, Sri Lanka can now truly fulfil its position as an economic hub of the Indian Ocean. The Hambantota Port PPP will generate FDI, create exports and most importantly create jobs that will empower Sri Lankan youth. As you know, jobs, empowering exports and FDI are, in fact, some of the key focus areas of the Budget - 2018.

Hon. Chairman, again, if I may go back to the themes of the Budget, 2018, it is founded on the themes of "Blue-Green Budget" and "Enterprise Sri Lanka". This is a Budget to harness Sri Lankas marine and natural resources in a sustainable manner whilst unleashing the true potential of our greatest resource - our people. For too long, our people have been suppressed by an overbearing State and by archaic legislation, which are a vestigial link to our colonial past.

Our education system have excluded our talented youth and denied opportunities for the realization of their capabilities. Young entrepreneurs have been unable to access affordable finance to bring to life their business ideas. As a result, our youth have become accustomed to waiting for the Government to provide them with some relief, be it a government job or some form of concession or handout. Our companies got accustomed to open-ended protection from competition. Sri Lanka, as a whole, got shifted into a defensive mindset despite opening our economy way back in 1978.

This, Sir, is the first step in a journey to reverse this mindset and to empower Sri Lankans to take control of their own destiny. The Budget focuses on liberalization to unlock the barriers to greater investment, trade and start-up enterprises. It also allocates resources to provide

training and skills development for youth to equip them with the capabilities to take advantage of such opportunities. We envisage the day when the farmers daughter becomes an agribiz-entrepreneur, when the fishermans son becomes a seafood exporter. Sri Lanka needs to go back to its roots of being a nation of entrepreneurs, a nation of traders as our ancient forefathers were many thousands of years ago. To do this, we must be open to global trade, embrace competition and take on the world and win. Whilst the Government will not be a "nanny State" as I have said many times. We do not forget the vulnerable and those who need the support of the State. The Government will always look after the handicapped, the underprivileged and the poor and that is why we feel that a strong, social safety net is of the utmost importance in a liberalized open economy like ours. The Budget has made sustainable allocations to ensure appropriate safety nets and support for those adversely affected by market dislocations. However, the Government will not protect those who stifle competition at the expense of the greater good of the society.

In fact, we have been having recently a very lively Debate on shipping liberalization and it is, I feel, with all due respect to my Friend, Colleague and fellow Cabinet Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, a prime example of this. Because at present, five Sri Lankan companies control the agencies of shipping lines that account for 74 per cent of the global shipping market. These five companies have an average age of 115 years. Whilst these companies have opposed liberalization of the sector, Sri Lankas apparel exporters, the Tea Exporters Association of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Export Association have all hailed the move to liberalize the shipping industry since it enables more competitive pricing and better services to the entire export industry. Do we want to undermine the interest of thousands of export companies and hundreds of thousands of their employees to serve the interests of a handful of entrenched shipping agency companies? We need to encourage an environment of healthy competition that will drive innovation, service excellence and growth. We will ensure that such competition will be fair and balanced, eliminating unfair trade practices by enacting prudent regulation.

This is why the proposal on shipping liberalization is coupled with the proposal to implement an Independent Regulator for the industry. In fact, as I mentioned to my Colleague this morning, we will discuss the modalities of implementation of these proposals with the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, at the earliest, while taking note of all his concerns.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Ports and Shipping) Hon. Chairman, may I just thank the Hon. Minister for considering to discuss further the position that I put forward as the Line Minister.

3803 3804

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) We will do that, hopefully, before the - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, I want to thank him for offering to discuss that further. Of course, I want to reiterate that my proposal was on behalf of, not only the Line Ministry, but also the entire SLFP, where we sat down, discussed this and took a decision. I thank the Hon. Minister for keeping it open so that we can discuss this further and come to a via media.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Excellent. Thank you very much. Now, go ahead, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Thank you, Hon. Chairman and Hon. Minister.

In fact, the Budget, I would say, takes a similar approach to trade liberalization. Sri Lanka has become one of the most protectionist economies, as you know, in the region with an array of tariffs and para-tariffs. In addition to driving up the cost of living and the cost of doing business, these tariffs have resulted in creating an anti-export bias and diverting economic resources to the non-tradable sector. It is no wonder then that our exports have collapsed in the last two decades. But again, in the latter part of this year, we have seen a very encouraging increase in the export sector.

It is in this context that we embarked on a systematic trade liberalization agenda in this Budget. As you know, subsequent to the Budget, we have already gazetted the removal of 1,200 para-tariffs, which were identified as having limited domestic economic impact and negligible revenue impact. We have committed to the complete removal of all para-tariffs on items that do not have Customs Duty within the next three years. This is a major reform. It will help drive resources to the export sector and will bring relief to the consumers as well. Rest assured that these reforms are not being initiated in a vacuum. We are well aware of the fallouts of unfettered liberalization, as seen in the Asian economic crisis of 1997 and more recently, with the pushback against economic liberalism in the West. So, we are taking an informed, balanced approach to globalization.

With regard to tariff liberalization, the Government has identified a core negative list of products, including sensitive agricultural and rural industry products which will not be subject to the same liberalization programme. We are bringing in legislation to prevent unfair trading practices and robust anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard laws are in the final stage of enactment. Together with the strengthened consumer protection laws,

Sri Lanka will have the legislative framework to address any fallout from trade liberalization efforts. A trade adjustment package is also being designed to provide financial as well as a non-financial support to local industries to remain viable in the context of a more competitive environment. In parallel, an Export Market Access Support Programme is proposed in the Budget, which will facilitate SMEs to venture into global markets. Any economic reform creates winners and losers. There will be many winners in our reform efforts, but through these adjustment measures, we have ensured that there is a meaningful safety net to support those who fall behind.

Hon. Chairman, another significant liberalization measure is the modernization of archaic legislation. There are many who pontificate on the need for Sri Lanka to break away from the forces of globalization and to chart an independent path. But, little do they realize that many of our major laws and legislation are still those designed by our former colonial masters. We remain tied to this colonial legacy and continue to be governed by those diktats.

The proposals in the Budget, 2018 for further liberalization of markets are designed in a manner to promote competition and contestation in markets. Competition drives innovation, productivity improvement and service excellence, all of which in turn support better and more affordable products and services for citizens and will enhance the living standards in Sri Lanka. It is also clear that these liberalization measures are not implemented in a vacuum. They include carefully thought-out measures to ensure appropriate safeguards and support to protect the vulnerable. In all Proposals, the Budget, 2018 sets the stage for a vibrant social market economy with a foundation of competitiveness, social justice and fairness.

Hon. Chairman, the bedrock of a vibrant and competitive economy is the robust social infrastructure. A countrys greatest asset is all its people and we have continued to invest heavily in our people. It is only then that our people will be empowered to be true shareholders in Enterprise Sri Lanka. Since the Unity Government came into power, there has been a conscious effort to enhance expenditure in education, health and housing. In the year 2014, the then Government spent less than 2 per cent of GDP on education, higher education and skills development; it was actually 1.9 per cent. In every year since then, the spending on education has increased and the proposed expenditure in 2018 is 2.4 per cent of GDP. We expect to increase it further gradually in the coming years. But, it is not just the volume of spending that is relevant, but also the quality of expenditure.

An exam-centric curriculum has resulted in a large number of students dropping out of school after Ordinary Levels. But, this is because the education system has failed the students and not due to a failure of the students themselves. The education system has failed to recognize the fact that all students have unique skills set beyond academic capabilities. The 13 years of education policy, with an allocation of Rs. 3.5 billion, recognizes the varied

3805 3806

2017 9

skills of students and ensures the opportunity for students to stay on in school after the Ordinary Levels. Students can take up market-oriented technical and vocational training programmes and skills development programmes, at the successful completion of which they will receive formal certification such as NVQ 4. Rupees 4.5 billion has been allocated for market-oriented skills development programmes for youth through the Employment Preparation Fund and the Youth Corps. The German Tech Training School programme will be expanded to five new schools around the country, enabling all Sri Lankans to develop the skills to thrive in "Enterprise Sri Lanka".

In higher education, Rs. 5 billion is allocated for development of new technology-based degree programmes. Access to higher education will also be further enhanced by easing the eligibility criteria for Mahapola Scholarships, which will benefit at least 3,000 additional students from next year.

In the year 2014, the previous regime spent 1.39 per cent of GDP on public health. Since the Unity Government came into power, there has been a marked increase in expenditure on health, with the allocation for 2018 increasing to 1.73 per cent of GDP and we will continue to increase it in future too. Significant allocations have been made for the control of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiac illnesses and the continued threat of CKDu. A health insurance scheme is also introduced for university students.

Then, significant investments are made for housing across the country. Rs. 17.5 billion is allocated for housing under the Urban Regeneration Programme with a further Rs. 12 billion allocated under various rural housing development schemes. The Governments commitment to large-scale investment in social infrastructure is abundantly clear. These are investments that directly benefit the people in the form of knowledge empowerment, health and well-being, security and shelter. You may not see this development in the form of glittery, albeit empty airports or ports, but you will see it in the form of improved lives and livelihoods of everyday Sri Lankans.

Sir, I have spoken a lot about "Enterprise Sri Lanka", a key theme of this Budget. We envisage the modernization of Sri Lankan enterprise, where entrepreneurship thrives and small businesses have opportunities to tap into global value chains. But, we have not, in any way, neglected traditional industry and the rural economy. "Enterprise Sri Lanka" will empower the traditional economy and help take it to the next level through the infusion of technology and access to markets.

In fact, transparency and fairness in a rules-based framework is the hallmark of all the taxation proposals in this Budget. One of the major impediments to investment and the business climate has been Sri Lanka's tendency for ad hoc tax policies. Following the Inland Revenue Act, in the Budget, we have taken steps to address this by introducing transparent, rules-based taxes in several key segments such as vehicle taxation and alcohol taxation, among others.

In vehicle taxation, the change in basis to a pure engine capacity-based tax will help address the rampant malpractices and severe leakage in customs revenue. In the past, alcohol taxation on an ad hoc basis has favoured one sector over another, leading to corruption and a proliferation of illicit liquor. The change to a formula-based tax on alcohol content will finally bring some rationality and objectivity to the taxation of alcohol in line with global best practices.

The principles of fairness, the rule of law and transparency are the foundation of the Unity Government. The proposals in the Blue- Green, Enterprise Sri Lanka Budget are an embodiment of these principles. Those proposals set the stage to empower Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, the Sri Lankan SMEs and the Sri Lankan youth to take their future into their own hands to compete on the global stage and win.

() LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT)

BILL . . Order for Second Reading read.

[5.32p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, I move,

That the Bill, be now read a Second time.

Sir, this Bill has been brought about for the reason that there were two technical errors which need to be corrected. The first Amendment was an Amendment where if any Party receives less than 20 per cent of the votes and has only three members to be elected, the mandatory requirement of appointing a female would not have to be done. However, when I read this at the Committee Stage, I read it correctly. However, when it was translated into Sinhala, there was an error. So, today, this House is going to correct that Amendment which I read properly.

The second issue relates to the multi-member wards. As you know, there was a policy decision that if a party wins a multi-member seat, both seats would be awarded to that political party. So, these two Amendments have no

substantial bearing. These are errors which needed to be corrected as the Elections Commissioner requires these Amendments to be brought about for the election to be held. As you know, there has been various debates that various quarters are trying to postpone the election, but these were the mandatory requirements required by the Elections Commissioner and I thank every Member in the House for the support which we have obtained to take this forward.

, . . . , . , . .

The election process has begun. Parliament has no power to intervene in it at this moment. I request the Hon. Speaker to rule out all Amendments which are trying to intervene with the election process. We have no power to intervene, except in the correction to be made, to which

you as well as the entire Parliament had agreed because we had passed something and an incorrect version of it had been presented to you. That has to be corrected. Other than that, the election process should not be violated. We might gain or lose. That is irrelevant. But if you go on, on this basis to flout and violate the Standing Orders and Parliamentary Procedure, you are bringing democracy to a big farce.

Therefore, I appeal to you, Hon. Speaker, in the name of democracy, on behalf of the Opposition and all the Hon. Members of Parliament as well as the other outside organizations including the PAFFREL, to overrule this attempt of trying to amend and smuggle in Amendments which will try to deviate from the established due election process that we have already started.

I am surprised at the response of certain Members and this Amendment was brought about on the requirement of the Election Commission. I have not - [Interruption.] . . [ . . . . . . .

Also, Sir, if you have a multi-member constituency, with regard to nominations, you cannot adopt one process and when you declare the member, you cannot adopt another. This is an Amendment of necessity. The Election Commissioner has directed that this Amendment be brought about. If we do not bring this Amendment, we cannot hold elections. He has informed me that he will freeze the results of the multi-member constituencies. Most of the Hon. Members are shouting in this House that they want an election. On one front, they are asking for an election and on the other, they are trying to delay it. Whatever statements that are being made will delay the process.

Therefore, Sir, I humbly request that this Amendment be taken up for a Vote and proceeded with.
