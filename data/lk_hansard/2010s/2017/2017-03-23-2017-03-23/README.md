Rauff Hakeem. Are you going to add something on this issue? ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Sir, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena raised this issue. I must thank the Hon. Prime Minister who is in the House now. In fact, we raised this issue with him yesterday and he has made all arrangements to provide sufficient relief to Trincomalee. It seems to be spreading to other areas and we have to look at other areas as well. In fact, I must thank the tri forces. They have deployed almost 800 men in Kinniya and the surrounding areas and other voluntary

organizations have also deployed people. They are cleaning that area. Also all necessary equipment have been brought in and a High Dependency Unit has been set up in the Kinniya Hospital. That is the only one apart from the one at the Negombo Hospital. We must also thank the volunteers, doctors from other areas who have volunteered to come. That shows the amount of sacrifice those who are in our medical profession is making. They are going to these areas at a risk to their own lives and they are serving these people. So, I must also record here with gratitude the help rendered. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you. . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to comment on what the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Leader of the House have said about this issue. The Government has made all the resources available. I endorse what the Hon. Rauff Hakeem said. The three services, the Police, the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and the Provincial Departments of Health Service are all there. They have got even people down from Polonnaruwa. As regards to Trincomalee, the resources have been given and they have been working on Trincomalee. Then, they went to Kinniya and they have gone into individual houses there.

Now the disease is moving down towards Batticaloa. I said that we will make all the resources available there as well. The Hon. Minister is keeping an eye on the situation in Batticaloa. But, there seems to be a spread of disease. I mean we have to be careful. Maybe, we have been in Colombo, but look at what has been happening in Maldives where there has been Swine Flu. Bird Flu is in China and South Korea. I think, South Korea has ordered 30 million chickens to be killed. China is also culling the birds and the meat prices there are fluctuating. So, there seems to be a series of epidemics that are going around and we will have to be more on the alert to ensure that it does not spread here. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Especially, when it comes to tourism, Hon. Prime Minister, once Malaria and Cholera used to be a problem here. Now, I think, people including travel advisories are concerned about Dengue. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe)This is the tourist season in the Eastern Province. So, we want to get it under control. We should get Batticaloa also under control.

No. Just have a little patience. I want to explain this. I have just explained to the Hon. Deputy Speaker. , , . ; . . . . , , Constitutional Amendment , .

A Constitutional Resolution was brought in to establish the Constitutional Assembly and a Steering Committee of 21 Members was appointed. That Steering Committee has been sitting. The UNF headed by the Hon. Prime Minister has 106 Hon. Members in Parliament and of the 21 Members in the Committee, the Prime Minister's Party has the majority - 11 Members. Then, the TNA, which has 16 Hon. Members in Parliament, has two Members and the JVP, which has five Hon. Members in Parliament, has two Members in that Committee. The EPDP is also a Member of the Committee. Then, there is the SLMC too, which has one Hon. Member in Parliament officially. - [Interruption.] No, Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you have more than one, I know. But, officially, the SLMC has one Hon. Member in Parliament and they have one Member in the Committee. Then, the Joint Opposition, which has 52 Hon. Members in Parliament, has only two Members in the Committee. The SLFP, which is in Government, has three Members in the Committee. It is quite okay. We have been participating irrespective of what the composition is. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) What is the point you are trying to make, Hon. Member? Is it that you have been participating in the Committee? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I want to bring to your notice, Sir, The Island newspaper of today reports on this Committee. I have all

my respect to The Island newspaper, the founder himself, Mr. Upali Wijewardene, had been a very good, close friend of mine. But, it carries an article in the second page titled Constitution making : JO boycotts Steering Committee meeting; reported by my good friend Saman Indrajith with a photograph of the Hon. Prime Minister. It is a long report, which I do not want to read through, Sir. It states, I quote:

The Constitutuent Assembly Steering Committee responsible for preparing a draft constitutional proposal met, for the first time,........."

"For the first time", Hon. Leader of the House. Then, it goes on to state, I quote:

"........ without a single MP from the Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presiding."

There have been so many meetings of that Committee where the JO had not been present, but the JO has been attending it right through, as much as possible. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) So, your position is, you are participating in the Committee and that you are not boycotting it. Is it? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We are participating in it, but the happenings of the Committee are being reported wrongly. We do not blame the newspapers. Someone is giving wrong news to the newspapers. We have to find out how this happens because the Hon. Prime Minister chairs this Committee and it is a very serious Committee. The Hon. Leader of the House and I are also Members of the Committee. So, how can this happen? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Dinesh Gunawrdena, I think your matter is very clear. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, someone who wants to go around the world must be interested in spreading wrong information. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to support the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardenas assertion. I must say that their participation has been very good; the JO has been participating regularly. And this is the first time in the history of Parliament that all political parties are represented in the Steering Committee. For example, in the 70s, when the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirima Bandaranaike

formed a Constituent Assembly, the Tamil parties did not take part. In the Constitution making of President J.R. Jayewardene also, the Tamil parties did not take part. So, this is the first time that the Tamil parties are taking part in it actively along with the Joint Opposition and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. So, this reporting has to be corrected. I think it is very unfair because we have been attending over 50 Committee meetings. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Leader of the House, the day before also I attended it. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I agree. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yesterday, I had to go and join the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa at a public meeting. Today, you all have cancelled the Committee meeting. We did not cancel it, but the Hon. Prime Minister has cancelled it. So, a wrong report is going out to the country.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I think they are trying to set fire to the constitutional process. So, Sir, I think you must not bring them to task, but at least reprimand them. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Well, the matter is very clear, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) "" . . , . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . , 1970 ; .. . ,

It is totally inaccurate because there have been very regular attendance by them in the Steering Committee. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Prime Minister is the Chairman of the Committee. He can make a clarification and make a release which covers everything. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, these people are trying to destroy the country. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , ?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) , 21 ,- ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Only the Bill. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) It is not the Bill. I think the Hon. Member has made a mistake about it. There is only one Bill - Revocation of Irrevocable Deeds of Gift on the Ground of Gross Ingratitude Bill. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I am referring to the Orders. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) That is right. There are two Orders. One is an Order on mutual legal assistance between Sri Lanka and Ukraine. I think there is no issue about that also. Then, the other is an Order made under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 2013. It is a statute, an existing law coming from 2013. This special law was brought in for a limited period of two years and it was to be extended. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) For non-summary offences. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes. On serious offences, the suspect could be detained by the Police over 24 hours up to 48 hours with the permission of the judicial officer. This law was to be in operation for a limited period of two years and lapsed in March, 2015. In terms of Section 7(2) of the Act, I published a Gazette in February or March, 2015 for a further extension of this statute for two years and that two-year period will lapse in the course of this month. Therefore, I have published another Gazette at the request of the Hon. Attorney-General and the Police Department to extend this statute for a further period of two years. This law, I think, was introduced by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem in 2013. Now, here, we are seeking permission of Parliament only for a further extension of two years. There is a Constitutional issue whether we can debate anything about the contents. This is an existing statute. The only matter before Parliament is whether this could be extended for a further period of two years as it is and we have no right to make any amendments.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It was introduced in 2013 and to be expired after two years, in 2015. Then you extended that for another two years which will be expired in the course of this month. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Correct. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) So, can we limit it to this month and then close the Debate or, do you want to extend it for another two years? That is the issue. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) In fairness to the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the others who are having different views on this law, I can suggest this House that we get this extended for a further period of two years. At this stage, Parliament has no right to make any amendment to the existing law. The matter is, whether it should be extended or not. That is all. But, if there are other legal aspects which the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is of the view, we must make some amendments to the law; certainly, we can discuss it separately. There is no purpose of getting entangled with those issues in this Debate because this is a limited issue as to whether it should be extended or not. If there are some suggestions that certain laws need amendments, we are open; we can discuss with the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and other Party Leaders. We will have a separate discussion on this matter. If you propose any amendment, certainly, we are willing to discuss it separately. Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, shall we do it that way? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Will you put it for approval today or, will you give us a little more time so that we can discuss and take it- () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) This is only for extension of time. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We can put it for approval in the first week of April. The Hon. Minister wants to move it and explain. We have no issue on that, you can explain. Our issue is, whether we can discuss this today and come back in the first week of April. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) No. There will be an issue because the Police Department and the Attorney-Generals Department-

897 898

2017 23

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, has this gone before the relevant Sectoral Oversight Committee as well? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes, this has gone before the Sectoral Oversight Committee. Hon. Member knows that there is an issue. During the last four to five years, the Police Department and the Attorney Generals Department had followed this law.

I will come out with the statistics of serious offences that had been committed prior to the enactment of this law and thereafter. After four years, roughly 50 per cent of the numbers have come down. That shows that this law has helped in the reduction of the crimes in the country. Therefore, I think the Hon. Members will support this move and this will not cause any prejudice to anybody. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Opinions expressed by some of the leading human rights activists, to be very frank, appeared in the newspapers. It has been canvassed all over. So, I think Hon. Minister, if you give time till first week of April, we can resolve this issue with you. But you can go ahead with the Debate, we have no objection to the Debate. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) My problem, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that the Debate is only on the extension, nothing else we can debate here. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I might mention that this is a Bill that was brought by the previous Government. We are only seeking to extend the time. I never gave a promise to the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena to postpone the Vote. I said that when the Hon. Minister comes I will put it to him and if he agrees, I am agreeable. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) ? ? () ( () ) (The Hon.

That means the Supreme Court has also affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and therefore, all the courts with original jurisdiction and all the courts below the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court have to follow this. We were waiting for some time and it took, of course, ten years now. We were expecting the superior courts to correct this situation and give the correct interpretation. But, I have observed that there are several judgments that had been delivered on the subject matter, but there is no solid clarification or proper interpretation by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal. Therefore, we were compelled to bring in the necessary and proper amendments by way of a Bill to make it a statutory law in our legal system.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [2.05p.m.] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Madam Presiding Member, I am glad that I am able to speak on this Debate while you are presiding since you are also a member of the legal profession and you will

understand the nitty-gritties of this particular piece of legislation that the Hon. Minister is wanting to be passed.

Madam, Sri Lanka is one of those countries which has an interesting legal history of a variety of systems prevailing in our country. As a matter of fact, all of us know that on the civil side, we treat the Roman-Dutch Law as our common law. We have a unique position because in the world Sri Lanka and South Africa are the only countries which follow the Roman-Dutch principles to be applicable as our common law principles. In this regard, it is very significant to note that even the Dutch themselves have abandoned the Roman-Dutch Law. But among the Commonwealth Countries, only South Africa and Sri Lanka follow the Roman-Dutch principles in our legal system, particularly when it comes to the common civil law.

In this case particularly, the Hon. Minister proposes to introduce some changes. In fact, this Bill is being brought about as a result of a decision handed down by the Court of Appeal in the year 2007, I presume, where an irrevocable deed of gift was permitted to be revoked by the donor for ingratitude by way of a deed of revocation without recourse to courts. This was not the legal position before that judgment. After the judgment, it has created some difficulties particularly to the banking sector. Now, I am sure the banking sector had lobbied heavily and this Bill had to be brought in to correct the anomalous situation that would have arisen and that had remained in our common law.

Madam, we must also remember that previous governments have also come under pressure from the banking sector to reform laws, particularly, we introduced the Parate Execution Law, which enabled banks to have a summary procedure to be adopted in forfeiting properties that have been pledged as collateral in loans, where cases were pending in courts. So, we must realize these issues. I would like to look at it from the point of view of the debtor. Of course, sometimes, we are overly concerned about the concerns of the creditor. But the debtors themselves also do suffer.

In this case, I am sure that there are other reasons for such a Bill to be brought because if you allow a donee to pledge a property to get some loan from a banking institution, he could by way of collusion with his own donor- if it is the father, a sibling or any other relative- revoke the deed. They could collude with each other and revoke the deed and that will put the bank into some difficulty and that perhaps may be the reason why a Bill is brought, so that an irrevocable deed of gift cannot be revoked without recourse to action in court. So, this invariably reverses the position that had been created by the judgment handed down in 2007 in the case of Wilson Vs. Sumanawathie and others.

Here I would like to pose another question. There appears to be two other grounds on which an irrevocable deed of gift could be revoked. One is when there is a legitimate child being born after the deed of gift had been granted. Then, there is another case where other

921 922

2017 23

conditions stipulated in the deed of gift is violated by the donee. Those two causes are not included in this particular legislation. I raised this with the Hon. Minister and he said, Well, we discussed it with the Law Commission and for a variety of reasons these stakeholders and the Law Commission did not want to include these two other grounds on which an irrevocable deed of gift could be revoked.

But, of course, the Hon. Minister kept it open that if necessary, subsequently we can bring in amendments. I thought I should flag that issue. Since only one ground is mentioned specifically it could impliedly mean that other two grounds cannot be pursued. That is some matter that needs to be given some consideration since by implication it would mean that anyone wanting to revoke a deed of gift for those other two reasons may not be able to do it. Therefore, it may be advisable for us to have the other two grounds also included since the Roman-Dutch Law very specifically prescribes the other two grounds also as grounds on which an irrevocable deed of gift could be revoked.

While saying that, I must also state that the lending institutions are always very cautious in taking collateral. They go through the title report, and if the title report is defective, a person seeking to get a loan for a legitimate purpose cannot get his loan. There are difficulties that he may have to encounter. Rather than having a legislation of this nature, they could also treat that not every deed of gift would be revoked. We need not have a presumption that every deed of gift would be revoked by the donor. Here also, we are stipulating a timeframe. Action must be brought within ten years of the deed being executed and within two years the cause of action having arisen. So, that again causes another problem. What happens if the donor is incapacitated or if the donor is dead? For instance, the father gifts to the elder child. Elder child has been very nasty and was not treating the father properly, and he acted in ingratitude, and if the other siblings want to bring an action against him, what happens? These are issues that can arise. Once a legislation is being prepared, we need to look at all different types of scenarios that can arise. What if the donor himself is incapacitated to such an extent that he cannot file an action? Therefore, these limitations also to a very serious extent constrain and are heavily weighted towards the banking institution or the lending institution and has not taken into consideration the difficulties that borrowers can face.

Of course, I do concede there can be collusion. The issue of collusion between two people, both the donor and the donee colluding with each other, to defraud the bank could always revoke an irrevocable deed of gift without recourse to courts. That maybe the reason why this is being brought. Yet, what I feel is that the limitation of ten years from the date of execution for action being brought and that within two years the cause of action having arisen is also seriously restricting the borrower to be constrained or to be put into difficulty.

Therefore, I thought that I should highlight those issues and I must say, as for the Muslim community in this country, we have our own law relating to succession.

We have the Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance where there is very clear provision. A deed of gift which is irrevocable cannot be revoked by the donor. That is the position under the Muslim Law and this certainly will not, in any case, affect the Muslims because as for Muslims, the Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance very clearly prescribes that. As the Hon. Minister himself is a very reputed civil lawyer - in fact, we have been contemporaries in Law College and otherwise. Several students have been reading his compendiums on civil law which he has written profusely and which has benefited students all round - he is quite aware of the principles of the Muslim Law when it comes to intestate succession since we have our own Ordinance, which governs the Sharia principles relating to this.

While talking about this, I must very cursorily mention about the Muslim Personal Law reforms which has become a very controversial subject these days in the country. I do not want to speak at length. The Hon. Minister had been good enough to allow the Muslim Parliamentarians themselves to decide on what needs to be done in order to reform our own personal laws when it comes to Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act which inevitably needs some serious changes.

It has become a matter of debate now even among the non-Muslims, particularly when it comes to the age of marriage stipulated in the Muslim Personal Law. I do not want to discuss that issue, but of course, reform is necessary and that reform needs to be progressive, that has to take into account the realities of the current times and also bear in mind that the divine law, when it comes to the Muslim Personal Law, is something that cannot undergo very serious, radical changes. There is a Committee that has been appointed to go into those reforms. Former Supreme Court Judge His Lordship Saleem Marsoof is presiding over that Committee, which is also comprised of many senior legal luminaries from the Muslim community including former Attorney-General, Mr. Shibly Aziz, Presidents Counsel, Mr. Faisz Musthapha, Presidents Counsel and some other important senior civil society members. They have been sitting on this for quite a long time and it is rather overdue. Therefore, we expect that Committee to quickly finalize the reforms that are necessary and bring those forth to be adopted so that whatever necessary changes could be brought in.

While saying that, let me also digress a little bit to talk about another piece of legislation that the Hon. Minister was good enough to bring to the House: the Amendment to the Prescription Ordinance that was brought in last year in order to facilitate the Prescription Ordinance to be exempted in the case of IDPs, particularly in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and the other provinces. During the period of the armed conflict, people had been deprived of their lands due to some duress brought upon them by various armed groups to transfer their lands. Even their possessions were forcibly expropriated from them. In those cases, if the Prescription Ordinance was to operate, those who lost those lands would not be able to lay any claim to their lands after ten years. Because of that, we brought in an Amendment to the Prescription

923 924

Ordinance permitting those people who have been affected to petition the District Court in their area to try and abrogate those deeds that had been executed forcibly or by other means of duress. In this regard, we urge the Hon. Minister to at least hold some workshops in those areas to educate the people because they need to know the details of this piece of legislation so that they can apply to the District Court in their area, and that will allow them to make use of the available provisions and redeem those lands. Particularly in the Batticaloa District, there had been several complaints by Muslims, and there are other areas where the lands had been taken over during the period of the conflict. So, I thought I will flag this matter.

In the meantime, I must also talk about a few other issues pertaining to reconciliation in the country. That leads to land, once again. I would rather speak about this matter in Tamil so that this record will be properly documented.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) This is with regard to the very pertinent questions that were raised by the Hon. Minister Rauff Hakeem. One thing is that we passed the Prescription (Special Provisions) Bill to accommodate those who have been deprived of their right to litigate for their properties, especially in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces due to the armed conflict. The duration of that law, I think, is only two years. We have held a couple of workshops and I want to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister that the Secretary to my Ministry already had discussions with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and we are going to educate the people that before that time period lapses, they must take the opportunity to vindicate their rights.

The other matter that the Hon. Minister raised was that there are two other grounds in addition to gross ingratitude on which a donor can revoke an irrevocable deed. One is, when there is a legitimate child born after the execution of the deed of gift and the other is, when the conditions have been breached by the donee. In fact, we discussed this matter at length and there is not any effect of this particular judgment on revocations on those two grounds. That is why - if necessary, we can make some adjustments - we left the provisions on those two grounds intact without interfering. We just wanted to rectify the mistake that has been made as a result of this wrong interpretation.

The other matter that the Hon. Minister raised was about the ten-year period, that there could be confusion. In fact, the basis for making it ten years is that, even if a person possesses a land forcibly, to which he has no right or interest whatsoever, still, in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, irrespective of all the other criteria, he acquires the Title. Therefore, when you have to revoke a deed of this nature on that basis, there has to be some limitation. Then only there will be a certainty about the Title. Therefore, we thought it fit to have a ten-year period, which is sufficient for them to file action to revoke a deed on the grounds of gross ingratitude. But, if there is ingratitude shown even after ten years, then we cannot help it because there has to be certainty with regard to the Title owners. Thank you very much.

I am certain that it must be 65 or 70 detainees now. There are only a very few cases - about 45 - now. Those are on grave crimes such as the killing of Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar and the bomb blast in a train compartment at Dehiwala. Therefore, the number cannot be more than 65 to 70 and also those trials will definitely be concluded within the next few months. .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M.

, . [6.11p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. Today, I would like to point out an entirely different problem in the society. Passing an Order extending the period of detention of persons arrested on this type of offences is a must. This is an issue related to the criminal justice system and this has affected the peace-loving people of this country.

Today, the coastal area from Jaffna to Negombo provides main points for trafficking Kerala Ganja. The coastal line is being used by traffickers for their benefit. Unemployed youth in these areas have fallen prey to these traffickers in transporting and distributing Kerala Ganja brought via sea routes to small-time drug peddlers. When these youth, who are victims of such circumstances, are arrested and produced in courts, these big-time drug peddlers spend money for litigation and even for payment of fines. But, due to poverty and inadequacy of punishment, they engage in the same activity again once they come back after paying the fine. Currently, Hon. Minister, the penalty or the fine imposed on offences

related to Ganja is grossly inadequate and that loophole is being used by big-time traders to get others engaged in the trade. For five kilograms of Ganja, which is worth millions of rupees, the fine is only Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000. For less than five kilograms, the fine is Rs. 25,000. So, the law should be amended to deter the emerging trend of youth falling prey to this menace which has affected many households in these areas. The law should be amended to increase the fine so that it will be a deterrent for both big-time peddlers and other youth who are used by such peddlers for transportation. It has become a very serious issue especially in our part of the country.

And also, there is another item known as Baabul which is used very frequently by school-going children. Therefore, considering these facts, these traffickers must be brought to book and once they are brought to book, the penalty should be so high that they will not repeat this. I know in certain cases, the first-time offenders are given a suspended sentence and if they repeat the offence they are sent to prison. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to consider this because day-by-day this is increasing and more and more drugs are coming in. The police is doing a very good job. They catch these peddlers and take them to courts. Unfortunately, the fine is so low that the following day, they come out. So, this will have to change. If you increase the fines, in the future we will be able to save the children, especially the school leavers. This should be considered as another drug like cocaine.

You know, once children leave school they enter an entirely different world. Even to enter the university they have to wait one-and-a-half years and even to find employment it takes some time. They cannot take a decision during that period. This is the time at which these people approach these children. They get together and spoil this young generation. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to consider this very carefully and to increase the penalty in such a way that this is stopped to save the future generation of this country.

We must also improve the facilities given to the navy for stopping drugs like this coming from other countries to our country. The navy and the police could co-ordinate and work together in solving this problem to save the future generation. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) I must thank the Minister, Hon. Rauff Hakeem. He touched on the Muslim Law and the Shariya Law which we have been following for ages. We are very grateful to the Minister indeed for forming a committee to get the final decision from the Muslim MPs. We have been following that law not only here. Right round the world, this is practiced. It does not differ. Even though we follow that law, we always follow the rules and

999 1000

regulations of this country. So, I must thank you for considering it. There was so much of opposition but gracefully the committee was formed and the final decision, as you said, will be made by the Muslim MPs. Once again, I assure you whatever is the law that we follow, we will not go against the law of this country.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , () . . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , " " . , . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

[7.04 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

I too wish to place my views with regard to the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Kaveendiran Kodeeswaran, Member of Parliament, of developing a proper methodology to provide employment to graduates. We, as citizens of Sri Lanka, should be proud that the concept of free education brought by the late Hon. C.W.W. Kannangara, followed by free meals, free textbooks and free school uniforms by the successive governments with the good intention of granting not only equal opportunities to the children of poor homes and rural areas to further their studies to come up in life, but to identify the intellectuals from villages and poor homes who were unable to exhibit their talents due to financial strain to obtain education through payments and non-availability of well-equipped schools in rural areas.

I am happy to state on the Floor of the House that under the, "The Five Point Plan - a New Country in 60 Months," of our Hon. Prime Minister, school education of thirteen years will be made mandatory, making compulsory free education up to a period of thirteen years. All these are done to identify intelligent students from rural and poor homes and get opportunities and facilities for higher education to become experts in different fields in this country.

After establishing schools with GCE Advanced Level classes with provision of qualified teachers in villages and rural areas, the poor intelligent students enter the universities in Sri Lanka for graduation in various fields of study. Like the provision of free education, there should be some methodology to provide employment to the passed out graduates suited to their field of study either in Government or private sector without having any barrier or stagnation. Otherwise, we could only see such graduates forming unemployed graduate associations and lodging their protest by way of Satyagraha on the roads demanding employment.

Their requests and protests are acceptable. They spent three to four years in the universities with the financial support of their parents. All cannot afford to spend on their children due to poverty, but with high hope of the future of their children who will be a recognized figure in the society, they mortgage their only house and property or obtain loans and spend on their children's education. If their children cannot find a job immediately after graduating, how could they redeem their only property or settle their financial commitments?

These are the young adults who pass out with great expectations of contributing their talents, knowledge and skills towards the development of motherland as well to become leaders in various fields. Unfortunately, when they face such disappointments by their shattering hopes and dreams, it will lead to youth unrest. I am not blaming unemployed graduates who are performing Satyagraha or

fast unto death. Unfortunately, this has become the culture of the day. There are protests, strikes or fast unto death for everything. The representatives of the Government meet them, give some sort of assurance and sort out the problems. Thus, it has infiltrated in the minds of everybody in the country that they could achieve something if they go on strike, protest march or fast unto death. The Government has to be blamed for encouraging such actions. If the respective Ministers, Secretaries to the Ministries or Heads of Departments identify these shortcomings or lapses and resolve it at the correct time, such unacceptable, undesirable and unwanted activities will be avoided or minimized. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Hon. Presiding Member, I am finishing with this.

Further in this context, I wish to table* a memorandum submitted by the Unemployed Graduates Association from the Batticaloa District, who are staging their protest fast unto death for the last 29 days. They have made some reasonable and acceptable suggestions, such as:

1. Due to the delay in granting their appointments, to extend the upper age limit for application to be 45 years of age.

2. Appointments should be given considering the years of graduation.

3. Appointments given on quota basis should be stopped.

4. Vacancies for teachers in the Eastern Province should be filled in accordance with the Circular Number 01/2016 issued by the Ministry of Education on the approval of the Department of Management Services of the Treasury.

5. Special consideration should be given to alternatively abled (disabled) applicants.

As such, I kindly request the House to take these matters into consideration.

The suggestion made by all of us is an immediate solution to minimize the number of unemployed graduates. Though nearly 25 months have gone by, as our Hon. Prime Minister suggested in his Five Point Plan to be implemented within 60 months, under developing education, there will be 18 international level technical

colleges accommodating 1,000 students in each technical college and annually setting up internet-based job markets in each and every university where every student will be able to submit an application containing their details, qualifications and preferred job opportunities. They will be made eligible for these programmes one year prior to their final year, which will help the student obtain job opportunities immediately after their passing out. If this is implemented fully, this will lead to finding a permanent solution, where there will not be any unemployed graduates.
