[4.22p.m.] ... ( ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Presiding Member, I heartily congratulate the Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, for presenting his Blue-Green Mangala Budget of our Yahapalana Government, both you and I represent.

Sir, our Finance Ministers Budget Proposals have been prepared with a vision to take this country forward from its unbearable debts, the legacy that the former Government left behind, in which I was also a Minister.

Our Finance Minister has taken the right steps to benefit all sections of the society: the rich, the middle-class, the working class and the poor masses. When we go through the Budget Proposals one by one, we can see the effort he has taken to rectify the mistakes of the past and to build a strong nation under an uncorrupt, committed and strong leadership.

To build a strong country, we need communal harmony and reconciliation in the country and think as one people, one nation under one flag. As the State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, it gives me a great satisfaction to observe that the Budget is made to give relief to all sections of the population in this country in order to build a strong nation.

Sir, the task of preparing a Budget is not that easy. No Minister of Finance in the past had presented a Budget to satisfy everyone. The legacy that the previous Government left for us was a big yawning gap of foreign loans and borrowings. If this burden was not cast upon us, the Finance Minister would have felt quite comfortable to present a Budget giving more relief to the people.

These Budget Proposals, which have been prepared to strengthen the living conditions of the down-trodden masses are commendable. Concern for three-wheeler drivers, who are large in numbers - mostly in Colombo,

which I represent for over three decades - and giving them a training is a remarkable proposal. I suggest that during this training period good ethics should be taught to build the image of our country. I suggest that a uniform to drivers should be introduced to make them look smart and it will promote security for the passengers as well. Encouraging electric vehicles will reduce air pollution and bring a healthy green environment.

Sir, this years Budget was presented by the Hon. Finance Minister during a critical period when the country is facing many protests and demonstrations. This shows how a democratic country can express freedom, which we could not find in the past years. Youth unrest and protests of university students are the crops of economic burden and therefore, this Budget has focused on finding solutions.

School dropouts are a big burden to the society. This Budget plans to ensure 13 years of education and also identify students' skills and provide them special training in the field of their choice to obtain employment. The allocation of Rs. 325 billion for education, health and youth empowerment will improve science, technology, IT fields with modern laboratory facilities in schools and higher education institutes. In general, changing of curriculum and teaching methods, special training for teachers will increase the literacy rate of our country. Providing new medical schools in Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa will increase the intake for medical education which will give more opportunities for students to enter State universities without looking for private medical colleges spending large amounts of money, which many rural students cannot afford.

My forefathers were the ambassadors of trade who introduced Sri Lanka's commodities like spices and gems to the international trade arena, , which helped prosper our country. The Western nations who were in pursuit of our natural resources were prompted to trade with us. Reduction of taxes for gem imports and encouraging re-export will increase our export earnings.

I appreciate the decision to reduce the export of cheap labour, especially domestic maids, who are forced to leave their families neglecting their childrens future and also messing up and making their family life miserable. This in the future, will ruin our culture and the family bonds. The Budget Proposals encouraging women to represent in country's affairs and to provide micro-financing to women involved in self-employment are commendable.

Sir, the investment in the health sector by our Government has been significant. The Government has fulfilled the promise of providing medicine at an affordable cost. Already, a sum or Rs. 200 billion has been allocated for 2018 and furthermore the allocation of resources will be provided to strengthen the health sector.

I have observed criticism from the Opposition for relaxing laws for foreigners and on foreign investment, with which I do not agree at all. This special concession

for foreigners and foreign investment will attract foreigners to invest in our country and much-needed foreign exchange will largely flow into the country. The only way to bridge the Budget deficit is to attract foreign investment and improve exports for the benefit of the country.

To increase foreign export the Budget has allocated Rs. 800 million for "Export Market Access Support" programme. This will boost companies earning less than US Dollars 10 million to enter new export markets and bring prosperity to our country.

Sir, if Sri Lanka is to achieve its goal on advanced economy, it is required to build our future plans on a strong foundation of democracy and reconciliation. We must ensure that the tragedies of the past are forgotten and do not occur again. National integration and reconciliation is a must if we are to achieve our enriched vision. The proposal to construct 50,000 brick and mortar houses in the North and the East will give more relief to people who have suffered for three decades.

Sir, I should thank the Hon. Finance Minister for giving attention to the forcibly-evicted Muslim families from their traditional homes in the Northern Province in 1990 by the LTTE by allocating Rs. 2,500 million to resettle those displaced families who are scattered in all parts of Sri Lanka.

Sir, I wish to state that this years Budget is prepared for the development of the entire nation covering all fields; education, youth empowerment, agriculture, health, employment, housing, land and sports. This will yield fruits by building unity among all communities. The Finance Minister has managed the Budget with great difficulty by imposing a super luxury tax for super vehicles, taxing the rich without passing the burden on to the middle income earners and the poor.

Finally, I wish to place my gratitude to His Excellency the President, Hon. Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera for the splendid Budget Proposals.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana. You have ten minutes.

[5.07p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Presiding Member, the Budget presented by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, last week has received accolades far and wide as a clean, lean and green Budget" for the year 2018, in keeping with our countrys commitment to attaining sustainable, holistic and inclusive development for our populace, along with ensuring that Sri Lanka leads the charge in working towards transforming the world by attaining the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations towards 2030 and creating a new economic and social order for Sri Lanka through meaningful growth.

Having said that, I would also like to say that this Budget, as mentioned by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media at its presentation holds a special significance, making its applicability to the 70th year of our countrys Independence. We, as Sri Lankans, have had a tumultuous history with respect to political, economic and social development since Independence. The history has exhibited time and time again that although our country, with its teeming superlative resources, could have emerged decades ago on the world stage as a superpower, competing or domineering over the Asian tigers, the politics and policies of the past stood in our way. Further, given our countrys diversity and the vibrant social fabric that it promotes, it suggests that if we work together collectively and harmoniously for inclusive development, Sri Lanka is destined for greatness.

Today, we, as Members of this House, have a noble, yet grave and humbling task: being accountable for our past, be it good or bad. Moreover, as we embark on our 70th year of Independence, we have a greater

responsibility towards shaping the future of our country for our children and walking forward united in diversity to a new age of freedom and prosperity for all our fellow citizens.

In my opinion, the proposed Appropriation Bill for 2018 does just that: it works to establish sustainable macroeconomic stability by instilling prudent economic management policies and ensures unrestricted economic stability to achieve the upper-middle income level by 2025. It is important to acknowledge here that all these are being conducted by our Government while facing enormous challenges of immediate and short-term economic vulnerabilities created by Governments of the past and the rising national debt. However, I believe that these challenges are also, in some form, necessary as they, along with the political and social challenges that our country has faced in the past, effectively set the stage to lay a firm foundation based on the pillars of democracy, reconciliation and social equality to commence building an innovation-driven social market economy, accelerating economic growth in a fair and equitable manner.

As a Representative of the Eastern Province, one of the worst-affected provinces in terms of ethnic strife and economic deprivation through the actions of the past, I can clearly state that this Government's policies, effectively exhibited through its third Appropriation Bill since it was formed, acknowledge all aspects of what makes us Sri Lankans unique from the rest and furthermore, exemplify the Governments respect and honour for the diversity of our society to ensure that all stakeholders, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion, caste and creed, work collectively towards the development of our country.

Sir, although Sri Lanka introduced an open economic policy in 1977, the laws that were construed provided vast setbacks that Sri Lanka was unable to keep up with the globalization trends that were occurring all around us. This, among other things, was one of the core reasons why we have not gone where we should have. This Budget, as portrayed in multiple aspects, aims at correcting this by liberalizing our economy with the cooperation of Parliament. It would repeal and amend such laws and introduce new laws to enable our country to be a more vibrant and dynamic market economy, and compete effectively on the world stage.

Sir, I hail from the Eastern Province famed for its teeming resources both in the land and the sea, which contribute effectively to the Blue-Green economy that the Appropriation Bill proposes. The Blue-Green development strategy not only is in line with our countrys international commitments such as the SDGs for 2030 and the COP 2015, but moreover it will generate growth for our country in its most relevant and applicable forms, tailor-made with respect to the resources available.

Our ocean and agricultural resources make Sri Lanka unique. Harnessing these resources and setting policies to ensure that they are adequately utilized, yet all the while ensuring that new and readily available technologies and

831 832

[ ... ]

2017 14

measures are implemented, is necessary so that our economys diversification occurs without creating environmental risks, ecological imbalances and deficits across the board.

Sir, I commend the Hon. Ministers recommendation to amend the vehicle policy which ensures clean, green and environmental sustainability. The Proposal that all vehicles in Sri Lanka to be powered by non-fossil fuel sources by 2040 given the frightening rise in the global carbon footprint is laudable and the measures that he has proposed to enact are entirely feasible to ensure that the public reaps the benefits without being victimized through these reforms. This is evident through incentivizing the usage of renewable energy and bio-degradable equipment to be used cohesively with agricultural, solid waste management and commercial sectors so that sustainable reforms towards building a Green Sri Lanka shall be enacted with cohesive and inclusive participation of all stakeholders.

The Eastern Province is famed worldwide for its postcard coastlines. So, the Proposal to invest in an Integrated Coastal Zone Management mechanism to avoid erosion, pollution and for beach replenishment is vital and necessary. Further, promoting the protection of the ecosystems around lagoons and estuaries - it is something which myself and fellow Representatives of the Batticaloa District have been clamouring for, for a long time - along with capacity building and support provided to those who use these lagoons for a living is an absolute necessity. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Hon. Minister of Finance for recognizing the potentials in the Batticaloa District towards the establishment and strengthening of the Blue-Green economy by completing the model Aquaculture Industrial Park in the Batticaloa District.

As the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Business and Commerce, I must say that the Appropriation Bill, 2018 hits the nail on the head, especially with respect to Enterprise Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Kindly give me, at least, three minutes, please.

It certainly will take Sri Lanka where it has not been before, and further, the creation of a more enabling environment for Foreign Direct Investments coming into Sri Lanka will drive up the scale for holistic economic development. By doing so, the Government effectively facilitates and incentivizes all aspects of the value chain with respect to the private sector, from the grassroots to the elite, along with enacting safety net mechanisms for those that may not succeed, which is a component of a competitive market economy.

The revitalization provided to the SME sector is highly laudable. Ensuring an innovation-drive Budget by way of incentivizing and supporting local entrepreneurs to attain their goals through financing, credit schemes, guarantee funds and grants is commendable. This would fuel growth in innovatory sectors across the board and ensure that Sri Lanka adequately and effectively taps its true potential in the IT sector.

Further, the support for local industries with the introduction of strong Anti-Dumping and Countervailing laws and Consumer Protection laws is highly laudable and the Trade Adjustment Programme would allow local entrepreneurs the boost to compete on the world stage.

I would like to commend the Hon. Minister for recognizing the role of the National Intellectual Property Office which has enormous responsibilities in ensuring the proprietary rights of Sri Lankans are attained, and thereby further incentivizes the growth.

For all these measures to succeed, it is absolutely necessary for the education sector to be enabled to churn out our future generations equipped and educated to take on the reins to ensure continuing development of our country. As such, I must applaud the Hon. Minister for effectively structuring 13 years of education, ensuring that no child is left behind and harnessing each of their skills and abilities equally, with applicable investment in every aspect which is necessary to ensure that all our children receive world-class education.

With respect to the development of the tourism sector, the Hon. Minister has identified the fact that the Eastern Province is in dire need of accessibility development to usher in tourists who flock to Sri Lanka from across the Globe but are wary of the daunting journey to the East coast. I am extremely grateful to the Hon. Minister for promoting further development of Batticaloa and China Bay as domestic hubs through public-private partnership to ensure increased tourism which would give way to the growth of the regional economies in the area.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) I will conclude with this.

I sincerely look forward to working with the Hon. Minister and the relevant authorities in attaining this.

With respect to health, I noted that there is a Proposal for a change in the tax structure; with the hope of reducing consumption of hard liquor, concessions were provided towards soft liquor such as beer and wine. I assume that the Hon. Ministers position on this is to move the country away from hard and illicit liquor consumption and thereby promote a healthier lifestyle, and also promote tourism similar to that of other countries. I would say that this Proposal should be proceeded with caution.

833 834

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) I will wind up. The allowance of concessions towards soft liquor could have detrimental effects on the society, predominantly on the younger generation as it would increase their ability to gain access to these undesirable elements which could lead them down the wrong path, even induce them to use hard liquor in the future. I am of the strong opinion that the Government should not allow concessions on harmful substances to health and society, be it hard or soft, but instead put on further restrictions while allowing certain exceptions with respect to tourist establishments and the likes, if absolutely necessary.

Sir, allow me to state that this Appropriation Bill for 2018 is not just a representation of stable and promising economic policies that would take this country forward, but it is more importantly an effective representation of an apt recognition of activating the mechanisms to harness Sri Lankas true potential while preserving its values, diversity, culture and heritage; an inclusive and holistic development.

Sir, I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and further, for the gravitas and exceptional leadership displayed in providing the framework for setting this country in the right path, I thank His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Thank you.

STATEMENT MADE BY LORD NASEBY ON WAR CRIMES IN

SRI LANKA

[6.31p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Presiding Member, I intend to place before the House the following Motion at Adjournment time. I hope the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs would answer on behalf of the Government.

I move,

This House resolves that, since Lord Naseby, addressing Britains House of Lords, drew attention to the fact that the casualty figures for the last period of the civil conflict in Sri Lanka, which ended in May 2009, cited in the United Nations Darusman Report, were brought into question by the figures quoted by former UN spokesman Gordon Weiss, by former US Ambassador Blake, in the report by the UKs Major General Holmes, and finally, by the heavily-redacted communications from the UKs Lieutenant Colonel Anton Gash released to him by the British Government; and since he further stated that the UK must recognise that this was

859 860

[ ]

2017 14

a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights and that the West, and in particular the US and UK, must remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans, especially their leaders, the Government of Sri Lanka should take action to pursue this matter with Britains Foreign and Commonwealth Office and with the UN Human Rights Commission to change their unjust positions in regard to Sri Lanka and thereby remove the threat to this country, to its defence forces, and to its leaders, and that the Government should also report back to Parliament on this matter.

Sir, I would like to add that the figure given by the so-called Western sponsors of the Resolution was 40,000. This figure has now been totally negated by Lord Naseby in the House of Lords. He says that the figure is much less than 7,000.

I would like to place this fact on record, Hon. Presiding Member. This clears us of genocide. The allegation of genocide was used with false figures. This was the basis of the Resolution. I disagree with the Deputy Minister, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, who says Lord Nasebys revelations are not directly relevant to the UPR. This is incorrect, because the Resolution itself depended on the 40,000 figure.

Secondly, Lord Nasebys statement brings new information to the entire scene, which was not available earlier. Through the information that was available, he has brought out these figures, which shows that new information such as what has been brought by Lord Naseby on the Sri Lankan Human Rights situation should be placed by the Sri Lanka Government in Geneva. Sri Lanka Government cannot dodge this. Why are you all trying to dodge this by making a statement that it has no relevance in this regard? I would like to thank the Hon. Deputy Minister. I do not have much time. I quote what you have stated. I think in a personal note to Lord Naseby, you had thanked him. But, that is not the Sri Lanka Governments stand.

That is why we are moving this Motion. The Government must take a stand, take up what Lord Naseby has canvassed for Sri Lanka, request the UK Government to change its course of action against Sri Lanka in Geneva and recanvass this whole Resolution that was moved against Sri Lankas armed forces, the heroes of the war, in collaboration with Britains Foreign and Commonwealth Office and with the UN Human Rights Commission.

I would like to refer to the relevant sections of what Lord Naseby has stated in the House of Lords on 12th October, 2017, I quote:

The West, and in particular the US and UK, must remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans, especially their leaders. We in the UK should reflect on the sacrifices of thousands of young Sri Lankan soldiers who died to create peace in that country. Finally, I reflect that Sri Lanka came to our need in two world wars and had casualties, and it was one of just a handful of countries who supported

It is very clear that the British Government should be recanvassed by the Sri Lanka Government on this basis.

This is fresh information that has come. I do not know whether the Hon. Minister is going to be in the House to reply. This is a very serious situation because, before the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva left for Geneva the day before, he made this utterance that it has no relevance.

How can the Minister, the Deputy Minister or whoever representing Sri Lanka make a statement that the Lord Nasebys statement has no relevance in the current affairs in Geneva? We are being let down; it is a total let-down of the country. I hope that the State Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hon. Vasantha Senanayake would take this message to His Excellency the President to intervene in this situation even at this last moment when the Session is scheduled to be held in Geneva.

We also sent him a letter of appreciation thanking him for raising this issue on behalf of Sri Lanka and for finding the truth for Sri Lanka when our Foreign Office is keeping silent. This is a job of the Foreign Office to find information and feed back to the Head Office in Colombo. Our High Commissioner or a special messenger should be sent to London to collect this information. That is what a Foreign Office must do, but we are keeping silent and wanting our soldiers and heroic leaders to be taken to these Geneva Commissions. We condemn that. I propose that this Motion to the House to be adopted and taken to the higher levels of this Government.

Thank you.

[6.45p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Motion.

I agree that we must first extend our great thanks to Lord Naseby for his address in the House of Lords, which was an eye-opener and a clearing to the world. I think we should thank him for bringing out his stand in this manner.

However much our Sri Lankan society needs an overall justice about the whole issue, despite the reports made internationally or locally with regard to the

863 864

2017 14

violation of human rights, we would like to see that it is reported in an independent and an impartial manner. The numbers are irrelevant. Whether it is the then Government of Sri Lanka or the present Government of Sri Lanka, it is our duty to ensure the outcome after an independent process. We should focus more on prevention approach in the future and ensure non-recurrence of past violence. Therefore, we will have to clarify such kind of international reports.

I really admire and appreciate Lord Naseby, who is a friend of Sri Lanka and a personal friend of mine as well. When we visited London with the former Speaker, he paid a courtesy call. He has very clearly and openly said that the UK must recognize that this war was a war against terrorism. So, the rules of engagement are based on International Humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights. For that, we must admire him and thank him on behalf of everybody. This is my observation.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much. The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake.

[6.48p.m.] ( ( - ) The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, the Adjournment Motion that has been placed before this House today is based on the observations that Lord Naseby made in his recent address to the House of Lords. The Motion calls on the Government to take action to pursue his comments with the international community to remove the threat to this country, to its defence forces, and to its leaders.

Sir, in light of the excellent relationship that Sri Lanka now enjoys with the international community and the confidence that the international community has that Sri Lanka will honour its undertakings made to the international community, I cannot perceive a threat to this country either with regard to defence forces or its leaders present or former.

Certainly the information unearthed by Lord Naseby highlights the professional conduct of the Sri Lankan Army during the period of the war and this information must be used by the Government and the Opposition parties and all those who consider themselves Sri Lankans or friends of Sri Lanka to counter the blatant falsehoods that were spread about the country and the war. It is then our common duty to combat deliberate misinformation

and the findings of the Rt. hon. Lord Naseby is greatly useful to further this purpose.

However, we must not in all this lose sight of the new Government's role as a respected member of the international community and it must be emphasized that the Government of the United Kingdom is a strongly supportive one. We have traditionally enjoyed a very close link with the United Kingdom even after Independence, which Sri Lanka won through artful negotiations, unlike neighbouring India. We retained much of the old Government structure and the Constitution and also invoked a Defence Agreement with the UK immediately after becoming independent. This shows the level of trust we have always enjoyed with the UK.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, there is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I just need a clarification. Hon. State Minister, you are aware of the fact that the UN Resolution 30/1 was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka. That Resolution states about 40,000 people, criminal action to be taken, reparation and so on. Your intention or contention of nullifying the reports has to have a ground reality. Where is it happening? Is it taking place? We are very appreciative of the fact that you have sent a personal note.

( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) If you will bear with me, I will come to the point.

It was due to our short sighted policies that took Sri Lanka to an isolated position in the world and isolated us from our friends, including the United Kingdom.

Sir, regarding Lord Naseby's statement, let me reiterate the Government's deep appreciation to him for the continuous and long standing support and friendship he has extended to Sri Lanka and I table* the letter dated 2nd November, 2017 sent by His Excellency th President to Lord Naseby appreciating his work.

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

I wish to inform the House that I made it my purpose to meet with him almost immediately after I had been appointed State Minister of Foreign Affairs as far back as June this year.I also informed His Excellency the President that it is imperative that we acknowledge his efforts and I took the initiative upon the President's concurrence to strongly support Lord Naseby. I did so not in my private capacity, I did so as the State Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka. I wish to assure the Members of the House that all due respect is being given to Lord Naseby and his good work.

Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, my good Friend basically made a statement in the House that attempts were being made to trivialize the value of Lord Naseby's work and to label it as irrelevant. I wish to very strongly state that it is not my personal view and that it is not the view of the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka. I wish to state very strongly that the work and the value -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I appreciate what you say that it is not the view of the Foreign Ministry and also it is not your view. If so, how did the representative of Sri Lanka, who is now attending on behalf of Sri Lankan Government, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, make that statement?

( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) It is a statement attributed to him. I do not know whether he actually made it or not. I would be surprised if the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva actually made such a statement. This is what I can state for myself.

I would also like to quote my own letter. There has been a lot of speculation on my letter, but I do not think very many people have actually read my letter. I think, if I were given an opportunity to read my letter, perhaps my position on Lord Naseby affair will become manifestly clear. My letter states:

"Dear Lord Naseby,

I am writing to thank you formally for the invaluable work you have been doing on behalf of Sri Lanka. We are well aware of your great efforts in the past, but what you have contributed in the last few months is particularly important at a crucial time.

It was very insightful of you to ask for the despatches of the British Defence Attache who served here during the last years of the long conflict from which this country suffered. Though the British Foreign Office appears to have forgotten what are undoubtedly salient elements, what you have brought into the public domain makes it

clear that the Sri Lankan armed forces fought a much cleaner war than is often alleged in the international arena. I suspect, that if some of the redaction is removed from the documents already made available to you, the sincerity of the Sri Lankan armed forces will become undisputed.

This redaction according to the explanation given to you is purportedly for securing confidentiality between the British Foreign Office and friendly nations of the international community, however, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned we are quite certain that the original version without redaction will in no way be embarrassing to us. Therefore, we must ask ourselves, why extraordinary lengths have been resorted to, to deprive yourself, one of the senior-most and respected Peers in the House of Lords, of pertinent information? and why indeed what has been given to you subjected to redaction?

It was also very good of you to speak so much more forcefully at the recent debate in the House of Lords. It is particularly important to deal with the various canards that are being spread and your arguments go to show that the number of civilian deaths was significantly smaller than is being bandied about are clear and irrefutable.

I hope that we in Sri Lanka will be able to build on your work, to ensure that our victory over the terrorists who inflicted such suffering on all our people, Tamils as well as Sinhalese and Muslims, is not traduced.

I look forward to meeting you on my next visit to England and hope too that you will once again visit this country to which, and to all its people, you have shown such deep commitment.

I fully consent to your using or reproducing this letter, if it will in any way assist you in your laudable mission of bringing real justice to Sri Lanka.

I think my letter makes my position extremely clear.
