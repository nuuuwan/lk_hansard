asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs:

(a) Will he inform this House -

(i) whether he is aware of the existence of a government called Transnational Government of the Tamil Eelam intent on the establishment of a separate state called Eelam within Sri Lanka; a parliament called Transnational Constituent Assembly comprising 135 members; and a post of Prime Minister to which a person by the name of Vishwanadan Rudrakumaran has been appointed; and

(ii) whether he admits that Australian and Denmark Governments have displayed the name of Tamil Eelam in their websites as a legitimate state?

(b) Will he inform this House -

(i) whether there are any other countries other than Tibet and Tamil Eelam, which do not have a geographical territory; and

(ii)` of the steps taken to prevent this illegitimate government from functioning effectively in the United States of America, Canada and Europe?

(c) If not, why?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) There is no government in existence called the "Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam" ( TGTE.) We are aware, however, of a self-styled group of persons calling themselves TGTE.

No country, no government, no Member State of the United Nations, no international organization or legal entity has recognized this self-styled group as a government, or as a government in exile.

(ii) The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)

had listed "Tamil Eelam" as a country classification on its website, which could be selected as the "country of birth" for the Australian census of 2016.

The High Commission of Sri Lanka in Australia brought this to the attention of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 8th August, 2016. Following representations made, the reference to "Tamil Eelam" was removed from the website of the ABS the following day, 9th August, 2016.

The Chief of the ABS has written to the Sri Lanka High Commission informing that the ABS has never recognized "Tamil Eelam" as a country, and assuring that this term will not appear in any data published from the 2016 Census of Population and Housing, consistent with the broader Australian Government recognition of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Moreover, the Australian Government, in November 2016, extended its ban on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for a further period of three years after reviewing the LTTEs listing under Australias Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. "Tamil Eelam" had been listed as a country

eligible for Danish visas on the Danish Immigration Service website in September, 2016. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs

took immediate high priority action to probe this, and rectified what they termed as an inadvertent error, and mistake made by the Danish Immigration on its website. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark has also apologized on behalf of the Danish Government. (b) (i) Tibet is an autonomous region of China. There is no country called "Tamil Eelam". (ii) There is no Government called TGTE as explained above. (c) The Government of Sri Lanka remains constantly vigilant; and cooperates extremely closely with all relevant bilateral partners on intelligence sharing. The LTTE remains banned in the list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist activities of the USA, Canada and the European Union. ( ) (The Hon.

INFOMATION QUOTED IN PARLIAMENT BY HON.

BIMAL RATHNAYAKE ON 24th JANUARY, 2017:

STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FINANCE

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - Minister of Finance) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake, yesterday in Parliament informed that he had received a copy of the Report or the Executive Summary which had been delivered by the Auditor-General to me and also to the Chairman of COPE. Accordingly, he quoted some of the information from that Report during the Debate.

This is a special Report on examination of books of the Central Bank. I, in the capacity of the Minister of Finance, requested on the19th of August, 2016, from the Auditor-General, under Section 43(2) of the Monetary Law Act, the examination of books of Central Bank relating to direct/private placements in Government Securities since 2008, on per year basis, on areas specified in my letter, be submitted to me within three months.

347 348

Sir, I am also utilizing a letter that had been delivered to the Auditor-General by the Attorney-General on the 12th of February, 2004 regarding "accountability and audit of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka" where he has emphasized the fact that confidential and privileged information in the hands of the Auditor-General should not be divulged to anybody unless and otherwise the Minister of Finance or the Prime Minister or the President gives the exemption. So, Sir, I would like to table* this letter to be included in Hansard in order to ensure that such a letter has been issued and it has been complied with by the previous Auditors-General.

After several reminders, the Auditor-General has delivered to me a set of volumes of information without a signed audit examination report. That information has also been delivered openly without using even a closed official envelope despite the market sensitivity of information contained in the volumes. Further, the examination requested has not been completed as yet. In addition, he has stated that adequate time could not be spent for the examination due to the impatient and unethical reminders of the Minister of Finance, which leads to the breach of my privileges as the Minister and this has been commented by the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake during the Debate.

The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake said that there are officials who have the capacity or the courage to tell what is true. Today, we have given that right to all officials, not only to the Auditor-General. We are relishing the fact that democracy has been reborn in our country. But, that does not mean that you can have arrogant Government servants who usurp powers which is only in the hands of Parliament. The Auditor-General is a creature of Parliament and he is answerable to Parliament, not to the general public. So, these are matters that are of grave concern.

Further, the same set of information has simultaneously been delivered to the Chairman of COPE and to the Governor of the Central Bank without my knowledge. This examination should contain information and findings strictly for my use for the purpose of making new policies in respect of issuance of Government securities and public debt management.

The volumes contain a large pool of individual information and details of issuance of Government securities which is highly market sensitive. Meanwhile, I have just received a fax from the Ministry of Finance dated 19th August, 2016 saying that there is no letter or an Executive Summary that has been delivered to the Ministry of Finance up to this moment by the Auditor- General on this score. I table* that as well.

As I said before, the Hon. Attorney General in his letter E118/03/C1B5 dated 12th February, 2004 addressed to the Auditor-General has set out the grounds for

confidentiality of sensitive information relating to the Central Bank and the requirement to be complied with by the Auditors-General when disclosing such sensitive information. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Auditor-General has breached the information confidentiality requirement and the relevant procedures. He has a penchant for talking to the media, more than providing information to the Government or to Parliament and I guess this is another instance.

Sir, leakage of this type of information will adversely affect Government security market operations, issuance of government securities to raise funds for budgetary requirements and interest rates structure in the economy. This will raise the cost to the government in borrowing from the market. Sir, as I mentioned yesterday, there are some unscrupulous officials who are still in the Central Bank who had been employed by the former Governor. Their activities are detrimental to the economy. So, these are only hand in glove operations that seem to be happening.

In view of the above, I propose that the Auditor-General has acted unprofessionally and unofficially without due care for public duty.

Sir, the Hon. Speaker had been very quick yesterday to send the reports wherever that was due and I would also appreciate, if information that was used by MPs yesterday to corroborate evidence also will be looked at, as to how they got it. And, I must say, as the Executive Summary or a letter has not come in, I have not instructed anybody to receive any copy. So, revealing information that I have asked for to somebody outside without even my knowledge is something which is serious, unbecoming, unprofessional and that is not the way the Auditors-General in the past have acted. These are not matters that should be taken lightly.

The statement quoting him in the headlines of the Sunday Times says that unethical practices are adopted by the Minister of Finance. Sir, my job is to ensure, when the President or the Prime Minister wants information, as an active and a responsible Minister of Finance that I respond to them. To do that, I need to get substantial corroborative evidence. This is the reason why I basically wrote to him and I have been getting intermittent replies saying that the Central Bank is unable to provide information. So, if that is the case, if that is the sensitivity and if that information is sacrosanct, how has it gone into the general public? So, I would greatly appreciate if this will be looked into and responded by tomorrow at the latest because we have got to take further counter-action. I hold everybody responsible. Especially if the rates of the cost of capital goes up, they will be held responsible for doing such irresponsible and detrimental acts to the economy.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Prime Minister, this issue has been going on for one-and-a-half years now. Under the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, Independent Commissions were brought in. The Audit Service Commission is one such Commission. When we raised it under the Presidents Vote, the President gave an assurance to the House that the relevant Bill would be gazetted on the 09th of January. Today is the 25th of January and it has not yet been gazetted. All the audit functions come under that, Hon. Prime Minister. It strengthens the Auditor-General, not weakens him. So, I think the Government must keep to its pledge and bring in this Audit Service Commission.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The Audit Service Commission Bill has been drafted and the Ministry of Finance is going through that finally. So, I think, at the moment, the Hon. Minister of Finance and the Auditor-General can meet and discuss their views on the Bill. After that, it will be submitted to the Cabinet.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. Next, Notice of Motions at the Commencement of Public Business.
