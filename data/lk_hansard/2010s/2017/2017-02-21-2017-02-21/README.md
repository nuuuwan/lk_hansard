Three months back, I appointed a special Committee and that Committee is evaluating all those requests. In the near future, they will forward a report to me. Then an appropriate decision could be taken. Your request is being considered very favourably.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Member, with regard to that request, earlier Ministers in an ad hoc manner upgraded local bodies from Pradeshiya Sabhas to Nagara Sabhas. I have appointed a Committee which would evaluate on a marks scheme and make appropriate decisions. These requests could be forwarded to that Committee. There was a public notification three months back where any citizen

who wants a local body to be upgraded could make a request to that Committee. If you forward your request to me, I can forward it to that Committee.

SRI LANKA EXPORT DEVELOPMENT ACT: ORDER

[2.28 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Speaker, I move, That the Order made by the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade under Section 14 of the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979 relating to Cess and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1992/52 of 11th November 2016, which was presented on 26.01.2017 be approved.

(Cabinet approval signified.) Hon. Speaker, I would like to give an overview of Sri Lankas exports and growth as it is now. As we have known, our growth has been okay, but it has been internally oriented. Sri Lankas annualized real GDP growth from 1990 to 2014 was around 5.4 per cent with low volatility over the period and consumption and investment were the primary contributors to growth. Compared to several South East and East Asian comparator countries, Sri Lanka has seen very little GDP growth coming from exports.

1297 1298

The export component of growth in Sri Lanka has generally weakened over time. Relative to the comparator countries, the contribution of exports to growth was low, especially from the late 1990s through 2010 and remained low in absolute terms from 2010 to 2014. Even right now, export growth remains low. This lack of export growth contributes to pressures in Sri Lankas balance of payments, which have constrained overall economic growth potential. Sri Lankas trade deficit - ranging from minus 6 to minus 14 per cent of GDP since 1990 - drives a persistent current account deficit, which has generally not been matched by capital inflows. Sri Lanka drew down on international reserves in 2015 to fill the gap in its balance of payments, which led to elevated levels of macroeconomic risk and increased borrowing cost for the Government, until IMF support agreement was signed in April, 2016.

Our exports have diversified very little over the last 20 years while most comparator countries are getting significant growth from new exports. Over 90 per cent of Sri Lankas goods exports are focused in products that it first began exporting with a revealed comparative advantage prior to the 1990s, products including garments, tea and other agricultural goods, rubber goods, and precious stones. Meanwhile, Thailand, which once had a similar export basket to Sri Lanka, continued to diversify into electronics in the 1990s and then into transportation and chemical products. Vietnam, which had a very similar export basket to Sri Lanka in 1995, has diversified rapidly over the last ten years.

Sri Lanka remains stuck exporting products, mainly apparel and agricultural products, where it competes with primarily lower income countries, which creates a wage ceiling for these industries. For instance, we compete with Kenya and India for global market share in tea and compete with India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam in garments.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have only two more minutes, but, I think you are willing to continue.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Yes. Please give me another two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, go ahead. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Wages paid by exporting industries are lower than most non-tradable industries, such as construction or transport and especially lower than public administration

work. To maintain competitive international prices, several major export industries in Sri Lanka are forced to keep wages low and they therefore struggle to find and retain workers as incomes increase in the country. Garment exports from Sri Lanka have managed to maintain a global market share through innovation, higher quality products and supplying niche markets through buyer-driven global value chains. However, on the whole, export productivity has not kept pace with overall productivity in Sri Lanka.

By contrast, most comparator countries export more diversified baskets of products including machinery and electrical products, which are often linked through producer-driven global value chains. Research has shown that these product categories tend to be of higher complexity and the countries that export these products tend to have the capabilities and know-how to produce many different products making further diversification more likely. Research further shows that countries with higher economic complexity tend to achieve higher levels of income and stronger future economic growth as workers can specialize in areas where their productivity is highest, which supports innovation and sustained wage growth. Many of these more complex products exported by the comparator countries are linked through producer-driven value chains, which allow for further specialization among countries, but which often require investment in production from multinational corporations in order to gain a foothold.

Hon. Speaker, it is also necessary for us to diversify our export markets. Since we have been exporting to our traditional markets such as the United States, the UK and the European Union, the time has come for us to look at new markets now. In this regard, we are in the process of negotiating several bilateral trade agreements with countries such as China, Singapore and we are also looking at Japan and Korea and entering into strategic partnerships with Thailand. We are also looking at invigorating our FTA with Pakistan and, at the same time, looking at comprehensive economic and technological cooperation with India.

Hon. Speaker, this is the only way forward for our country and I seek the support of all the Members of this House to ensure that we achieve our targets. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have nine minutes.

[5.49 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak. I can remember, sometime back, the Hon. Prime Minister stated in this august Assembly that we need Rs. 2,000 billion per month to run this country, of which 50 per cent - Rs. 1,000 billion - goes for repayment of loans. I think this is the biggest problem we are facing today. So, it is high time for us to take a decision as a country and as a Government to find solutions without blaming each other. If we are to exist, definitely we have to increase exports and reduce imports. How are we going to do it? This is the biggest problem we are facing today. Are we going to increase our exports or are we going to keep on borrowing and repaying loans for ages for what we have borrowed earlier? I think we have to change this situation.

Actually, much was spoken about the Hambantota Port which is a big issue, and then the tyre factory and the car factory. When we went to Hambantota, we saw the situation there. It is useless to blame the earlier

1367 1368

Government. It is a fact that flights are not coming and ships are not coming, but we have to keep on repaying the loans. That is why His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister after discussion, spoke to the Chinese Government and came to an arrangement in such a way that if it is given to the Chinese Government, the income will definitely be increased and factories will come up, by which there will be more employment. As far as I know, a large portion of the loans given by the Chinese Government will also be reduced.

When you take the issue of the tyre factory, what has been happening so far is that we have been exporting raw rubber at a low price and importing tyres and almost all other rubber items. So, by constructing that factory, I am sure we will be able to use raw rubber to produce our own tyres for vehicles and in addition produce all rubber products. It is the same with the car factory. We will be increasing employment opportunities by constructing that car factory. By doing all these, not only will we increase exports, but we will reduce the imports also. Then, the problem of unemployment can also be solved. Sir, we may be in the Government or in the Opposition, but we must think of the country.

Last month, Members of the Government - both UNP and SLFP - and the Joint Opposition, we all went to China. What did we do there? From morning till evening, we were taken to places where they had projects. Wherever we went, there were projects which were planned for ten to fifteen years. On those plans, they have been continuing the projects by which the country is reaching its goals. Likewise, we too have to take a decision and go forward.

Sir, I come from the Puttalam District where we have coconut. Earlier, we spoke only of tea, rubber and coconut as export products. Today, coconut industry has been completely wiped out. I am not blaming anybody. But the reason is, during the last 10 to 15 years, coconut lands were given to big companies like Chilaw Plantations Limited, Kurunegala Plantations Limited and the JEDB. They neglected coconut plantations and now they have gone to the extent of cutting down coconut trees instead of replanting. I am bringing this out to say that 50 per cent of the coconut lands are barren, therefore the production has gone down. As a result, 50 per cent of the oil mills are closed today; 25 per cent of the desiccated coconut factories are not functioning. Sir, BCC had one of the biggest mills in our country, but today it is closed. The reason is, we do not have sufficient raw material.

Sir, I must thank the Hon. Navin Dissanayake, Minister of Plantation Industries. He has taken the trouble to replant. If this had been done 10 -15 years ago under the earlier Government, I am sure, the coconut production would have been doubled by now and almost all those oil factories and desiccated coconut factories would have been functioning today. I was also an oil and DC miller. Because of politics I had to give up all that. I can remember, our desiccated coconut was equivalent to what

was exported from the Philippines. Since our coconut oil had less fat content, we had a lot of exports those days. All these things have gone down today and we have gone to the extent of importing coconut oil and other oils to fulfil our needs. Not only that, even employment opportunities have gone down. So, these are the things we have to think about.

I must also speak about my Leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister of Industry and Commerce. He is trying his level best to reopen the mills and industries which have been closed. Not only that, he has gone to the extent of helping private people by providing incentives and also giving them lands to start factories and so on, so that we can not only export coconut, but can also produce whatever we can in Sri Lanka to reduce the imports.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Presiding Member, I remember that the Hon. Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, one time during the crisis told the people, Take just two or three spoonfuls of sugar. I will produce the required amount of sugar within two years. People listened to him and reduced the consumption of sugar. By the end of the third year, he was able to produce sugar in the country. Like that, we all must get together, leaving all our political differences for the sake of the country. Then, I am sure, in future whoever comes to power will have a better country to govern.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much. . 14 .
