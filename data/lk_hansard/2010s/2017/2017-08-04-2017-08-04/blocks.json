    "text": "most senior and seasoned politicians and presently, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe entered Parliament for the first time in 1977. I, too, entered Parliament, for the first time, in 1977. We met each other for the first time as fellow Members of Parliament. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe has continued to serve as a Member of Parliament for 40 years. I, however, vacated my Seat in Parliament voluntarily in 1983 consequent to certain things that happened at that point of time. In fact, my Party had 18 Members of Parliament in 1977 and two of them have left us and my other 16 Colleagues also voluntarily vacated their Seats in 1983. I might mention that I was the first Member of Parliament to lose my Seat in 1983. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe had, during this period of 40 years, served as a Deputy Minister, a Minister and a Prime Minister. Inclusive of his present term, he has served Prime Minister for the fourth time. This, Mr. Speaker, is in itself an outstanding and significant achievement. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe has also served as the Leader of the Opposition. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe is by nature, a very calm, a very stable and also a very subtle person. He is not one who could be easily ruffled. He is, in that sense, a formidable person. I might say a formidable opponent. It is well known that he has a very wide knowledge of men and matters and that his vast experience in the public sphere, to a great extent, influenced all the work that he was engaged in. He is respected both domestically and internationally as a leader with a vision. This aspect of his personality perhaps needs to bear fruit in a more visible manner in the future. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe was prepared to take decisions which he considered to be in the best interests of the country irrespective of any other consideration. A crucial decision taken by Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe was that taken to field Mr. Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Opposition Candidate at the Presidential Election held in 2015. There was pressure for Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe to be the Opposition Candidate. He, however, boldly and wisely decided that Mr. Maithripala Sirisena would be the Common Opposition Candidate. The result at the election justified his decision and the country has embarked on a journey widely different from that pursued by the former Government. This was a significant contribution made by Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe towards the betterment of the countrys future. The benefits that have accrued from that victory must be utilized fully for the benefit of the country. When we talk of the larger interests of the country, Sir, it is perhaps with Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe's future that we are more concerned. The economy needs to be redeemed. The national question needs to be resolved.",

    "text": "They are linked to each other. They are inextricably linked to each other. The thirty-year armed conflict is one of the primary causes for the parlous state of affairs in the economy. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe has always taken a progressive and pragmatic view on the national question. Resolution of the national question would make a big contribution towards the redemption of the national economy. All the steps contemplated by Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe vastly enhanced domestic and foreign investment in various fields of the economy, particularly export-oriented manufacture and growth, promotion of tourism and developing Sri Lanka as an economic hub in the region can succeed to the extent of its full potential only if the national question is resolved in a just, reasonable and acceptable manner. His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe need to work together to enable the country to succeed in these two objectives. Today, Sri Lanka enjoys the goodwill and support of the world. This needs to be preserved and developed. This can only be achieved by President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe working together to achieve these two objectives. The two of them owe this to an undivided, indivisible, just and prosperous Sri Lanka and to all its people. On my behalf, Sir, and on behalf of all the Members of Parliament representing the Tamil National Alliance and the Tamil people particularly in the North and the East, and on behalf of all the people of this country, we convey our very best wishes and felicitations to the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe and wish him the very best. Thank you, Sir.",

    "text": "Hon. Speaker, we have gathered today to celebrate 40 years of Parliamentary and public service of our Prime Minister. 1977, the year that he entered Parliament, was a transformational year in the post-independence history of this country. Unshackling a fully-insulated, centrally directed socialist economy and introducing a market-driven open economy while having to retain the essential features of a welfare state is a very difficult balancing act for any Head of State or Prime Minister. In our Prime Minister, we have someone who is endowed with those essential qualities of patience and perseverance that is necessary to surmount all these difficulties and steer the ship of Government. Coming into politics with President J.R. Jayewardene who believed in market reform and free enterprise being the key driving forces to achieve economic growth and social advancement, our Prime Minister today, is following the social market economic principles which are the guiding principles of our Government. His political trajectory is intrinsically embedded in the 1977 economic revolution. I would dare say, arguably he is the sharpest intellect in our contemporary political scene. Though some may say or some may see his human chemistry as somewhat wanting at times which is unavoidable for any leader at the helm of power with all the stress of day-to-day political pressures, even his worst enemies would notice one special trait in him. That is whenever he speaks in Parliament, even in his most aggressive presentations, he is rarely seen as intimidating. That is an essential quality of a mature political leader, which is quite unique to the Hon. RanilWickremesinghe. He is undoubtedly one of our most gifted leaders. High office sought him out not due to destiny but for his quintessential quality of steadfast loyalty to his Party and his policy consistency. When I talk of Party loyalty, I would like to remind the Hon. Members of this House particularly, the loyalty he showed President Premadasa when he faced the impeachment in the House. Such qualities are the reasons why he was able to surmount all the vicissitudes of the political winds in this country and rise to the position of Prime-ministership four times. I must say on a personal note, I was perhaps one of those people who associated with him in his last two ascensions to the Office of Prime-ministership. Firstly, in 2001, when I was somewhat unceremoniously removed",

    "text": "from Cabinet, being the astute political leader he is, he seized that political opportunity and engineered the necessary defections from the Government to install his own Government within five months of that incidenthappening in this House. We also saw certain other qualities in him. I must particularly say that sometimes he is unfairly criticized. That is inevitable when you hold public office. I am perhaps the only one left in this House now who were part of his negotiating team with the LTTE. I will witness one thing. Several people sometimes find fault with him for having signed the Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE. Those who are pragmatic enough to understand the political situation then, with our international airport being attacked by the LTTE, the new Government had a few options, but to also look at the sentiments of the international community and putting together the Co-chair concept bringing together Washington, Brussels, Tokyo and New Delhi as well as Norway, New Delhi in an indirect manner, to negotiate with the LTTE. He is, sometimes, unfairly criticized for many things. But, I would here say which many people may not know that if the Hon. RanilWickremesinghe unconditionally agreed to the Interim Self-Governing Authority proposed by the LTTE, he would have been the President in 2005; he would have won the Parliamentary Elections in 2004. So, I am one of those witnesses to the fact that he steadfastly refused to agree to pressure by even our facilitators to look at ISGA unconditionally and agree to some of those issues contained in the Interim Self-Governing Authority document. Hon. Speaker, I must also hasten here to say that when the previous administration, of which I was also unfortunately a Member, was blinded by the euphoria of a military victory and unfortunately allowed xenophobic forces to raise their ugly head and create racial disharmony in the country, the Hon. Prime Minister from the Opposition Benches then and also, during the term of this Government for a brief period, when these same forces once again were trying to disturb the hard-fought harmony among ethnicities that we have restored in this country, he was steadfast in condemning them and taking the necessary action to bring such forces to account. So, I must here take this opportunity to wish the Hon. Prime Minister for the yeoman service he has rendered the country. I must also hasten to add one more thing, Mr. Speaker. I am somewhat saddened today to see that the decency that we Members of this House should observe on solemn occasions like this has sunk to the lowest levels by some of our Members in the Opposition boycotting this Felicitation Motion. This is a very sorry state of affairs. In my 23 years of Parliamentary life, this is perhaps the first",

And therefore, I must say, some of the Members in the Opposition have compromised their principles for the sake of cheap political expediency. Having said that, may I take this opportunity to say that Hon. RanilWickremesinghe was and is indeed an iconic leader, a stature. I am bold to say as a leader of a minority Party that only a very few lived to endure in amity and harmony with everyone in this country. We wish our Hon. Prime Minister well and invoke Gods blessings on his fortieth year in politics. On my personal behalf as well as other Members of my Party, we wish him many more years of success and strength.

Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was a very young Parliamentarian who entered Sri Lankas political system at a historic juncture from the Biyagama Electorate when late President J.R. Jayewardene had led the country into a new economic journey with the introduction of open-trade policies in 1977. His journey in Sri Lankan politics and immensurable service extended to the country are inspiring directions to any politician who wishes to serve the nation. After entering Parliament in 1977, he steadily progressed in his political journey having entrusted with many ministerial portfolios and even holding the office of Prime Minister thrice, previously.",

He has pioneered in addressing the needs of the youth and in directing them for self-employment. The establishment of the National Youth Services Council has been a tremendous success with multiple benefits to the youth even today. Later, as the Minister of Industries, Science and Technology, he has contributed to the second phase of economic liberalization since 1989. The Biyagama Free Trade Zone was his creation that helped many young men and women to find employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the economic prosperity of our motherland. His unvarying aim of providing employment to youth as a means of economic development in the country continues even at present, as the Prime Minister for the fourth time. His vision of creating one million new employment opportunities for the youth without a burden to the taxpayer will bring economic prosperity to this nation. More importantly, taking up the challenges to introduce large-scale reforms to the economy in many aspects at present in his fourth term as the Prime Minister is commendable. Increasing export capacities, developing new technology-based industries, development of Western Province through the Megapolis project, and continuing efforts to convert our country to a knowledge-based economy are some of his targets for which we are happy to contribute in all possible ways. Towards leading this process he has initiated new market access through FTAs with China, Singapore and strengthening the existing FTA with India. I, as the former Minister of Export Development and presently as the Minister of Industry and Commerce, congratulate him for all his new initiatives to expand our trade to the global market. Hon. Speaker, our Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe had a firm commitment and leadership to regain GSP Plus for the country and to remove the fisheries ban imposed by the EU. He has succeeded both these hard-gained achievements even before he completed two years in office as the Prime Minister. As the Minister of Industry and Commerce, I believe GSP Plus is a great achievement for Sri Lanka in recent history. I am confident that his vision for Sri Lanka with all these industry reforms and directing the country to a knowledge-based economy will bring in great rewards for the Sri Lankan economy in future. I wish to mention that before I joined the UNF Alliance, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe undertook the responsibility to resettle the Muslim refugees who were chased out within two hours by the terrorists from their native places in the North. In spite of various challenges he has kept his word by appointing a Task Force under my Chairmanship in this regard. I too was a refugee. We",
