( ) (The Hon. Chairman) He did not mention your name. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) He mentioned my name. He said that I prepared a gazette which was faulty, but I wish to state that my action was challenged in court and it was subsequently withdrawn.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) That is correct. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) So, there is no wrongdoing established on my part and there is no judicial-[Interruption.] He can have the view that the gazette is incorrect, but until and otherwise a court pronounces that there is a wrongdoing on my part, he cannot take up the position that the gazette is faulty.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) That is very clear. ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) The case was filed on your advice and subsequently withdrawn on your advice. That is the problem.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) What is your clarification, Hon. Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha ) Hon. Chairman, this is a delimitation process carried out by a Delimitation Committee appointed during the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Its Report took three years to be completed. So, by the time it was handed over, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena was the President of this country. So, when it was tendered for the Gazette, it had to be signed by the incumbent President. Therefore, if one is trying to take cover -

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) He is not talking about what happened after he became the President.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) No, he is talking about what happened after he became the President.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay, you can clarify it. - [ Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) He signed that Gazette as the President of the country. - [ Interruption.] His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena did not sign the Gazette prior to that as he was the Minister of Health. He signed the Gazette as the President of the country. - [ Interruption.]That process started under President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2012.

( ) (The Hon. Prasanna Ranatunga) President Sirisena was the General Secretary of our Party at that time. - [ Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) And that delimitation process took three years. As a fact, it had to be signed by His Excellency the President. Even though it was faulty, President Maithripala Sirisena had to sign it in terms of the law.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay, now that is clear. ( ) (The Hon. Prasanna Ranatunga) , . . . . - [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, the General Secretary of the Party cannot sign the Gazette. He has nothing to do with it. -[Interruption.]

[6.48p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Mr. Chairman, I am thankful to you for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Public Administration and Management and the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government.

Firstly, I must say that my Ministry has been a subject for discussion for the last two years due to local government elections not being held. It was not due to any fault of me or of this Government, but for the fact that the delimitation process had not been carried out properly. Political parties tried to use this situation for a political platform and therefore, at the Committee Stage Discussion of the last Budget my Ministry was the only Ministry which was subjected to a vote. This year too, I expected that, but we now have cleared all obstacles. Therefore, we are confident that we could hold the election in February.

Before I go into the substantive matters of my speech, I would like to thank my Secretary, my Additional Secretaries, Legal Department and the institutions that come under my Ministry for the support they have given to me. I do not have a Deputy Minister, but we have made 91 per cent of physical and financial progress. We have a budget of over Rs. 40 million, and with the support I got from my Secretary, who gave the leadership, and all in my Ministry, we managed to do a lot of development.

That project is known as the Greater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Programme. The sewerage system of Colombo is over one hundred years old. Our Ministry has given the leadership to rectify the errors and improve this system. As you know, today, sewerage is sent to the sea without any purification. This has caused a great environmental hazard. Our Ministry has taken the leadership to solve this issue as well.

Also, we have not forgotten our brethren in the North and the East. We have been able to give water for cultivation through the Iranamadu Irrigation Development Project which covers about 8,455 hectares. This is the "Victoriya" of the North.

Sir, even though, unfortunately, our Ministry is known as the "Ministry for delaying elections or delimitation", we are in the forefront in developing this country, and we have carried out a great amount of development projects. We have been able to develop 101 local bodies under the North East Local Services Improvement Project. Physical development alone in this country is not enough. Human resource development is mandatory and we have focused on human resource development where we want to give the leadership to local bodies in dealing with these areas. Sir, you have been championing this cause for a very long time that there should be a great autonomy to local bodies, but, in addition to having autonomy, there should be accountability as well. In this House, I have been asked questions at numerous occasions about provincial councils. Unfortunately, I do not have the teeth to answer some of the questions due to the Thirteenth Amendment. So, at this point of time, I would respectfully remind the Members of this House the need to create a mechanism for accountability of local bodies and provincial councils to Parliament. In view of the Thirteenth Amendment, there are certain obstacles and therefore, . . .

In addition to the physical development of my Ministry, we have drafted a new Bill for the elections of local authorities. As you know, the Municipal Councils Ordinance, the Urban Councils Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act in this country are very archaic.

3153 3154

We intend to refer the Bill to all the provincial councils and by next year, we will have a new Act for municipal councils, urban councils and pradeshiya sabhas. In addition, after the next election, we will have over 8,000 Members to local bodies.

Unfortunately, though we have a training arm under my Ministry, there is no funding to train those Members. Therefore, I humbly urge that money be given to train the 8,000 Members who would take office after February, next year.

In addition to that, as you know with the increase of the number of Members, we need more resources for physical development of local bodies, especially the chambers. That has not been provided for in this Budget and therefore, I have to make an appeal in this regard, because we are going to have over 8,000 Members for the local bodies. So, if we do not have chambers to accommodate those members, they will not be able to do justice to the people.

Accommodating 25 per cent women representation in the local bodies, I think is a great step taken in this country. As you know, we boast of having the first woman Prime Minister in the world. But we stopped there. From that point onwards, there has been a decrease in women representation in politics. There is a five per cent women representation in Parliament, but most of them have political lineages. Therefore, with this new amendment, we will have greater women participation at the level of local bodies. Also, we have included a provision to have 25 per cent women representation at provincial council level and I think, if we can move in that direction, it will be a progressive step with regard to Parliamentary Elections.

Mr. Chairman, there are various questions raised by the Hon. Members. May I be permitted to answer some of those questions in brief. The Hon. Vijitha Herath, raised a query with regard to the residents in Jumma Masjid Road in Colombo Central, where the Municipal Council has raised their monthly rental from something like Rs.50 to Rs.1000 or so. I would like to bring to his notice that every five years . . However, this Government has taken an initiative to give them title deeds, which I think, is a step taken towards the right direction.

The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara spoke about creating a separate service for the local bodies. We have already put two Cabinet Papers in this regard, but, as you know, the local bodies come under the provincial councils. Therefore, we have a technical issue there because on one front we are talking about giving autonomy to local bodies and provincial councils but on the other front, we want to create a separate service for local bodies. Therefore, this has to be looked into in a very prudent manner. Our Ministry has looked into it and we are looking at the concerns and the various issues raised.

Also, the Hon. Vijitha Herath spoke about motorcycles being given to Members of the local bodies. We have given that in two stages. In the first stage, we have given 2,555 and in the second stage we have given 2,366. So, other than three Members all those who have paid, have been given motorcycles.

The Hon. Chandima Gamage spoke about a mortuary in his area. He said that the Chief Minister had given us a report with regard to that. The tender process of that is being taken forward. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne spoke about statues of local bodies. As you know, there are various inconsistencies with regard to statues brought in not by local bodies but by provincial councils. Therefore, we have to have a mechanism where no statute, which take away powers from provincial councils, is brought in and also no statues are brought in by the provincial councils in violation of the powers of the Central Government. Therefore, we are creating a great nexus among them and the UNDP is giving us assistance in carrying out this programme.

The Hon. Daglous Devananda referred to upgrading of certain local bodies. Mr. Chairman, you are aware that the Minister had the power to decide on upgrading a Pradeshiya Sabha to a Municipal Council. We had seen some instances in the past where Pradeshiya Sabhas, without being upgraded to Urban Councils were straight away upgraded to Municipal Councils. I took this power away from me and put a Cabinet Paper to bring in a mechanism through which it is evaluated by the Chief Secretaries and send to us. So, if it falls within the criteria, we will do the upgrading. Also various other Hon. Members, including my former State Minister, the Hon. Priyankara Jayaratne referred to upgrading of certain local bodies. However, Mr. Chairman, we have to do justice by the country. Just because I am the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils, I cannot upgrade the local bodies for political reasons because then we will not be doing justice by the people.

Therefore, we have created this mechanism. So, I ask any Member, if they want to upgrade their local body in the area, to follow that mark system and if it falls within that criteria, I will definitely carry out upgrading of that local body.

Hon. Chairman, I once again thank all the Members who supported me in carrying out my duties and also the general public who were patient, even though various Members used my Ministry as their political platform.

. I took great concern to see that smaller Parties exist in Parliament because, as you know, there was a cut-off point of 5 per cent and various other suggestions. But, I was always conscious of the fact that though the JVP may be having a lessor number, they make a great impact. , . . , ) . - , .- , , , , .
