( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, yesterday, the House had listed and debated four Items - a Bill, a Resolution, an Order and a Notification - but only the Bill was passed. There have been major deviations and errors in the other three Items that were presented to the House. These are financial regulations. Sir, I would bring to your notice that Parliament has been misled. If Parliament has been misled, it has to be immediately looked into and action has to be taken in relation to that, because these are financial regulations. The Hon. Minister of Finance presented them but they were not moved after the passage of the Bill. There are major errors. We would like the Hon. Speaker to suspend the Sittings and call for a Party Leaders Meeting to go into this serious error.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, it was brought to my notice yesterday. -[Interruption.] Yes, the Hon. Leader of the House.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella - Minister of Higher Education and Highways and Leader of the House of Parliament) I was there yesterday at that time. The Chair should call for the Items to be moved. The Chair called only Item No. 1 to be moved and did not call for the other Items. I cannot move. That is what happened. The officials were there and they should have advised the Chair to call for the relevant Items to be moved. They advised to move Item No. 1 only and then Parliament was adjourned.

Sir, I draw your attention to the headline of "the Sunday Times" dated 05th February, 2017. It states, I quote:

Request to appoint outsider as CB Deputy Governor Monetary Board examines proposal from Finance Minister

Sir, this is a thing which was not taken up and I would like to know who leaked this out to the media.

1061 1062

There is an independent inquiry going on to find out who was present that day. I was informed that five Monetary Board representatives, including one Deputy Governor and one other official were present. These were the only five people who were there when it was discussed. It was not only this matter, there were other matters that were also discussed. But, I am only referring to what was stated in the newspapers. So, this is not the first time such information has gone to the media. - [Interruption.] No, it is not. How do you know I have said so?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, you were saying -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, I have not said so. They are saying I have said so. Dr. R H S Samaratunga, the Secretary to my Ministry is an ex officio member of the Monetary Board. He specifically says how this has come out in the newspaper is unknown. So, I would like Parliament, which controls the financial activities, to look into this. The Central Bank has been up for many discussions among the Hon. Members. As to how they cannot keep things within themselves -whether it is right or wrong is not the question- how it got out, who were the Members involved should be investigated. I would appreciate, Hon. Speaker, that you immediately initiate an inquiry into this. This is not the first time that this happened. As I told you, last time also a report which was asked by me was presented by a JVP Member of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, I will bring that matter to the attention of the Governor.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I would appreciate that a report be given to us at the next Parliamentary Session.

( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , , .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the House, we have to discuss that at the next Party Leaders Meeting.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . , . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We will discuss that.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . [1.02p.m.] (, ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim - Deputy Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are seeking approval of Parliament for the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (Ceiling on Prices) Regulation No. 02 of 2016 made by the Hon. Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine under Section 142, read with Section 118 of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, No. 05 of 2015, published in the Gazette Notification No. 1989/61 dated 21.10.2016, in exercise of the power of making regulations vested in the Minister in charge of the subject by the same Act, in terms of Section 142(4) of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, No. 05 of 2015.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please! At this moment of time, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Lucky Jayawardena to the Chair?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake ) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Lucky Jayawardena do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Sir, Prof. Senaka Bibiles Policy was implemented by the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and the aforesaid Gazette Extraordinary has been presented to Parliament seeking approval. This has been pending for a long time. His Excellency the President who was the former Minister of Health tried his best to bring this amendment

to Parliament but failed. After this Government came into power, Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, our new Minister, took a great effort to bring this Regulation to Parliament to reduce the prices of medicines for the benefit of the poor people of the country.

In fact, I saw on CNN, the new American President has summoned the pharmaceutical manufacturing companies for a discussion to reduce the prices of medicines in America too. So, you can see that the overall prices of medicines in the world is high. Therefore, we have to thank our Minister, (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne for taking such a great effort to bring down the prices of 48 drugs which will be affordable to the poor people in Sri Lanka. The prices of these drugs have been brought down by almost 50 per cent by our Minister.

In fact, Non-Communicable Diseases are rapidly increasing in Sri Lanka. Most people are affected by NCDs -Non-Communicable Diseases. By now, we have brought down almost 50 per cent of the cost of medicines. Almost every pharmacy is implementing that regulation. The importers of medicine are also very careful about distribution of medicines. Though there is a fixed price, complaints are coming against some places because they have not reduced the prices. Our Ministry has instructed the Authority which is handling this subject to check on those places that have not reduced the prices. We are looking into that. A flying squad is in operation for that purpose and we are looking forward to bring all these culprits to justice who have not reduced the prices.

Next, the system that has been introduced by the Minister is to manufacture drugs in Sri Lanka. Only the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation and some other companies have been producing drugs in Sri Lanka. But they are not manufacturing 100 per cent of the requirement. We have been asked by our Minister to improve manufacturing of drugs in Sri Lanka. Earlier, we gave a five-year buyback period for the investors who would like to manufacture pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka and the buyback will be done by the Government for five years. The buyback period was five years with the Department of Medical Services and the contract was for 10 years with the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation. Now it has been changed in order to bring down more manufacturers. Now, we have gone up to a 15-year buyback agreement with the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation and with the Department of Medical Services, we have gone up to a 10-year buyback agreement now. I think the manufacture of medicines has gone up now. We feel that it would increase further.

Almost 22 factories have been approved by our Committee and that has gone to the Cabinet for approval. They will start production this year.

The Cabinet has given approval to a Sri Lankan company to manufacture saline in Sri Lanka. So, for the first time, saline is going to be manufactured in Sri Lanka. All this time we have been importing saline from China. So,in future, after signing agreements with manufacturers, more drugs will be manufactured in Sri Lanka which will benefit the poor people.

Thank you very much.

[1.19 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, let me first thank you for allocating time to speak on the Regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine.

At the outset, I am duty bound, as a Member of Parliament representing the Batticaloa District, to thank His Excellency the President, the Hon. Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, also the Hon. Deputy Minister and the officials of the Ministry who declared open the newly constructed hospital building in Kaluwanchikudy last week. Rs. 450 million was allocated by JICA on the initiative taken by His Excellency the President during his tenure of Office as the Minister of Health.

The health sector in our country is considered as an important factor, which involves the lives of the citizens. Though our Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister, who is from our Province and has been playing a very active role on this, are making enough effort and doing their best to improve the health sector and the health services of the country, I am sad to say that the full benefit of their tireless efforts are not received by needy recipients in the Batticaloa District, let alone in the Eastern Province. I would like to say that - I am not blaming you, Hon. Minister, the Deputy Minister or the officials of your Ministry - due to the 30 years of civil strife that prevailed in our country, the health sector development in these areas was barred and is still due to be restored.

To be more specific, I would first draw the attention of the Ministers to the immediate shortcomings at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital and the hospitals such as district hospitals, peripheral units, base hospitals and divisional hospitals under the administration of the Eastern Provincial Council. Though sufficient specialists and consultants in varying fields are at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, due to continuing increase in the number of patients getting admitted from Thuraineelvanai up to Kathiravely and Pullumalai with complicated diseases seeking treatment from specialist doctors, there is a significant dearth of adequate ward facilities. Some patients are placed on the floor and verandah for want of space and more importantly, beds, whereas patients who could afford financially are compelled to take treatment from private hospitals by channeling medical specialists. Thus, the concept of free medical services is only in words, but not in action.

Not only land for the construction of medical wards are available, but I understand there is a move to shift the Batticaloa prison, housed next to the hospital to the land closer to the Thiraimadu area, with the intention of handing over the property for the expansion of the

1101 1102

Teaching Hospital of Batticaloa. This land is already reserved for this purpose. So, I kindly request the Hon. Minister to take up this matter with the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs to expedite the construction of the Prison in the newly allocated land and help the poor patients undergoing immense suffering obtain treatment from medical specialists by staying in the wards.

Further, I would also like to bring to the attention of the House, the need to consider for a free, mobile and efficient ambulance service in Batticaloa. As very correctly mentioned by the Hon. Douglas Devananda also, I need not to elaborate on the number of road accidents taking place daily in Batticaloa and the time spent on the transfer of accident victims to the Teaching Hospital. Ambulance services there are entirely inadequate. Time and again, I have to personally get involved in the affairs of those who had tragically passed away while being transferred to the Hospital. To send accident victims to the Hospital as quickly as possible and thereby save their lives through early or immediate treatment, a free ambulance service is a must. This is being implemented in some districts and I am confident that the Hon. Minister will immediately take action to implement such service in the Battialaoa District as well.

In order to have the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital running smoothly, as it is also an important institution for the undergraduate students of the Faculty of Health Sciences of the Eastern University of Sri Lanka, efficient, service-minded and qualified individuals should be appointed to the Hospital Committee. At this point of time, the term of the present Hospital Committee in office is coming to an end. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to appoint a new committee, which will coordinate the development of the Teaching Hospital efficiently.

Before I place the shortcomings, needs and requirements in the hospitals which come under the administration of the Eastern Provincial Council before the House, I wish to appeal to the Hon. Minister to instruct the officials of the Ministry to strictly consider applicants from the Batticaloa District for the minor grade vacancies since there are enough qualified, unemployed youths in our area. Coming back to the hospitals under the administration of the Eastern Provincial Council, I do not know whether the Hon. Minister is aware that some of the hospitals have been closed down for want of doctors. The buildings just stand up with the name board divisional hospital and those are included in the statistics of hospitals in the Batticaloa District, but those hospitals are, in fact, non-functional. The Hon. Minister might be surprised when I read out the names of the hospitals in that state. Those include hospitals at Mancholai, Mahiloor, Karadiyanaru, Mankerni, Mandur, Unnichchai, Navatkudah, Kathiraveli and Mahilavettuwan. So, I would kindly request the Hon. Minister to take prompt action and give utmost priority to making these hospitals functional by providing at least two doctors per hospital. Lives are at stake there and a quick decision by you would save them, Hon. Minister.

These hospitals are in remote villages, where the residents are very poor, they find it very difficult to supply their daily meals and are unable to find adequate means of travelling to the Teaching Hospital or to any district hospital. The public transport facilities are also very poor in those areas. Hence, the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and indigenous Medicine is duty-bound to grant the requisite relief to these poor villagers who were affected very badly even during the period of war.

Then, with regard to the improvement of facilities of the Base Hospital in Eravur, I made a request through a letter to the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine at the inception of the formation of this National Government. Due to lack of time, Hon. Minister, I table* that letter, which was dated 15th of December, 2015 for your easy reference and to take necessary action.

Before I conclude my speech, Sir, I would like to point out that for the action taken to reduce the prices of 48 important drugs, people of this country are ever grateful and thankful to His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and the Hon. Deputy Minister. In this regard, it is very necessary to state that an Osusala under the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation should be established in Batticaloa as well so that the patients there could obtain such state-approved drugs at reduced prices without being cheated by private pharmacies. I am confident that, definitely, my good Friend, the Hon. Deputy Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine would look into this matter and give priority to my request. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) I would like to answer him, Sir. Hon. Member, the development project of the Batticaloa Hospital has been approved by the Department of National Planning and we are looking for foreign funds as it is a big project. So, to find funds, we will need a little more time. But, some other development activities are going on in the Batticaloa Hospital.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Of course. For that, I am grateful to you. ( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Then, I agree that there is a shortage of doctors in some hospitals. There are about five hospitals, we have been informed by the RDHSs, which have been closed

1103 1104

down as a result. With the new appointments coming up, we will provide those with doctors. And also, in the Batticaloa District, we are going to open five PMCUs with an OPD and five beds to treat in an emergency before patients are transferred to the Batticaloa Hospital. We plan to start those this year.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Thank you very much. [. . 1.29]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have five minutes.

[5.35 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity.

In almost every Debate on health I used to speak, because, as you know, I was a Provincial Health Minister. I am indeed happy because every time we spoke, there have been improvements made for the sake of the poor children and the poor people. The Hon. Minister is always listening to us and looking after the problems in the hospitals in the rural areas.

Generally speaking, health is a very important thing because for the other things like education, we can give time; but, when it comes to the subject of health, it has to be attended to immediately.

I always speak of the hospitals in the rural areas because in most of the hospitals in cities like Colombo, Kandy and Galle, everything is up-to-date. Doctors are available, nurses are available and within a day, patients get all the medicine. But in the rural areas the situation is totally different. This has been the situation that prevailed earlier on. But, fortunately, the Hon. Minister has changed the whole situation. When I was a Provincial Health Minister, I had problems in getting medicines. We write to them; we speak to them and plead with them and ultimately we get only 25 or 30 per cent of the medicines required. So, because of that, the poor people were suffering. But, today, that situation has changed. If you do not have medicine in your hospital, within a few minutes or hours, you can call another hospital - telephones are given - and the necessary medicine will reach you. This is something good because the poor people -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to conclude in two minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) I just started. You said I had five minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes. But already you have spoken for three minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) I thought I have spoken for only one minute.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No. You have spoken for three minutes and now you are left with only two minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Okay. I suppose the Hon. Minister is in a hurry.

So, I think these are the things that we have to discuss. I can remember, when we were trying to bring in ambulances from India, there was so much of talk, so much of criticism and so much of problems, but today people are happy. When you call them, within five, ten minutes they come and take you to the hospital. This is the kind of service that we expect from the President downwards - the Hon. Minister of Health as well as from the other Hon. Ministers. This is what the people are expecting from us.

Today you are talking of SAITM. I am a father of two lawyers. I have been spending millions of rupees to bring them up to that level. The doctors must realize that they are given free education and it is their duty to serve the people. I am not arguing with them; I am not fighting with them. They should come for a discussion with the Hon. Minister, with the President or with the Hon. Prime Minister. When they strike, unlike other sectors, the people are suffering.

I am grateful to the Hon. Minister for bringing in these Regulations. They will definitely help the poor people. Through this, the Hon. will be able to serve the poor people in the rural hospitals. Also, I am expecting an early date from the Hon. Minister to come to Puttalam. Probably, he would give me a date today.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)

Regulations for Prescribed Standards for recognition of institutions awarding degrees other than a University established or deemed to have been established by the Higher Education Act no. 20 of 1966 have been gazetted but have still not been passed by our Parliament.

I must state the obvious viz that the SLMC has no power to place these regulations before Parliament.

When these regulations are passed by Parliament, you could apply to the SLMC. At that stage the SLMC will visit your institution to ascertain whether your institution meets the standards prescribed and then decide whether to recognize or not recognize your institution.

The problem relating to the Malabe Medical College of SAITM

It is the view of the SLMC, based on legal opinion that SAITM cannot exist as the off shore campus of the NNSAM (Nizny Novgorod State Academy of Medicine) of the Russian Federation. It may however exist as a Degree Awarding Institute referred to in the Universities Act (Section 25 and 70A -70D of Part IXA) and also in the Medical Ordinance (Medical Amendment Act No. 25 of 1988).

"When analyzing the above deficiencies along with the observations made it is clear that the investigation team had studied the functions at the SAITM with the intention of improving the study programme by making recommendations to expose the undergraduates to the state mechanism as identify under E6 highly recommending to the Ministry of Health, the access to state JMO system and under E5 recommending suitable field practice area to develop a working relationship with existing public health service."

, public health forensic medicine , SLMC :

"However, the investigating team in their conclusion had surprisingly recommended that the SLMC does not recognize graduates who have completed the study programme currently provided by the faculty of Medicine SAITM, as suitable for provisional registration.

When considering the observations made by the investigators as referred to above it is clear that the above observations do not match with the final recommendtion made by them."
