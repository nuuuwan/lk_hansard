[11.23 a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

I am happy, Sir, that I am able to say a few words on this Condolence Motion pertaining to the late Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, a very distinguished Member of this House. The late Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka was a Member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He joined the Party when it was yet growing. I think he made a substantial contribution towards the growth of the Party and to the success of the Party in the years to come. He also functioned as the Secretary of Sri Lanka Freedom Party. In the capacity of the Secretary, I think, he played a crucial role in the management of the affairs of that Party. It is also well known that he functioned very closely with the late Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who was a Prime Minister of this country and that he also functioned very closely with Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who functioned both as Prime Minister and as President of this country.

He, I think, contributed in his fullest might to the growth and success of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He

1069 1070

was returned as a Member of Parliament to this House from the Horana Electorate on a number of occasions. He was much respected by the people of that area and also by the people of the country. He functioned as a Junior Minister, as a full-fledged Minister and as a Prime Minister of this country, I believe, on three occasions. The various positions that he held during the tenure of his membership in this House as a Junior Minister, a Minister and as the Prime Minister eventually demonstrated the influence that he was able to wield both within his own Party and in the country.

I have had several occasions, Sir, to interact with him quite closely. I value my interactions with him because I always felt that I was interacting with a person who had very clear and definite views, but who at the same time, was a modest person and also a moderate person; a person who would not spew communal venom for the promotion of himself in politics. He was firmly of the view that this country should be undivided; that this country should be indivisible; that this country should be united and that it should be one country. He was also of the view very clearly that all the people in this country must live with equality and justice and be able to live with equality and justice and that must be ensured and that was the only way to make this country successful and give this country its due place in the international scene. He was very clear about that.

He was not a person who used communalism or chauvinism to promote himself in politics by spewing communal venom in the country so as to achieve any personal advancement. He had strong views but those views were very moderate and modest and, they also ensured that everybody could be able to live in this country as equals in dignity and with self-respect.

Sir, he maintained the highest dignity and decorum in this House. He was very careful about that. We all respected him for the manner in which he conducted himself in this House. He never was willing or he never did anything that would adduce this august Assembly to a common market place. He always conducted himself with a great deal of dignity and decorum that demanded respect and we all respected him for that. He was not noisy; he was not arrogant; he was not aggressive; he was mild but he was firm, he was modest and moderate and we all respected him for that.

I think, Sir, we have lost a very valuable Member of Parliament by the demise of the late Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka. His son, the Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka is now with us and he is a Member of Parliament. I am sure he will follow in the footsteps of his father and make a significant contribution to the well-being of this country.

I wish to convey Sir, our deepest sympathies on the passing away of the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, to his widow, to his son, the Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka, to the other members of his family and everyone else.

I thank you, Sir.

It is the Unions that are causing the biggest problem for the development of this country. I am sorry to say this in this august Assembly. Everybody knows that dengue is widespread in the Trincomalee District. While I was here a Chairman of some Association spoke to me. He said that he is unable to send doctors voluntarily to Kinniya for dengue treatment. He has sent some doctors to Kinniya and that batch is coming back today, and a new batch is to go; but there were no voluntary doctors willing to go there.

After we set up the HDU in Kinniya, there were no deaths reported. There were about fifteen deaths in the Trincomalee District and in Kinniya, there were about thirteen deaths. It was a sad situation. However, after the HDU was established there were no deaths reported.

Hon. Member, I appreciate the Adjournment Motion that you have brought in today. It is a challenge for the Ministry of Health. I agree with that. It is a challenge. But what can the Ministry of Health do on this subject? In Sri Lanka, we need more than 6,000 doctors to fill the vacancies in the hospitals. We need more than 16,000 nurses to fill the vacancies in the hospitals and we need more paramedical officers as well.

You are pointing the finger at the Ministry of Health. But, I do not think the Ministry of Health can take any action regarding this. The Hon. Mujibur Rahuman said that we are ill-treating the patients today. I agree on that. If something goes wrong in regard to the doctors' issues, they will go on strike. What can the poor patients do? If they have money, they can go to private hospitals.

If people do not have money, they go to the Government hospitals. When they go to the Government hospitals and if the doctors, nurses and paramedics in the Government hospitals are on strike, sometimes, the poor patients have to stay overnight in the hospitals to get treatment the next day. It is sad to even hear about it. We

have seen this on TV. For some reason, this is happening.

What happens when a doctor who passed out from the university -
