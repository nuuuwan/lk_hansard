But, in this instance, what the Hon. Speaker just read out is that the Attorney-General informed the Supreme Court that the Hon. Minister of Justice will be withdrawing the Bill, not that the Attorney-General agreed that the Bill is unconstitutional. He merely

informed Court that the Hon. Minister of Justice is withdrawing the Bill and therefore, it is unnecessary now to make a determination on the constitutionality of that Bill. So, in this instance, that issue does not arise.

But, I would generally agree with the certification given by the Attorney-General, particularly at the Committee Stage Amendments, where a citizen is not even able to test the right or wrong of the Attorney-Generals certification before it is passed in Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. State Minister.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Niroshan Perera - State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, I would like to answer the Question raised by the Hon. Douglas Devananda under Standing Order No. 23(2).

During the post-war era, financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank opened a large number of business places in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. This has resulted in a high banking density in these Provinces. For example, in the Northern Province, there are 22.9 branches per 100,000 people and in the Eastern Province, 17.7 branches per 100,000 people. Further, people in these areas were trying to obtain credit to start income-generating activities as well as for consumption. However, sustainable economic opportunities and financial literacy of the people were lacking in these areas.

Answers to individual Questions are given below:

Answer to Question No. 1 is this. There have been various complaints where it is observed that even regulated financial institutions are carrying out malpractices stemming from the above situation which further deprive the people in these areas. This has raised the attention of the Central Bank to conduct an in-depth study to identify the unfair and unethical practices of such financial institutions.

Answer to Question No. 2 is this. The customers of these institutions are selected based on the competition and the policies and procedures of such institutions. Further, as these are business decisions, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has not imposed any restrictions or requirements in selecting a customer base for financial institutions so far.

Answer to Question No. 3 is this. The financial institutions' interest rates and other conditions are also a business decision which is determined in line with the

1873 1874

institutions, policies and market competition. Further, interest and conditions will apply to customers only after an agreement between the institution and the customer. Nevertheless, improving the transparency in all communications made to the customers by the financial institutions is a best practice to avoid unethical and unfair terms and conditions.

Answer to Question No. 4 is this. In order to ensure repayment of a loan explaining the terms and conditions, awareness on utilization of loan funds, managing funds to repay the loans are best practices which financial institutions are expected to follow. Nevertheless, the situation explained above, which is competition and vulnerability of the people, has resulted in financial institutions avoiding such best practices and involve in fulfilling unrealistic targets.

Answer to Question No. 5 is this. In this regard, the Central Bank has already carried out a field study in Kilinochchi area based on a complaint received. Main recommendations made under this study are as follows:

(i) Improve sustainable economic activity in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces to generate employment and opportunities to improve income sources.

(ii) Conduct examination in all regulated financial institutions to identify any malpractices carried out in this regard.

(iii) Customer awareness campaign to increase financial literacy and methods on resolving credit issues.

(iv) Seek possibility in issuing a regulation to address customer protection.

Hon. Member, if you have any specific cases which you have identified, you can forward those complaints to us and we will notify the Central Bank. And also, if you want to meet with the Central Bank officials, we can arrange a meeting for you.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) , , . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .

, , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELVAM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you may commence your speech now. [12.18p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let me at the outset thank you for allocating me 10 minutes of the time allocated for the Debate today in order to express my thoughts on the two Notifications under the Excise Ordinance presented by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, our new Minister of Finance and Mass Media. Also, permit me to digress a little to congratulate the Hon. Minister on his new appointment. It is a great achievement indeed. It was only in my last speech before this House I reminded the Hon. Minister that he is a senior Member of the Government, who has held an array of Cabinet portfolios and it would only make any politician envy. Since it has also been prophesied by the newspapers that the Hon. Minister would indeed be the new Minister of Finance, I reminded him not to be so malicious and frivolous but act with dignity giving the due respect to the portfolios he represents. I can only emphasize and re-emphasize the same now that he is the Minister of Finance. More so, I believe that he has the distinction of being only the second man after the late Hon. Felix Dias Bandaranaike to hold both portfolios of Finance and Foreign Affairs. Actually, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs also shares that distinction now. I suppose depending on who you look at, either way, you are in distinct company.

Sir, I believe the Hon. Minister has one more reason to be mighty proud of, as he is replacing Asias Best Finance Minister. It is no easy task. Imagine the amount of confidence, the President and the Prime Minister must

1881 1882

have had on the Minister, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. Little over two years has not expired since Asias Best Finance Minister has been replaced by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, because the President and the Prime Minister are confident that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera can do a better job, even without any economic or accounting background, as opposed to Asias Best Finance Minister. I must say, many would envy that. Or maybe, it is just another step in the scientific process of selecting Cabinet Members, which was highlighted by the Government in its elections pledges. Either way, I do not want to digress any further, but congratulate the Hon. Minister on a fine achievement. Well done!

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let me bring your attention to the gravity of the state of the Ministry which the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is taking over as it was highlighted in the Annual Report of the Central Bank, 2016. In an article in The Island newspaper, Prof. Milton Rajaratne of the Faculty of Management of University of Peradeniya, highlights 30 economic indicators and provides a comparison against 2014 - the last year the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa governed this country. Twenty eight indicators are unfavourable and only two are favourable - and that is also very marginally.

Now, let me emphasize the case of per capita income. Thanks to the magnificent economic management of Asias Best Finance Minister, our per capita income this year is actually US Dollars 8 and it is less than last year. We are only US Dollars 14 higher than that of 2014 figures, which shows the remarkable ability of the former Minister of Finance to take this country down the same path, as he took Lanka Sathosa, and mind you that these figures I quote are too against the dubiously adjusted figures of 2014 by this Government.

Now, Sir, for example, the following indicators are against those of 2014: as a percentage, Economic Growth is down from 2014; Gross National Income is down from 2014; Gross Domestic Investments are down from 2014; Gross Domestic Savings are down from 2014; Unemployment Rate is up from 2014; Consumer Price Index is up from 2014; Nominal Wage Rate is down from 2014; Trade Deficit is up; Export Earnings are down from 2014 and it is particularly dangerous if you take the first three months of 2017 because there has been a decline. For the last three consecutive years, our exports have declined.

Sir, let me give you a few more examples. According to the figures, the Import Expenditure is up from 2014 and Official Reserves are down from 2014. What about the much-talked about debt? The Debt Service Percentage has increased from 2014 to 2016 from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. The Government Debt has increased for two

consecutive years from 71 per cent of the GDP to 79 per cent. The other indicators such as Government Expenditure, Deficit Finance Percentage, Interest Rates and Lending Rates have all increased showing the deteriorating state of the economy. The lack of confidence on the economy is highlighted by the performance of the Colombo Stock Exchange and Foreign Direct Investments. In the Colombo Stock Exchange, all indicators such as ASPI, value of shares trade and market capitalization have all deteriorated. Foreign Direct Investments have gone down to the levels of war era period.

Sir, I will not go on. It will be good for the new Minister of Finance to study these figures and understand the gravity of the situation. We will let the Hon. Minister compare these economic indicators historically year-on-year and tell us, when in the history of Sri Lanka did we have it so bad.

Sir, I must also bring to the attention of this House that these figures which have been cooked up by the Central Bank are dubious in nature.

Take for example the GDP at current market prices. In 2015, it was stated as Rs. 10,952 billion. In 2016, this figure was revised up to Rs. 11, 183 billion. With Rs.10,952 billion, you get a growth of 4.4 per cent. But, if the figure published in 2016 was Rs. 11,183 billion, then, it would be lower at 2.2 per cent.

Also, Sir, I think we need to take into account the Auditor-Generals opinion on the Financial Statements of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the year ended 31st December, 2016. It is for the first time in the economic history of Sri Lanka, the Auditor-General refuses to give an opinion. He says, "Because of the significance of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, I have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on these Financial Statements."

I wonder whether the new Minister of Finance understands the gravity of this situation. Normally, when the Ministry of Finance wants to issue Bonds, it issues an Offering Circular to famous international investment banks, such as Barclays, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, HSBC, et cetera. The Offering Circular states the accuracy of the information provided by the Central Bank. In this particular Offering Circular, it states, "The Issuer, having made all reasonable inquiries, confirms that this Offering Circular contains all information which is material in the context of the Offering, that the information contained in this Offering Circular is true and accurate in all material aspects and is not misleading, that the opinions and intentions expressed in this Offering Circular are honestly held and that there are no other facts

1883 1884

[ ]

2017 22

the omission of which would make this Offering Circular or any of such information or the expression of any such opinions or intentions misleading. The Issuer accepts responsibility accordingly."

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have five minutes more. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Thank you, Sir.

So, you look at the gravity of the situation. When these foreign investment banks come and check from the Central Bank the accuracy of the information, the Auditor General cannot confirm the accuracy of the information because the former Minister of Finance has not told the truth. I think, this will result in the Sri Lankan Government having to pay much higher prices at future auctions.

Also, it must be said that our Debt-to-GDP Ratio has been manipulated because earlier the value was taken on the face value of Bonds, but in this instance, the Minister has refrained from taking the face value in order to show the Debt-to-GDP equity ratio at 79 per cent. Actually, the figure is somewhat over 83 per cent.

Sir, it is better, if the Minister takes stock of what is to come. Sri Lanka's stuttering economy is burdened with high foreign debt payments of over US Dollars 3 billion per year from this year onwards and if the Minister fails to restore any confidence in the economy and attract Foreign Direct Investments, it is not to the promised land that the "Yahapalana Government" will lead us to, but to another revolution.

Interestingly enough, Sir, I was in conversation with a friend of mine and he was trying to explain the business cycle theory. He explained that after every 20 odd years, all business cycles peak at the same time and argued that there will be a conjuncture around 2020. Well if that is the case I can honestly say, good luck to the Minister.

One more thing, about this new Cabinet reshuffle: it is indeed a rare combination to include Finance and Media. Stranger and more so is the fact that Hon. Ravi Karunanayake who has been given the Foreign Ministry portfolio has retained control of the Development Lotteries Board, National Lotteries Board and an array of Government institutions. This must be the scientific methodology, which the Hon. Prime Minister so proudly spoke before the elections. My only contention is that the rationality cannot be understood by anyone except perhaps the Hon. Prime Minister himself. Well it has

often been said by the UNPiers that the Hon. Prime Minister is Asia's best brain, so now I see the complexities with which Asia's best brain works.

In my parting thoughts may I humbly suggest to the Hon. Minister that he refrains from including favourable proposals only targeting his friends in the next budget. I think we saw plenty in the 2016 Budget Proposals. Might I also suggest to the Hon. Minister not to accept rent money from various people and not give any bonded warehouses to his close relatives on lease or appoint unsuitable relatives to State enterprises. The list is endless. I think, we all get the drift.

So if the Hon. Minister adheres to my humble advice, he will do a better job than the former Finance Minister. He said that he has big shoes to fill. He might not have the intellectual capacity of Dr. N. M. Perera or Hon. Ronnie De Mel, but I do believe that the new Finance Minister will be a better listener than the former Finance Minister as we all know the garden path the former Finance Minister has led us.

I congratulate the new Finance Minister and let us hope for the best.
