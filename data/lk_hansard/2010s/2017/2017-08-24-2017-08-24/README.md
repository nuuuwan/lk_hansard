(ii) if so, the date the compensation will be paid?

(c) If not, why?

.. ( ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Hon. Speaker, Answer to Question No.11 (a) (i), (ii), (iii) and (b) (i), (ii) is as follows:

(a) The Rehabilitation Authority has no records regarding the damaged properties of Mr. Harrison Fernando. However, we have sent a letter to Mr. Harrison Fernando to submit his application with the relevant documentation to take necessary action to pay the compensation by the Rehabilitation Authority. According to our circular, we have also sent copies of same to the Divisional Secretary of Eravur and the Divisional Secretary of Wellawaya to expedite the process.

(b) The Rehabilitation Authority will take necessary action after receiving the relevant documents from Mr. Harrison Fernando.

(c) Does not arise. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. J.M. Ananda Kumarasiri) Sir, this incident took place 30 years back. Therefore, some of the documents are missing. But, I spoke to the Hon. Minister to see whether he was willing to make this payment based on an affidavit submitted by the victim. Will that be possible?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Member, that could be done. If the documents are not available, and if there is an affidavit available and also if the village headman of the area can certify that this has happened, on that basis, probably we can do it.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. J.M. Ananda Kumarasiri) I have a document which certifies that this incident took place 30 years back and the Divisional Secretary as well as the Grama Niladari has certified that. So, based on that, if you can make this payment, it would be really helpful.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. You can do that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, can I make a clarification, please? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, when the Bill was originally presented, the Elections Commissioner stated that certain technical amendments had to be made for the purpose of having the election. Consequent to that, there were Party Leaders' Meetings; there was a consistent dialogue and subsequently amendments were made based on that dialogue. But if any Member in this House requires clarification of those amendments, my officials are present in a Committee Room and they are in a position to -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We will discuss that at the Party Leaders Meeting. Now start the Debate.

() LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT)

BILL

. . Order for Second Reading read.

[11.22a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) I move,

919 920

"That the Bill be now read a Second time." Hon. Speaker, I present this Bill to amend the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2012. The pith and substance of this Bill is to facilitate the election. When this Act, No. 22 of 2012 was brought about, due consideration was not given in regard to the manner in which the election should be held. Therefore, amendments were needed to facilitate it.

Consequent to that, the present Government brought in the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 1 of 2016 where we introduced female representation. That was a very progressive move in the history of our country where women were given a quota of 25 per cent. Whilst this dialogue was going on, there were requests by Party Leaders that there should be an increase in the quota of the PR system. Thereby, the 30 per cent was increased to 40 per cent to facilitate representation of all parties and when such amendment was brought about, the requirement of 25 per cent had to be brought in within the 40 per cent. So taking into consideration all these aspects, I would say that this Bill is very progressive.

Sir, various allegations have been made that we postponed this election. I would like to state to go on record in this House that at no stage has this Government postponed this election.

. . . . . . . " ." . .

Sir, I will make a brief statement at the end. At this stage, I will leave it to other Members to address the House.

This is not democracy. This is the yahapalana fraud and that is what you all are trying to do even today and you try to put the blame on the JO. The JO is not going to get caught in your trap. We will support any nonsense, but you should explain what the nonsense is. That is the duty of the Hon. Minister. He should explain these 50 Amendments one by one and tell us what the result is going to be, because the Commission is unable to explain the result. Our Members went to the Commission yesterday.

. . . You have to give a mandatory order to a Party. Hon. Minister, it has to be a mandatory order. - [Interruption.] Wait! I am telling you this because you are going to create a result which is going to be worse than people coming through the back door to Parliament. After the Parliamentary Election held in August, 2015, we know how people came through the back door. The whole country knows about it. In the same way, you are going to act now.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the National Delimitation Committee was appointed to make recommendations to the Minister for the division of each Local Authority area into Wards, to determine the boundaries of each Ward and assign a name and a number to each such Ward. The Committee, in making its recommendation for the division of a Local Authority area into Wards had to follow a criteria set out in the law and was obliged to consider a number of factors such as the ethnic composition of the Local Authority, the need to ensure representation on the basis of the ethnic ratio, the geographical area of the Local Authority, its physical features, the population of the Local Authority area, the density of the population and the level of economic development of the Local Authority area.One of the important factors the Committee had to consider was the ratio of ethnic composition of a Local Authority area and the need to ensure representation on the basis of the ethnic ratio. A similar criterion was also adopted in order to create Multi-Member Wards.

The above process was completed and the Gazette was issued on the 21st of August, 2015. When this process was started by the previous administration, the former Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, though he was not the Minister in charge of the subject - there was a different Minister - was virtually dominating the whole process and he had, through various machinations, introduced various different criteria and finally we found that there had been serious discrepancies, which resulted in injustice to many dispersed communities. Because of the representations made by us as concerned parties that the recommendations of the Committee were biased, arbitrary and irrational, the Hon. Minister appointed a Committee, which was an appellate body, to make recommendations to him on whether the boundaries of Wards in a Local Authority area should be altered.

This Committee too was guided by the principles applicable to the National Delimitation Committee. The Report of the Committee was submitted to the Hon. Minister with recommendations to alter boundaries of Wards and names, which it was felt appropriate based on the representations made by the concerned parties. Thereafter, the Hon. Minister issued a Gazette.

Now again, we find that though the Committee was appointed, there is still a large number of issues remaining to

be considered with regard to boundaries of Wards, names of Local Authorities, names of Wards, Multi-Member Wards et cetera. Some issues, especially the way in which certain Wards have been carved out, have resulted in adversely affecting representation of ethnic minorities. It is ironic that an election system that sought to ensure fair and balanced representation to communities has resulted in dilution of their right to representation owing to political machinations.

I am very constrained to say, that though it was a collective effort, though we were in this Government, though we made several representations to the Committee headed by one of the celebrated public servants, Mr. Asoka Peiris - he was a very good gentleman and before him, we went and made representations and he gave us time and various assurances - finally, when the Report came, we found that even those assurances have not been complied with. And this anomalous situation needs to be remedied to ensure fair representation to dispersed communities before elections are held to Local Authorities.

One such very glaring mistake had been pointed out even by Mr. Peiris. He had also said it several times. I hope the Hon. Minister will be here just to listen to me.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Yes, I am coming. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Minister, our voting for this Bill depends on certain assurances you will give from the Floor of the House, so that we can at least justify that we have impressed upon the Hon. Minister about the anomalies that have been created and that he will correct them; at least subsequently. Then, we will be able to tell our people that we voted on the assurances given to us.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha)

. . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, you can reply in your winding up speech; you do not have to intervene now.

For instance, one particular example that the Chairman of the Committee himself had mentioned at a variety of workshops is about the Samanthurai Pradeshiya Sabha. The Samanthurai Pradeshiya Sabha, in the previous delimitation had only ten members. Now, its voter population is almost 40,000. The voter population of the Dehiattakandiya Pradeshiya Sabha is also 40,000.

969 970

But, it has 23 members - almost double or more. Then, the Lahugala Pradeshiya Sabha, which has only 5,000 voters, has 12 members. The Hon. Dallus Alahapperuma will understand that this an anomalous situation.

. . . , . .

So, in order to clarify this situation - since my time is limited - Sir, I would like to table* the representations that were made in Tamil by the Hon. M.I.M. Mansoor, Hon. Member of Parliament, on the 17th of November, 2015 .

Together with that, I would also like to point out the other anomalous situations in various other areas. For instance, also in the Musali Pradeshiya Sabha, a very serious situation has arisen with regard to the allocated number of members. Those numbers have been allocated in a very unjustified manner. The situation is the same particularly with regard to Arippu, Silavathurai, Vavuniya and Aandankulam areas. In all these areas, Double-Member Wards have been created for lesser number of voters and Single-Member Wards have been created for larger number of voters. So, this issue is also something that we cannot justify. In this regard, I would like to table* another letter sent by the President of the Musali Mosque Federation on behalf of the people of Musali to the Hon. Minister regarding the Musali Pradeshiya Sabha.

In that letter he clearly says, In 2011, the Muslim representation was eight out of nine and rest was Tamil representation. This is the ethnic ratio proportion and the correct one". He further says that however, after 2014, while the Ward system was introduced, during the changing process of the system, certain officers have conspired to change the Wards. Delimitations have been carried out very secretly without any transparency and subsequently, when the gazette notification came out, it seems that the Arippu village has been divided into two Wards as Arippu East and Arippu West just for 572 families with 1,341 voters, allocating two members whereas only one member is allocated to the Maruthamadhu and Veppankulam GS Divisions, which consist of almost 1,231 families with 2,003 voters.

Also in the Andiapuliankulam area in Vavuniya, where there are 800 voters, a similar situation has arisen.

It has been forcibly annexed with the Menik Farm area, where only one member could be elected. So, that area, with those 800 voters and the Tamil community having 1,400 voters, should be made a Multi-Member Ward. Vavuniya has only a few Muslim members who could be elected. But, under the Proportional Representation System, under the earlier system, there was a possibility for us to return more members. The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha has also realized this. He had been a Member representing the Kandy Electoral District along with me and he knows about this situation. For instance, the Deltota Pradeshiya Sabha was able to return four Muslim members earlier, but with the present delimitation, only one member can be elected from the entire Deltota area.

So, this is a very serious issue. We cannot face the people with this type of delimitation. At least, they should have created a sufficient number of Multi-Member Wards to enable minority members to be elected. In the Deltota area in Kandy, you know, there is a substantial concentration of Muslims. That is just an example. There are several such examples all over the country and therefore, it is incumbent on the Hon. Minister to ensure that some kind of rectification will be done before an election is held. Otherwise, there will be a serious injustice caused to many dispersed minorities. Also, the minorities who are concentrated are facing problems. For instance, in the Trincomalee Electorate - my Hon. Member, the Hon. M.S. Thowfeek is here - he points out the way in which the membership has been allocated in that Electorate. If you take the Trincomalee District, now the current percentage is, 43 per cent Muslims, 31 per cent Tamils and 26 per cent Sinhalese. The 43 per cent Muslims have only 51 members; the 31 per cent Tamils have 56 members and the 26 per cent Sinhalese have 66 members. How can you justify this?

( ) (An Hon. Member) It is an injustice. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, it is a serious injustice and you expect us to support this Bill. Of course, you have postponed elections. Therefore, there is a big outcry; people want this rectified. We are fully with you on that issue, this Government needs to conduct elections fast. The Joint Opposition is also making a lot of noise about this. So, none of us is against holding elections as soon as possible. If we hold the elections by the end of this year, at least, that is the best. Of course, the Local Authorities have been without any administration for the last two years; a lot of things have been neglected. Therefore, it is important for us to have elections quickly. But, these anomalous situations have to be corrected so that we can justify to our people why we had voted for such a Bill.

The principle contained in the Bill, we accept. We are fully for it, though there is going to be a lot of difficulties for all Parties. Now, increasing the women representation in the Local Authorities is one of the very salutary

971 972

features of this Amendment, which is something that we must all agree and support. I must say that my State Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudarshini Fernandopulle, has been one of the vociferous frontline Members who had fought for this. I must congratulate her that she has won her battle and we are fully with her on this issue. I hope all the ladies in the country will thank us, the male Members in this House, for having at least provided them 25 per cent representation in the Local Authorities. I hope that this representation will help to increase women representation in the Provincial Councils as well as in Parliament. We are all for this. We would like more women to get into all the elected bodies.

With those comments, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would earnestly appeal the Hon. Minister to give us an acceptable explanation and an assurance that these anomalies will be corrected in due course, so that, our support in this Bill could be justified. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, can I be permitted to take one minute to clarify what the Hon. Minister stated?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The Hon. Rauff Hakeem referred to the anomalies with regard to delimitation. Unfortunately, this Bill was passed in 2012. Then delimitation was done and in consequent to that I had to go through an appellate process. I concede that there is an issue and there has been a mechanism to rectify it to a certain extent. But, with regard to the anomalies which the Hon. Rauff Hakeem highlighted, my hands are tied. That has to be brought in by a specific Amendment to Parliament. So, those issues that he referred to and the proceedings with regard to the holding of this election, have no nexus. I believe the serious issues that have been raised by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem should be addressed. But unfortunately, with regard to the holding of this Local Government Election and the issues that the Hon. Minister raised have no nexus, but this Parliament has to look into this grievance. I am sure that all of us will look into that.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Please ensure that you correct it. You must give us that assurance.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I have no legal mandate to rectify the anomalies, but this House has the mandate to do so. So, I leave it to this House.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Who will take the steps to- [Interruption.] We will get the Government - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Rauff Hakeem is trying to get an assurance from me. I am sympathetic to his cause. We will all work towards rectifying whatever anomalies, but with regard to me giving specific undertakings, I have to work in terms of the Legislature at present.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What I am trying to say is, we have already told the Prime Minister - I told him yesterday and this morning - and he assured even in public meetings that the areas where anomalies have been noticed will be corrected and it will be corrected before an election. Therefore, we will take it that you will make all reasonable attempts to bring in whatever legislation that is necessary to correct these anomalies before holding an election.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Minister, we all will try to see what can be done. With regard to the given undertaking, I will work within the present legal framework. But, with regard to the issue raised by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, we will see whether we could work towards to rectify the grievance.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Minister cannot give us a very vague assurance. A proper assurance has to be given, if we are to vote for this. Otherwise, I am sorry, I will at least have to abstain from voting. I say this because I cannot go before our people and justify these sort of anomalies. He also has to be responsible because these are issues that concern one

large ethnic community to which serious wrong has been done. Therefore, I need a proper assurance and I at least expect the Prime Minister to give his assurance for us to vote for this Bill.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next Speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. [5.28p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity given to speak during the Debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill. I am glad that eventually all the Amendments are being brought before the House and together with the Committee Stage Amendments that have been circulated, it will form a complete election regime that can ensure that elections to the Local Authorities are held without any further delay. As has been expressed by many Members today, it is a matter of regret that elections to the Local Authorities, the lowest and the closest representative body to the people, have been postponed for so long. With the passage of this Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill, we hope that elections can be held either before the end of this year or at least, early next year because Local Authorities are the institutions, as I said, that are closest to the people and all day-to-day functions at various levels - villages, towns and cities - are handled by the Local Authorities.

Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that democracy is a series of experiments. In this new electoral process also, we are going to experience yet another experiment because this election system that is being introduced - 60 per cent from the First-Past-the-Post System, 40 per cent through a compensatory PR System, and then, built into that, the requirement of 25 per cent representation of women - in fact, is an experiment. We hope this will be a success story because this is the system that has a wide consensual agreement in terms of a Parliamentary election system. There has been a long clamour for a change of the Parliamentary election system. In the deliberations for a new Constitution, a system has been agreed upon by most parties and it is that system that is now being, if I might

say, experimented through this Local Government elections that are to be held first.

Through this, we believe that the elected bodies will actually be truly democratic and truly representative, because overall number of members who come from different parties will be in line with the percentage of votes that those parties receive. At the same time, there will also be members who would be elected from Wards directly by the people living in those Wards. So, people will have persons who will be forced to be accountable to their Wards and at the same time it will ensure that the distribution of seats in a particular Council will be in accordance with the overall votes received.

As I said, in addition to this, the long-felt need with regard to womens representation will also be ensured. We are not sure how this will work out because there are certain challenging situations, certain extreme situations, situations in which one party dominates a particular area and so on. There might have to be some overhang which has been defined in the Committee Stage Amendments. Those are the challenges. Nevertheless, through this process, we will be able to, in practice, see how this system works and since this is the widely-accepted principle of election for the national Parliament as well, an experimental run in the Local Councils is most desirous. We have also been discussing the possibility of having the same electoral system for all three levels; that is at the national level in Parliament, for the Provincial Councils and the Local Authorities.

Since this is a system that was first agreed upon for Parliament, but now being implemented for the Local Authorities, I think the Government has also felt the need to amend the Provincial Councils Elections Act to bring it in line with the system that is now being introduced at the Local Councils. The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution that was presented to Parliament yesterday is said to be the necessary Constitutional Amendment that paves the way for electoral reform at the provincial level. However, we have indicated to the Government that unless the intention of the Twentieth Amendment is made clear to the country by actually publishing the amendments that are necessary to the Provincial Councils Elections Act, the Twentieth Amendment project will be seen as yet another ruse to postpone the elections for the Provincial Councils.

If it is a bona fide exercise that requires the postponement of the first round of Provincial Councils elections that fall due in October this year, then that has to be made very clear. It must be made plain to the people and for that, we have suggested that the Government at least publish in the gazette the proposed amendments to the Provincial Councils Elections Act and the postponement, if any, of any Provincial Councils election, must only for the necessary period during which the delimitation exercise is to be performed for the provinces and not beyond that. So, in that respect, may I say that the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution has to very specifically limit the period of postponement, if any is necessitated by the fact that the delimitation process is necessary for the new electoral system, that it

1027 1028

will be limited to a period of one year, so that the Delimitation Commission that may be appointed will have time, at least six months to one year, to perform their task but not more than a year, and if not, it will be unfair and it will not be justifiable to extend all Provincial Council elections beyond 2018 and into 2019.

These are some of the concerns that I am publicly expressing. Now this is something that we have already intimated to the Government a number to times, but I am publicly expressing this so that unless these preliminary steps are taken, we will not be in a position to support the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires at least a two-thirds vote in Parliament. I say at least because it is an amendment to the Constitution. If, in the various challenges before the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court requires that a referendum is necessary in addition to the two-thirds vote in Parliament, then, of course, that will cause further difficulty for the Government. But, even if it is only two-thirds, the Government requires the support of the Members from the Opposition ranks as well and I must make it very clear that the purpose of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution must be very clearly announced and the intention must be displayed to the people before they can expect any support from the Opposition ranks.

As far as the Local Authorities elections are concerned, even during this day, there have been discussions with the Hon. Minister with regard to certain anomalies, certain grievances that various political parties have expressed to him. I must thank him for giving patient hearing to all the parties today and finding solutions.

We hope the assurances that the Hon. Minister gives at the end of the day will satisfy the different political parties concerned, and that they will support the passage of this Bill, which all of us agree is long overdue, so that these representative bodies at the lowest level can be constituted and can serve the people.

So, I wish the Hon. Minister all success in his negotiations with various stakeholders here and wish him that even beyond the passage of this Bill the various tasks that he will have to perform before holding the elections and in holding these elections will be a success. Thank you.
