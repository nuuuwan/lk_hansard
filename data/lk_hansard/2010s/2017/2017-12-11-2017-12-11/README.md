"That the question of privilege arising out of the matter raised by the Hon. Roshan Ranasinghe, M.P. on23rd November, 2017 in Parliament to the effect that his privileges have been infringed, be referred to the Committee on Privileges under Standing Order No. 127 of the Parliament."

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I want to get a clarification from you. The Hon. Wijayadasa Rajapaksa has written to you and circulated a document which states that the Constituent Assembly has unconstitutionally been constituted. There has been no proper decision announced by the Chair in this regard. It is the House that should decide on this matter not the

Constituent Assembly. What I am requesting is that the Hon. Speaker should give a Ruling or your opinion on this to the House because otherwise we are proceeding in a manner that is unconstitutional.

APPROPRIATION (AMENDMENT) BILL

. . Order for Second Reading read. [9.36 a.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance and Mass Media) Hon. Speaker, I move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.

Moving the Amendments to the Appropriation Act, No. 24 of 2016, I would like to say a few words on the background to this Amendment. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the economy exhibited mixed performance during the first nine months of this year. As growth in industry services sector improved, an agriculture sector was affected by economy-wide effects of adverse weather conditions.

The economy grew at a rate of 3.9 per cent in real terms in the first half of the year compared to the same period in the previous year, significantly marking below potential growth prospects. The drought and flood related disturbances mainly affected agricultural activities which contributed to overall growth negatively and spilt over to other sectors of the economy as well. Domestic supply disruption, tax revisions and increased prices of imported commodities caused consumer price inflation to remain at elevated levels during the year so far. In November, in the Colombo Consumer Price Index, inflation rose to 7.6 per cent and the growth of credit extended to the private sector decelerated gradually during the year as monetary policy remained tight and less accommodative.

Meanwhile in the fiscal sector revenue collection as well as the Government's primary balance improved during the first nine months of the year along the path of fiscal consolidation as supported by the IMF's extended fund facility programme. Nevertheless, estimates revenue for 2017 may not be achieved during the year due to the delay in the introduction of the new Inland Revenue Act which will be introduced from the 1st of April in the coming year, and it dampened the economic activity which weighed on income tax and taxes on goods and services.

Adverse weather events such as droughts and floods incurred significant fiscal costs in terms of immediate relief measures and expenditure allocations for disaster mitigation measures.

Government intends to spend more on disaster insurance by extending the coverage to droughts as well,

so that more relief could be provided in the time ahead for all those affected by natural disasters. Further, measures are underway to formulate procedures to link up the weather-related compensation to an index which reflects changing weather patterns so that Governments support is extended to needy people in a better targeted manner.

Further, higher than estimated debt service payments owing to high interest payment and rupee depreciation made a sizable impact on the Government cash flows. Therefore, some deviations from the envisaged Budget deficit target is likely in 2017 from the initial estimate of Rs. 625 billion to a revised estimate of Rs. 680 billion. In this context, a further expansion of the borrowing limit is warranted to offset the immediate impact caused by unplanned events on the Governments Budget. Such expansion would facilitate fiscal operations and exert a lease burden on the ongoing Government funded activities. Nonetheless, Governments intension is to keep the utilization of the expanded borrowing capacity to the least possible level. As the approved provisions in the Budget 2017 may render insufficient to meet all payment obligations during the fiscal year 2017, it is needed to mobilize additional funds by means of borrowings.

Accordingly, it is required to increase the borrowing limit from Rs. 1,579.1 billion to Rs. 1,629 billion by amending Section 2. (b) of the Appropriation Act, No. 24 of 2016. Accordingly, I now present the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill for the approval of this House. Thank you.

. . Question proposed.

[9.44a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Speaker, I would like to speak first on Item No. 5 and then on Item Nos. 2 and 3 of the today Order Paper.

There are Regulations on Export Control licence and banned items in terms of Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. Since 1967, Sri Lanka is a signatory body to the World Customs Organization. Therefore, it is compulsory to implement the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System.

According to Article 3 of the said Convention, Customs tariff and statistical nomenclatures shall be in conformity with the Harmonized System. The Harmonized System will be reformed every four years and Harmonized System 2012 amended as Harmonized System 2017 accordingly. The Customs Co-operation Council has recommended certain amendments to the

3903 3904

2017 77

existing Harmonized System Codes in six-digit level and introduced six amendments to the Harmonized System 2012.

It is adopted as a new version, "Harmonized System 2017" to ensure the Harmonized System is kept up-to-date with slight changes in the technology and patterns of international trade. The Amendment covers agricultural sector, chemicals sector, wood sector, textile sector, base metal sector, machinery sector, transport sector and a few other sectors. Accordingly, Sri Lanka made Amendments to the existing national Harmonized System at an eight-digit level to comply with the obligations of the WCO. It is required to publish these Amendments through the Revenue Protection Order as per the Article of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. It is also essential to amend and publish all the Regulations published in Gazette Notifications which include amending its code by using new RPO at the same time.

Hon. Speaker, I will now speak on Item No. 2, "the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill" and Item No. 3, "the Safeguard Measures Bill" of today's Order Paper. Sri Lanka is now decisively moving towards an economic model that is driven by entrepreneurship, trade and investment. Our Government has committed to generating one million new and better jobs for the youth of this country and the only way to do this is by becoming a more active participant in international trade. Sri Lanka is not new to this. We were a country where trade accounted for 80 per cent of the GDP over a decade ago. But, thereafter, we slipped down and now it is half of that, around 40 per cent.

We are decisively moving to a more open and dynamic trade regime, whether it is through removal of para-tariffs or duty reductions through Bilateral Free Trade Agreements. Some measures were introduced by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media in the recent Budget to remove para-tariffs on 1,200 items with a roadmap for removal of all para-tariffs over the next three years. Alongside this, there will be substantial liberalization coming through the new Free Trade Agreements we are signing with Singapore, China and India. While welcoming greater trade with the rest of the world, we have not forgotten the need to look after the interests of our own industries here at home. This is why the two Bills presented today are so significant.

Hon. Speaker, the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties and the Safeguard Measures Bills presented to Parliament today will be vital domestic legislation to facilitate protecting domestic industry from unfair trading practices. I am pleased that our Government was able to present these Bills which have been delayed for many years. These Bills are an outcome of several Consultative Committee Meetings previously held in Parliament, Cabinet decisions incorporating such amendments and final drafting process which included the Attorney-Generals Department and the relevant Government and private sector institutions. The Attorney-General has confirmed that the provisions in the Bills presented today are consistent with the Constitution.

Sir, Sri Lanka has rights under three commercial defence instruments of the World Trade Organization, namely: Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994 - Agreement on Anti-Dumping -; Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and Agreement on Safeguards. However, it was necessary for Sri Lanka to introduce appropriate domestic legislation for implementing the provisions of those three WTO agreements. Many countries, both developed and developing countries, such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and the UK have already enacted required domestic legislation to be in conformity with the provisions of the WTO agreements. Such legislation was long overdue in Sri Lanka and the introduction of these two Bills fulfill that long lacuna.

Mr. Speaker, let me briefly highlight what the significance is of trade remedy measures such as anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard measures in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was in the process of rationalizing and phasing out of most of its Customs Duties in relation to imports under the previous FTAs. Instead of introducing trade remedy laws, Sri Lanka resorted to introducing various para-tariffs. With the removal of these Customs Duties on imports, there has been a tendency on the part of several trading partners of Sri Lanka to resort to dumping or subsidization of their goods of different kinds into Sri Lanka. This creates, from time to time, a situation of unfair competition in the domestic market, whereby the domestic industry may suffer injury. To address such a scenario of unfair trade and to provide a remedy to the domestic industry against injury caused by such dumping and subsidization, anti-dumping and countervailing measures have assumed a great deal of significance. But, let me be very clear - these anti-dumping and countervailing measures or safeguard measures do not aim to provide protection to the domestic industry. These are only remedial measures in the event of injury to the domestic industry caused by dumping, subsidization or by sudden surges of imports. The primary purpose behind these trade remedy measures is to re-establish fair competition and to provide the domestic industry a level playing field; not protection, but a level playing field.

Sir, let me briefly explain the key elements of the Bills being presented today. Dumping is said to occur when goods are exported to a country by another country at a price lower than its normal value. This is an unfair trade practice which can have a distortionary effect. Anti-dumping is a measure to rectify the situation arising out of this. The use of an anti-dumping measure as an instrument of fair competition is permitted by the WTO. It provides relief to the domestic industry against injury caused by dumping.

It is important to understand that dumping is not just about cheap or low-priced imports. It means goods entering at a price lower than its normal value. Once this is established, the trade remedy measures can be considered. Yet, the mere complaint that goods are dumped will not be sufficient to levy anti-dumping duty. It will be done through a systematic and a credible process of investigation and determination.

3905 3906

In addition to anti-dumping, the section on countervailing subsidies will make provisions for remedial measures against unfair trade practices. This is because apart from dumping, countries also resort to the subsidization of the exports to Sri Lanka. Export subsidies, under the WTO agreement as well as these Bills, will be treated as an unfair trade practice.

The section on safeguards in this Bill, on the other hand, authorizes the importing country to restrict imports for a temporary period, if it is established after investigations carried out by competent authorities that imports are taking place in such increased quantities to cause a serious injury to the domestic industry which produces like or directly competitive products.

Sir, although the previous Government talked much about the protection of domestic industry, they resorted to a distorted import tariff regime and the imposition of Cess to protect it. This created an anti-export bias and hurt our exporters competitiveness. What is important is to create the necessary economic environment for entrepreneurs to be competitive and to protect them from unfair trade practices. These two Bills that we introduce to Parliament will enable this.

As part of the new National Trade Policy, our Government will be entering into Bilateral Free Trade Agreements with large economies such as India and China. Our negotiations with Singapore have reached the finality. We propose to sign the FTA with Singapore towards the latter part of January, 2018. FTAs with Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and others are in the pipeline. Under these Free Trade Agreements, we will be undertaking tariff liberalization while seeking market access from those countries.

Hon. Speaker, as we implement tariff liberalization under these FTAs, it should not lead to sudden imports surges or to the dumping of products into our market. We urgently needed to have domestic legislation to address such concerns.

These two Bills, once enacted, will become two significant pieces of Legislation that provide this domestic legal framework to go ahead strongly and confidently into further trade liberalization and greater trade openness, while knowing that the domestic industry has recourse to a good legal framework to prevent unfair trade.

Thank you.

It can be taken up for Debate, but it should not be decided on today so that, before it is put to vote, the Opposition would get an opportunity of debating this properly. We have been waiting for 11 years and, waiting for one more month will not make much effect.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes. Anyway, it will not take one month. Then, Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue with your speech.

[10.09 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, thank you for the opportunity given to me. I will restrict my observations to the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill but not precisely on the Bill that has been presented by the Hon. Minister today which is actually an amendment to the Appropriation Act, No. 24 of 2016.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, what are the Bills which are postponed for the 23rd? Is it only the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill?

Lakshman Kiriella) For others, will we have the vote today? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Okay. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the precise Bill is an amendment to the Appropriation Act, No. 24 of 2016.

3917 3918

I wish to make certain observations with regard to the Report that the Committee on Public Finance presented to Parliament on the last day of the Budget Debate, the 09th of December, 2017. There are some serious issues that we have raised and they are relevant to the Amendments that are proposed to the Appropriation Bill during the course of the current year, which means the year in which that the Appropriation Bill is effective.

Sir, with regard to the process by which figures - Estimates - are presented to Parliament, in the last years Report as well, we raised the issue that accurate figures were not there in the Budget Estimates that were presented and after the Budget Speech of the Hon. Minister, those figures have to be necessarily amended. Therefore, when the Parliament goes through the Debate for one full month, the actual Estimates are not available to Members of Parliament. We raised this issue last year and recommended that at least within a few days of the Hon. Ministers speech, the actual figures be given to Members of Parliament at least during the Debate on the Third Reading. Unfortunately, this year too those figures have not been presented to Parliament and the Committee has also highlighted the fact that it disagreed with various Estimates that the Ministry of Finance projected last year and using common sense estimations and it suggested certain changes. Now, this year when the Ministry of Finance has given us the projected figure for 2017 - that is the year we looked at during the last Budget - most of the figures are much closer to what the Committee on Public Finance gave and not to the Estimates that the Ministry of Finance gave.

So, we had a meeting; the Hon. Minister was also present in the meeting and the officials gave us various explanations. Some of which are justified and some of which are not. But primarily, the problem seems to be the format in which the Ministry functions. They have different formats in which these figures are dealt with, so that one is not comparable with the other. So, each time you raise an issue, the answer that comes by is, No, this is in a different format. I wonder whether this is not something that has happened now or even ten years ago, this has been the way in which things have been done. I wonder whether this was designed in such a way that nobody is able to compare figures so that some figures are given at one point and another set of figures are given later in a different format and there is no possibility of comparison. After two years of working through this, we have come to the realization that this formatting has to be changed if there is to be a proper independent evaluation. We were not able to perform the task of the Public Finance Committee in presenting it to Parliament within four days of our observations on the accuracy of the Estimates given this year also. We took more than a month, exactly a month, to do that. That is another issue. But with the figures that are given to us in this particular format, even within a month, it is not possible. So, it renders nugatory the effort of the Public Finance Committee to present these figures and make our own judgements for the benefit of Members of Parliament during the Budget Debate.

Secondly, I wish to highlight another important issue which involves what we have said in our observations on Budget integrity and discretionary budgeting. Clause 6 of the Appropriation Bill allows what is placed under, "Development Activities" of the "Department of National Budget" Head to be used as a discretionary fund by the Government with a very wide scope regardless of the status purpose of the allocation. This allows for abuse of the budgeting process which has consistently taken place in the past. This Budget Head, that is called the, "Department of National Budget," under which "Development Activities" come, has a misleading label. In presentation, it appears to be a commitment to national development activities which would generally receive strong public approval. But in actual fact, this Budget Head has been designed precisely to avoid commitment as a fungible fund from which exigencies and contingencies can be met. It is actually a contingency kind of fund but it is given the title National Developmental Activities." So, people look and see and think that so much money is being allocated for national development fund but it is actually a discretionary fund that is kept to be used at the discretion of the Minister. It is, therefore, ironic that under the current Budgetary practices, all the Budget Proposals that are solemnly read out in the speech of the Finance Minister implying a serious commitment to the nation are twice misplaced within the Budget.

First, they are misplaced within this Budget Head which is discretionary. The Minister says that we are committed to doing this, the other and all of that; but it goes into a Budget Head which is a discretionary fund implying that the commitment might easily be reversed.

Second, within that Budget Head they are misplaced within the subheading titled, "Contingency" as if the Government were treating the implementation of the Minister's proposals as a matter of chance occurrence.

The Minister makes a long speech and says that we are committed to doing this, that and the other. It first goes into a Budget Head that is discretionary and then into a subhead titled, "Contingencies". How can that very important Budget Speech of the Minister that goes to the country widely within minutes and the next day in all newspapers as the leading story to what the Government is committing itself to, be twice misplaced. Once it goes into a discretionary Head and then only as a "Contingency". There is no real commitment to doing what the Minister in his Budget Speech promises to the country.

The Committee therefore in the Report believes that this is an unfortunate mistake in the budgeting procedure that should be rectified at the earliest. I am glad that the Minister is present when I make these observations. The Committee proposes that a new Budget Head be created with the title, "Proposals of the Finance Minister" rather than put it into Department of National Budget which is a discretionary fund and to put it into a "Contingency". But here if you put it under a separate Head saying that these are the "Proposals of the Finance Minister" then those are identified and at the end of the year you can evaluate and

see whether those solemn promises that the Minister made on his feet while presenting the Budget have been implemented or not. So the proposals and commitments of the Finance Minister in the Budget Speech can be embedded with due recognition and seriousness that they deserve.

The proposal by the Committee is to treat the Minister's commitments seriously in the budgetary process. Until then, the Operational Activities heading of the National Budget Head be considered as an item placed in the Head that are not discretionary. Until this change takes place, we suggest that this not be considered discretionary but as firm commitments.

In addition to the Budget Proposals, much of the Governments welfare promises are placed in this section as well. So, you place all the welfare promises into a discretionary Head and as "Contingencies". Overall this means that the allocations made here which can range between 10 to 20 per cent of the Governments expenditure can be utilized for very different purposes than those stated. This has previously been referred to as a "slush fund" that is concealed within Sri Lankas Budget.

This discretionary process was only created in 2002 by an amendment to the Appropriation Act. I wish to bring this serious concern to your notice as we understand that there are contingencies and more and more contingencies occur when droughts happen, when floods happen, when landslides happen and when Tsunamis happen. These natural disasters are also on the increase without any forewarning; but that can remain in the Contingency Fund properly identified as a Contingency Fund. The Ministers proposals, particularly the welfare proposals and even other developmental activities should not go into a Contingency Fund and be allowed to be used at the discretion of the Minister but must be treated as a firm commitment and allocations made specifically for those.

The time between the Appropriation Bill being presented and the Hon. Ministers speech is very short in our country. This is one of the reasons why this is not possible to be done and the Budget process also concludes within a month. So, that is why we have suggested that at least those be placed under a separate Head created as the "Proposals of the Minister of Finance" so that those can be properly identified and their implementation can be overseen.

Thank you very much, Sir. [..71.07] ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , , .. . .

[10.58a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Then, how many minutes do I have?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Five minutes is the maximum.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Okay, Sir. I am pleased to inform this House that the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill and Safeguard Measures Bill provide the necessary domestic legislation for Sri Lanka to invoke remedial measures against unfair trade practices as a member of the World Trade Organization.

The first Bill on AD and CVD is to enable the domestic industry to be safeguarded from unfair trade practices such as dumping and subsidization through the levying of compensatory duties on imports that are benefitting from unfair trade practices. The second Bill on Safeguard Measures allows countries to adopt measures to restrict imports when large quantities of imports cause

serious injury to domestic industry. There are three WTO instruments which provide trade remedies in the context of an increasingly liberalized global trading environment which may lead to or allow for unfair business practices. Thus, this legislation intends to promote and safeguard domestic industry of the WTO member countries from unfair trade practices and sudden import surges causing or threatening to cause serious injury to domestic industry.

The World Trade Organization-sanctioned domestic trade remedies are already in use, indeed for many decades now by a majority of both developed and developing countries including our major trading partner in the SAARC, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh as well as China, Republic of Korea, EU, USA et cetera.

Sir, it is a fact that this House has recognized the need to enact these Bills over the years and much preparation has already been made in this regard. The record will show that Cabinet had approved the drafting of this legislation as far back as in 2001 and the legislation had been successfully drafted, successfully revised with all Government - private stakeholders, legal consultants and WTO guidance and presented to Parliament, incorporating all Ministry observations and recommendations.

As the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama said, the delay to date in processing these two Bills is due to Parliament being dissolved after the Second Reading of these Bills in the past, change of governments et cetera. However, all preparatory work, training, awareness generation on the subject of trade remedies, defensive action on trade remedies have been continued through the Department of Commerce under my Ministry.

Therefore, this legislation fulfills an outstanding and serious need to protect the domestic industry from unfair trade practices and unforeseen surge of imports. It is both fundamental and essential for the future health and growth of our domestic industry and manufacture.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .
