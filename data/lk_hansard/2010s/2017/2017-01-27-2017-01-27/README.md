Now you cannot go ahead and produce a doctor. -[Interruption.] You must answer that question. As a result, today, Hon. Speaker, students are being arrested, they are being remanded.

I reiterate that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is illegal said the Minister of Science Technology and Research Susil Premajayantha yesterday.

This is a senior Government Minister making a statement.

It further states, I quote:

Speaking further, he maintained that only those who are not conversant with the law are scared of these institutions and he was not one of them.

The minister made these remarks in reply to a question posed by journalists at a press briefing held at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.

He said that due to certain actions by the FCID, it led to certain individuals gaining popularity, especially when a minister or a MP is arrested and legal action is filed. He said this could translate into an election victory for the person instigating the arrest.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . . This is not a point of Order. If they want a Debate, we can give a full-days Debate.

[11.20 a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, today the House is paying tribute to a predecessor of the very office that you are in as well as one of those dominant political figures among Muslims in this country.

The late Hon. M. H. Mohamed was a rare Muslim leader whose political views, as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa a while ago stated in the House, transcended narrow communal boundaries. Throughout his colorful political journey, he was an effective mobilizer of broad alliances of people irrespective of ethnic, religious or linguistic differences. This made him a formidable force in metropolitan Colombo. He claimed an unbroken record of representing the predominantly Sinhala dominated Borella Constituency under the First-Past-the-Post System of elections that prevailed in the past.

I can confidently say that nobody who came to know the late Hon. M. H. Mohamed left his presence unaffected by his simple charm. He had his own independent views and also many detractors and adversaries. But all in all, they all agreed that he fought fierce battles, but retained his warm humanity.

His advent to politics coincided with the socio-political transformation that began in the watershed year of 1956. , , , , 1956 .

He also adriotly maneuvered the Colombo Municipal Council Elections soon after the debacle of 1956, in which the United National Party suffered one of its worst

defeats. He ensured that the party wins the election to demonstrate to the dejected party ranks after its humiliating defeat in 1956, that the party retained and remained strong at its core - the municipal politics of Colombo. Thus, the late Hon. M. H. Mohamed, in the prime of his political career, acquired the aura of a Colossus in the public discourse of the nation. He was thrust on the national stage as the bright young Mayor of Colombo, whose election as the first Muslim Mayor of Colombo in January, 1960 marked the revival of the then beleaguered United National Party.

Sir, he was also mentor and adviser not only to young Muslims, but also to many Sinhala and Tamil personalities who sought entry into politics and public life through the Colombo Municipal Council. He played a pioneering role in many Muslim community-based organizations and was equally dynamic in other social enterprises. He played a leading role in the Old Boys' Association of his Alma Mater - Wesley College, Colombo. He extended his generous patronage to Buddhist and Christian social initiatives, not because he was a politician but because of his many friends in those fields who actively sought his counsel and support.

He found immense satisfaction in politics. He was a fine craftsman in the exercise of manipulation of power to reach his goals and objectives. He often confessed in private that he disliked unending petty political fights that were characteristic of elected office. Of course, they were necessary, he said reluctantly, to get something done.

He was the quintessential city hall politician. He remained steadfast to the personal style of political networking which is a sine-qua-non in municipal politics. That was also the foundational strength of this political trajectory.

Mr. Speaker, in 1965, he was made the Minister of Labour in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. In his Parliamentary career of six decades, he served under Presidents J.R. Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa and D.B. Wijetunga.

His illustrious peers were men in the calibre of Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Sir Razik Fareed, Jabir A. Cader, Faleel Cafoor and Halim Ishaak. Their cosmopolitan worldview placed them in unique pantheon of Muslim leaders of Sri Lanka.

Forged on the anvil of Municipal politics, where personal relations are lifelong commitments, the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed acquired a steely resolve and an urbane ease. He willingly opened doors of opportunity to all ethnic groups. We have got to bear in mind that we all love and care for the same values he insisted and instilled. He expressed his views honestly and forthrightly. He continued to comment on public issues. He was active right until the very end.

Mr. Speaker, he was also, as mentioned earlier, one of the founder members of the Rabithathul Alamal Islami, the World Muslim League that has its head office in the

655 656

Holly City of Mecca. He had many friends in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Muslim world. So much so, whenever we attend conferences outside this country relating to Islam and Muslims, there would be many who would approach and ask whether we knew Mr. Mohamed and inquired after his health. He set up the Islamic Centre and through the Islamic Development Bank assisted many worthy students to pursue their educational career whenever they are faced with adversity. He was also one of those early Ministers in-charge of Muslim religious and cultural affairs, who had pioneered the State-sponsored Hajj Pilgrimage Programmes which functioned very smoothly under his leadership.

He came from a very proud lineage of politics like N.D.H. Abdul Cader and various others, who were some of the earliest Members of the Legislative Assembly in this country. Coming from a proud lineage and inheriting a proud legacy, he also has left behind his heirs. His two sons, Hussain Mohamed and Shaul Hameed Mohamed had also been involved in politics and I am sure all of us in this countrys Muslim political sphere could never forget the trail-blazing impact that a colossal figure like the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed has left behind.

I believe any tribute to him should also include some of the tribulations that he faced in his life. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the former President Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and many others from the SLFP will remember the controversial Impeachment Motion and the No-Confidence Motion that was brought against the late Hon. M. H. Mohamed. I would like to quote what my late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, in stout defence of the then Speaker, the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed, has said in Column 485 of Hansard dated 10th October, 1991:

If the Speaker had made a mistake on the first occasion, he has every right to remedy it now. We are lawyers. There are hundreds of judges. We have the Supreme Court. Everyday judgements are being reversed. Hundreds of injunctions are ex-parte given, writs are issued, stay orders are given on ex-parte hearing supported by affidavits. But the day you go and present the other story - the court has inherent powers - because uberrima fide the absolute faith, is broken, the trust established between the court and the man who asked for the relief is broken, the court will say, you shall no longer be heard, you are not entitled to that right. This is the legal position. Therefore, if the Speaker has made a mistake on the first occasion, then I am of the view that the second act of rejection is a matter which was exercised in good faith. Therefore, these are matters on which we like to hear further submissions.

Sir, I further quote:

If I am satisfied at the end of the day that in the light of the arguments that are presented, there was a dishonest rejection of the Impeachment Motion, I shall not hesitate to vote for the No Confidence Motion but if I am not satisfied, once again in keeping with the pledge that I have promised to uphold, namely, the Constitution, - a man whoever it may be, we should not sling mud - and I shall not hesitate to give the benefit of the doubt to the Hon. Speaker and acquit him of this serious allegation."

These are the words of my late leader in defence of the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed whose decision in that controversial Impeachment Motion ended up in an impeachment on himself. I think those who had been in Parliament those days -I was in the Gallery watching this

whole drama - and most of you who are in the House today who had been involved from either side of the debate then may remember this. At that time, our current Prime Minister was on the side of late President Ranasinghe Premdasa and that was one of those days in which this whole House and its integrity came into serious question. But, particularly, I must say, whoever who had been Members in this House during 1989 - 1994 would vouch that the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed, despite whatever controversy, was one of those Speakers who had absolute control of the House when he sat in the Chair and that he dispensed his duties as the custodian of the rights of the Members in a very even-handed manner and earned the respect of both sides of the House.

It is with a heavy heart that we pay this tribute to one of those colossal figures from among the Muslims who strolled the political firmament of this country.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [.. 11.34] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , , , , , .. .

He, as the Hon. Speaker, has made one of the most important judgments from the Chair. It was in relation to Commission of inquiry into the abduction and murder of Mr. Richard De Soysa: Ruling on point of Order. It was recorded in Hansard of 18th December, 1990. It was a very important Order given by him. It is a lasting Order from the Chair. I do not want to read the entire Order. The issue was whether a Motion given by the Opposition at that time was valid or not. They asked for a Debate in the House. The Government objected to that as there was some inquiry before the courts. Objections were raised with regard to the Debate. The Hon. Prime Minister would remember this. It is a recorded, important Order from the Chair.

I would like to just quote a few sections of that Order. Column 2300 states:

Regarding the second argument of the Hon. Leader of the House, I have taken note of a Ruling given by my predecessor, the Hon. Albert F. Peiris, regarding this matter. However, over the years the accepted practice of the House, supported by successive Speakers, has been that Standing Order 78 cannot be construed to include the Attorney-General.

Then, it goes on to say:

The right and supremacy of Parliament to debate almost all matters brought before it is an unfettered right that should be safeguarded at all times. However, I do take cognizance of the fact that there is a self- imposed restriction on the freedom of the House to debate any matter by the principle of sub judice which has been enshrined in Standing Order 84(vi). I have also borne in mind two other salient points which were adduced by Hon. Members of the Opposition. Firstly, it is that the right to debate any matter before the House should not be fettered merely because at some point of time a matter could be brought before the courts by plaint being filed in civil action, which could be done even with the idea of thwarting the freedom of discussion in the House. This I feel should not be permitted and I would like to zealously safeguard the rights of the House in this matter. The second point is that this case had created for it a great degree of importance in this country.

This was an Order given from the Chair. Mr. Richard De Soysas abduction became a national discussion. Here, the Speaker gave an Order in this manner. I also made a submission. In his Order, he refers to that and says, I quote:

I agree with the submission made by Mr. Dinesh Gunawardena that the substantial part of the Motion calls upon His Excellency the President to appoint a Commission of Inquiry. What precedes it are several recitals that give the reasons for the Motion. They are severable from the Motion, which can stand without them.

[11.59 a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I consider it a privilege to be able to say a few words on this Condolence Motion pertaining to the death of the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed, Member of Parliament, Minister and one-time Speaker in this august Assembly.

Sir, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed is said to have received his early education at Wesley College in Colombo and he was an active member of the Old Boys' Association of Wesley College and held the post of President of that Association for a long period of time. He rendered a great service to that institution.

I first came to know the Hon. Mohamed when I entered Parliament in 1977. The Prime Minister too entered Parliament in 1977, and in 1977, the Hon. Mohamed was a Minister. He was the Minister in-charge of Transport. He was a very kind person, a very genial person. He tried to get along well with everybody; in fact, he got along well with everybody. He was interested in maintaining a close relationship with Members of Parliament of all communities and he was one who made a significant contribution towards communal amity in this country.

In fact, I remember, when I once had a long conversation with him, he told me that he represented a particular electorate in the Colombo District - I believe, it was Colombo North - and the majority of the voters in that electorate were not persons of his community but of the majority community and that a young politician at that time, who is a much older politician now, had gone and seen him and told him, In this constituency, my people are the majority. In fact, the people belonging to my caste are the majority and I think you should not continue to be a Member of this constituency any longer and I would like to take over this constituency from you. The Hon. Mohamed told me that he responded by saying, All people in this constituency, irrespective of which community they belong to, support me and I am elected by them and I will continue to be their Member. If you desire to contest me, you can contest me and face the result." That gentleman had disappeared from the scene and went off to a far off place, which he now represents. So, Hon. Speaker, that was the Hon. Mohameds character.

He was very concerned about finding a solution to the national question in this country and he hoped that Hon. Members of all communities would come together in a very responsible and reasonable way to resolve the national question and was greatly disappointed that many Colleagues of the majority community who were close to him even disappointed him; went back on their words; went back on their commitments and were not sincere and genuine in resolving the national question in a reasonable and acceptable way.

In the course of the long discussions with the Hon. Mohamed, it was clear to me that he realized that if the matter was not resolved in a reasonable way, the consequences that would be inevitable would not be helpful as far as this country was concerned.

It is a sad matter, Sir, that this situation continues even now. Even though at the last Presidential Election and the last General Election the people of this country returned a verdict which was symbolic and supportive of a genuine and reasonable resolution of the national question, we seem to be having difficulty in that matter even today and I am reminded of what the Hon. Mohamed told me; that if this matter is not resolved in a reasonable, respectable way, it will be inevitable that the consequences to this country will be grave. I want to say in this House, Sir, that those were the words of wisdom of a very senior and experienced politician of our country who valued communal amity.

He was also a Minister of other portfolios in his career. He was one of your predecessors, Hon. Speaker. He was a Speaker of this august Assembly. He took part in various conferences at various different points of time. I had a very close, personal relationship with him. In fact, I was quite sad when I heard that he had passed away, though he passed away at the ripe old age. He had a very, very cordial, friendly and genial disposition and was always able to get along well with everyone and I think, we have lost the services of a very senior politician of a very gentlemanly nature and I join the other Hon. Members of this House in expressing our very sincere condolences to the members of his family and to everybody else who was close to Mr. M.H. Mohamed.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

[1.35p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. The late Hon. Minister, M.H. Mohamed was one of my leaders. Even though earlier we belonged to different political parties, I used to be in contact with him and get his advice. He was a thorough gentleman. That is why being a Muslim he contested the Borella electorate which had only 5 per cent of Muslims. He was able to win the hearts and confidence of the people of all communities right throughout the period he was in politics. As far as I can remember, he was the Minister of Transport and also in-charge of Muslim affairs through which he was able to serve the Muslim community as well as all communities.

Also, I would like to remind that he was one of the senior Vice Presidents of the Rabita al-Alam al-Islami Movement in Saudi Arabia through which he was able to get the help from Saudi Arabia to help all communities. In addition, he was the pioneer in forming the Islamic Centre at Maligawatte by which he was able to coordinate with the different sections of Muslims and also get in touch with the leaders of all communities. We all used to get together to do many services to help the country.

Further, he was in charge of the Islamic Development Bank, by which he was able to get foreign scholarships for children of all communities and so many youngsters were successful because of his efforts.

I cannot forget and I am proud to say that the first Muslim Speaker, Hon. H. S. Ismail, was from my electorate and after that the next Muslim Speaker was the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed. I remember, even though I was not t in Parliament at that time, he was able to coordinate and get the confidence of all Members by which he was able to successfully conduct the Sessions of Parliament.

We also cannot forget that he had two of his sons engaged in politics; Hussain Mohamed was the Mayor of Colombo. I think, later, he became the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia. As the Mayor, he served the people of Colombo and as the Ambassador, he was able to help the country as well. His brother Shaul Hameed Mohamed was also a Member of a Provincial Council. So, just like their father, they were able to serve the people.

673 674

The most important thing I would like to mention is, I can remember when I was a young politician, even though we belonged to different parties, he always said, Serve the people; think of the people." According to our religious belief he said, "There is another world where we have to answer. He was able to handle so many progressive movements successfully and helped not only one particular community but the country as a whole. So, that is why he won the confidence of everybody.

When he was alive, I have been following his politics and activities. Finally, I would like to convey my sympathies to his family. His loss is a big loss not only for his family but also for the whole community.

Thank you.

[1.40 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

I wish to thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for permitting me to participate in the Vote of Condolence in respect of the late Hon. Alhaj M.H. Mohamed, the charismatic politician, leader, former Speaker of this House and Cabinet Minister who held many portfolios and was highly respected amongst the Muslim community as well as by the people of all other communities.

"Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raajioon" - "From him do we come, and unto him we return." This is what the Holy Quran says.

"Many a man has trod the soil of the earth. Many more will do so in time to come. But not everyone of them will leave their footprints in the sand of time. However, there are a few who have done so, and there will be those who will leave their mark." One such illuminating personality is Marhoom Alhaj Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed.

Sir, I have known Marhoom M.H. Mohamed well over a period of 40 years, which dates back to late President J.R. Jayewardenes era, when he was the Minister of Transport. During this period, he pioneered the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs as well. I would like to state that he was a leader who inspired many young men. He addressed many important issues pertaining to the conducting of the Hajj pilgrimage of Sri Lankan Muslims in a more efficient manner, which was far better than the standards maintained after his tenure.

Sir, with his potential and experience ranging from the institution of Local Government, right up to this House and going beyond this House and even having graced the Chair in which you yourself, Hon. Deputy Speaker, is now occupying, he went further by associating himself

with Rabitat al-Alam al-Islami, the World Muslim League of Saudi Arabia, which is functioning in Holy Mecca and became the founding member of the Sri Lankan Chapter of such a pious and prestigious organization and became constituted as a Councillor as well. He also founded the Motamar al-Alam al-Islami of Sri Lanka Council under the direction of the dynamic figure none other than Dr. Inam-ul Khan of Pakistan.

Sir, Marhoom Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed, fondly referred as, "MH," by all, has held several Cabinet portfolios at different times from being a Municipal Councilor, Member of Parliament, Minister and eventually climbed to the pinnacle and became the Speaker of Parliament. He left behind a legacy, the impressive Islamic Centre at Maligawatta, which would continue to serve the Muslim community with ambiguity he so desired.

Marhoom M.H. Mohamed did not expect to be called a Muslim leader when undertaking his pursuits in politics or religious matters. He identified himself as a national leader in resolving conflicts among all communities from time to time. In fact, at the Islamic Centre, he formed a Peace Committee including Buddhist priests, Hindu priests and Christian clergy and Ulemas.

He treated them all with equal respect and honour without distinction. Ven. Kamburugamuwe Vajirabuddhi Thero and other Buddhist monks always patronized the Islamic Centre without any reservation and gave their fullest cooperation to this Muslim leader to forge ahead with reconciliatory efforts.

The late Hon. Marhoom M.H. Mohamed was so loved and respected that he won the hearts of the Sinhalese, so much so that he was a dayakaya at every temple in his electorate. Sir, you may know that as you are also from the same electorate. It was an awe-inspiring sight to witness the large number of yellow-robed Buddhist priests converging at his funeral and paying their last respects with choked emotion and tears in eyes. He, in actual fact, built up a new culture of reconciliation and peace building and invited his brotherhood to join in this meritorious - "silwath" - path.

When he became a Member of Parliament, the greatest humanitarian service he did was to transform Wanathamulla - a shanty dwellers shack - into a developed settlement with flats, schools, a community centre and playgrounds matching the modern style of the metropolis. The grateful people lined the streets of Wanathamulla, when his Janaza was wending its way through their settlements, weeping and crying out Borella Piya Budu Wewa! It symbolized an inimitable sight seldom witnessed before.

Sir, having come from a deeply religious family, Marhoom M.H. Mohamed did not neglect his religious functions, associations or activities. The commemoration of the 1400th year of the revelation of Holy Qur'an throughout the Island for one full year was a landmark event in the life of Marhoom M.H. Mohamed. A National Committee was set up by the then Prime Minister, the

675 676

[ ]

2017 27

Hon. Dudley Senanayake under the Chairmanship of Marhoom M.H. Mohamed. It goes down in history that a commemorative stamp to mark an Islamic event was issued for the first time; prisoners were released and the National Flag was ordered to be flown on Government buildings by the then Minister of Home Affairs, the late Hon. (Dr.) W. Dahanayake.

His deep Islamic leanings and beliefs did not prevent him from unselfishly working towards communal harmony, regardless of occasional unpopularity within the Muslim community to which he belonged. He was appointed by the Government as the Chairman of the National Hijra Council, which worked not only for the welfare of Muslims, but also contributed towards establishing communal harmony. Towards this, he organized two international seminars in Sri Lanka on the Universality of Islam and arranged a dialogue between Muslims and Christians, with top delegates from international Muslim organizations representing at these events.

Through the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre in Maligawatta, which Marhoom M.H. Mohamed was credited to have established, he periodically invited Ulemas, Buddhist priests, Christian clergy and Hindu priests for events projected to endorse communal harmony; which is something we should carry on in our reconciliation efforts.

Sir, I am very happy to say about his eight children. My good friend Mr. M. Hussain Mohamed, former Mayor and also the Ambassador for Saudi Arabia, his brother M. Hasan Gassaly Mohamed, Ms. Ummu Hafeera, Dr. Nasz Haniffa, son-in-law and also the Ambassador for Bangladesh and Oman, his daughter, Ms. Thufa Hameed, the Consulate General for Sudan and Mr. Haniffa Mohamed are all present here.

After his death, I met Mr. Haniffa Mohamed, Mr. Shahul Hameed, my good friend and a former Member of the Western Provincial Council and Shaha Mohamed. They have acquired their late fathers good qualities extremely well, which I have personally witnessed, in carrying out the Islamic culture and human values towards every community just as their late father used to do.

[1.55 p.m.] ... ( ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I consider it a great privilege to be able to say a few words in this august Assembly about a son of our soil who had made so many contributions for the well-being of Sri Lanka and her people. He was a no ordinary politician. He assumed a nobler role to play his part for the integrity of this country and strengthen national amity of a lasting sort. As an affable personality, he always greeted us with an infectious smile and never failed to enquire into our welfare. For longer period he, though several years senior to me in age, befriended me both in politics and personal life and never once approached with any rancour despite some of our differences we assumed in public life.

In fact, I have known ex-Speaker Al-Haj M.H. Mohamed since my school days. He initially represented the Maligawatta ward, where I spent a good part of my childhood. Moreover, he had a positive role in my upbringing and exposure to political career. More importantly, he had been our family friend for many years until he passed away last year.

I believe, among the Muslim statesmen of the past, he occupied a significant place. For, he had a long commitment to politics and statesmanship than many others in his generation. Brought up in the cosmopolitanism of Colombo society, he was exposed to the multi-ethnicity of our motherland. Never a controversial statesman, he devoted himself to the upliftment of his lesser fortunate people. Though born in a considerably comfortable family of business connections, he, during most of his career, mixed around

with lesser fortunate people for whose benefits he devoted his political career. Late M.H. Mohamed strode the Sri Lankan political arena like a Colossus for over seven decades. He passed through the portals of four generations in politics and in family life.

Al-Haj M.H. Mohamed, was a sincere personality who was admitted to the pantheon of politics when he was still in his teens. Thus, while in his adolescence, he made a success of his debut to enter the Colombo Municipal Council in 1945. His upbringing was in comfortable family surroundings; walking up and down from his home in Dematagoda to Wesley College, which is his Alma mater, he was always proud of his Burgher friends along Mount Mary, Dematagoda; a large number of them too attended Wesley College. This gave young Mohamed an ideal exposure to improve his English vocabulary and also a vista to chart his political future.

Late Hon. M.H. Mohamed was a Member of the Municipal Council, a Member of Parliament, a Minister, a Speaker and also a stalwart of the United National Party who entered into politics and remained in that enterprise during that golden era, after entering the Colombo Municipal Council in 1947. After his father Proctor Haniffa bade adieu to this lively political career, the Late Hon. M.H. Mohamed contested the same Maligawatta ward which his illustrious father represented up to then. After a vigorous campaign, the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed had built a fairly reasonable reputation and he was victorious as an independent candidate and entered the exalted corridors of power in the prestigious Colombo Municipal Council.

Politics was a legacy he inherited from his grandfather, Mr. M.C. Abdul Rahman, who created history by becoming the first Muslim to enter the Legislative Council under the British Government. The process continued with Mr. N.M.M. Haniffa, the son of M.C. Abdul Rahman, the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed, his grandson, Mr. Hussain Mohamed and Mr. Shaul Hameeed Mohamed, the great grandsons, all climbing the ladder one after the other.

The buds bloomed into radiant flowers when in 1961, the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed crowned himself as the first Muslim Mayor of Colombo. The flower strewn-path continued when his son, Mr. Hussain Mohamed, was made to wear the mantle in 1989; the father and the son basked in the glory, adding a new chapter to the history of the principal municipal council administration. He built a strong stonewall around him to defend the motherland stoutly; he had a passion for loyalty to his country.

Apart from that, he was a champion of communal harmony and totally dedicated his entire life to foster communal understanding and fraternity. Because of his ancestral background and heritage, the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed devoted himself to the cause of Islam and to the service of the Muslim community, both nationally and internationally. He was the first in so many respects in the history of Sri Lanka. He won his ward in the Colombo Municipal Council and on 12th January, 1960,

679 680

[ ]

2017 27

was elected as the first Muslim Mayor of Colombo. I was elected at the same time to that Municipal Council and I am happy and proud that I cast my first vote to the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed to become the first Muslim Mayor of Colombo. He was in the Colombo Municipal Council from 1947 to 1965. Again, he was in-charge of Muslim religious and cultural affairs in President J.R. Jayewardenes Government.

He was appointed by the Government as the Chairman of the National Hijra Council, which not only worked for the welfare of Muslims, but also contributed towards establishing communal harmony. Towards this, he organized two international seminars in Sri Lanka on the Universality of Islam and arranged a dialogue between Muslims and Christians with top delegates from international Muslim organizations represented at those events. The late Hon. M.H. Mohamed, through the Islamic Centre in Maligawatte, which he was credited to have established, periodically invited Ulemas, Buddhist, Christian and Hindu clergy for events intended to promote communal harmony.

He devoted himself to the cause of Islam and to the service of the Muslim community, both nationally and internationally. I can list out many of his contributions to international Islamic resurgence beginning from his pioneering moves to institutionalize the Haj pilgrimage. The first Haj delegation proposed by the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed received the approval of the Government of Sri Lanka. The World Muslim League - Rabita Al-Alam Al-Islami - was launched under the patronage of King Faisal bin Abdulaziz in 1962 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The late Hon. M.H. Mohamed was associated with this organization from the very beginning and was its founder-member of the Sri Lankan chapter of the organization. He was a Member of the Constituent Council of the Rabita Al-Alam Al-Islami, the highest decision-making body of the international Muslim organization.

He established the Islamic Centre in Maligawatte, Colombo in 1965. Through this Centre, he had a lot of understanding created between him and all the communities and conducted a number of conferences. Besides the Islamic Centre, he established many Jummah Mosques, Muslim orphanages, the Muslim Ladies' Arabic College, an Islamic centre for physically handicapped, a girls school, a college and an Arabic school. He initiated many projects for the education of Sri Lankan Muslims through the Islamic Centre. He was behind the arrangement for the educational scholarships for the education of Sri Lankan Muslims through the Islamic Development Bank - IDB.

Writing about the political achievements of the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed, Dr. Wickrema Weerasooriya mentioned, Mohameds political achievements are simply unique. From a mere Member of the Colombo Municipal Council to end up as the First Citizen of Colombo - Mayor - and then go on to win a Parliamentary seat and hold many Cabinet portfolios under both Dudley Senanayake and J.R. Jayewardene and then end up as the Speaker of the House of Parliament when R. Premadasa

was the President of the country are no mean achievements. Only those who have so succeeded know how difficult the road was! By any conventional standard, Mohamed was an overachiever. But the humility with which he accepted all accolades and praise held him good stead in good times as well as in bad times.

Finally, I must say how the majority Sinhalese people had accepted him as one of their leaders. His Borella electorate, which he represented in this penultimate years, is eternally grateful to him for the service he had rendered to them. When he passed away, as mentioned by the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana, the speaker who spoke before me, the people in his electorate expressed their deep sentiments about him. They exclaimed as " !"; our father of Borella may attain enlightenment! I never heard such heartening sentiments, just before the janaza left his house at Borella. The overwhelming surge of sorrow expressed by his voters - mostly the Sinhala people who thronged the funeral house in their thousands, wailing, shrieking, shouting and tearing their hairs out - was the highest demonstration of mourning and sorrow not witnessed in the recent past even at any leaders funeral. They were spontaneous in putting up banners and placards all along the Borella which was the funeral route with the wordings " "; our father of Borella is no more!

In fact, with the Hon. M.H. Mohameds loss, Sri Lanka had lost a worthy son, but his deeds and words will be there for ever to reverberate for the others to follow. With my deep appreciation of his life, career and contributions, I wish to conclude this speech with the prayers that he will have a special place in Jannat as we say, in Heaven.

Thank you. [.. 2.09] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka - Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media and Chief Government Whip) , , .. . 5, 3 , .
