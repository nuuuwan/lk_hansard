( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you go ahead.

[11.46 a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Hon. Speaker. Before I speak on the Adjournment Motion that is before the House, I want to say a few words, Sir, generally about the issue of corruption in this country and how different governments have been dealing with this issue.

Corruption is endemic in this country. Every government has been responsible. When elections are held, one party attacks the other on the basis of corruption. The party which is the incumbent government is attacked and the other party comes to power. But corruption continues. It is publicly talked about that the government is corrupt, the Ministers are making money and various things are happening. They blame each other. But they all do the same thing and do not ever make any honest endeavour to bring this to an end. People are getting sick of this situation. My fear is that if this present situation continues, this corruption which has become endemic and so wide in this country might be the cause for the end of democracy. Democracy in this country can come to an end unless corruption is brought to a halt.

We all know that despotism and dictatorship have always been preceded in many countries by rampant corruption and that rampant corruption has been the main cause for despotism and dictatorship taking place in many countries and democracy being terminated. Corruption needs to be dealt with by any government. It must be stopped. It must be terminated. Persons guilty must be punished. But it never happens in this country. For the last so many decades we have been talking about corruption; corruption under the UNP; corruption under the SLFP, corruption under the UPFA; that Minister is corrupt ; this Minister is corrupt and so on. Who is the man in this country who has been convicted for corruption in court?

121 122

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) The TNA is - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Is there one person who has been convicted? You have been talking about corruption under every government. Had there been one single man from any government who has been convicted in court for corruption?

( ) (An Hon. Member) But they put us behind bars illegally. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) This is the position. So, you are fooling the people. You are fooling this House. You are fooling the Hon. Members of this House. You are hand in glove with each other in the matter of corruption. Both the UNP and the SLFP are hand in glove with each other in the matter of corruption. That is the truth.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Minister of Rehabilitation [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

is the most corrupt. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) People are getting sick of all of you; people are getting tired of all of you; people feel that all of you must be packed off and people might prefer a dictator taking over. It almost happened. In 2015, we were moving towards a despotic dictatorship; we were moving towards the end of democracy. Fortunately the people stopped that. But we had great leaders in this country. Did anyone accuse Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake of corruption? Did anyone accuse late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike of corruption? Did anyone accuse late Hon. Dudley Senanayake of corruption? Did anyone accuse late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike of corruption?

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) What about J.R. Jayewardene? ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Did anyone accuse even late President, Ranasinghe Premadasa of corruption?

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) No. Only killing; no corruption. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Why? What is happening now? ( ) (An Hon. Member) He was accused - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Okay. What is happening now? I am not saying the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe is corrupt; I am not saying His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena is corrupt. But there is corruption. You know it and nothing is happening. Corruption must be eliminated, Sir. Much is talked about the corruption that prevailed during the last regime.

That man is being arrested; this man is being arrested; some charges are levelled against one person and some other charges are levelled against the other person. You have been in office for two years. What have you done? Has anyone been indicted in court in regard to any particular charge? Has anyone been convicted? No. Are you trying to save the persons guilty or are you framing false charges that you cannot substantiate against people? This country needs to know, when there is so much of allegations of corruption that is being levelled against the former government, why is it that no one has been convicted or why is it that no one has even been charged in a court of law. Is it because you are protecting them or is it because your charges are thoroughly unfounded and you cannot substantiate them?

Therefore, Sir, this must be brought to an end. We cannot allow this to go on. It is bad for the country. The country is stinking with charges of corruption both against the UNP and the SLFP.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Against the present - ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Even against the present Government, there are charges of corruption. We read about them in the newspapers. What is happening?

On the issue of the Central Bank, Sir, I will not be long. This has been a long standing issue. The Central Bank has lost its prestige in this country. It has lost its status in this country.

123 124

2017 24

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Definitely. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) The Central Banks misconduct, their misbehaviour, their acting beyond the legitimate functions of a central bank did not start yesterday or the day before. It started a long time ago. During the last regime, the Central Bank was accused of even engaging in political propaganda on behalf of the government.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You have only three more minutes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) In the United States they propagated the policies of the government. So, this has been going on for a long time. But, as far as this particular bond scam is concerned, the truth must be ascertained and the persons responsible must be brought to book. Even with regard to the earlier bond scams, nobody should be spared.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Prime Minister - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) No one should be spared. I would urge the Government to appoint an upright independent commission of inquiry to go into the whole question and find out the truth. It is absolutely imperative that the country must know the truth. We do not care who the person who is responsible, but the person responsible must be ascertained and brought to book. He must be charged and - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Lohan Ratwatte, why do you not allow the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to speak? Please let him speak. This is an august Assembly.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) The Government must take action to find out who has been responsible for this scam. The country has suffered an immense loss. There is no question about it. The country has suffered an immense loss. This money belongs to the poor people of this country and you have

no right to swindle the money in this way. This is wrong. It must be stopped. The truth must be ascertained, Sir, and the persons who are responsible must be charged.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much. The next speaker is, the Hon. Kabir Hashim.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, this Debate pertaining to the Central Bank Bond issue, in a sense, is giving us some relief because, as Parliamentarians, our primary duty is to be watchdogs of financial management of the Government. Unfortunately, under the Westminster System, when both the Executive as well as the normal legislators are all in one House, very vituperative and vicious type of verbal exchanges are unavoidable when debates of this nature take place. But yet, I must very carefully say that it is important for us to be somewhat sane in approaching the critical purpose of a debate of this nature.

I have also been the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and during my tenure, I was able to produce a Report regarding one of the biggest frauds in the Inland Revenue Department, the VAT fraud, which amounted to almost Rs. 4 billion. I am quite satisfied that when I filed that Report, this House took possession of it and then, finally, we were able to prosecute the offenders and some of them are now serving sentences in the prison. Those who have been found guilty by the Committee have already been found guilty of the charges that were brought against them.

Now, we need to also focus on how the procedure takes place and what is the way in which we are going to deal with these issues once a Report is filed by an oversight committee. I must congratulate the Chairman of the COPE, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti. He was very responsible and he did not allow unnecessary political interference to impede the progress of the vigorous and robust investigation that we were able to do in a limited way. But then, most of the issues that deal with this particular matter are still at the level of assumption. So, we need to do more work in order to bring, if at all there are culprits -[Interruption.] Inferences can be drawn. Inferences can be drawn by the conduct. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Conclusion of the Committee is the conclusion. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I have signed that Report. I am not a person who has signed the footnotes. I have signed the main Report, the Chairman is aware of that. But, what I am saying is, as a former Chairman of a Public Accounts Committee through which we have produced a Report and have been able to take the culprits to courts and get them punished ultimately, I was able to succeed in that effort. What I am saying is, the proper procedure is, once this Report is tabled in the House it is a property of the House and it is the Speaker who must take charge. It should not be left to the Executive. My opinion is that the Executive does not get involved in this. I must thank the President for, at least, initiating the setting up of a Presidential Commission, because there is more need to be done in

order to bring the culprits - if at all, they are to be punished. We also must, in the meantime, realize that our Central Bank and its credibility will have to be protected.

In that regard, I must say the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage made a very vicious, vituperate, and very robust attack on some Members of the Government. But having spoken quite tenaciously, he finally ended up somewhat maligning his entire speech by casting some doubts or aspersions on the current Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, who, I must say, is one of our most respected international public servants. As a matter of fact, the financial markets and the business community and its leaders, all heaved a sigh of relief when the President was able to finally reach a compromise with the Hon. Prime Minister in appointing Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy. He had a very long, distinguished career in the Commonwealth Secretariat. Hon. Deputy Speaker, when we go to the Marlborough House in London, we were very proud when representatives from other Commonwealth nations come and tell us about the stature and the value of our international public servants in that system and Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy was one of them. Also, I must say with regard to this issue relating to Mr. Raj Rajaratnam and his Galleon Group that Dr. Inrajit Coomaraswamy did serve in an entity that was created by Mr. Rajaratnam called Galleon Research Services and that was, in no way, involved in any investment or in dealing with any financial markets. It was only an advisory service that he performed for a very short period of time after his retirement from the Commonwealth Secretariat.

Having said that, I must now move on to some of the other issues. We must also say that this Government has been responsible enough to bring in the Right to Information Act, which is to be gazetted now and will come into force from February. That will give further strength to the civil society to hold the Executive to account on many issues. Therefore, it is our duty to highlight these matters. Also, the fact that we have appointed an Opposition Member as the Chairman of this oversight committee is a further proof of this Governments intention to be as open and transparent as possible and we, the Hon. Members from both sides of the House, have been able to collectively look at all these issues, all the facts, examine officials and produce a Report, which has now set the platform for us to move forward and look at this issue. Therefore, we need to finally clear all these things and bring this to a closure.

In that regard, I must also make a few suggestions. This controversy or criticism is surrounding the date of auction - 27th February, 2015. The amount of debt accepted by the Central Bank at that auction was vastly in excess of the amount that had earlier been communicated to the primary dealers. The fact why the other primary dealers were not aware of the debt ceiling or the amount of debt to be auctioned being ten times the amount that was originally intended, is a issue I think, the Presidential Commission needs to look at. Of course, one matter that everybody knows is that a new Government had come into being and that it was necessary for the new

183 184

2017 24

Government to present a revised Budget. It presented a revised Budget for 2015 at the end of January. If the revenue and expenditure streams were accurately estimated in that exercise, the borrowing could have been streamlined to hold the Treasury Bond rates at the lowest possible level. But, unfortunately, with the new Government coming into being and in the haste in which the Budget was presented, the reconciling of both the revenue and expenditure streams had posed some problems for the Treasury. Then, the Ministry of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs at that time issued a statement saying that the Governments immediate needs for cash to make payments for the bills in hand and to complete incomplete projects were to be met through the Treasury Bond issues in March, 2015. If there was a need to raise Rs. 10 billion in one rushed issue, certainly problems will arise. Therefore, the prudent thing would have been for these issues to be spread out at least over the next few weeks or over a month or so, so that this sort of thing would not have happened.

Here, the Central Bank acts as the agent of the General Treasury to raise these monies to meet shortfalls in its expenditure programme. That is why we need to have a very robust system and I am sure, having learnt from this exercise, certain correctional measures have been put in place.

Looking at the allegations regarding Perpetual Treasures Limited -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you are running out of time.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I will wind up very quickly.

There are particular issues that the Presidential Commission needs to look at. It is necessary to investigate the trading activities of all the primary dealers in the days before and after the 27th of February, 2015. Only if the activities of all the bond dealers are examined would it be possible to determine whether any particular company or companies could be considered to have had some privileged information or insider knowledge in order to do what did happen.

Of course, there is a normal pattern how insider trading takes place. The dealers are canny enough to discern some unexpected market activity and would try to cash in on what is going to happen. So, if that is happening, we need to know who were the people who originally wanted to sell and who were willing to buy. Those things need to be probed. So, the dealings of all the primary dealers on or about the 26th and the 27th of February, 2015 need to be looked at in order to finally bring all these grey areas into a proper conclusion so that we would be able to discern from this how, if at all, that fraud has taken place.

With those comments, I would rest my case and hope that the Presidential Commission would be able to shed more light onto this issue.

Thank you.

The COPE report on bond scams: Not two reports as claimed but single one by 25 members

:

It, therefore, testifies to the fact that COPE members have arrived at their decision after engaging themselves in a vibrant debate or discussion. There is nothing wrong in doing so since the truth can be found not by agreeing but by exploring, probing and questioning the accepted view. If decisions are made by any social group without following these steps, it is likely to build a group of 'intellectual slaves .

I repeat, "intellectual slaves."

. that would not augur well for the continued existence of that group. Obviously, COPE is not expected to build such a group of intellectual slaves. Hence, the critical approach by COPE members to issues before them is praiseworthy.

"Regarding your request for comments in the above-mentioned letter, we are not aware of international best practices to accurately calculate the potential loss in the case of the past bond auction. Accurately quantifying the loss would require knowledge of the actual cost of the bond placement under non-competitive allocations (a necessary counterfactual). In our view that counterfactual cannot be accurately calculated on an ex-post basis as it depends on the market conditions on the auction date."

Then, he said, 'Why do you not accept at that level.' Still, we said, 'If we go for that level, we are shifting the prevailing interest rates punching the country by more than about 150 basis points.

At that auction, the weighted average yield to maturity for bids up to Rs. 10 billion stood at 11.73 per cent as compared to 10.46 per cent applicable to bids around the announced amount of Rs. 1 billion. Some analysts interpret that this increase in the yield rate by 127 basis points is a loss to the government due to introduction of competitive auction system. . -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Deputy Minister, you have one more minute.

Regarding your request for comments in the above-mentioned letter, we are not aware of international best

practices to accurately calculate the potential loss in the case of the past bond auction. Accurately quantifying the loss would require knowledge of the actual cost of the bond placement under non-competitive allocations (a necessary counterfactual). In our view that counterfactual cannot be accurately calculated on an ex-post basis as it depends on the market conditions on the auction date.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Finance Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, there has been a very serious breach of Privilege due to what the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake has mentioned in Parliament today. Therefore, I would greatly and sincerely appreciate if you could look into it and report to us by tomorrow.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Tomorrow maybe difficult, but I would certainly look into it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, it is only to check how this has happened. Thereafter, we will take necessary action.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will check on that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The President, the Hon. Prime Minister or myself are not privy to that document. So, we only want to know how he got that.

Thank you.
