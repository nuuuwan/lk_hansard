( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Chairman, I think the Public Servants in this country have enjoyed certain political rights in keeping with certain conditions. If they want to contest an election, they must go on leave. If they are elected to public office, they must give up their Public Service. I think, Sir, it is nothing but fair to retain that entitlement of Public Servants, who desire to participate in a political career to be permitted to do that. -[Interruption.] I think we have to consider that matter because there is no conflict of interest. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Such a person has to go on leave during the election and if the man wins, he will have to give up his public position, his public office. So, I think the Government must consider it. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Leader of the House. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) With all due respect to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I would like to say that all Public Servants

All Public Servants are not shut out. Teachers can contest. - [Interruption.] It is only those who work in fields. People such as Grama Sevakas, Samurdhi Niladharies and Development Officers are shut out.
