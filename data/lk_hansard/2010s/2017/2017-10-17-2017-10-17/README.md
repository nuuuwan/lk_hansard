[4.14 p.m.] ( - ) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - State Minister of Finance) Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are passing Amendments to the Electronic Transactions Act, which, I

1087 1088

2017 17

think, is very progressive. A considerable amount of work has been done by the ICT Agency and the Ministry in bringing this Bill. I think they had consulted international experts in the UNCITRAL in order to make sure that the best practices and international standards have actually been adhered to in bringing these Amendments.

The Electronic Transactions Act, No. 19 of 2006 is amended through this Bill and the Amendment is bringing the Act in line with the UN Electronic Communications Convention - UN ECC. Sri Lanka is the first country in South Asia to come in line with the international Convention, the first country in Asia being Singapore. Actually when it comes to the law, even though Sri Lanka lags behind in certain laws like, for example, the Customs Ordinance, which is 150 years old and has not been amended or a new Customs Law has been introduced, if you take the electronic area, I think we are racing ahead of the other countries and also tying ourselves into the international conventions in terms of electronic transactions.

Now, I want to make three points. The first point I want to make is, from the economys point of view, having such an Act increases the potential to trade. The Amendment will give greater legal certainty for e-commerce and e-business. Generally speaking, when something is electronic, something which does not have human intervention and human discretion, it always provides for reducing things like corruption. But here, it also ensures the legal validity of these instruments in cross-border transfers of money including the enforceability of Foreign Arbitration Awards and even in terms of sale of goods agreements.

It also improves Sri Lankas electronic communication with other countries. Some of the other countries are also drawing up at this time local legislation in line with the United Nations Electronic Communications Convention. The Amendment defines the time and place of dispatch and the receipt of electronic communications, tailoring the traditional rules to suit the electronic context. It allows for enforceability of contracts entered into by Automated Messaging Systems. I think it will really be very positive in terms of increasing Sri Lankas trade. So, the platform has been created to increase trade.

The other main point I would like to make is that the way the Electronic Transactions Act is amended will also help us to improve Government revenue. One main function of the Government is to increase its revenue so that it could provide the basic services that the population expects. Section 8 of the original Electronic Transactions Act has facilitated electronic Government transactions and helped to improve efficiency. For example, you have an e-Visa system at the Department of Immigrating and Emigration; you have an electronic system in the Department of Motor Traffic in terms of licence issuing and you also can make payment of rates of the Colombo Municipal Council online.

So, a whole host of new services can be offered.

The new Amendment will strengthen the existing provisions in Section 8(1) and 8(2) to move the government transactions to the digital era making those more secure in terms of authentication for all government transactions. This will be extended in the future to include electronic tax filings. Now that we have a new Inland Revenue Bill, most agree that the net needs to be cast wider rather than a few people being burdened over and over again in terms of tax payments. So, this will really help us in terms of tax filings. We have got to the day where a normal citizen will be able to go online from home and we will simplify the administration of the tax system further so that they could actually log on to and close their tax systems online. That is where we are really heading.

Also in Sri Lanka, we have a huge problem with e-procurement; procurement is a problem. If we take any Ministry, whether it is at the Local Government, the Provincial Government or at the Central Government, it takes a long time to close out a procurement. Some procurements have taken one year, one-and-a-half years or two years to bring it to a closure. The other countries have really closed this gap and in some places, they can just do it in hours and in some places, in days. Even in South Asia, procurements can be closed in two or three months, but Sri Lanka is far behind. So, e-procurements are going to be possible and more secure. These are all revenue-based transactions. These transactions would definitely improve government.

The original Act gave legal recognition to electronic signatures. There was a misunderstanding that the original Act did not give recognition to electronic signatures. This is really a misunderstanding and the Attorney-General had basically confirmed that it did. The new Amendment Bill, which has been presented today in Parliament, further broadens the scope of the legal validity of electronic signatures because it amends Section 7 of the Principal Enactment with Clause 5. This is based on Article 9(3) of the UN Electronic Communications Convention and broad bases its use on a technology-neutral basis. So, the facility for electronic signatures are now available. You do not have to physically sign a document. Now, it is a part of the law and can you imagine how much more efficient and quicker it makes this?

The new Amendment also authorizes the providers of electronic signatures - Certification Service Providers - to use biometrics for authentication purposes. So, the Attorney-General has confirmed that this is possible and what is the implication? The implication is that you can deal with the Sri Lanka Customs not necessarily with physical forms, but with electronic signatures. Gradually, we will be taking away human interface and interaction on a whole host of things. If you think about Customs duties, nobody really needs to know who imported what; nobody needs to know that. Actually, what we need to know is what is the good that is being imported, under which particular code that good is being imported, which particular duty actually applies to it and if it can be done electronically, the answer is known very, very quickly. So, it provides for a far more efficient government

1089 1090

revenue collection, for far more transparency than now exists in the system and it will also enhance the image and credibility of the Government and government servants. Sir, my final point is this.

M-Pesa . . . ; . . . . In making new initiatives and bringing in new innovators, new entrepreneurs, the cost of failure is very high. Unlike in other countries, which are having lots of new entrepreneurs - the buzzword around the world today is "entrepreneurship and we talk of using technology for entrepreneurship - we are having a problem because the cost of failure is high. ; ; . .

Hon. Sampanthan, you know that we established a Consular Services Division in the District Secretary's Office in Jaffna about a year ago, at which the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, you, Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran and I were present. What we are trying to do with that is, instead of asking the people in Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Vauniya to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Colombo to authenticate a document, for them to do it from where they are. That is the kind of convenience that we are able to create by using electronic transactions. So, now what we are trying to do is to expand it and make sure that it becomes possible for consumers all over the country to authenticate their transactions using electronic signatures. From what I understand from the lawyers of the Agency, it expands

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) () . ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, what I understand from the lawyers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Agency is that it is an expansion of ways in which an electronic transaction can be completed or authenticated. It can be through biometrics, electronic signature or some digital code. It defines or expands the definition of an "electronic signature", from what I understand.

Sir, the fact of the matter is that by amending such laws, it makes it easier and more convenient for people around the world to engage in transactions with Sri Lanka and that includes those people who live in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it makes transactions convenient. So, going from US Dollars 40 million to US Dollars 400 million in electronic commerce will, perhaps, become easier and more attainable with these kinds of Amendments to the law, which are being debated and are to be approved in Parliament today.

Sir, that is what I wanted to speak about. Thank you very much for giving me time.

ADJOURNMENT

( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka) " " .

. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan will now move the Adjournment Motion.

RELEASE OF PERSONS IN CUSTODY UNDER PREVENTION OF

TERRORISM ACT [5.58 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I might commence, Sir, by reading my Adjournment Motion.

The Motion pertains substantially to persons held in custody from the North and the East under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

The facts are as follows :-

(i) These persons are held in custody under Prevention of Terrorism Law irrespective of whether they have been convicted, have been charged or have not yet been charged. They have been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Law and all action taken against them has been in terms of that Law.

1121 1122

(ii) It has been accepted by the Sri Lankan State both domestically and internationally that the said Prevention of Terrorism Law is draconian, obnoxious and should therefore be regarded as obsolete. The Sri Lankan State has made several commitments both domestically and internationally that the said Law will be repealed and that a new Law will be enacted in keeping with acceptable domestic and international norms.

(iii) The Sri Lankan State is yet to fulfil this commitment, but that does not derogate from the Sri Lankan States commitment that the said Law should not remain on the Statute Book.

(iv) The only evidence available against most of these persons are confessions extracted from them against their will under the Prevention of Terrorism Law which would be inadmissible against them in a normal Court of Law. Many of the cases have been postponed because the prosecution is not ready to proceed with the cases.

(v) Almost all of them have been in custody for very long periods of time, for as long as, they would have been sentenced, if sentence was passed on them shortly after being taken into custody.

(vi) The families of these persons in custody have suffered for very long periods of time, without the support of their breadwinners. This vitally important factor has not been given due consideration.

(vii) Quite apart from the pernicious nature of the Prevention of Terrorism Law, persons in similar situations such as persons taken into custody during the insurrections of the JVP have been granted an amnesty and released. It is not understood why the same principle cannot be applied in regard to these prisoners.

(viii) These cases cannot be considered as coming purely under the purview of the Attorney-Generals Department. With due respect to the Attorney General as the Chief Legal Advisor of the State, these cases have a certain political dimension and cannot be addressed on a purely legal basis. It can be justifiably stated that if Sri Lankas national question had been reasonably addressed in time, many of the persons in custody would not have been in their present position and would have been useful citizens. This circumstance makes it obligatory that you address this issue politically too.

The issue not being addressed politically is a strong impediment to reconciliation and the restoration of goodwill and harmony.

(ix) An unnecessary complication has been created by the transfer of some cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura. If witnesses needed protection, such protection could have been provided without the cases being transferred.

The accused in the cases to be transferred from Vavuniya where the language of the Courts is Tamil to Anuradhapura where the language of the Courts is Sinhala are from the North-East and are Tamil speaking and not proficient in Sinhala, the other language of administration and Courts. Their cases being transferred to Anuradhapura where the language of the Courts is Sinhala is a denial of their constitutional right to have their cases heard in Tamil, a language which they can understand. In a criminal prosecution, the rights of an accused person are fundamental. He has a right to fully comprehend the evidence and the case presented against him.

By such transfer the accused is also denied the opportunity and the right to legal assistance of his choice. These and other factors could prejudice a fair trial. The proposed transfer reflects a measure of insensitivity to the fundamental rights of an accused person. The prisoners have been continuously carrying on a fast against such transfer. This situation needs to be addressed on an urgent basis.

I have to also very strongly urge that for the reasons stated above all these prisoners be released without any further delay.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I might say a few words in regard to this Motion, the main points of the Adjournment Motion are that all these persons whether convicted, prosecuted or not prosecuted have been dealt with under the Prevention of Terrorism Law.

They have been arrested, investigated, charged, and trial proceedings conducted and convicted under the Prevention of Terrorism Law, which the Government itself admits must be repealed because its provisions are such to raise the question whether such provisions can ensure justice. The Law is to be repealed for the reason that the implementation of various obnoxious provisions in the law can only result in injustice and not justice. It is the primary reason for the Government wanting to repeal the Law. This is the reason for my submission that all these persons must be released, whatever the stage of the cases against them may be.

I will read, Sir, the commitment made by the Government at the United Nations Human Rights Council in the Resolution adopted on the 1st of October, 2015. The Resolution states that the United Nations Human Rights Council welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to review the Public Security Ordinance Act and to review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and to replace it with an anti-terrorism legislation in accordance with contemporary international best practices. That is the commitment made by the Sri Lankan Government at the United Nations Human Rights Council in regard to the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Law.

These persons, Sir, have been in custody for long periods of times; 10, 15, 20 years which would mean that they have already been in custody for periods equivalent to that for which they could have been sentenced if they were sentenced shortly after they were taken into custody. It would be unjust to continue to keep these persons in custody. It cannot be disputed that these persons had engaged in certain activities for political reasons or purposes. These cases have a political dimension. It was the failure to evolve an acceptable resolution to the national question that resulted in these persons engaging in certain activities that constitute the offences that they are being charged with. It has a political dimension. It is not a purely a legal issue. If it has a political dimension, different considerations must apply, particularly in the present context when reconciliation has become the key issue facing the country. It is imperative that this issue must also be addressed politically and not looked at as a purely legal issue. This issue not being addressed expeditiously is a serious impediment to reconciliation, where the accused persons and those sharing a commonality with them feel that they have been treated differently.

During the JVP insurrections in the 1970s and in 1980s, persons accused of grave offences were granted an amnesty and freed. The gravity of the offences committed was about the same. There was a political dimension. That was why they were granted an amnesty. The accused persons want to know why they are being treated differently. This different treatment constitutes a serious

1123 1124

[ ]

2017 17

impediment to reconciliation. The families of these persons in custody have been without the assistance of their breadwinners for long periods of time. They have undergone immense sufferings and that too is a serious impediment to reconciliation.

An unnecessary complication has been added to the issue by three cases being transferred from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura. These cases have apparently been transferred to ensure the safety of witnesses. It is strongly submitted that the safety of witnesses could have been ensured without the cases being transferred. Consequently, the prisoners concerned are carrying out a fast and the condition of their health has become a matter of concern.

These are Tamil prisoners from the North-East who have a knowledge of Tamil only and do not have a knowledge of Sinhala. The language of the Courts in Vavuniya is Tamil while the language of the Courts in Anuradhapura is Sinhala. As per the Constitution that is the position. The accused persons being Tamils without a knowledge of Sinhala are constitutionally entitled to have their cases heard in Tamil in a Court where the language is Tamil and their cases being transferred to Anuradhapura where the language of the Court is Sinhala is a violation of their constitutional right. As accused persons, they should not be denied the right to fully comprehend the entirety of the case presented against them. Transfer of the cases to Anuradhapura where the language of the Court is Sinhala denies them that right. By such transfer they are also denied of legal counsel of their choice. These factors are tantamount to a denial of justice.

The prisoners concerned also ask that the decision to transfer their cases to Anuradhapura from Vavuniya be rescinded and I do urge that all persons taken into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Law be released.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I conclude, I would like to say a few things. There is a strong feeling amongst the Tamil people that these prisoners were in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Law and they are in custody because they have committed certain offences related to the non-resolution of the national question; all these persons are being charged for various offences committed because there was a conflict in this country between the citizens who constitute the people of this country; they are not persons who are alleged to have committed offences for personal benefit; there was a political dimension to it and when there was similarly an instance earlier on, in the 1970s and 1980s, when there was the JVP insurrection which also had a political dimension more economic than social or political, all of them were granted amnesty and they were freed.

I observe that the Hon. Minister of Law and Order is here. I believe he is the one who is going to answer this Question. We do not want to confront the Government, but we certainly want to impress upon the Government that time has come for you to seriously address this question. It is not sufficient to say, "there are no political prisoners". This issue has a political dimension. All these

persons are in custody, all these persons have been charged and all these persons continue to be in custody because they have committed certain offences consequent to there being a conflict in this country in regard to the nature of governance; in regard to the structure of governance.

That is why they are in custody. So, you cannot deny that these persons are in custody in relation to offences which have a political dimension and that makes it obligatory for you to not to look at this as a purly legal issue. It is not merely an issue for the Attorney-General's Department. It is an issue for the Government to handle politically, to address politically and that is what these prisoners quite rightly say. Even in the 1970s and the 1980s when there were JVP insurrections and very serious crimes were committed, serious offenses were committed, because there was a political dimension to them. They were given an amnesty and they were all freed. So, I do not think, Sir, that the Government should any longer look at this question in a manner that does not befit the seriousness of this question.

I think the time has come for the Government to address this question seriously because the Tamil prisoners and the Tamil people feel that the Government is not addressing this issue seriously enough to come to the right conclusion. So, I would appeal to the Government on behalf of these prisoners to address this issue seriously. I met some of the prisoners and I met their families. The families are suffering. Those prisoners have been in custody for 10, 15 or 20 years. If they were sentenced shortly after they were taken into custody, they would have finished their sentence and come out by now- but they were not able to do that.

In regard to the prisoners transferred from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura, you are denying them their constitutional right to have their case heard in Tamil, which is the provision that is provided for in the Constitution. They have a right to have their cases heard in Tamil. Their cases being transferred to Anuradhpura is not fair; it is unjust and unacceptable. Therefore, I think that all of this should be resent to Vavuniya.

So, I would earnestly appeal to the Government - I make this appeal especially before the Hon. Minister answers - to give this question very serious thought and kindly address this issue in a manner different from the manner it was addressed hitherto. Thank you, Sir.

[6.18 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition very quickly so that the Hon. Ministers concerned will have enough time to respond.

This issue was addressed by us as soon as there was a change of Government; as soon as there was a change in

1125 1126

Presidency in January, 2015. There were meetings conducted in the Parliament precincts by the Hon. Prime Minister. There were several meetings that we had with His Excellency the President, the then Minister of Justice, the Attorney-General and several officials, consequent to which a certain number of detainees under the PTA were not released, but there was a way found for them to be released from incarceration and that is, for them to plead guilty and lenient sentences were given followed by a period of rehabilitation. But, such number is only about 70 to 80, I believe. A greater number of them are still in custody and their cases are still being dragged. There was a special court set up in Colombo and a special judge was appointed as a Commissioner of High Court and still, the cases before that court are not concluded. Now, the Government might say that there are various reasons for that; they might say that the defence counsel is obtaining dates.

But, the more important question, the political question, that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has moved in this Motion has not been addressed: why are Tamil prisoners who are said to have indulged in crimes motivated by political objectives still being pursued under the law when such Sinhala prisoners, in the early 70s and the late 80s, were released? Once those agitations came to an end in those days, no legal proceedings were pursued against them. That is the important political question that the Tamil people are asking today. It begs the question, Is it because these are Tamil prisoners that you are still pursuing and you are being legalistic, even insisting upon the Attorney-Generals right to transfer the cases from one court to another, from one judicial zone to another? What is significant is the fact that in the first judicial zone, the proceedings are in Tamil and their attorneys, who by the choice of those prisoners, can represent them, but in the other zone, they do not understand the language in which the proceedings are conducted and they cannot retain lawyers of their choice. So, their legal rights are seriously being affected.

Recently, I raised this issue with His Excellency the President in the presence of the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Hon. Deputy Minister of Justice, who is here today. At that meeting, a senior official of the Attorney-Generals Department stated an emblematic issue. He told the President that a particular lady who was accused of the attempted assassination of the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga spent seventeen-and-a-half years in jail before being released for lack of evidence. There was no evidence against her at all. Yet for all, the case went on for seventeen-and-a-half long years, at the end of which she was released. That is emblematic of the problem that one faces under the Prevention of Terrorism Act because there is no bail available. The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha has said this time and again, as a lawyer he knows. In the late 80s, he has appeared for many accused under the PTA. The only piece of evidence there is, is the supposed confession of the accused; there is no other evidence. The police do not conduct investigations and all of us know how those confessions are extracted from these suspects.

So, two-and-a-half years or almost three years after the change of regime, we are still discussing this and naturally, our people have begun to question the bona fides of the Government in respect of this matter.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran and Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan also requested for time to speak. But, we have only five minutes left before the Hon. Minister starts. So, if any one of those two Hon. Members want to speak, I can give only five minutes to present the TNA's point of view. - [Pause.] Since no one is willing to speak, will the Hon. Ministers speak?

( - ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka - Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development) Sir, I will speak first. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Will you be taking the whole time left, Hon. Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Then, you have almost 25 minutes. [6.24p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am going to take this up twofold. One will be about the detainees and what part of it I can cover, I will cover. Then, I will move on to the new legislation that we are trying to work out to replace the PTA. I will just give some details on the process of what has happened.

First, let me take the issue of detainees. On the 08th of January, 2015, there were 108 suspects in custody under the PTA and the Hon. Sumanthiran referred to this. I am trying not to confuse this. Of those 108, 40 have been granted bail; 11 are in remand; 27 have been released; 25 - on the basis that you said - have been sent to rehabilitation; four have been passed on guilty verdicts in their court hearings and one had actually died of a heart attack while he was in prison custody.

So, that constitutes those 108. But some progress did take place. The issue arises with the AG having instituted legal action and there being proceedings in the high court. They were sent to rehabilitation, and wherever possible they were released. But the other cases are fairly serious. In some of these cases, Hon. Deputy Speaker, we find that the defence lawyers are not doing their bit as well. In fact, there was one occasion when the Solicitor General, Mr. Suhada Gamlath, called up all the defence lawyers and said, Do your bit also to work through these cases. So, I know we have been discussing, but let us have another chat about it outside some time, and see how we can speed up these high court cases.

There are 74 of them remaining at the moment. The breakdown of those by the year of arrest is: 2 in 1997; 2 in 2005;7 in 2006, 2 in 2007, 14 in 2008, 23 in 2009, 05 in 2010, 7 in 2011, 4 in 2012, 03 in 2014, 4 in 2015 and 1 in 2016.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In 1997, if there were only two - ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) I agree. I take your point. But, it is in the court process. Of them, 7 are Sinhalese, 63 are Tamils and 4 are Muslims. So, terrorism is not only targeting the Tamils. There are 18 cases that are pending action by the Attorney-General. So, we are working with the AG to institute action as fast as possible. Now, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition also spoke of moving some of these cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura and its effects. Actually, I believe, this was done in very good faith. It may not be working out, but the reason was to have two special courts, one in Colombo and the other in Anuradhapura, to hear through only the PTA cases and expedite them. If there is a problem with that, let us discuss it. We will wait for the Justice Minister to return and discuss it with her as well as the Minister of Prison Reforms. Let us work out the way forward on these cases so that we get the 74 cases heard quickly.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Minister, the point that I have made, and I have repeatedly made, is that you yourself admit that the Prevention of Terrorism Law is an obnoxious law and it must be repealed. That is a commitment you made to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Now, all these persons have been arrested under that law; they have been investigated under that law; confessions have been extracted under that law; they have been charged under that law; proceedings have been conducted in court under that law and they have been convicted under that law. This is the law which you admit as obnoxious, draconian and must be repealed. How on earth can persons be continued to be held in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Law? The whole thing must be wiped out.

You say the law is bad, not a law that ensures justice being done, on the contrary, is a law that ensures that injustice is done by the accused persons; then you must release those persons. And, the question we raise further is, you will not dispute the fact that in every one of these cases, the accused person is being charged with an offence that he has committed for political reasons - not for personal benefit - largely because the national issue had not been addressed and resolved in an acceptable way.

If there is a political dimension, it must be looked at politically. In the 1970s, in the 1980s, during the JVP insurrection, prisoners were released because there was a political dimension. Why do you not look at it in that way? Giving us numbers in regard to persons in custody is not helpful. You must look at it from the point of view of, one, the Prevention of Terrorism Law being repealed and consequently all steps taken under that law must be regarded as invalid; two, political dimension must be addressed. It is a political issue.

We are becoming unpopular amongst our people because our people feel that we are not standing up for them, that we are not impressing upon the Government that the Government must act in this matter. Therefore, we want a decision in regard to this matter at the earliest. In the course of the next one week or ten days, there must be a decision made on the basis that there is a political dimension and the Prevention of Terrorism Law is bad, everything done under that law is bad.

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) You must listen to me, Sir. I have tremendous respect for you. I told you at the beginning my answer is going to be two-fold. One is about the detainees; two is what we are going to do with the new law. But, if you go through the 74 cases, I do not think you or I can take a decision on these cases because all these have to do with assassination attempts; people have died at the end. - [Interruption.] I table* the list of these 74 cases.

These are not cases that you or I can decide on. But we are trying to work through this. The PTA was brought in at a time that the LTTE crisis was at a height. Now, times have changed. Terrorism has changed; the threats on Sri Lanka have moved with times and we are looking at the current day threats. In that context, we started looking at a new law. The Hon. Prime Minster appointed a Committee. I chaired most of those meetings. We started drafting what is called "Counter Terrorism Bill". Along with that, we want to follow it up with a further Bill called "Organized Crime Prevention Bill" and that will handle matters that are outside of terrorism, that are related to organized crimes, and maybe, a further Bill will come in to handle drugs and narcotics.

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

As far as the Counter Terrorism Bill is concerned, we did a draft concept paper, went to Cabinet and Cabinet approved it to coming to the Sectoral Oversight Committee. The Sectoral Oversight Committee gave its views, then it came back to the Committee. The Committee met with various resource personnel, international organizations, the UN, the Counter Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the EU and various people gave their comments. We had local discussions, and we reworked the framework, went back to the Cabinet and the Cabinet approved it to go in for drafting to the Legal Draftsman. The Legal Draftsman has started work on it.

But, however, the draft CTA concept paper still requires a little more work. I have been waiting to talk to a few more stakeholders on it. Some of them were overseas. We were waiting for them to come back. Some areas require a simpler clearer language. There are some sections that will not meet everyones liking. Some will say the safeguards are excessive and some will say they are inadequate. There will always be two sides to a story. But I want to assure this House that the Government is striving to produce a Bill that will safeguard national security taking into account the current threats of terrorism and current international standards. We will work this out, go back to the Cabinet and with the Cabinet approval complete the drafting process with the Legal Draftsman. We hope to bring this to this House as a Bill by early next year at which time we can discuss it in the House as well, and it will be open to debate and then amendments can be moved during the discussion.

But, let me assure you that we are doing this not because of any international pressure or anything. We have to do it for the people of this country, whichever corner of the country they may come from and to safeguard them from terrorism. The threat of terrorism at the moment is not the threat of terrorism we had 10, 20 or 30 years ago.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Sir, may I finish, please? -[Interruption.] I cannot give you time because I want to finish my speech after which you may speak. So, on that basis, a new Counter Terrorism Bill will be worked out and presented in this House.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Why can you not at least repeal that order and let the cases be heard in Vavuniya?

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) I am sure, the Deputy Minister of Justice will reply to the Hon. Sampanthans concern about transferring some of the cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura. Honestly, this was done in good faith. It was done in order that these proceedings could be heard continuously so that these 74 cases are finished quickly. It is not only in Vavuniya, there is another court in Colombo. But, if there are any issues with that, I am sure, we can discuss them. The Deputy Minister of Justice is here and he will answer. But, to be honest, we are working on this and we want you also to work through this with us. We understand your problems and we have tremendous respect for your concerns and for you, Sir. But, we have to work through this. There are all sides to this problem which have to be ironed out.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , , .

.. ( .. - ) (The Hon. H.R. Sarathie Dushmantha - Deputy Minister of Justice and Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana) It is actually about the protection of the witnesses. But we can work on it. So, on the request to the Attorney-General -

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Witnesses have to be given protection. Why can you not -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Sarathie Dushmantha) Certainly, we have to go with the practical issues also and we will work on it. On the request to the Attorney-General, this decision had been made. So, we can actually discuss this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Why do you not sit together with the AG and the Minister of Justice and work it out? -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) What the Hon. Sampanthan is saying is that when the cases are heard in the Sinhala language, since that it not a dedicated court for this particular matter, obviously there will be a language problem. So, Hon. Minister, you can discuss this matter again.

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) I think his point is well taken. But, I still believe that we did it in good faith. Let us sort it out by having a discussion on Thursday.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) With regard to all the issues that have arisen, we will meet immediately and discuss.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) We will have to meet and come to a finality. ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) We will meet on Thursday. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) So, if the Hon. Minister is not available, the Hon. Deputy Minister and his officials can facilitate a meeting, because this is a matter that comes under the Ministry of Justice more than the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) So, we will invite them to a meeting in Parliament on Thursday. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Swaminathan, do you want to add something to this? We have a few more minutes to adjourn.

[6.36p.m.] .. , , ) ( .. - , ,

) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity of speaking.

I think, the Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development has made it very clear. I have also in my personal manner, although it does not come within

my ambit as a Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, discussed this matter many times with the Attorney-Generals Department. As the Hon. Minister has very clearly said, there are 74 indictments that are pending and today those indictments are being heard most expeditiously as far as the courts are concerned. I was even assured that the postponements are not more than two weeks from the date of hearing. As far as the transfer of these cases, in fact, I took this up also with the Attorney-General unofficially and he is under the impression that if there is any matter as far as language is concerned, they are willing to give proper translators to help the witnesses. -[Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is about law and order. The Deputy Minister of Justice says that we can discuss it.-[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) So, I have no objection. -[Interruption.] Excuse me. Did I say that you cannot discuss the matter? I have never said that. Do not barge into this. I only said what the Attorney-Generals Department mentioned to me. -[Interruption.] Let me speak. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) These are Tamil persons who do not know Sinhala. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) As far as the political prisoners are concerned there is one issue which I would like to mention. I am in charge of the prisons and I keep checking everyday with the doctors and they say they have been treated. When the prisoners are weak, they are being taken to the hospitals. They are given saline. Presently, even after 21 days of hunger strike they are in good health. They are under total care with the prison officers and they have also been kept in such a way that there is no threat to their health or any issues as far as their lives are concerned. So, these are the few things that I have to mention. As far as my Ministry is concerned, we have taken the steps.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Things are not happening the way it should happen. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am sorry, that is not within my purview. But I can respectfully speak on behalf of the prisons. [Interruption.

Thank you, Sir.
