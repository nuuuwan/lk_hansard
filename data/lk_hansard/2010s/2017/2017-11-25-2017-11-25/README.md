ACTION TAKEN TO REFUSE STATEMENT MADE

BY UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AGAINST SRI LANKA: STATEMENT BY

MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT ASSIGNMENTS

AND MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana -Minister of Development Assignments and Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to answer the Question raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena on the 20th of September, 2017, pertaining to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Chief Officer within the United Nations who has been tasked by the Member States to advocate for Human rights.

The High Commissioner has made some opening remarks - I think that is the subject matter of the Question raised by the Hon. Member - presenting updates on human rights situations in 40 countries in the world. It is not only in regard to Sri Lanka but in regard to 40 countries of the world that he made this announcement. This included the United States of America, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Philippines, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Maldives, DPRK, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, Bahrain, Iran, Venezuela, Brazil, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Turkey, Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Greece, Libya, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Burundi, Mali, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Republic of the Congo.

So, it is not that he has isolated Sri Lanka in this Report. This is a Report that he has submitted and made certain remarks pertaining to the human rights situation right round the world in most of the countries. As the Hon. Member correctly said, there are no human rights issues related to Sri Lanka to be settled in an international arena anymore. Because, we have satisfied the international community that we are quite capable of handling our human rights situation by ourselves and therefore, it is now localized. The High Commissioners Office has been mandated to report to the High Commission of Sri Lanka and this is all that he was doing when he issued this statement.

As a Government that is responsible to all her citizens, we pursue a policy of engaging with all countries and international organizations for the benefit of the people of this country. This policy of engagement has contributed to Sri Lanka enhancing its profile in the international arena. It has also assisted Sri Lanka to regain economic benefits. Human rights is work in progress and it is in the interest of all that we should strive to improve the situation of human rights in our own country.

Achieving reconciliation to ensure durable peace and non-recurrence, promotion and protection of human rights, ending impunity and upholding the rule of law, strengthening good governance and democracy and equitable and inclusive development were the platforms on which this National Unity Government which was elected by our people.

Based on this mandate, in September 2015, at the 30th Session of the Human Rights Council, Sri Lanka made proposals based on addressing truth-seeking, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence and co-sponsored the Resolution 30/1 titled, Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka and worked with members of the Council and others to facilitate its adoption by consensus.

Sri Lanka also co-sponsored the Resolution 34/1 titled, Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. That was adopted by the UN Human Rights Council on 23rd March, 2017 by consensus, which provided a two-year extension of the timeline for the implementation of the Resolution 30/1 of 2015.

Sir, I must say that the understanding and support received by Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council when the Resolution 34/1 was adopted by consensus is a reflection of the trust and confidence placed in Sri Lanka by the UN and the international community and there are national mechanisms being formulated by Sri Lanka for the promotion of reconciliation, justice and human rights with a view to achieving enduring peace and prosperity for all Sri Lankans.

Considerable progress has been made in the country over the last two and a half years in meeting its commitments to the people in the area of reconciliation. In particular, the implementing legislation related to the Office on Missing Persons, bringing back normalcy to the lives of the people and acceding to the international conventions have been acknowledged by several countries.

We are committed to achieving the goals that we have set for ourselves for the benefit of our own citizens, for all our citizens. It requires patience, perseverance and commitment, and we will continue to forge ahead.

We take the comments of the High Commissioner as a reminder that we should continue our journey to build a peaceful and prosperous country that adheres to the rule of law and respects international norms on our own

1557 1558

accord. In this spirit, we will continue to engage with the UN Human Rights Council and the international community.

Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, are you on a clarification? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have just one question. The Adjournment Motion which I moved last week was partly answered by the State Minister as you were not in the House and he conceded- it was in relation to Lord Nasebys statement in the House of Lords in UK where he had unearthed enough material to rectify where the UN Human Rights Commission has erred. Now, the question is this. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made one statement and our representative to Geneva, the Hon (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, has made a different statement. So, these issues should be corrected and the national policy should clearly be stated by the Government in office.

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Hon. Member, I beg to differ with you. I do not think that the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva has made a different statement. We are mindful of Lord Nasebys statement and we are very thankful to him. Indeed, we appreciate it very much that he has done a lot of research in producing that. It was not just a statement that he has fired off-the-cuff but he has done a lot of work to make that statement, and he has substantiated that statement with a lot of data, which I think most of us may not have been privy to either. But, that forum in Geneva last week was not the forum where this should have been taken up. I believe that there would be a more appropriate stage at which we could use this statement. Rather than praising the statement and creating an opportunity for the people interested to tackle that statement in a different way and contradict it, I think, we should keep it as an ace to use it at the appropriate stage, because that clearly discounts the Darusman Report and all other reports that speak of 40,000 civilians that have been killed, which I never believe, in the first place. I do not think any reasonable person in Sri Lanka would even believe that we are capable of just slaughtering innocent people in that manner.

So, we are very thankful to Lord Naseby for his statement and we have acknowledged his contribution and

his friendship towards Sri Lanka. I am also thankful to you for agreeing with those sentiments and also praising Lord Naseby for his forthright statement. We will certainly be using that statement at the appropriate stage.

Thank you.

Deputy Speaker, he is speaking as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the country. With your permission, I want to raise this because this is a very grave issue. That figure has been unearthed and established by Lord Naseby. If the Sri Lankan Government is not going to make use of that statement to canvass in Geneva, we are failing in our duty to defend our country and our valiant soldiers who fought the war and defended the country.

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Hon. Member, I am not saying that we are not going to use it.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) His Excellency the President also sent a letter to Lord Naseby-

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) I am not for a moment saying that we are not going to use it. We will certainly use it and we will use it to the maximum. But, this is not the opportune moment to use it.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) And, as you said, it is not the correct forum to use it. ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) The Universal Periodic Review does not relate to that matter; it is not for that purpose. At the appropriate stage and at the correct time, we will use that statement to the maximum. Do not worry about it.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) And at the right forum.

"We were surprised to see how President Obama and all other leaders went to the President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, surrounded him and had a long chat also. Normally, small nations like Sri Lanka goes behind the powerful leaders of developed countries." I asked, What is the reason for that? They said, The previous governments policies had created problems. Your country was almost on the verge of blockades and sanctions were to come up. But, your President is following a middle path policy and the way the two leading parties - the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party - are working together is a model for other countries." They were surprised to see that and stated that they would take that as a model to other countries. They also said, The Government and the Opposition parties are working together to develop the common interests of the country. That is the reason why we also back and support you.

Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to our Hon. Leader of the Opposition, one of the most senior politicians in this country, the TNA has only 16 Members in this Parliament. The JVP, a Member of which holds the post of Chief Opposition Whip, has only six Members and we, the Joint Opposition, has 54 Members in this Parliament. If you talk about democratic values and respecting

democracy, then you should respect the fact that the Joint Opposition has 54 Members seated in the Opposition. But yet, we are not being recognized as the "Opposition" in this Parliament, with all due respect to Hon. Sampanthan.

. . ? , . Sir, the litmus test of democracy is holding regular elections at regular intervals. That is what you call democracy. For the last two-and-a-half years, the provincial council elections and the local government elections have been postponed. The litmus test of democracy is having periodical elections at regular intervals. That is democracy. For the last two-and-a-half years, the provincial council elections have been postponed. Not only that, you introduced amendments to Parliament by violating the Standing Orders to postpone elections. We have brought that matter to the notice of the Hon. Speaker and have spoken about that many times in Parliament. Even the Hon. Prime Minister, at one time, was suggesting to the Government to amend the Standing Orders, but nothing has happened yet. Then, His Excellency the President goes to New York and in front of all the world leaders, states that democracy has been reinstated in this country. But for the last two-and-a-half years, there has been no election. Unfortunately, even today, there is no clarity as to when the elections will be held.

. , more than 12 Parliamentarians have been remanded. Mr. Chairman, you know that. More than 1,000 government servants have been questioned by the FCID. We still believe that the FCID has not been established properly; it is not an institution like the CID or other departments of investigation which have been lawfully or legally established by this House or by the law. But yet, you still find more than 1,000 government servants, civilians and Members of Parliament going there on a daily basis for questioning.

Sir, we have a question: does the presumption of innocence unless you are proven guilty, which is entrusted by our Constitution, apply only to the Members of the Government? Recently, we saw a number of Government Members talking to the media about the bond scam and clearly bringing up the point that the presumption of innocence has to be protected unless you are proven guilty. But, when it comes to the Members of the Joint Opposition or the government servants who had been working under the previous Government, that presumption of innocence unless you are proven guilty does not apply.

. Twitter , , that human rights is not a national policy.

I must say that I agree with it up to a certain extent, but I also disagree with his statement because human rights may not be a national policy for your Government, but all that are included in your foreign policy and in your national policy. I must bring to your attention what the British Prime Minister Theresa May said. She said that human rights laws will be changed if they "get in the way" of the countrys fight against terrorism. I was expecting our President to make this statement at the UN. We are a country which fought against terrorism for thirty years and defeated it. Ours is the only country in the world which defeated terrorism. Not only that, we must appreciate Lord Naseby's statement about the casualties during wartime. We are also disturbed about the fact that our Government has failed to appreciate the work that Lord Naseby has put in, going to the extent of applying under the Freedom of Information Act of Great Britain and proving that the UN has given a wrong impression and wrong numbers about the last phase of the war in Sri Lanka and about the casualties.

Yesterday, shortly after the Friday prayers, a terrorist group attacked a Mosque in Bir al-Abed in the North Sinai Province of Egypt killing 235 people. The numbers are increasing. The Mosque belonged to the Sufi sect of Islam, which is bitterly opposed by Salafist groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS. The attack may have been designed to create divisions between the people of Egypt, a country which has stood steadfast behind Sri Lanka since the time of Gamal Abdel Nasser and the beginning of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Joint Opposition condemns this ugly and brutal attack and we call upon the Government also to take steps in order to condemn this and sympathize with the people of Egypt and follow up against terrorism at every platform in the world.

Sir, let me now go to another issue. This is the issue which I raised in the House on 14th November, 2017. The Deputy Minister, Hon. Vasantha Senanayake answered it. It is in relation to what Lord Naseby had raised in the House of Lords in UK.

I do not want to take time to read through, but I would like to quote from column 860 of November 14, 2017 Hansard. It states:

This House resolves that, since Lord Naseby, addressing Britains House of Lords, drew attention to the fact that the casualty figures for the last period of the civil conflict in Sri Lanka, which ended in May 2009, cited in the United Nations Darusman Report, were brought into question by the figures quoted by former UN spokesman Gordon Weiss, by former US Ambassador Blake, in the report by the UKs Major General Holmes, and finally, by the heavily-redacted communications from the UKs Lieutenant Colonel Anton Gash released to him ...."

- that is to Lord Naseby. -

".... by the British Government; and since he further stated that the UK must recognize that this was a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights and that the West, and in particular the US and UK, must remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans, especially their leaders, the Government of Sri Lanka should take action to pursue this matter with Britains Foreign and Commonwealth Office and with the UN Human Rights Commission to change their unjust positions in regard to Sri Lanka and thereby remove the threat to this country, to its defence forces, and to its leaders, and that the Government should also report back to Parliament on this matter.

This was the Motion that we moved. This is a very serious matter which the Government at the moment is ignoring.

There was meeting in Geneva, of course, similar but on a different issue last week. Our representative to Geneva did not make any reference to this matter. The entire process against Sri Lanka moved by the UN Human Rights Commission has been based on the accusation that 40,000 Tamil people have been killed by the Armed forces. Now, today, Lord Naseby has proved with British authoritarian documents that this is wrong, that this figure is false.

Now where do we stand, Mr. Presiding Member? When the Resolution was moved against Sri Lanka on that figure, they convinced us that the Resolution should be accepted and our Minister of Foreign Affairs gave in without challenging it. We had the Paranagama Commission Report. But the Government did not produce the Paranagama Commission Report. They accepted these figures and moved against Sri Lanka. Today, Sri Lanka is faced with this embarrassing position from which we have to find a way out.

Lord Naseby, a friend of Sri Lanka and a Member of the House of Lords, who we have met here and in the British Parliament has unearthed evidence for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. What has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs done? They have kept silent. Did they unearth one of these documents? No. Did they use any official or unofficial methods or agencies to unearth such

1669 1670

2017 2

evidence? No. This is why we say that it is a failure on the part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to defend our country. Firstly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should defend our country.

Secondly, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs would agree with me, though he might differ the approach that this has to be rejected in Geneva, the best evidence today is what has been produced by Lord Naseby in the House of Lords. What did the Ministry of Foreign Affairs state immediately in reaction when this matter came up? I quoted what the Hon. Vasantha Senanayake, State Minister of Foreign Affairs stated on that day. We agreed on that day. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement which was not credible enough to take the matter forward. The Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote a letter to Lord Naseby. We appreciate it. The Joint Opposition also wrote a letter to Lord Naseby. I have the letter which His Excellency the President wrote to Lord Naseby. I do not know whether it ever reached Lord Naseby or whether it is still in some file of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because there is no document to prove that they have sent it to Lord Naseby. So, this is the way Sri Lankas Ministry of Foreign Affairs - I am sorry to say this- is handling this grave issue that stands against Sri Lanka today. We want the Minister of Foreign Affairs to take this matter up with the Human Rights Council and refute the figure of 40,000, so that the blame on Sri Lanka will be reduced and erased.

Thirdly, Lord Nasby says, this has been a war against terrorism and not against the Tamil people. Among the civilians, there were LTTE cadres in civvies. These are evidences that have been unearthed by the British intelligence service. So, what more is there to defend our country, Hon. Foreign Minister? This is an important issue and I hope the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Government will take up this matter.

Now I would like to move on to another matter. During the last few days in Geneva, what is the stand that the Sri Lankan Government has taken in relation to Universal Periodic Review Recommendation 116.90? What is the stand that you have taken in relation to Recommendation 116.91? We would like to question. This has been raised in an article appearing in todays The Island written by Sanja De Silva Jayathilake.

Then the UPR Recommendation 116.70 states, Guarantee completion of on-going investigation.... That is one of the Recommendations that has been moved. Then the UPR Recommendation 116.73 states, Hold security forces and government officials accountable ....

What is the stand Sri Lanka has taken? We would like to know about it from the Hon. Minister, in his reply. Then the UPR Recommendation 116.76 -

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Hon. Member, can I -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Let me present this. I would ask you to reply in your speech, because I have very limited time. We are discussing the Votes on the Ministry of Transport, not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is very sad. This is what has happened to this Parliament. The Hon. Minister is helpless and I am helpless too. I have very little time. Hon. Marapana, you have more time. So, I hope you will spare these few minutes to me.

Then we have UPR Recommendation 117.43 and 117.44.

So, we are in a very serious situation where the international community is trying to corner Sri Lanka on grounds which is totally disproved today. The 40,000 figure is disproved today. What is the Government going to do? This is the most important issue where there could be an understanding between the Government and the Opposition, if there is a possibility. That is how we should tackle this national issue and reject the UN Human Rights Councils false allegations that have been contained in the Report as well as in the address made by the UN Secretary General. This is what the Sri Lankan Government must do. If we go on accepting it even when we have got the evidence, it is a failure of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have officials but, what is the use if they are not ready or if they are not advised to defend the country?

[4.53p.m.] ( ) ( - ) The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Chair, the Government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe took many extroverted strides to end the self-imposed isolation from the rest of the world that Sri Lanka had persistently embarked upon in the previous years. The Good Governance Government sought to re-establish links with traditional allies and to forge new links and new alliances with more recent friends in the international arena.

In this regard, it was most logical to commence at the closest point, which of course is between Danushkodi of India and Talaimannar. Thus, the confidence and goodwill of our closest neighbour became a matter of paramount importance in formulating Sri Lanka's Foreign Policy. We are all aware of times in our post-Independence history where the Indo-Lanka relationship was not at its best. So, the Government worked sincerely, once again, to win the trust and respect of neighbouring India. This is why Prime Minister Modi continues to offer us his support quite so often. He even honoured this country with a State Visit so as to participate in the

1681 1682

2017 2

International Vesak Festival in May this year. Another testament to our friendship is the sincerity with which the Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj bravely waded into the Palk Strait issue and gave Sri Lanka an unequivocal commitment to entirely stop the intrusion of Indian fishermen into our waters. Sir, as you know, this has been a persistent irritant in the Indo-Lanka relationship. Such friendly interactions are only possible due to the mutual trust that this Government has successfully developed.

A significant initiative known as the Blue Revolution deep-sea fishing scheme has now been initiated by the Tamil Nadu Government. This programme was launched by Prime Minister Modi in July this year with the Central Government allocating as much as Rs. 1,500 crore over the next few years to encourage South Indian fishermen to move away from the environmentally destructive practice of bottom trawling, and instead promote deep-sea fishing. The Indian Government has also decided to refrain from registering boats and persons who violate the ban on bottom trawling in the Palk Bay, finally, acknowledging and remedying the injustice to the Sri Lankan fishermen and the adverse consequences to the marine environment.

India and Sri Lanka are not merely friends, we are kith and kin. Both the Sinhalese and the Tamil communities claim descent from India, albeit from different parts. The two most dominant religions, Buddhism and Hinduism, can be regarded as precious gifts that we received from India. Sinhala and Tamil languages, traditions, customs, literature, art, song and cuisine have been shaped by Indian influence. We have entered into a Free Trade Agreement with India, and if we use this to the fullest in an intelligent manner, we can enjoy a market of over 1.2 billion from India alone. We can move mountains with India on our side, and this Government has fully secured the confidence of India.

Again, speaking of friends, we must also recognize the great contribution made by China as a dependable friend in both good times and in adversity. As far back as 1950, the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake saw the usefulness in establishing diplomatic links with China. The Rubber-Rice Pact of 1952 initiated by Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and the Minister of Commerce and Trade, the Hon. R.G. Senanayake not only cemented the links between the two countries, but also highlighted the independent foreign policy decision that a little country like Ceylon had the courage to take despite the fact that many of our friendly Western Nations exerted significant pressure that Ceylon should refrain from contracting with China. With hindsight, the Rubber-Rice Agreement has almost universally been hailed as one of the greatest historic Agreements entered into by Independent Ceylon. The close friendship in Sino-Sri Lanka relations grew to ever loftier heights during Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaikes premiership, and China served as a rock solid international ally during President Mahinda Rajapaksas tenure. China helped him to combat terrorism internally in this country both in the form of economic and military assistance and by providing crucial support at international fora where the Sri Lankan situation was either genuinely or deliberately misunderstood. China now continues to support the great developmental goals

and aspirations of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government in bringing Good Governance and solid economic growth. Edifices to the China-Sri Lanka friendship stand conspicuously in the form of the BMICH, the Lotus Tower, the Nelum Pokuna, and of course the Port City Complex will also be surely one in the near future.

Sir, I think I ought to take a moment to mention the name of Lord Naseby, at least very briefly, since it appears to be the most popular name in Parliament this month. Lord Naseby is a solider who fights for what is right, and I have had the privilege to meet him and speak with him on many an occasion. His efforts were even very recently, at an Adjournment Motion brought in by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, accepted and hailed by me in my capacity as the State Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Presidents letter to Lord Naseby, which followed my own highly-publicized letter to him, was tabled on that occasion because due to some inexplicable reason the fact that the President had in fact commended Lord Naseby had eluded both the local and international media. The insinuation, therefore, that the Government, and in particular the Foreign Affairs Ministry, does not regard Lord Nasebys revelations as useful is certainly not correct. What certain officials of my Ministry have tried to articulate, albeit unsuccessfully, is that this information can be invaluable if used appropriately, at the right time and at the most pertinent forum.

The correspondence of Colonel Gash, which he has given us, along with the findings of Gordon Weiss, the University Teachers for Human Rights, the unpublished Report of the United Nations Country Team, the Paranagama Commission Report and many other documents based on genuine findings and accounts have reached similar conclusions based on logic. The number of missing persons may vary slightly from report to report, but it is true to say that they all fluctuate within the range of 7,000 to 8,000 figure, which coincidently is the range that has been put forward by the Department of Census and Statistics in Sri Lanka also. To push the international community into accepting these figures as correct and to relegate Darusman and his findings, based on guesswork, hearsay and unsubstantiated terrorist propaganda posing as factual documentaries, the place it deserves, can only be the garbage bin of history, but this country must first engage in a truth-seeking mechanism internally. This cannot happen unless this is done. Now, there is no question that such a mechanism must be a domestic one, and the notion of foreign judges though suggested as an option, can and must be viewed only in that light. It is an option which we are free to accept or reject as we like. Such an option may have, I think, been originally included with a view of securing foreign expertise, if we so required it. In any event, our Constitution bequeaths judicial functions and capacity to a hierarchical court structure of which the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka is at the apex. There is therefore no constitutionally recognized manner in which some extraneous body or source can hear cases or deliver judgments of issues that need to come before the established judicial process here in Sri Lanka.

1683 1684

Mr. Presiding Member, I can personally assure the House that if any measure was underway, either to jeopardize the sovereignty of this country or to undermine the integrity of Sri Lankas judiciary, I would have been the first to revolt against this Government. This Government has changed Sri Lankas image in Western nations. We are now viewed as democratic, as promoting fundamental rights, and contributing to the comity of nations. Upon independence, we had good links with the West and Britain, in particular. As Britain itself pulls itself out of the European Union, they may themselves look for their old Commonwealth allies. The world has changed much since Independence, but we may still find a useful role to play with Britain. We unlike our neighbour India did not suffer strikes, agitations and blood baths to win our freedom. Although we had our struggles, which included incarcerations of our leaders like my own great grandfather the Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake, our Independence was negotiated artfully and skillfully and we continued with much of the existing colonial structures of Constitution and Government unchanged. The singularly most powerful agreement entered from a foreign policy view, was the Defence Agreement with Britain and so, we and Britain transformed ourselves from former roles as a colony and colonial master to that of the strongest allies. While forging ahead and forming bonds with emerging nations in Africa and South America, it is also prudent to re-establish traditional bonds and relationships. Our policy, as articulated by our President, is a policy of goodwill to all and enmity to none. That then is the policy of our Ministry.

Thank you. [.. .0 ]
