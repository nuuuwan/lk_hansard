FOREIGN EXCHANGE BILL

. . Order for Second Reading read. [2.36 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, I move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

Hon. Speaker, our current law applicable to foreign exchange is the Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of 1953. Just after the World War II, many European countries brought in exchange control. The United Kingdom had exchange control from the start of the World War II. The whole European economy and many Asian economies were completely devastated and they would not have revived without the Marshall Aid Programme by the Americans. But at that time, Sri Lanka did not see it necessary to have an Exchange Control Act because we had sufficient reserves. In fact, we had enough reserves and during the war, we had built up our reserves thanks to our sale of rubber and tea, which were needed by the Allies, and at the end of World War II, as we became independent, our reserves were such that we gave a loan to the United Kingdom and the whole of the Gal Oya Scheme was totally financed by Sri Lankan resources. We did not have to go to the World Bank or to the Exim Bank or to anyone else.

But in 1953, we had a foreign exchange crisis when our earnings came down from rubber and tea. When commodity prices got affected and went up a bit high during the Korean War, our reserves came down and at that time the then Government brought in the Exchange Control Act. Actually the situation revived after 1953 and we were again on a good wicket, but nevertheless this was kept on. The Central Bank and the Finance Ministers after 1956 felt that this was a necessity.

There were also many doctrines of the socialist market where controls were felt necessary. Therefore, it became a habit. Then, Kaldors Proposals and all that got built into our system and then we started liberalizing from 1977. Actually many other countries that started liberalizing after us have changed their law. They have amended the law or they have repealed the law. Only 47 countries have not moved away from the restrictive laws of foreign exchange control.

Now, we have a very peculiar system. On one hand, our law is to control foreign exchange. We talk of foreign

667 668

exchange control, but if you look at the present liberalization that has come through different regimes, whether it be from President J.R. Jayewardene, until today, every government has virtually liberalized it. So, our law and our regulations are at variance. What the law says is one thing and the regulations do something else. For instance, residents in Sri Lanka are permitted to accept foreign currency from non-residents against goods and services. A person who maintains a Foreign Exchange Earners Account is eligible to borrow in foreign currency. A person can take out and bring in to Sri Lanka any amount of foreign currency subject to declaration of Customs, if it exceeds US Dollars 10,000 and US Dollars 15,000 respectively. Now, a person can retain and possess foreign exchange up to US Dollars 10,000. A person can operate and maintain accounts outside Sri Lanka.

A person resident outside Sri Lanka can take out unutilized foreign currency throughout Sri Lanka. A person resident in Sri Lanka can make and receive payments to and from non-residents in relation to issuance and transfers of shares; purchase, transfer and make payments in respect to transactions related to Sri Lanka Rupee Denominated Treasury Bonds; make payments to or for credit of citizens of foreign states, corporate bodies incorporate outside Sri Lanka and foreign institutions in respect to Rupee Denominated Treasury Bills; purchase, transfer and make payments in respect of Sri Lanka Development Bonds; issue, transfer and make payments in respect to Unit Trusts operated with licences issued under the Securities and Exchange Commission; issue and transfer Sri Lankan Rupees Denominated Redeemable Preference Shares in a company to persons resident outside Sri Lanka; make payments in rupees to non-residents in respect to immovable property. Holders of NRFC, RFC, RNNFC and FECA can make payments outside Sri Lanka for any purpose. Residents to make payments in foreign exchange to persons resident outside Sri Lanka using credit/debit cards.

Then, we have also adopted the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund where we have to remove all foreign exchange restrictions related to current transactions. We have not done that in our law. We have made regulations. So, there is a contradiction here. If you are not controlling your exchange, why do you want to keep a law of which the objective is to control exchange and then have regulations? So, people do not have full confidence in Sri Lanka. So, that is one reason.

The other reason is regulation of gold. We really do not control gold. In 1981, the convertibility of USD to gold was ended. Then, finally in 2002, we said that in terms of Sections 5, 21 and 22 of the Exchange Control Act, for any person to buy, sell, import or export gold without any restriction must subject to the requirement that it has to be approved by the Director General of Customs. Then, in 2012, we specified that an import licence would be required for importation of gold and now it is not controlled by the Central Bank. Though the law has provision, it is controlled by Sri Lanka Customs.

So, we have many contradictory provisions in the Exchange Control Act and that is why we have brought in a new law. The objective of the new law is to promote and regulate foreign exchange and we have repealed the Exchange Control Act; we call it the Foreign Exchange Act. What we have done by regulations, we have now enshrined by legislative provisions.

The key features of the new law are; the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is the agent of the Government and is responsible for implementing of the new law. So, now, as the agent of the Government, they manage foreign exchange. They need not control foreign exchange. Authorized dealers and restricted dealers, currently authorized to deal in foreign exchange, will continue to be subject to the provisions of the new law and the Central Bank. Every commercial bank, newly licensed or in operation, will continue as authorized dealers. A person resident in Sri Lanka having foreign exchange or foreign assets may use it for current or capital transactions. So, we have now liberalized the total of current account transactions.

Capital transactions will be defined by regulations and certain classes of transactions with the limits specified will be free of any control. Sri Lankan resident in Sri Lanka can play a role in the development of the country. If they have foreign exchange belonging to them outside the country, even if they have not declared it, they can bring it in. Because, today foreign exchange is not the luxury of a few rich people. A large number of people have money abroad. They may have earned 25,000 Dollars, 100,000 Dollars or 500,000 Dollars. They have kept the money which they have earned abroad. They have done transactions. Then, monies have, for over a period of time, being kept by people when they exported or imported. Now we want them to bring all these monies back into Sri Lanka.

At the moment, our interest rates are higher than that of most of the countries in which they are keeping that money. But, many of them do not like either to go through the exchange control procedure or to be labelled as a criminal. So, they are keeping the money in those countries. Therefore, what we have done is, we have given a concession to Sri Lankans to make use of this opportunity. They can remit up to US Dollars 1 million without having to pay a tax and above that, they have to pay only a remittance fee of one per cent. This is because we want the money in Sri Lanka for development. But we have excluded from this the monies coming under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act or the Bribery Act. In addition, under the Bribery Act, if any person is convicted, all his monies and properties are forfeited. So, we have left those areas out. If an ordinary person has kept money and has not made a declaration, he could bring the money in. There are people who do transactions with Japan, buying vehicles and spare parts. There are a large number of people from Wennapuwa, Nattandiya and Harispattuwa who have got money outside the country. There are many people who have small accounts abroad. So, we will bring all that in. That is the whole purpose of this exercise.

But, we have given paramount importance to preservation of financial stability. So, if the Monetary Board says that there is a crisis coming up or there is a fear that there can be a shortage of foreign exchange, the Minister, with the approval of the Cabinet, can regulate or restrict the remittances of foreign exchange into Sri Lanka for a period not exceeding six months. What happens after that six months? Then, you get permission of Parliament and extend it to another six months. All we are saying is, this cannot be an administrative act; this must be done with the permission of Parliament because public finance has to be controlled by Parliament.

What have we done? Now, the control and restriction on foreign exchange, which was the objective of the Exchange Control Act, have been moved out and been replaced with management and monitoring of foreign exchange, but with provision for the Minister to act on the advice of the Monetary Board, if he feels certain controls have to be brought in.

Current accounts are fully liberalized and capital transactions are under Regulations approved by Parliament. We will have a more liberalized foreign exchange regime. We have to. The whole region is developing. As you know, in economic development, the real engine of growth is now coming into Asia and it will come to the Indian Ocean Region. Look at the growth that will take place in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Middle East. So, with so much of money transactions taking place, we should be able to utilize it and benefit from it. We should not put any restrictions. Sri Lankans are going abroad. They are dealing with foreign exchange. So, we are having a more liberalized system while the Central Bank can monitor the actual foreign exchange that is being utilized by people and we have made it a civil penalty. In most parts of the world, once exchange control went out, it no longer became a criminal liability, but a civil penalty.

The worry that some Hon. Members have is, will there be a draw-off on our foreign exchange? No, it would not be there. I can certainly tell you that we do not anticipate it and at the moment, with our agreements with the IMF, we do have sufficient reserves. We have also had agreements with some of the other countries. In addition to it, in the next few months, I think within the next year, we will also be acquiring another US Dollars 1.1 billion to our own account when we do the transaction, while retaining and controlling the Hambantota Harbour, in case of terminal operations and common user facilities, we will be paid and we can set that off later on against our loans, but after using it first as a buffer. Later on, I hope, the Hon. Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation will also be bringing us some more money in regard to the Mattala Airport. So, we have the reserves at the moment to face a crisis.

Sir, I would commend to Parliament that we do pass this Bill and enable these transactions to take place, monies to be invested in Sri Lanka and the people of Sri Lanka to benefit in general. Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim - Minister of Public Enterprise Development ) . . . . . .

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to say that countries in the world and in our region have reformed their Exchange Control Acts at different times as needed. The Thatcher Government in the UK in 1979 went for a major reform by abolishing exchange controls overnight. Reforms in India were more piecemeal and in 1999 they repealed their Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and brought in the Foreign Exchange Management Act.

In 2002, the then Ranil Wickremesinghe Government in Sri Lanka had extensive consultations with the Central Bank, other banks, exporters, business community, professionals and brought in the Foreign Exchange Management Bill. But, unfortunately, there was litigation in courts and as such we could not get the Bill through during our tenure in government. But, that was an excellent piece of legislation that should have come through at that time.

Historically, Sri Lanka during the ancient days of kings to colonial times did not have any exchange control regulations in our country. We, more or less, during the time of our ancient kings promoted free trade and exchange. One such good example is, Parakramabahu the Great who ruled Sri Lanka during 1153 to 1186. During that period, in order to consolidate his rule in the entire region, one of the things he decided to do was economic development. In the plan for economic development, he proposed a free trade zone area. In this free trade area, there were a huge number of local industries that worked especially in spices, elephant tusks and different timber which was available for traders to come and trade in Sri Lanka. In exchange, there were other goods like silk that we traded. Arabs and Chinese were the famous people who came and traded in these areas. So, historically when we look at our country, we were not a country that has been regulated or closed. We were an open country where we traded openly with the world. We did not fear to work with the global environment. During this time, we can see that our country was a part of the famous Maritime Silk Road which is now famously talked about in our region.

It was only during World War II that the colonial rulers introduced exchange control to Sri Lanka as a war strategy in order to control monies falling into the enemies hands. This was first brought under the Finance Regulation in 1939. Exchange controls have been too rigid most often creating inefficient unproductive economic activities and have created more problems for countries. This has been confirmed by the famous Columbia University Professor Jagdish Bhagwati. These are some of the economic theories well spoken against rigid exchange control measures.

In 1953, the then Governor of the Central Bank, N.U. Jayawardena, though he was a student of the London School of Economics and Political Science under the famous Professor Hiet, believed in free exchange, but he was forced to present the Exchange Control Bill because that was then decided as policy for the government. It was passed through and it was actually called a draconian Act at that time. Basically, the Exchange Control Act had enormous powers. The Central Bank virtually had control, the Minister had control over the Central Bank and basically, any offences created under it was considered a financial crime. This went on for a long time without any changes. We did not have the foresight to look at making the changes. In 2002, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe realized that we need to link with the rest of the world and be competitive. We tried to make the change but our government was short-lived at that time.

If you take Singapore, Singapore has followed a totally different strategy from the time they started developing their country. Singapores first Finance Minister, Dr. Goh Keng Swee considered options of introducing exchange controls to tackle their balance of payment problems. But, they realized that it is not the symptoms that you need to solve, but it is the remedy.

So, instead of looking at the balance of payment problems, they addressed the root cause of the problem by having a disciplined budget and controlling money creation. Instead of putting Exchange Control Acts and trying to prevent money moving up and down freely as

687 688

per demand and supply, they began to cut down their unnecessary expenditure and that created strict fiscal discipline. As a result, they developed their country in the right direction.

In 1966, Sri Lanka lost another opportunity when a Professor of Economics from the Gujarat University came to Sri Lanka and developed a Paper advocating flexible exchange rates. We did not think of pursuing that either. The Foreign Exchange Bill that we are talking about today is too late a few decades, but it addresses some of the key problems. I think it has to be still stronger, but I do not think we have taken all the issues into consideration. It addresses some of the key problems though not all. It is an improvement on the Exchange Control Act definitely. Rather than controlling authorized dealers, it is more management-oriented. It controls the management of foreign exchange. The Central Bank implements laws subject to directions from the Minister. So, basically the Minister still has the power to control certain activities.

[ : .]

[ .]

[At this stage, His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena entered the Chamber.]

The other important aspect that we have seen in this Bill is that we decriminalize exchange control violations. This has been a very important change that we have made. Since all violations are supposed to be criminalized, it always creates a fear factor for businessmen to use the exchange mechanism as a tool for developing their businesses.

In the current Exchange Control Act, holding of foreign currencies by citizens is actually presented in a negative context. In terms of Section 5, no person other than an authorized dealer should hold or deal in foreign exchange. However, in the proposed Foreign Exchange Bill it has been put in a positive context so that according to Clause 8(1) (b) of the Bill, A person in, or resident in, Sri Lanka shall hold foreign exchange in his possession or in a bank account in Sri Lanka;. They could use it subject to the purpose, limits and terms of conditions set by the Minister.

Finally, I would like to say further, Section 5 of the Foreign Exchange Bill stipulates that those who hold foreign exchange in a bank account in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka or those who own a foreign asset could use such foreign exchange for paying of any current or capital transaction of his or her choice. The requirement to be satisfied is that such foreign exchange should not have been acquired by converting local currency into foreign currency meaning that those who genuinely earn foreign currency can use it in the way they want. These laws are subject to the act of money laundering, or corruption, or bribery. Therefore, it has enough safeguards against illegal money. The proposed Amendment most importantly gives dignity and

protection to Sri Lankans. Up to now, Sri Lankans holding money abroad sometimes could not bring in their monies because it was under certain restrictions. Accordingly, the Amendment has protected citizens personal property rights which are not available under the present law. This is a great achievement that we have given to our own citizens of the country. We have always looked at foreign exchange being brought by foreigners. This is an opportunity to recognize our peoples earnings abroad. Therefore, citizens can engage in current and capital transactions subject to rules by the Central Bank and the Minister. Therefore, I think this is step forward in the right direction to make Sri Lanka a strong country in the region and in the world.

Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance and Mass Media) ? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [3.56 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Presiding Member, as we celebrate 40 years of the open economy in Sri Lanka this week, the Sri Lankan economy, today, is currently at the crossroads in the macroeconomic policy formulation. Sri Lanka needs now, as the Hon. Amunugama just mentioned, to introduce a set of policy reforms on an urgent basis to address some of the persistent structural vulnerabilities of the economy. The current Government has been able to reverse the decades-long trend of falling Government revenue

relative to national income. Today we have managed to bring it to a level where it can go forward with confidence.

Actually, in 2015, when His Excellency the President, who is here with us in the Chamber today, took over the reins of Government along with the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, we had an economy in shambles. The fiscal sector was in shambles: falling government revenue, high Government debt, unproductive investments, inefficient transfer payments were some of these problems. The external sector was in shambles: falling exports, widening imports, unsustainable short-term capital flows and borrowed international reserves were some of our problems at that time and the monetary sector was also in shambles. This was all due to the crony-capitalist system which was adhered to by President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his dark rule of nine years.

( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) .

I would also like to say, Mr. Presiding Member, that the prudent management of the exchange control liberalization is also the need of the hour and I am sure there are many Members who may have expressed some of these fears earlier in this Debate. In fact, the Government is fully cognizant of the risk associated with imprudent management of exchange control relaxations.

.

The recent global financial crisis and many currency crises before have aggravated the fear of capital account liberalization as they could lead to potential financial crisis due to sudden outflow of foreign capital in the event of loss of international investor confidence. However, history has shown many a time that capital control relaxations per se have not been solely responsible for such crisis, but the imprudent macroeconomic management of the respective governments. Such imprudent macroeconomic policies may include over-valued exchange rates, weak supervision and regulation of banks and other financial institutions, bad corporate governance and practices et cetera.

Therefore, the current Governments approach to the introduction of more liberalization to the foreign exchange management through the proposed Bill rests on a well-coordinated effort among all institutions and stakeholders involved. Such efforts towards more liberalization underscore the corresponding improvements to prudential controls designed to mitigate any volatility of foreign capital inflows at least in the short run. Further, the Government is very well mindful of the fact that it is a fine line between relaxation of exchange regulations in order to encourage foreign investments and leaving potential room for activities such as money laundering, tax havens et cetera. Therefore, we are taking all measures to address all potential avenues that could be potentially detrimental to the free flow of capital and financial account movements.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. E. Saravanapavan. You have ten minutes.

[5.07 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, it is no secret that our country has a severe foreign exchange shortfall. The two aims of the Government are to attract Foreign Direct Investment and to encourage the private sector to invest more.

The war-affected provinces of the North and the East have the highest untapped potential for export trade. However, there is not much effort to convert the export potential of these provinces. No action has been taken to understand the ground situation. A professional assessment to know what actions must be taken to increase exports of products and processes and the conducive environment required has not been done.

As Members representing the war-affected provinces, we know that human skills and capacity is one of the most important requirements. There are nearly two million overseas Sri Lankans who have the required skills and capacity to assist, only if we have a clearly spelled out Government policy that is backed by the conduct of the leadership of the Government. We keep getting consistent and disappointing feedback from people attempting to visit Sri Lanka to provide that capacity. They rely on fluffy statements made by some of the Ministers and only end up being disappointed by the actions of the Members of the same Government.

There is lack of investor confidence in these overseas Sri Lankans. It is the country that must fight to win their hearts and minds if we want to prosper. No one just invest if the country is on a high horse and dictate how the others must behave. The Government lacks a sense of direction on economic policy and the potential contribution of the overseas Sri Lankans. Even if there is one, I do not think many in the Government know what it is. The human capacity is the most important prerequisite for the development of the war-affected provinces.

A person with dual citizenship who has diligently worked for nearly two years to plan a way for post-war development and created models for rural development had a very bad experience recently and returned in disgust. That is because, one of the Ministers has questioned the legitimacy of the foreigners working for development. We want clear policies, not concessions; we want laws, not favours; we want rules, not friendships; we want stability, not luck.

I wish to quote the following extract of the 2017 Budget Speech made by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake:

Honorable Speaker, we have continued to address issues pertaining to the Northern and Eastern Provinces on separate basis in the past. I wish to lay emphasis on the fact that the Government is committed to eliminate existing socio-economic gap between North and East with the rest of the country by 2020.

Sir, is there a plan for the noble cause? We would like to see the action plan for this, we want to be involved in and understand what this plan entails. We also want to share some of the work our Party has been doing to assist with development, so, our efforts are not jeopardized by some high-handed attitude of Hon. Ministers or public officials.

If this could be done, we all could go in the same direction. The potential investors have plenty of negatives in the current political landscape, economic instability and security related issues. We do not need any more that will retard economic development, livelihood, exports and foreign exchange. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. . . ( ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Hon. Member, the UDA and the BOI have got a plan for the entire Northern region and two permanent officers are there. We are also trying to establish an economic zone in the Mankulam area. So you cannot say that there is a high-handed manner of any Minister or any official. We are doing our best.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I can prove that today a gentleman is flying off to Australia because of the problems he faced with regard to this project. If you can give the approval I will get him down from Australia.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You check with your own officers who are placed in Jaffna.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I am only coming out with facts.

719 720

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am also coming out only with facts. Please discuss this matter with your UDA officers.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) You have not understood what I am trying to tell you. I think everyone is canvassing for the diaspora to come here, but you are not making the situation conducive for them. That is what I am trying to say. So, let me speak, please.

Foreign exchange is not something you order and receive. We must work hard and build investor confidence and this cannot be achieved through the indifferent attitudes of some politicians. In Sri Lanka, foreign exchange earnings have persistently remained at a lower level than the demand for the same. That is, our inflow of foreign exchange through earnings in exports, overseas workers remittances, tourist earnings and direct investment have been lower than our expenditure on import payments and loan repayments. Hence, the current account deficit has become a salient feature of the Sri Lankan economy. Whilst there are many factors to consider, I believe the best solution to our current account deficit is pursuing the fundamental goals of finding ways to increase our export earnings and foreign direct investment.

Now, we already know that such a goal can be achieved through mechanisms of training our work force in relevant sectors, running of campaigns to attract investment and so on. Sri Lanka has been trying to implement those. But, to me, there is a factor which has overlooked with regard to the current account deficit, which if realized could propel the success of our exports and FDI goals simultaneously. That is to take necessary action to uphold the human rights of all its citizens in Sri Lanka, regardless of caste, race or minority status, and if there is political stability it could bring in.

Let me elaborate how such human concerns plays an important role in economic and financial discussion. When speaking at the presentation at the BMICH earlier this year, Professor Ricardo Hausmann from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government noted that the dearth to export earnings in Sri Lanka is because of our lack of diversification. That is why we lag in export earnings in comparison to nations like Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. For instance, between the years 2000 and 2015 whilst Thailand added 70 products worth US Dollars 326 per capita, Sri Lanka only started producing five products worth US Dollars 7 per capita. Also our production has been largely limited to its traditional exports like tea, rubber precious stones and garments whereas countries such as China have diversified into much higher productivity sectors such as electronics and machinery. The key to this shift, is noted to be, the development of know how. As it takes a long time to develop this because there is training and trial involved, Professor of Ricardo Hausmann recommended that Sri

Lanka should take advantage of its considerable diaspora population to build a labour force with a variety of high skills, and make strong partnerships for FDI flows. This necessity is what brings me to the requirement of upholding human rights. Modern political and economic studies have found that developing countries that respect human rights are more successful in attracting foreign direct investment than those publicized to have a history of abusing any part of its populace, and being in political turmoil.

This is because, other than the obvious dangers associated with political instability, investors increasingly face what is called, audience costs. That is, if they are involved with a country which has failed to uphold its promises to its people and has violated their rights, they may face repercussions in terms of their image, reputation and even stock value.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [5.36p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.

As we all are aware, there are over 10 lakhs of people who have been working abroad, doing big or small jobs,

727 728

for the last so many years. I think they are the second or the third highest foreign exchange earners, but, very unfortunately, they have not been given their due respect. I can remember, during the last Session when we had the Debate on the Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) Bill, I stated that those 10 lakhs of people working abroad do not have the opportunity to cast their votes at elections. But, I know of some countries which make arrangements in the embassies of the respective countries for the migrant workers to cast their votes during elections. That opportunity has not been given to our migrant workers. I mentioned it at that Debate.

Today, I am very happy that this Bill has been brought in so that we could broaden the opportunities and help these people to bring in their money - foreign exchange - in a way that will be useful to them. I would like to mention that earlier there were so many restrictions. Whatever earnings they had, they saved elsewhere. Even today, that is happening - they reserve their earnings in countries they are working. Because of the restrictions, they have been sending only the money required for the well-being of their families or for other matters and kept back the rest until they came back. So, we have to change that situation. I am sure that with this Bill, the money they have been reserving in foreign banks can be brought into our country and banked here.

Actually, it is our duty to look after them. There are only a few people doing professional jobs, but about 70 per cent of the migrant workers do small jobs. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Employment, the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale is not here. Those workers have problems. The problems they face are made known to us as Members of Parliament. Then, we go to the Ministry and do the needful and look after their problems. I must thank the Hon. Minister because she gives the due respect to the workers. When we solve the workers' problems for them, they are happy. This is a cycle. Some people work abroad for years and years, they come back and then, another lot goes - it goes round and round. The problem that these workers face today - I must come out with that - is, once they come back here, there is no organization to give them proper advice. So, most of the time what happens is, once they come back, money is spent unnecessarily and once again, they go abroad. So, I request the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media to have such a setup. There must be a setup where they can seek advice on spending money properly once they come back here so that they can improve their lives and go on with that money. So, that part must be included in this. Only now the Hon. Minister of Foreign Employment walked in. She is doing her part. In the Electorate I represent, over 30,000 people are working abroad. All of them are poor people. But, what is happening is, once they come back, they spend their money and when it is finished, they go back.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, give me one more minute. ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale - Minister of Foreign Employment) Hon. Member, I want you to know that we have already started a reintegration programme, through which we are trying to help them with financial benefits, to start self-employment schemes and all that. In future, under the migrant workers' welfare scheme called Shramika Surekuma, which we introduced last year, they will be monitored by the officers attached to the Ministry of Foreign Employment.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Minister, I thanked you before you came in for the work you do.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) I know, thank you very much for that. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) But, that is not enough. Even the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media must look into this.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Okay, thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan, you have five minutes. [.. 5.41]

[5.50p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, let me thank you for giving me nine minutes to speak about the new Foreign Exchange Bill brought in with the intention of replacing the outdated Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of 1953. This Bill has been contested in the Supreme Court albeit unsuccessfully and by some quarters, strong opposition has been voiced against the Bill.

Sir, in all honesty, I feel that any Hon. Member who speaks about the Foreign Exchange Bill should fundamentally ask the question, Why do we need foreign exchange controls at all? After all, the effect of any such Bill would ultimately be either tightening the foreign exchange controls or loosening those. We also know that trade in yesteryears did not carry any exchange controls and from an economic standpoint, imposing exchange controls would only mean suppression in demand and restrictions to the citizens. We have also seen, considering the global trend, more and more countries are moving away from exchange controls. So, it makes all the economic sense to relax our exchange controls and create greater demand. I think it should be the way or at least the direction in which we should move, in a long-term perspective. But, in the short run, it is different.

733 734

2017 05

We do not live in a perfect world and we certainly do not have perfect markets. So, in such circumstances, it becomes increasingly important to think inward and primarily, to be concerned about one's own economic interest. We have seen how foreign exchange robber barons have manipulated markets at the risk of economic collapse of smaller countries and have also seen how these nations have safeguarded their national interest using temporary exchange control mechanisms.

So, the fundamental question is not about the direction of this Bill, but rather about the safeguards and the timing. We should not forget the lessons we learned from the Asian financial crisis of 1997. As a result of the Thai Governments decision not to peg the Baht against the Dollar, a wave of financial instability spread across Asia quickly, which resulted in currency devaluation of 38 per cent and a stock market reduction by 60 per cent. So, in any foreign exchange Bill, it is vitally important to consider the safeguards more than the direction.

And the other important aspect to consider is the timing of the Bill. Are we trying to open up our markets at the most acumen time? Take, for instance, the current political situation. Now, it is being aired that 18 Government Members have come to their good senses and decided to sit in the Opposition in the near future. Irrespective of the merits of this story, this is not conducive for investor confidence. Sir, this joke of a Unity Governments amazing ability to mismanage the entire economy can result in capital outflows, if this Bill is made into law at this juncture. We have a serious balance of payment problem; our trade deficit has expanded to US Dollars 2.5 billion in the first quarter and our exports have declined during the first three months of the year and have been stagnant around the US Dollars 10 billion mark. What usually offsets the trade deficit are the worker remittances and our earnings from tourism. Take the case of tourism, for instance. This year up to June, we have had a whopping 4.8 per cent growth. Do we really need even a Minister to achieve this growth rate? I have seen on social media that Sri Lanka has been rated by several magazines and organizations as one of the best places to travel to. So, that is good publicity. At a time with good publicity and of peace, our Minister is able to achieve only a growth rate of the war era. This goes to show the complete incapability of this Government to get anything done other than, perhaps, wasting Government coffers by buying vehicles for themselves. The problem with tourism will be even more aggravated if the World Health Organization declares Sri Lanka as a country with a dengue epidemic or the respective countries impose travel warnings on travelling to Sri Lanka. Now, all these do not go well for Sri Lanka and I believe that the timing of this Bill is not the most opportune moment.

It was only recently that the country was made aware that the former Minister of Finances apartment rent has been paid by a person responsible for the biggest daylight robbery in Sri Lanka. In any other country, the Minister of Finance would have been jailed. I wonder whether the other Member who so vociferously defended the former Central Bank Governor and his son-in-law too has profited from ill-gotten gains.

Now, I also want to bring into contention the Governments inability to understand the aspirations of the people. This has resulted in many a protest and strikes by students and workers alike. This has not been conducive for investments. So, it is best if the Government at least tries to understand the issues and provide appropriate relief than take the baton-and-the-tear-gas approach.

Mr. Presiding Member, we must not only look at the Sri Lankan context, but also at the global situation when implementing policy such as this. The world markets have greatly fluctuated over the past two years, from the beginning of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. Some economists believe that another Asian financial crisis is on the horizon. For example, Chinas devaluation of the Yuan in relation to the US Dollar on 24th August, 2016 is seen as a symptom. This caused the Chinese economy to slow down, resulting in lower domestic interest rates and a large amount of bond float. The low interest rates enacted by China encouraged other Asian countries to decrease their own domestic interest rates. Japan, for example, cut its already low short-term interest rates into negative numbers in early 2016. This prolonged period of low interest rates forced Japan to borrow increasingly larger sums of money to invest in global equity markets. The Japanese Yen responded counter intuitively by increasing in value, making Japanese products more expensive and actually further weakening its economy. So, all in all, even if we look at the domestic macro environment or the volatile international markets, we can conclude that it will be wiser to follow a conservative path in the near future.

Mr. Presiding Member, if I am to comment on the Bill itself, I understand that the Bill has been designed after some lengthy deliberations with stakeholders. However, whether the final design of the Bill reflects the deliberations is another question that needs clarification. One of the glaring differences between the Foreign Exchange Bill and the Exchange Control Act of 1953 has been that the supervision of gold trading has been lifted.

Now, as gold can be used as a tool for capital outflows in a time of political and economic uncertainty, if capital outflows would take place, there will be no mechanism for Government to impose restrictions except by bringing in new legislation. I feel, Sir, the Government should put more attention to such shortcomings of this Bill. I think, in general, the decriminalization of exchange policy violation is a good measure. Many reputed Sri Lankan business personalities have fallen victim to this law including the architect of Exchange Control Act of 1953, the late Mr. N. U. Jayawardena, and if my memory serves me right, even the former Chairman of the Hirdaramani Group.

Our laws should encourage entrepreneurs and business personalities to expand their activities and not put them behind bars or riddle them with lawsuits. So, in that sense, this legislation is in the right direction. This Bill will also relax the ability of the citizens to hold on to foreign exchange. The current Exchange Control Act of 1953, under Section 5, prohibits any person other than an

735 736

authorized dealer from holding foreign exchange. Now, this has a moral implication too and some believe this is a violation of property rights, and I agree. I see no rational reason any Government should restrict its people from spending their monies which they have earned abroad unless of course a national interest is compromised. Furthermore, Sir, the old Exchange Control Act was an instrument of inefficiency as each foreign transaction had to be permitted as the Act itself does not contain any authorization. However, this issue will be rectified by the new Bill as commercial banks and specialized banks will be made authorized dealers and the Central Bank will be permitted to appoint restricted dealers. However, the authority of the Central Bank to permit any person by a special Gazette to transact in foreign exchange is too open and can lead to irregularities.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one minute more. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Okay, Sir.

Perhaps this Clause was inserted keeping in mind large projects.

However, I feel there is no need for this as the Central Bank, in any case, can appoint restricted agents. This Bill will also allow any person in or resident in Sri Lanka who holds foreign exchange in a bank account in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka or owns any foreign assets, which has not been derived from the conversion of rupees or the disposal or conversion of any financial or real asset within Sri Lanka, to utilize such foreign exchange for making any payment for current or capital account transaction within or outside Sri Lanka. I think this is an excellent clause, for too long our Sri Lankan companies have not been able to venture out overseas due to capital account restrictions. But. this will give the platform for the local companies to make their mark on the international markets.

In conclusion Sir, as I said earlier, I feel this Bill is in the right direction although we have reservation about the controls. We feel that the Bill could have been drafted better in some instances, such as by restricting the power of the Minister in removing members from a Board of Inquiry. But all in all, we feel that the most important aspect will be the timing of the implementation of the Bill and it should be done at a time of confidence so as not to create capital outflows. But for that to happen, I think, it is best if this Government resigns.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, please.

[5.59 p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Thank you, Sir.

Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya, there is no need for the Government to resign. Perhaps, the Joint Opposition should resign and finally, let everyone know that you are incapable of doing anything at all.

Sir, I am actually pleased to have listened to the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya, who took a very pragmatic approach and applauded the Government for having introduced this new Bill. Thank you. That is the kind of politics we require: good things must be appreciated and what you think, perhaps, is not so good must be noted. -[Interruption.] I took notes. Let me respond. What you said is that you do not know why one needs foreign exchange control at all. You said that it suppresses the freedom of the citizens; I agree. You also talked about property rights and economic freedom and I completely agree with you. This is not the time to bring back controls, it is the time to relax because, as you pointed out very correctly, many countries are moving away from exchange controls. You said that in the long-term, it is a good strategy. But you had two issues about the short-term. You said you have to think inwards in the short-term. The two issues you brought up were "safeguards" and "timing". So, I liked to respond you because you made some valid observations.

I agree with you that we have to have safeguards. What do you mean by a safeguard? I heard earlier the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane talking about Soros bringing all his billions and taking away the billions and creating volatility in the market and so on. But, really, it is not about holding on to a few dollars, Hon. Tharaka Balasuirya. That is not the safeguard we require. It is about creating the opportunity for the foreign exchange holdings in this country to grow. That is what the safeguard is about. So, you have to be open-minded about this. You cannot think about restrictions, but think about safeguards in the bigger context of giving the opportunity. I also appreciate the fact that you mentioned that this Bill gives our local entrepreneurs the ability to venture overseas.

safeguard . Holding on to a few Dollars but creating opportunities to make more Dollars is important.

I might as well take this opportunity to inform you that foreign exchange reserves have now gone up to over US Dollars 7 billion, thanks to the prudent management of foreign exchange and the ability of this country to attract opportunities that we have created to attract that kind of foreign exchange.

Then you talked about timing. You said that the time was not conducive. Quite hilariously you said that 18 Hon. Members of the Government have decided to sit with you in the Opposition and that would bring down investor confidence. -[Interruption.] In fact, it is going to increase investor confidence, my learned Friend, because that will give us greater freedom to do what we have to do; to do the reforms that we need to do without all the internal pulling of strings and leg tackles that some people are trying to do to make things difficult for this Government to operate. Hon. Balasuriya, you also referred to a serious balance of payments crisis, the exports falling, worker remittances and tourism. Hon. Member, the balance of payments crisis has been created over the last fifteen years. I might take this opportunity to educate you, if you do not already know - perhaps you do - that in around 2003 and 2004 when the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghes previous Government left office, the exports of goods and services as a percentage of the GDP was 39 per cent, but when we took over the Government in 2015, it had fallen to 16 per cent.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up your speech now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay. Therefore, your Government or the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksas Government - he is the leader of the political party that you support - is the one that has to take the blame for creating the balance of payments crisis in this country year after year. It cannot be corrected even if you wanted to in a 18-month period.

Therefore, I would like to wind up by saying - I only have a few more minutes to speak - that 4.8 per cent growth is in fact very good given the circumstances that we had to undergo. Hon. Member, do you know that we had a draught that destroyed 55 per cent of the harvest of Maha Kanna? We had floods that destroyed 60 per cent of the harvest of Yala Kanna. Having gone through so much of difficulties, we have still managed to register a 4.8 per cent growth rate. I would also like to take this opportunity to inform this House that we are expecting the growth rate to hit 5 per cent.

I will conclude by quoting, the IMF staff team head Mr. Jaewoo Lee. He said, Overall fiscal performance has been very robust. It has been steadily improving in line with the program or even over performing targets. Hon. Member, Even over performing targets. The tax revenue has increased in some cases by 30 per cent or 40 per cent. -[Interruption.]

Mr. Mr. Jaewoo Lee further said, Going forward Sri Lanka has to ensure further progress is made on structural reform, which again leads to medium-term fiscal consolidation and greater exchange rate flexibility would be helpful in not only increasing reserves but also strengthening the resilience of the economy. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you.

. [6.08 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. I would like to start off by basically mentioning that I thought Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya was living in a fools paradise. He tried to make innuendos in todays context of character assassination, but it is nothing new. That was what he basically said.

I got up in order to mention not only about the Foreign Exchange Bill that has been presented but also about the strong economy that has been built during the last two-and -a-half years, which also includes fiscal consolidation and revenue increases. I am so happy that the IMF has made a recommendation and that basically fits with the tough times that we went through.

We saw today one of the vociferous members of the Joint Opposition, Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, going on rampage. Probably before too long you will see the numbers jumping going up, because he was coming in at the same time that our President walked in. Then, he went on rampage about what he has been talking for the last six months. So, there is some coordination between our President walking in and the guy who has allegations of bribery and corruptions coming here and speaking on something that Anika Wijesuriya yesterday spoke. It is absolutely frivolous and I should say that there is a design of character assassination in it. So, all I could basically say is to ensure that your despicable acts -[Interruption.] I know, that is Mahindananda Aluthgamage, not you, Hon. Balasuriya.

I am speaking about this because today my name was mentioned in Parliament. When His Excellency the

739 740

President walked in from one side, he walked in from the other side and started talking about this. So, see the semblance. Probably, the Joint Opposition will lose another Member - a corrupt one. That is the problem that we have.

As you all came to know through the media, I have been summoned to the Presidential Commission to inquire into Bond Issue, which is not a new thing. I was wondering why it took such a long time, because we were key players whom they were trying to get at. They were going after all other guys who were irrelevant and now we are summoned. Without having the courtesy to consider that I am a Cabinet Minister, he basically mentioned a date on which the Cabinet meeting is to be held and that happens to be today. Therefore, I got my lawyers to inform them that I was unable to be present-

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! .

.

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA left the Chair, and THE HON. SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I am so happy to see you in the Chair at a time when I am basically mentioning a matter related to breach of privilege which I wanted to raise today, but -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have only one minute left. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Sir. I hope even within less than that, I will be able to get my message across. I will read my text so that it will help the message to get across and thereafter if I have some time, I will speak.

Sir, as you know I have been summoned to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Central Bank Bond Issue today. This was handed over to me on Saturday. Courtesy was not offered to me even as a Cabinet Minister. They did not know that we have to attend the Cabinet meeting today and they wanted me to come and meet them on such a day.

However, both the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers and Parliament was scheduled for today. While I had

absolutely no intension of disobeying the summons issued by the Commission, I was advised by the lawyers that according to our Constitution Parliament is the supreme body and therefore, it should be given precedence. This is in view of the fact that this Commission which is a creature of the Executive is too supervised by Parliament. The right of an Hon. Member to attend Parliament without hindrance or obstruction is a long recognized privilege in the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth Parliaments and in Sri Lanka. It is clearly mentioned under Part A (1) of the Schedule of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. I had instructed the lawyers to inform the Commission of my inability to attend the Commission on the 25th and would do so as soon as my Parliamentary duties permitted me to do so.

Hon. Speaker, I would like to raise this matter because it was on Saturday that I got the summons to appear before the Commission on Tuesday; when everybody very well knows that we are senior members in the Government and the Cabinet meeting takes place on Tuesday. Furthermore, they also know it is a Parliament day. They got messages going out to show as if we wanted to disobey. I am so proud to be in this Government where there is freedom even for these Commissions to call the senior Cabinet Ministers before them, whereas the Opposition Members who had robbed this country for eleven years and reduced our reserves are going scot free. This is the sense of transparency our Government makes. There was a load of rubbish that was mentioned yesterday. I will take it up in due course when I will be able to take more time to speak. Hon. Speaker, I would like you to go through the privileges that are bestowed on the Hon. Members of Parliament and the Cabinet Ministers.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will check on that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Government servants must realize that they are part of Government and they should not try to run the Government. Today the problem is that these people think that they run Government policies.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will look into that, Hon. Minister. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I greatly appreciate your immediate intervention into this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

FULFILMENT OF GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENTS

REGARDING MISSING PERSONS [6.57p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

May I, Sir, first read my Adjournment Motion.

"Whereas the issue of "missing persons" particularly in the Northern and Eastern parts of Sri Lanka has been a serious issue for some time.

And whereas families of missing persons have in the past several months been carrying on peaceful demonstrations in all Districts in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to highlight this issue and to impress upon the Government the urgent need to bring this issue of "Missing Persons" to a satisfactory closure.

And whereas these families of missing persons have been interacting with Government and have been assured that the following steps would be taken:-

(i) the names of all persons who were in custody at that time the present Government assumed office and the places in which they were held in custody, would be made public and

(ii) the names of persons now held in custody and the places in which they are now held in custody would be made public

(iii) that representatives of families of missing persons would be enabled to visit 'secret' detention camps, in which some persons have allegedly been held in custody, and which these families have become aware of

763 764

(iv) that the Office of Missing Persons would be operationalized in terms of the law enacted in August last year, and that through this process, the families of these missing persons would have the opportunity through various steps that could be taken when the law becomes functional to bring this painful issue faced by the families to some acceptable closure. This would bring to an end the trauma of uncertainty, and lack of any reliable information whatever, which the families currently face.

And whereas (iv) above has been initially fulfilled and by the required notification, the Law relating to the Office on Missing Persons enacted on 23rd August 2016 has been made operational.

And whereas the Commitments made at (i), (ii) and (iii) above have not yet been fulfilled.

And whereas the fulfilment of the Commitments at (i), (ii) and (iii) above are fundamental to the families of the missing persons, acquiring confidence in the whole process which is critical to the success of the whole process and genuine reconciliation.

It is reiterated that the building of confidence in the families of the "Missing Persons" is fundamental to the success of this whole process, and genuine reconciliation.

Release of relevant information which only the Government possesses and has the capacity to officially release, should be a first step in the commencement of the process relating to the implementation of the law on the Office of Missing Persons.

This Motion urges the Government as a matter of urgency to fulfill the Government's commitments stipulated at (i), (ii) and (iii) above and without delay commence the process at (iv) above."

In fact, Sir, I have written to His Excellency the President in regard to this matter on the 20th of July and I am tabling* that letter. I will not read the whole letter. I will be thankful if you will direct, Sir, that this letter be published at the end of my speech in the Hansard.

There are thousands of people, families of missing persons, who have been demonstrating and carrying on a protest in all the Districts of the North and the East - in Jaffna, in Mannar, in Mullaitivu, in Kilinochchi, in Vavuniya, in Trincomalee, in Batticaloa and in Ampara wanting a closure to this question of missing persons and wanting the Government to release information pertaining to the missing persons, so that they would know what happened to their next of kin and this has been going on for a long time. In fact, I have been going and meeting some of these people. Recently, I was in Kilinochchi. A couple of days ago, I had occasion to go and meet those people. I think, Sir, the time has come for necessary action to be taken on the part of the Government to convince these people that there is a process which is taking place that will enable these people to be given information in regard to their kith and kin who have gone missing and as a result of such information being made available to these people, the trauma that they are presently undergoing will come to an end. These persons

will acquire some solace from the fact that information is being made available to them and that they will be able to bring this matter to a satisfactory closure where the persons will stop their demonstration and engage themselves in the process of assisting the Office of Missing Persons to ascertain the truth in regard to this matter.

I might say a few words, Sir, in regard to the role of the Office of Missing Persons. They are the vital part of investigations. They can come to a conclusion consequent to their investigations in regard to a particular person who is said to be missing. After that, they can issue a certificate that will enable these people to obtain either a Certificate of Absence or a Certificate of Death, one or the other, which would entitle them to various reliefs; they can be given reparation and other forms of support. Such a process and steps that I have outlined above would result in the families of the missing persons being able to obtain some credible information pertaining to their missing kith and kin and it will give them some measure of solace in regard to the trauma they are presently undergoing.

I want to say a few words, Sir, in regard to some statements being made by some important persons in regard to this Office of Missing Persons which are intended to persuade the Government not to take action that needs to be taken in terms of the law that has been enacted and to prevent this matter being brought to a closure in some acceptable way. I want to state, Sir, very clearly that the issue of missing persons must not be confused with the war.

In the war that was fought, the armed conflict, on the one hand there was the armed forces who were engaged in conflict with armed combatants. That was the conflict that went on for several years. All persons who went missing, all persons who disappeared were unarmed people. Whether they were unarmed civilians, a lot of parents surrendered their unarmed children to the armed forces because they wanted an investigation to be held and for them to be released so they will be safe. On the contrary, if some combatants were taken into custody, the combatants were so taken into custody when they were unarmed, when they were no longer armed combatants. So, in the case of all missing persons, Sir, it is important to remember that the missing persons were unarmed. I want to specifically mention that the persons who went missing, who were unarmed must not be confused with persons who were engaged in a war, who were armed combatants.

Recently, Sir, I found that the former President, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa has been making a statement that the missing persons law contravenes the Constitution. If the missing persons law contravenes the Constitution, he should have gone to the Supreme Court and challenged that law which he did not do. He should have spoken up

765 766

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

2017 05

in this Parliament and challenged that law which he did not do. He has stated that the whole country is in danger if the law is implemented. I think it is absurd, Sir, because the law pertaining to missing persons merely enables the office of missing persons to conduct certain investigations to find out what happened to the person who is said to be missing and give information to the next of kin in regard to their investigations to enable the next of kin to be reconciled to the reality and the truth of the current position pertaining to their next of kin. But, here it is sought to be made out that the country is in danger; that the countrys security is being jeopardized and that the Government is trying to do something which is harmful to the country. I do not think the Government should allow itself to be dissipated it in any way by such propaganda from doing what needs to be done, Sir, because the trauma of the families need to be brought to an end. I am concerned about this propaganda because the propaganda has been carried out on the basis that the war heroes, the soldiers who fought the war would be made to suffer, if this law was implemented. Now, I would think, Sir, that this is absurd because if one reads the law, one can find out that there is no question of soldiers being in anyway jeopardized or endangered as a result of the law being implemented. The law is intended to ascertain information which will give some relief to families of the missing persons.

Furthermore, Sir, we are concerned about the genuineness of these concerns for soldiers and war heroes. We all know the way Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, he was then General Sarath Fonseka, the way he was treated after the war came to an end and after the Presidential Election in 2010. We all saw him in prisoners clothes. He was described by the former Government as the best Army Commander in the world who brought the war to a satisfactory conclusion.

But after he contested the Presidential Election in 2010, he was taken to prison on some very flimsy charges and we saw the way he was treated. After all there was no person who was more famous as the result of the war than General Sarath Fonseka, who is Field Marshal now. But he was taken into custody. He was humiliated. He was insulted. We all saw that. These are the very persons who now claim that war heroes will be affected if the law on missing persons is implemented. So, I do not think, Sir, the Government should pay any heed to these statements that have been made by some persons in order to create tension in the country, arouse communal passion amongst Sinhala people and create a situation where the people will not be united, but will continue to be divided. I think, Sir, we should be very clear about that matter.

A large number of soldiers fought the war. They carried out the instructions of their Government. They were engaged in a war against armed combatants. Nobody can convict those persons of any crime. They were carrying out duties entrusted to them by the State in keeping with the instructions of the State. But there were

others, innocent unarmed civilians who were taken into custody. There were others who were taken into custody, unarmed combatants, some of whom have been molested and in fact even raped and some of whom have disappeared. We saw on Channel 4 some of the terrible things that have happened to some of the persons who were taken into custody, both males and females. There is enough evidence on Channel 4 to really see what could have happened. Those are the persons who will have to face investigations and some charges, if this matter is proceeded with. But the implementation of the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Act cannot bring that about right now and I do not think criticism against that law on the basis that these persons would be affected should influence the Government in any way in delaying its implementation of this law. Therefore, I would urge the Government, Sir, we ask that the list be published of persons who were in custody when the present Government took over office and the list of persons who are presently in custody because we want the families of missing persons to be given this information.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .. 7.30 .

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I am finishing up, Sir.

The families of missing persons say that some of these persons were held in custody in secret camps. We want that also to be dealt with by these persons being enabled to go to these camps and see for themselves the true position.

I think, Sir, now the necessary gazette notification has been made in regard to this law being brought into effect without delay. That should be implemented and that law should come into force. The seven persons who will constitute the Office of Missing Persons must be appointed without delay and they must commence the various steps that they can take under that law including investigations, providing reparation, providing compensation, giving information to the people in regard to what happened to their kith and kin. I think, Sir, that this must be done without any delay. This is a humanitarian problem where the families of missing persons want to know what happened to their kith and kin, their dear ones. I think the Government has a serious responsibility to make such information available and I would urge the Government to act expeditiously in regard to this matter.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) ! .

[7.15 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and would like to say a few words with regard to operationalizing this Act.

It is a matter of regret that it took almost one year for His Excellency the President even to list it under a particular Ministry. An Act such as the one that we are discussing now, which all of us are convinced will bring about some kind of solace to the relatives of the missing persons. The Government should have acted faster. It was bold enough to bring in the Bill and pass it amidst much din in this House, but then, was reluctant to make the first Gazette Notification for so long without any reason. The reason given was flimsy, that there was a small amendment that was required. Amendments can be brought to laws at any time and that is no reason why the Act should not have been operationalized.

Secondly, even operationalizing has not still taken place, because the Hon. Minister must give a date on which the Act comes into operation and that has not happened as yet. There is no necessity to delay this any further.

Thirdly, as I said on an earlier occasion, the Constitutional Council must act swiftly and appoint the seven commissioners who will then be able to give effect to this law. The Government obviously must allocate sufficient funds for the functioning of this office, because, as was stated by the proponent of the Motion, this is an investigative exercise to find out what happened to the persons who is said to be missing.

As the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said, it is a further matter of regret that the former President, who was at the forefront of the struggle of the mothers in 1988, 1989 and 1990, who went to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and championed the cause of Sinhala mothers on the case of their sons going missing, is misleading the country today and opposing this mechanism falsely stating that this will endanger the country and falsely stating that this Act is in contravention of the Constitution and so on. When the Bill was taken up for debate and when there was much disturbance in the Well of the House, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara was here singing songs. I told him that he along with the former President Rajapaksa were the two who fought the case of the Sinhalese youth at that time and if he was behaving like this, he is showing himself up to be a racist. That is what the former President is also

doing now. If he could do that at that time, now he turns 180 degrees and says the opposite when most who are affected are Tamil youth, then, he is nothing but a racist.

The Government that took the right step in the direction of reconciliation of transitional justice must move forward without being reluctant, without taking two steps back after taking one forward and act decisively, so that people will have confidence. But this is a matter of regret again. The persons who were eagerly awaiting this office to become functional are now losing hope because of the reluctance of the Government. This is the correct mechanism, not the commissions before which they went and gave evidence. This is an investigative mechanism that will somehow go into each case and try to find out what happened to the persons who went missing. So, this must be given the highest priority and I hope the Hon. State Minister of Defence, who is here to reply, will give that assurance on behalf of the Government today.

Thank you.

[7.25 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene - State Minister of Defence) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has requested that we submit the names of all persons who were in custody at the time the present Government assumed duty, as well as the names of persons now held in custody, and the places in which they are now held in custody. At this moment, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I would like to table* these two documents which gives the names of all persons who were in custody at the time this Government came in, where they were held, the number of people, the names, the date of arrest, case numbers and the court name and the remand prison in which they are now held in custody. I would like to table that so that the Opposition Members can see the names. We are more than ready to publicize these names as well.

Of course, the third question is whether there are secret detention camps. I would like to assure you that we have no secret detention camps. The three Forces do not have any political prisoners or any prisoners from the war. Everything is very open; anyone can come and have a look at. If they suspect that there are places like that, they are more than welcome to come, speak to the authorities and go and inspect those places and see whether there are secret detention centres in these camps.

As for the reconciliation process, Hon. Members, I know that there has been a slow progress. But, I assure you that this Government is steadfast in seeing this reconciliation process through. What we want is, this country to heal its wounds; we want this country to prosper. Not only the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers, every single person living in this country has to feel safe in this country and they have to have the feeling that they are included; they are Sri Lankans and they have the opportunities that everyone else has. So,

we - our President, the Prime Minister and the Government- have always promised that we will see this reconciliation process through and that promise is not something that we are going to break.

In fact, on the question of missing persons, I also had the opportunity to go and meet some of the family members of missing persons. We had the opportunity to bring some of the family members to Colombo and we had a meeting with the Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and with the IGP where they raised their concerns with them. Of course, they had the opportunity to meet the President as well. So, we do take their issues very seriously and I know that it is not an easy thing for a family member to keep wondering as to what happened to their loved ones. I think, finally, the President has now signed the Gazette and we have the Office on Missing Persons which will now start its activities soon. Through that, a lot of people will finally find solutions for their problems.

In fact, the former President as well as the Joint Opposition have been trying to demonize this Office on Missing Persons saying it is bad for the country, it is unconstitutional and it will be taken as a tool to go after the security personnel of the three Forces.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. State Minister, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) I have to say that these are all untruths. I think, with the setting up of Office on Missing Persons, not only the people of the North, even the people in the South, the families of the armed forces can finally find out what has happened to their family members who are missing in action, who are believed to have been taken by the LTTE. So, there is nothing to demonize. This is good for the country to heal its wounds. I reassure you that we are totally committed to the reconciliation process, and we want to see this through.

Thank you.
