( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, there are so many subjects which are related and unrelated to this. So, please listen to what I have to say. The Hon. Member has his right to present whatever view he has. As you just announced, I am recognized as a Leader of a group. So, give me a chance at least.

I name the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, MP. Hon. Leader of the House to move the Motion. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Mr. Speaker, before that, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please!

There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, with all respect to the Chair, I have to point out certain conventions in this House. When the Chair orders a Member to withdraw from the House, that persisting Order, if it is not carried out after you have asked the police to come into the Chamber and remove the Member, that affects the entire dignity of the House. What I say is, I have all the respect for the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena in the first place, but, if he was not willing to leave, he has to be removed from the House. But, subsequently, for you to rescind the Order, I do not see any precedence for that. That is up to you.

195 196

2017 08

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I totally disagree that the original Order is ineffective. The Serjeant-at-Arms and his two assistants came; the police came. There would have been a big brawl in the House. In order to avoid that situation, Sir, we suggested that you name the Hon. Member, which you have done. Accordingly, I move,

"That the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, MP be suspended from the service of Parliament for one week." . ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera - Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy)

. Seconded.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Motion is before the House: that the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Member of Parliament, be suspended from the service of Parliament for one week.

Question put. THE HON. SPEAKER, having collected the Voices, declared that the Ayes" had it.

( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) Divide, by name!

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Special Assignment) Hon. Speaker, now the Motion is before the House. So, the Opposition is perfectly entitled to ask for a Division by name.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is all right. We are allowing that.

Order, please! The Division will be by name.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Prime Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) As the Hon. Member said, Thirukoneswaram is one of the sacred Ishwaram temples in this country and it has been there for a very long time. It shows the fact that Trincomalee or Gokanna, as it was called, was an ancient port even prior to the time of the Lord Buddha. Most probably, both these sacred sites and Thiriyaya are supposed to have been places where the traders brought in their goods. Thiriyaya enabled them to come all the way down to Horowpathana and go to Anuradhagama. This is a sacred place of worship for the Hindus destroyed by the Portuguese. I have asked the Minister of Hindu Religious Affairs to go into this issue and see the possibility of declaring Thirukoneswaram one of the sacred sites.

) , ? ) 2016 , , . , ? , ? , ? , ? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we have to ascertain the actual number of persons who have disappeared and what has happened to them. As I told this House earlier, the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill was passed by Parliament to ascertain who are the missing people. Prior to that Debate, we had agreed with the JVP that some of their amendments would be accepted. Unfortunately, during the Committee Stage, we had missed some of the amendments. So, those amendments have been added on and the amendments to the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Act have been gazetted. So, we will bring the amendments before the House; have those passed and then, we can start operating the Office on the Missing Persons.

217 218

As far as the detainees are concerned, I think we have less than 100 - about 84 or so. I think all of them have been charged under the law and tried in courts. There is no one else in detention; they have been released. What I said at that time was that a lot of people are missing and that we have to presume that many of them are not among the living. What I mentioned in the House does not contradict it. What I told the House was that we will have to ascertain who are not here and who have left the country illegally. There may be some who have left the country illegally. So, once we ascertain who are not in the country and who have left the country illegally, then we could find out whether they are abroad. Otherwise, we have to presume that they are all missing and not among the living. So, that is all I said and it is not, in any way, a contradiction because even now, people are leaving the country.

The other day a number of people were detected going towards Australia and again, according to the information we got from the authorities, they were people from the North. Many people try to escape from the country and become refugees in other countries, some of them for economic reasons. Now that we know the number of persons being held in custody because of cases, once the Office on Missing Persons starts functioning, we could start ascertaining what the actual numbers of missing persons are.

( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) , . , . , . . . , . , . , ?

, . , , , . , . ? .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I can understand the Hon. Members wanting to know what has happened to those who supposed to have surrendered. So, these are all matters that have to be formally ascertained through a formal process. As far as the court case in Mullaitivu is concerned, I do not know what the final orders that had been given by the court are. But, the court can ask for any evidence that needs to be produced. We are also aware that people are trying to find out what has happened to their loved ones. There have been some agitations going on and the Government is doing its best to try and resolve this question.

( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) , : . 2015 .. . , 18 . , . , .. . , , ? .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We will inquire into it. What has happened, as I told the House earlier, is that before the Debate, we agreed with the JVP on some amendments and we had missed some of those. So, those are the amendments that have been gazetted now and we will bring those to Parliament. I hope you could pass it without debate. Then, the whole Act can become operational with the final amendments of the JVP. I think both the TNA and the JVP voted for the Bill and also the JVPs amendments were agreed on by the Government and the TNA, but some of those had been missed. So, they wanted those added. I think there was a major policy issue in defining or excluding certain funds from being used by the Office. So, those amendments will be made; the Bill has been gazetted. We can pass it somewhere in April. It should be possible for us to pass the Bill without delay, if the House agrees to pass it without debate. I do not think there is anything to debate in that. The Hon. Members have agreed; you all have also agreed. Then, we can pass the Bill without debate. - [Interruption.] Yes, you also voted.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Actually, we are not treating this as a political question; it is a humane question. As I said when I answered the original Question raised by the Hon. Member, we understand the sufferings of the people

whose relatives - maybe children, maybe husband, maybe wife or maybe parents - are missing; we know the sufferings they are going through. I have met them and I met some of them even recently. Then, there are others who are waiting for their lands to be returned. So, gradually, we are moving forward. First, we had to pass the law and the agreement of Parliament was that we would accept the amendments from the Opposition, but we missed some. So, that is all that we would try to bring in.

We are not treating these, as I told you, as political issues. Now, we are also working on a Truth and Reconciliation Commission apart from the Office on Missing Persons. So, all that will come into being. First, we will have to identify the people who are missing and then, from there, to work out the next steps that we have to take because a large number of people are moving both from Jaffna into the Vanni and from the Vanni into Jaffna. The Hon. Member represents one of the most affected areas. So, I can understand the pressure on him. We also feel the pressure. We also note the fact that they did altogether vote for the common candidate at the Presidential Election. We ourselves are committed to finding a solution for this problem and bringing the sufferings of these relations to an end. I would like to assure the Hon. Member and the House of that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, I think you have already asked the three Supplementary Questions.

( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) , . , , ? .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Your Question is very clear.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We are inquiring into the question of persons who are missing. Let us see what happens from there. The Office must first say that people are missing. Then, you have to look at how they went missing and why they are missing. Then, issues will arise out of that. The procedure is laid out in the Act itself.

221 222

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) And, plus the ones who have surrendered.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) And the ones who have surrendered. That is the issue that they have. So whatever evidence they have - but we are not going to start an investigation just because some - what the President said is that there is no total investigation into the military. But, whatever is necessary under the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Act will have to be followed. That is all. We will also bring the law on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Both are needed.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) ...

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I allowed you four times. ,-

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You go ahead, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) , ; . , . , . . . , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) It is a very serious question that he is asking. The Hon. Prime Minister will -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Act has provided for the procedure. There are inquiries and if any person has to be called upon to make a statement, we will do so. That person maybe a civilian, that person maybe from the security forces or that person maybe from outside. Those statements have to be given under this.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) What he says is-

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) It is not the military as a body, or the security forces as a body or any other organization as a body. It is a question of an inquiry in which certain individuals will be required to make statements on which they can determine what has happened. As the Hon. Member says there were people who have surrendered. So, when an inquiry goes on, all the necessary people will have to make statements.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The clarification the Hon. Member wants is, they surrendered to the Army and if the Army personnel are responsible for it, are we going to question them? We are questioning -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) All of them will have to make statements. As the Hon. Member said, there is some inquiry going on in the Mullaitivu Courts.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Correct.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Then, there are five cases in Trincomalee, there are some other cases in Mannar. All those are being investigated by the courts. In some of them, military personnel or security forces have been called upon to give evidence. We do not target on an organization or establishment. Where it is necessary that someone has to make a statement, he will make a statement. We have no problem.

223 224

2017 08

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) There is no restriction on questioning army personnel if they have to.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The law is very clear. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Exactly. Alright, thank you.

[6.11 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana )

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am so delighted to participate in the Second Reading of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Development Bill.

In September, 2015, at a historic United Nations Summit held in New York aptly titled Transforming Our World: 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", the world leaders including our President, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, adopted and ratified a Declaration to bring into force 17 Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs by 2030. Over the next 15 years, it is expected that these Goals would build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals or MDGs and would further aim towards eradicating all forms of poverty and address a range of social needs including education, health, social protection and job opportunities while tackling climate change and environmental protection. The Sustainable Development Goals are uniquely different to the Millennium Development Goals because SDGs promote an inclusive call for action amongst all - rich, middle-income and poor - countries to work together hand-in-hand to promote prosperity and to protect our planet.

Sir, for sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to harmonize three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. These elements are interconnected and crucial for the well-being of individuals and societies.

Sir, we live in a very precarious position in the global context, which, if not managed properly and effectively, could lead towards a worldwide meltdown of resources, economies and more importantly, our home, the Planet Earth. When taking into consideration the rapid industrialization in countries, the exponential growth of world economies and the globalization fuelled through continuous advancement in connectivity, it is imperative that there is an inclusive agenda amongst all nations, irrespective of their own growth agendas, to cooperate together to build a sustainable global village which is capable of meeting the needs of tomorrow in an environment that is conserved and protected without the calamities created by the tyranny of poverty.

The fundamental aspect of this Agenda is to ensure that eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest

271 272

2017 08

global challenge and the indispensable requirement for sustainable development. To allow for this, there must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems. Further, building natural avenues for alleviating poverty through environmental-friendly mechanisms is vital towards building a sustainable environment for our progenies.

Sir, when taking into account the sheer impact of the results of human intervention creating climate change, the deplorable condition of our planet and the rising tides due to global warming, it is absolutely imperative that change must start now. Climate change is already impacting on public health, food and water security, migration, peace and security. Further, if climate change is left unchecked, it will effectively neutralize the development gains even Sri Lanka, let alone the world, has made over the last decade and it will make further gains impossible.

The escalating levels of carbon emissions into our atmosphere from developed countries, the ongoing deforestation even in our country, the rising tides and erosions occurring in Sri Lanka and most evident in one of our close neighbours, the Maldives, are all absolute evident examples of climate change and the cause and effect mechanism that is eating away into our home, Mother Earth.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, at this juncture, it is important to note that the Sustainable Development Goals are emulated by five Ps : People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership.

People represent the stakeholders, the basic units of our society, whom have to be determined to end poverty and hunger, in all their forms and dimensions, and to ensure that all human beings can fulfil their potential in dignity and equality in a healthy environment.

The next one, Planet represents our home, which we should be determined to protect from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations.

The third one, Prosperity in which we are determined to ensure that all human beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and that economic, social and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature.

Then, Peace, in which we are determined to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.

And finally, Partnership. Where are we today? This Debate and the Vote later on, on the Sri Lanka

Sustainable Development Bill is representative towards our countrys commitment towards actualizing these Sustainable Development Goals. As a nation, and in its highest law-making body, we are responsible to the citizens of the world through the ownership, creation, implementation and success of a national framework towards our own sustainable development policies, plans and programmes akin to Sri Lanka. This, in turn, will allow our country to utilize the Sustainable Development Goals as a compass for aligning ourselves and our future plans with global commitments.

We have to safeguard our planet and its populace, develop knowledge-based economies, and eradicate hunger and poverty in keeping with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Sir, Sri Lanka can help transform the world.

Thank you. [.. 6.10]

ADJOURNMENT

( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka) , " " .

. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Adjournment Motion is to be moved by the the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan.

RELEASE OF LANDS OCCUPIED BY SECURITY FORCES TO

ORIGINAL OCCUPANTS

[6.26 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move the following Adjournment Motion before I make submissions on it:

Whereas large swathes of lands belonging to private citizens were occupied by the armed forces when fighting came to an end in May 2009:

Most of these lands were taken over from civilians for security purposes. For instance, civilians were evicted from several thousands of acres of land in Valikamam North in order to protect the Palaly air base from artillery fire almost 25 years ago. But even after the fighting ended in 2009, only a fraction of that has been returned for civilian resettlement, while large tracts of land are still occupied by the military which is engaged in farming and trade including running tourist hotels while the original occupants languish in welfare centres and with host families.

In the Vanni too, still several thousands of acres of land are occupied by security forces. Although some lands were released in Keppapulavu recently by the Air Force, more lands are still occupied by the Army.

The people have been staging agitations in front of these lands urging the Government to let them re-occupy their land. This was a promise given to the people by President Maithripala Sirisena before the Presidential Election in January, 2015. People have patiently waited for over two years and now are justifiably demanding that the Government keep to its promise and release these lands.

We urge the Government to take very early action in regard to this matter and release all land that is occupied by the security forces, in

which civilians lived prior to hostilities breaking out and that such lands be returned to the original inhabitants without any further delay.

In fact with regard to this matter I have written to the President, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena on the 3rd of March. That pertained really to the land in Valikamam North in the Jaffna District and the land in Keppapulavu in the Mullaitivu District. I will not read out this letter, but I table* it, and may I request that you kindly direct that this letter be included at the end of my speech.

I will now, Sir, make some comments on this question of lands in the Northern Province and the attitude of the civilian population to the question of these lands that we see through the various protests and demonstrations that are going on continuously for several weeks in several places. The people are protesting because they want to return to their lands, they want to live on their lands and they want to engage in farming activity on their lands. These demonstrations and protests have been held in support of the people who are protesting in the Northern Province by persons living in other parts of the country, in other places. In fact, some people including Buddhist monks have gone and joined the people protesting in the Northern Province and they have expressed their disapproval to this land being continuously held by the armed forces. Demonstrations have been held for instance in the Kattankudy Mosque in the Batticaloa District by persons who have been demanding that these lands be released to the persons in the North who are entitled to such lands. Demonstrations have been held in other parts of the country in support of these demands. This clearly shows that the people are of the view that the demand made by the people in the Northern Province is a just demand and that these lands must be returned to the people to whom these lands are due. Sinhalese people and Muslim people have been taking part in protests in support of this demand for the return of the lands by the people in the Northern Province.

I wish to thank the people, particularly the people from outside the Northern Province, the Sinhalese people and the Muslim people who have also been staging protests in support of this very legitimate demand.

Sir, I want to pose a question as to whether such a situation can prevail in the Southern part of this country. Can the lands of the civilian population be held by the armed forces or by the Government in this way? Will it be tolerated? Will the other political forces permit that to happen? Will they not intervene and ensure that the lands are returned to the people if such lands were held by the armed forces or the Government in the South?

What does this demonstrate? It clearly demonstrates that the Tamil people lack power and authority in their hands to be able to take action in regard to these matters. That is why, Sir, the people are inflicting pain on themselves by fasting, by sitting in the open by day and

277 278

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

night in the blazing sun and without being deterred by the dew or the rain with their families, with their children and even infants. They are protesting, they are demonstrating and inflicting pain upon themselves because they want the world to realize the injustice that is being done to them. This situation, Sir, cannot continue. It must come to an end.

Continued occupation of these lands owned or possessed by civilian population before they were dispossessed in a situation of war, despite the war having come to an end several years ago, is illegal and there is a clear denial of the legal entitlements of these people to these lands. It is a gross violation of their fundamental and human rights. Army may remain in certain limited extents of land which are clearly identified on the grounds of national security, but they certainly cannot use these lands for cultivation, to grow vegetables, fruits, other crops, run luxury hotels and restaurants, engage in commercial activities on these lands or use them for their leisure, for golf courses or for their residence. That would be a blatant violation of the fundamental and human rights of these people and I do not think, Sir, that situation can continue.

In fact, the UN Human Rights Council Resolution that was adopted in October, 2015 states, I quote:

Taking note of the review of the high-security zones undertaken by the Government, and welcoming the initial steps taken to return lands to its rightful civilian owners and to help local populations to resume livelihoods and to restore normality to civilian life,

That is stated in the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council. It goes on further and states in paragraph No. 10, I quote:

Also welcomes the initial steps taken to return land, and encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to accelerate the return of land to its rightful civilian owners, and to undertake further efforts to tackle the considerable work that lies ahead in the areas of land use and ownership, in particular the ending of military involvement in civilian activities, the resumption of livelihoods and the restoration of normality to civilian life, and stresses the importance of the full participation of local populations, including representatives of civil society and minorities, in these efforts;

This is what was stated even in the UN Human Rights Council Resolution adopted in October, 2015, one and a half years ago. They urged the return of land to enable the civilian life to return to normality. We are sorry to say that has not happened.

Might I read, Sir, from what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in the statement he made in February, 2017 at the UN Human Rights Council. I refer to the paragraph Nos. 48 and 49 of the statement of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

He says in Paragraph 48, I quote:

The restitution of land held by the military is still an unfulfilled confidence-building measure. Although significant areas of land have been released (according to government figures, an additional 2,625 acres of private land and 9,288 acres of State land have been released since October 2015), a mapping of both private and public land under the control of the military, and a release plan with clear benchmarks and timelines, have yet to be presented to the public.

He goes on to state in Paragraph 49, I quote:

Progress in the resettlement of internally displaced persons, despite the support received from donors and international organizations, has been slow. This is partially due to a failure to release land. On 16th August 2016, the Cabinet approved a rights-based and comprehensive national policy on durable solutions for conflict-affected displacement; challenges to its implementation persist, however, given that key obstacles, including land disputes relating to State occupation or secondary occupation, need to be addressed. Frustration in the affected communities has grown owing to the continued engagement of the military in civilian commercial activities.

Even the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sir, in the statement he made last month at the Human Rights Council, has referred to the problems that arise as a result of the military-holding land to an extent totally unwarranted and to the activities of the military resulting in the people not being able to return to their lands and people not being resettled on their lands. So, this is a matter that even the High Commissioner for Human Rights has thought it fit to refer to in his statement.

Sir, Hon. Minister Mangala Samaraweera, in the statement he made at the Human Rights Council on the 28th of February, 2017, has also referred to this matter. He says that in regard to State lands, 5,519.98 acres and 1,383.51 acres, totaling to 6,903.49 acres have been released. In regard to private lands, he says that 2,090.03 acres and 30.54 acres, totaling to 2,120.57 acres have been released. I see a contradiction between the figures given by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the figures given by Hon. Minister Mangala Samaraweera. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has apparently been informed that 9,288 acres of State land have been returned. But, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweeras statement goes on the basis that only 6,903.49 acres have been released; a difference of nearly 3,000 acres. In regard to private land, there is again a discrepancy. According to the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2,625 acres have been released. But, according to the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Foreign Affairs, only 2,120.57 acres have been released.

This discrepancy, Sir, and contradictions of this nature can only be addressed when there are plans in regard to both public land and private land under the control of the military for their release, with their proper extents being accurately identified and with clear benchmarks and timelines that are presented to the public and when with the cooperation of the public, this activity is pursued. So, I will submit, Sir, that there is a discrepancy, a contradiction, between what the Hon. Foreign Minister says and what has been stated by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the course of his statement.

Now, I have done some work on this matter. I have inquired from people who are knowledgeable, who can give accurate information and the information I want to place on record now is something which cannot be contradicted. In the Jaffna District, in Valikamam North, 4,500 acres of private land are yet to be released, largely in Tellippalai area. In other areas in the Jaffna District, 750 acres of private land are yet to be released; 5,250 acres of private land are yet to be released in the Jaffna; all of which is private land.

In Mullaitivu, Sir, 1,080 acres of state land have yet to be released; in Maritimepattu, 166.25 acres; in Puthukudiyiruppu, 371 acres; in Odduchuddan 108 acres; in Thunukkai, 425 acres where some part of it is forest; in Manthai East, 10 acres. In all, in Mullaitivu District, 1,080 acres of state land from which people were dispossessed have yet to be returned to the people. Beyond that, in Mulliativu District, 773 acres of private land are yet to be released. In Maritimepattu, 708 acres; in Odduchudan, 45 acres; in Manthai East, 20 acres. That is private land and state land in Mullaitivu.

Beyond that, the navy - the figures I gave early are lands in the occupation of the army- holds 404 acres of private land in the Maritimepattu Divisional Secretary's Division in Vattuvakal; police holds 22.5 acres of private land in Maritimepattu, Odduchuddan and Thunukkai. Those are the figures of the state land and private land held by the army, the navy and the police in the Mullaitivu District.

In the Kilinochchi District, Sir, 400 acres of land are yet to be released, both state land and private land, in Kandavalai, 163 acres; in Poonakary, 101 acres; in Karachchi 79 land acres and in Palai, 71 acres. I have given you the extents of state land and private land that are being unjustifiably held by the army, the navy and the police in Jaffna District, in Mullaitivu District and in Kilinochchi District.

Beyond that, there are lands being held by the armed forces in Mannar and Vavuniya. These figures are available. So, you can see from the figures that there are large amounts of lands, private lands owned by people for generations and centuries on deeds and State lands alienated to the people under the Land Development Ordinance on Land Development Permits that are being held by the armed forces - the army and the navy and the police - in all these districts in the Northern Province.

It is eight years since the war came to an end, and as I have stated in my Motion earlier, there can be no justification whatever for the non-return of these lands. These lands must be returned to the rightful owners. That is their fundamental right; that is their human right. You are violating their fundamental right and their human right. Then, holding on to these lands, you are carrying on business on these lands; you are carrying on farming on these lands; you are living on these lands. Lands are being used for your leisure while the people who own

those lands are living in welfare centres or with host families. How can you justify this? Is it acceptable? It is certainly not acceptable, Sir, and this must come to an end.

I am raising this question in Parliament today in regard to two particular matters, Valikamam North in Jaffna and Keppapalavu in Mullaitivu. I wrote to the President and I am thankful to the President. When the lands in Keppapulavu were not released by the air force and the lands in Puthukudiyiruppu were not released by the army, and in regard to the Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalaya land, when I met him with two of my Colleagues, Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran and Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan, the President was immediately willing to act, and in our presence, telephoned both the Army Commander and the Air Force Commander and directed that those lands be released in a day or two, which had been done, and I am thankful to him for that. The people of those areas are thankful that those actions have been taken. But, I want the Government to formulate a policy in regard to land which has not been released in the Northern Province in all the districts, in Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi. I have given the figures and the figures are correct. In Mannar and Vavuniya, there must be a plan; there must be accurate information made available to the public in regard to the extent of land, the location of the land and the plan must state when the land will be released. This is not a matter in regard of which there can be any further delay.

This matter was referred to in the UN Human Rights Council Resolution passed in 2015, the matter has been referred to by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the statement he has made now in 2017, one-and-a-half years later. There is a contradiction between the figures given by the Foreign Minister, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, and the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Therefore, Sir, the position seems uncertain; the position seems confused. This situation cannot continue and these lands must be released. We cannot wait for another further two years. The Sri Lankan Government has publicly announced that they are going to make a request to the UN Human Rights Council that they be granted further time to implement the Resolution adopted in 2015. Whether they will be given time or not, I do not know, but our people certainly cannot wait; our people cannot languish in welfare centres and live with host families at their mercy. They must get back to their own lands; they must be able to reside on their lands; they must be able to rebuild their houses on their lands and they must be able to carry on farming activities in their lands.

I raised this question Sir, because our people have come to the very end of their frustration. Today, in the blazing sun, in the rain when it is raining and in the night when there is dew, they are protesting with their families. Their wives, their children, their infants are all joining in the protest and it is unbearable. This situation cannot continue. It must be brought to an end and we want the Government to realize and take very early action to bring this situation to an end. I thank you, Sir.

[7.12 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene - State Minister of Defence) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, first of all, I would like to thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for bringing this Adjournment Motion. In his speech, he mentioned that all the lands that are to be released should be released and also referred to the hardships felt by the people in the North and the East.

I think it is also important that we tell this House what the Forces have done since the end of the war to release these lands. In 2009 when the war ended, the total extent of land that was held by the three Forces in the North and the East was 82,555 acres. Out of that, 52,226 acres were State land and 30,329 acres were private land. If we take the total extent of land that has been released from 2009 up to now, the extent of State land is 54,712.87 acres and the extent of private land is 24,328.5 acres. So, there is a total of 79,041.37 acres that have been released by the three forces from 2009 up to now. I think right now, in Jaffna alone, there are 5,299 acres that are being held by the military and out of that, some are around the Palaly Cantonment, which is under scrutiny at the moment. Even that, from 2009, there were 11,630 acres -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, your calculations seem to be a little bit wrong. You are saying that the lands that had been held were 82,000 acres in total and out of that, 79,000 acres have been released.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That would leave only 3,000 acres as the extent that is still being held. In the next breath, you are saying that in Jaffna alone, 5,000 acres are being held. How can that be?

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) All that is private land. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, that is not the issue. Your calculation is wrong; even from what you are saying, it is wrong. You say that the extent held by the forces was 82,000 acres in total and 79,000 acres have been released. That leaves only 3,000 acres to be released. Your next sentence is, 5,000 acres are being held in Jaffna alone. So, there is something wrong with your figures.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) I understand that. I will forward this document to you, Hon. Member and you can have a look at it. These statistics have been given to me by the Ministry. But, I know that within this Government, we have released over 30,000 acres throughout these last two years and we will, obviously in the future, release more land and give it to people of the North and the East. That is a promise that President Maithripala Sirisena as well as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has given to the people of the North and the East.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Both the President and the Prime Minister are looking into the release of these lands. We know that. When we talk to them, both the President and the Prime Minister are very promising. But, things are not happening on the ground. We want those to happen, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) Of course. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Kindly understand the plight of our people. How long can our people suffer?

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) I totally understand, Hon. Member. But, we also have issues. When we do release the land, we also have to think about deployment of soldiers from that area. We have to look for other land and to construct quarters for them to live in. So, there are issues for us as well when we do release these lands. But, it is not that we do not want to. We have been cooperating with the TNA and throughout these last two years, we have done a significant amount of work on the release of land and we will do more.

289 290

Even with regard to the Keppapulavu issue - I remember, we spoke about that issue in Parliament - we said, This can be sorted out. As you said, Hon. Member, the President himself got involved and said, Yes, release the land and they did. So, these issues can be resolved, but those will take a little bit of time. I know the frustration the people in the North are feeling; I know the frustration that the people in the East are feeling. We do want to settle this as we are committed to the reconciliation process.

But at the same time, we do not want to compromise on the national security, as you said. And certain lands, we cannot compromise on. They could be State lands or private lands but, when it comes to national security, those lands cannot be compromised. But, we are willing to compensate for those lands and we have been straight forward on that. If it is a private land, we will definitely compensate the people who own that land. There is absolutely no hindrance in that way. As a Government, we are committed. I know it is taking a long time, however, slowly but surely we are going forward.

There is a mix-up in the statistics. Hon. Sumanthiran, I will forward this to you. You can take a look at it, and maybe if there are mistakes in the statistics, you can tell me where it is.

Hon. Leader of the Opposition, we will certainly look into this matter. There is no compromise on this issue when it comes to the President, the Prime Minister or this Government. I know it is taking a bit of time, but we do not want to block this in any way or keep the people out of their lands in the North or the East. We will do whatever we can to accommodate the request of the people in those areas.

Thank you.

[7.19 p.m.] .. ( , , ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) I must thank the Hon. Sampanthan, Leader of the Opposition, for raising this issue. I also thank the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene for giving an assurance that the armed forces will consider this request.

This is a burning issue in the North and I totally agree with the Hon. Sampanthan. I have taken up this matter on numerous occasions, even with His Excellency. On Keppapulavu lands, I spoke to him before the Cabinet Meeting on the 14th. I personally met him and he took the

liberty of speaking to the Army Commander. Subsequently, the Hon. Sampanthan also had met him. The Army Commander told me that by the 28th of February he will release the lands that he could. I spoke to the Army Commander a few days ago. I asked him about the lands that have been occupied by him where commercial establishments are being run. He assured me that along the A9 Road all commercial establishments occupied by the army have been released. This is on the A9 Road.

But, as the Hon. Sampanthan said, there are certain other lands that had been held there. I totally agree with him. These are matters which I have taken up personally with the armed forces, but, as the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene correctly said, compromising of the State security is also another question. When I spoke to the Army Commander three days ago, he said that he was making all arrangements even to change the Army cantonments. I do not know how far that is correct, I cannot rebut that positon - the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene, the State Minister of Defence is here - and this is what he mentioned to me. Genuinely, the Army Commander is also cooperating with us. I must say, Lieutenant General Crishantha De Silva has been very cooperative and he has done his best and very closely working towards the end of it. When I asked him what will be the date, - as the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan said, we cannot allow this to go on for years and years; we cannot allow this to go on for another two years, - he could not assure me, to be frank, a date on which all these other lands may be considered to be given. But, he said that he would take all the necessary steps that should be taken under the direction of His Excellency the President as well as the Hon. Prime Minister to see that these lands are released to the people.

It is a very burning question and I totally agree with the Hon. Sampanthan and also the TNA, because, they have a responsibility towards the people. We too have a responsibility towards the people; I, as a Tamil as well as a Government Minister - we have to take the responsibility. I also endeavour my best in my own way to consider these issues and I am in touch with the relevant Forces. As regards Hon. Sampanthan's question, I hope and trust that very soon these lands will be given to satisfy the Northern and the Eastern people.

Thank you very much. , . . Question put, and agreed to. . . 7.22 , 2016 08 , 2017 09 . . 10.30 .
