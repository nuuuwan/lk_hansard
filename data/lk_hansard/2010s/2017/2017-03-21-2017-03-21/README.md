Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Member spoke in English. So, I will explain in English. We have agreed to the proposal which praises us. The Resolution states, notes with appreciation the proposal of the Government of Sri Lanka to establish a judicial mechanism. Now, we cannot establish a judicial mechanism. We can only do it under the law. We cannot do it contrary to the Constitution because we have not got - I do not think we can even pass anything contrary to the Constitution. Our Parties are not agreed to it. According to the Constitution, all our judges have to be Sri Lankan judges swearing loyalty to our country. Now, the Hon. Member is trying to distort our Constitution. Within that, we are certainly willing to get the help of experts to come and help us as observers.

I would like to tell the Hon. Speaker that we never went before the Darusman Panel. -[Interruption.] We did not go to New York. We did not speak to them outside and - [Interruption.] They know that you went and had communications with the Darusman Panel and exchanged letters.

DRAWING PRIME MINISTERS SPECIAL ATTENTION TO AFFAIRS OF FINANCE MINISTRY:

STATEMENT BY HON. PRIME MINISTER

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The Treasury Bills are governed by the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance of 1937 and under Section 2 of that Ordinance, the Minister is empowered to issue registered stocks, promissory notes, Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bonds for the purpose of raising authorized loans according to any law in operation at that time. Under Section 4, the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance shall, in respect of each loan to be raised, specify by Order published in the Gazette, the amount of money to be raised, the modes of raising, the rates and all other details.

According to Section 5, it is only after the Order is gazetted that the Registrar can take steps to raise the loans. This procedure had been followed for some time. But it transpired in the Commission that it was not followed for some time. In fact, we have been raising loans but gazetting it at the end of the year. This has started from 1999.

For instance, I found that the loans that were authorized by the Hon. K.N. Choksy was gazetted by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama as Minister in a different Government. This is the procedure that has been going on for a long time. This is not very satisfactory. On the whole, the legislation is also not very satisfactory. It was done in 1939 and no one anticipated such things. Sometimes you can raise the amount you want or you can raise a lesser amount or you can raise a larger amount when the issue is taking place. That flexibility has to be there.

To come out of this, what we want to do is to bring in legislation. First, we will be following the procedure as in the Ordinance. But we will bring in new legislation. We have asked the Attorney-General to look at it and the Legal Draftsman to draft it. The new legislation will set up a new procedure where once the Minister takes a decision it will be advertised in the newspapers. The House is in charge of public finance and we can inform the House of those advertisements. We have to get the flexibility also of raising the amount specified, a lesser

611 612

[ ]

2017 21

amount or a higher amount. That is the flexibility that we want. So, we are doing that.

Then, in the legislation, we are bringing in provision for two other issues. One is to declare legal all the Treasury Bills that have been issued so far. Some people may challenge it by saying that we raised money before the gazette was issued and therefore it is not legal. The other issue is, private placements. We have also had private placement of Bonds.

When this Government came into power we made a public commitment not to have private placements but to have public auctions and to use some other transparent system. Nevertheless, private placements have taken place and it came out in the inquiries that there was no formal decision taken even on private placements. The question is, whether even a formal decision is sufficient. So, the same legislation will make all Bonds issued legal. Though they say all Bonds issued are valid in the hands of the bona fide holders, the problem may come that someone might challenge the Central Bank when we go to redeem the Bonds. Then, there will be another issue. So, we do not want a position like that to come up. These were issued in 2008 and in 2014. People might challenge and then the court will say that you cannot redeem the Bonds because they have not been legally issued.

Therefore, we will bring legislation which will ensure that legality is attached to all Bond issues including private placement, and legality is attached to all Treasury Bills that have been issued.

In the same process, I must say, the Minister of Finance has made a statement on this issue. When this Presidential Commission started its work, he had been asked by the media to clarify. He has done it. I will not speak at length on this because today we are debating the issue of debts. So, whatever you have to say on those statements can also be taken up and discussed during the Debate. I do not want to take any more time of the House, but I thought I would clarify the law and the measures we are taking. I must thank the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena for having raised the issue and giving me an opportunity of clarifying this to the House.

In the "Daily FT" of today, an article of one of the former Deputy Governors of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka appears. I would like to refer to some sections of it, because last December at the tail-end of the Finance Minister's speech, I said that the US interest rates are rising; that those will rise two to three times during the year and as a result what will happen. When the US interest rates rise, all the investments run back to the US. They are only interested in higher interest rates and their profits. That is what is happening to you all today. Here, the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank warns the Government that Sri Lanka is facing a very serious and deep crisis.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Your time is over, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . Sir, I would like to quote from the article of the former Deputy Governor appearing in the "Daily FT":

"However, in 2016, in two separate moves, the Banks monetary policy was tightened: In February, by increasing the standing deposit rate to 6.5% and standing lending rate to 8.0% and in July further to 7% and 8.5%, respectively. But these measures were too short and too late. It also prompted the visiting IMF mission to flag Sri Lanka that its Central Bank should stand ready to tighten monetary policy if the money and credit levels would begin to rise. This is exactly what has now happened. The monetary base is now rising at the rate of 27%, up from 16.5% a year ago."

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . , . , unprecedented monetary crisis . The former Deputy Governor further says, I quote:

".....the Central Banks lending to the government has skyrocketed recording an annual growth rate of 80% per annum. Meanwhile, the investments in government securities by foreigners have fallen from a peak of $ 3.5 billion in February 2015....."

That is, at the time of our handing over the Government.

"......to $ 1.2 billion as at the end of February, 2017. The freely available foreign reserves have fallen to a record low level of $ 4.7 billion as at the end of February, 2017 whereas the countrys debt repayment obligations during the next 12 month period have increased to $ 4.8 billion."

That means, the foreign reserves have fallen to US Dollars 4.7 billion and our debt obligation, which we have to pay is US Dollars 4.8 billion. How is the Government going to balance this? He also says in his article, I quote:

"Given this scenario, Sri Lanka cannot remain oblivious to the US monetary policy tightening. If Sri Lanka does not follow suit, the remaining foreign investments in government securities by foreigners amounting to $ 1.2 billion might also fly out of the country. That would be fatal to the Sri Lankas exchange rate."

There were problems due to the recession. It happened everywhere. In places like Thailand, the Baht went down to a negative value. So much so, everybody started going to Thailand to buy cheap goods. That happens. These things happen when foreign investors suddenly pull out their investments from your financial markets. These things have happened in the past; it may happen in the future. But we have to have sound fiscal policies. Our monetary policies have to be properly geared to meet this situation. That is what we are trying to do. In a while, I think, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama will explain to you that one of the biggest foreign investments is going to happen in a few days time in Sri Lanka. This is something you started - you borrowed heavily from the Chinese and built up massive infrastructure in Hambantota. I am sure the former Speaker is fully aware of this. He is very happy because this whole project is going to bring a lot of prosperity to his district.

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Special Assignment) It is a US Dollar two billion project. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) US Dollars two billion is going to be invested by the Chinese to improve not only the infrastructure but also the

already existing Port is going to have cranes and other extra equipment to the value of more than US Dollars 600 million. It is a good investment. -[Interruption.] No, what I am saying is you did not do this. You borrowed and left it for us to save the country. -[Interruption.] But in the meantime, you are organizing protests there. You are getting people to sit on the streets. Poor port workers are asked to sit on the road and start a massive protest.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa did not do that. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) He did not do that. Do not be opportunistic. What we are trying to do is to save this country from the mess you all put. -[Interruption.] Let us not argue about that. I have very limited time. Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, you had better speak during your time.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we were there with His Excellency the President last night. You were also there. We discussed these matters. This is a National Government. We had a variety of issues on the matter pertaining to the Hambantota Port. We discussed among ourselves and now we have decided to go ahead with the development programme of the Hambantota Port. That is going to bring in not only the development of the Port, but also an increase in the transshipment volumes which is almost at a zero percentage now, unless you do not divert the cargo that needs to come to Colombo towards Hambantota. That is what that has been done in the past. You sent the motor cars down there. Finally, the poor consumers had to pay more to get their cars cleared.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Rs. 35,000 per car. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But this is not going to happen in the future. We are not going to divert any traffic from Colombo. In Colombo, two terminals have already been privatized. There may be more terminals coming in Colombo. Hambantota will have one of the largest terminals which will have a very high throughput of containers coming in and landing there. So, that is going to create a paradigm shift in the way this country is going to go forward. Not only that, a massive industrial park is going to come. The Chinese have undertaken to shift some of their industries to Sri Lanka.

Now, look at our export basket. We have never diversified our export basket. From 1990, whatever exports we had remains the same today. Garments, tea, some agricultural exports - these are our traditional exports from 1990s onwards. It has never changed. We have to change that basket. So, our export basket has to

627 628

2017 21

change and we have to diversify it. Diversification cannot come unless some industrial nation comes and invest and then creates a value chain so that they will be able to produce components and other items for industrial output in this country. That will increase employment opportunities. This is going to create a massive infrastructure boom in the country.

Therefore, what I would say is that the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena has quite opportunistically tried to throw this brickbat at us at a time like this. But this is a time at which both the Opposition and the Government - [Interruption.]

Yes, definitely. The Hon. Hisbullah is very keen about the sewerage project in Kattankudi. Yes, we are going to go ahead with the sewerage project in Kattankudi. We will definitely implement that. Now, that is another issue.

I went to Trincomalee yesterday. There is an unfortunate dengue outbreak. I went to the Kinniya Hospital and saw what is happening there.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you are running out of time. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I will wind up. I want to thank our three forces and the police for having undertaken a massive cleanup operation in places like Kinniya and other areas of the Trincomalee Town. I was there at the Office of the Provincial Director of Health Services in the Trincomalee Town as well as in Kinniya this weekend to see what was happening regarding the dengue outbreak that has unfortunately claimed almost 16 lives in that area. I must thank the Minister of Health, Hon. Rajitha Senaratne, officials of his Ministry as well as other officials of the Provincial Department of Health Services of the Eastern Province, for setting up a High Dependency Unit in the Kinniya District Hospital. That is the second such Unit apart from that of the District General Hospital, Negombo. That High Dependency Unit has volunteers coming from all over the country. Several doctors from other hospitals have come to the Kinniya District Hospital to assist in the efforts to curb the escalating rate of dengue outbreak. There are almost 1,500 patients in that hospital. It is a small hospital in the middle of the town. In fact, the location of the hospital itself has created half the problem. There is a serious problem of sewerage; so gully bowsers have to be bought in. We have gone there and promised to do all that. We are taking steps to control this epidemic. But of course, in controlling the epidemic, the public has to co-operate. As a matter of fact, there are almost 800 civilian volunteers. They have also got together with almost 800 tri force personnel as well as the police who are going around the entire area in the cleanup operation. I hope these efforts will succeed.

I must thank all the volunteers who have come from all parts of the country, particularly, the doctors of the Sri

Lanka Medical Service, who have come there to assist in this programme. I must thank the Hon. Prime Minister, who is going to have a massive youth camp there in Trincomalee next week. Because of that, there are more contingency arrangements that are being made. I am sure this outbreak could be brought under control very soon. I thank the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine for all what has been done. I also thank the Opposition for having brought up this Debate today so that we can meet those arguments and explain to the country the true position today.

Thank you.

A year ago, the Federal Reserve had expected to raise interest rates four times in 2016. Global frailties put paid to that.

Now things are different. This week the Fed raised rates for the second time in three months-thanks partly to the vigour of the American economy, but also because of growth everywhere else.

[6.22 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Might I begin, Mr. Presiding Member, by first thanking you for letting me speak on the Adjournment Motion moved by the Joint Opposition on the prevailing state of the economy. The most optimistic supporter of the Government, whilst looking at the current economic situation, would say that things could be better, or that we are turning the corner as the Minister of Finance just stated, or the worst is over. And of course, the most popular chorus of the Government Members seems to be that we are where we are because of the evils of the Rajapaksa Regime. This, of course, is politically a sound strategy: save ones face by putting all the blame on an opponent. But, I think a prudent measure would be to look inwards to fully understand the folly of this Governments economic policy. This, coupled with mismanagement and increased levels of corruption confirmed by international indexes such as the Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index, shows that the current economic situation is this Governments own creation. So it would be wiser to rectify these errors, after all, there is only so much of what the Government can sell and what the people would buy in blaming the previous regime.

But, this much I will say, Mr. Presiding Member, to the Government. All what is today, the current state of the economy, is not entirely this Governments fault. Let me explain. We were able to have a trade surplus way back in 1977, and I think prior to that in early 1950s, and thereafter deficits. It is not the fault of only this Government, it shows continuous failure of policies for us to be competitive internationally. If one considers the fact that since Independence this country has increasingly become a welfare state rewarding the unsuccessful rather than encouraging the unsuccessful to be successful, it cannot entirely be blamed on this Government. Or, consider the case of increasing tax evasion or increasing State-sector employment with decreasing levels of productivity. I can go on with many more examples, which I believe that we have perpetually erred in our policy and our thinking since Independence, and we continue to do so, but which needs a fundamental paradigm shift.

Dr. N.M. Perera, the famous Marxist Finance Minister, in his 1973 Budget Speech explained to

685 686

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Parliament about the sustainability of our pension mechanism and said that it will become an increasing burden to the Government coffers. But, did we listen? Therefore, it is essential that we separate and identify these long-term deterrents of economic growth and rectify them by developing national policies based on economic productivity and efficiency rather than party compromise. Politics work on compromise; economics do not. They work on sound policies and sound management. Let me clarify further. What I am talking about here is clear long-term shifts in economic policy on issues which, we all can agree, have not worked well for this country since Independence, not this Y ahapalana pretext of economic compromise, which does not work and which is only a faade to meet political objectives of parties governing this country. And now a lot can be said of this Governments economic policies and reasons for their failure. But, what I feel is, the fundamental flaw remains too much of economic compromise which was clearly highlighted by the fact that Budget Proposals have been changed numerous times. Folly of this Governments economic policies, mismanagement and corruption and its fantastic ability to make a bad situation the worst can be highlighted if we take a close examination of a few of Government policies. It can be seen that even before the Government was formed, the then Leaders of the Opposition, in order to come to power at any cost, started with untruth; uttered untruth to the people of promises and election pledges that the Government was unable to keep or had no intention of keeping.

Other promises which the Government found difficult to avoid came at a huge economic cost not thinking about economic consequences at that juncture. How else can one explain when Mahinda Rajapaksa promised to increase the salaries of public servants by Rs. 3,000, these Government Leaders offered to increase the same by Rs. 10,000? After coming to power and realizing the difficulty of its implementation, what the Government decides to do is to cheat the people by offering an allowance of Rs.10,000 with Rs. 2,000 to be added to the salary each year.

So, would it not have been more prudent for the leaders of Y ahapalanaya had they offered an increment of Rs. 5,000 thereby ensuring both the votes and the prevention of economic deterioration? And take the case of reduction in the fuel cost, over Rs. 2.5 billion saving was lost which this Government would have spent on education and health without having year on year reduction. Let us not also forget the reduction of fuel cost which this Government enjoyed, but might not be able to enjoy in the future. It has been reported in media that the Government is considering increasing the price of a litre of petrol by Rs. 30 and the price of a litre of diesel by Rs. 20 and the electricity charges by 20 per cent. This goes to highlight the reverse in its policy but now at the cost of education and health.

Now take, furthermore, the policy of trying to defend the Sri Lankan Rupee in the first eight months of 2015. Due to this, we depleted our foreign reserve from US

Dollars 8 billion to US Dollars 2 billion; our interest rates have increased by five to six per cent while our exports have declined by 5.6 per cent in 2015 and it is expected a further decline by about 3 per cent in 2016. Now, the interest rates have increased from five to six per cent on average from 1st January, 2015 as of present and the domestic borrowings have increased from Rs. 3,832 billion in 2015 to Rs. 5,332 billion as of September, 2016 - a massive 39 per cent increase. The increase in interest cost to the Government under domestic borrowings alone would amount to a massive Rs. 300 billion. The draconian VAT increase which was implemented a few months back, and which taxes even the most basic human necessities such as medical services would only add an addition of Rs. 200 billion to the economy. Now, Mr. Presiding Member, these are the Mahadana Muttha economic policies of the Government, because we know at the end, it will kill the goat and break the pot. We know that the Government will have to depreciate the Rupee eventually and some analysts estimate that the Rupee will be around 160 to 165 against the Dollar by the end of the year.

So, the initial policy of defending the Rupee and wasting our foreign reserves has not worked and it has been detrimental to our export growth. Furthermore, Sir, increase in interest rates should result in capital inflow to the country, but exactly the opposite has happened. Foreign investments in Treasury Bills and bonds have decreased from US Dollars 3.375 billion in January, 2015 to US Dollars 1.6 billion as of today. Foreign Direct Investments are down to about US Dollars 400 million, comparable with FDI during the time of the war. So, Sir, something, definitely, is not working over here.

It will do well to remind the Members of the Government that when President Mahinda Rajapaksa was in office from 2005 to 2014, we were able to increase the GDP from an economy of US Dollars 20.7 billion to a strong economy of US Dollars 80 billion. The GDP per capita was increased from US Dollars 1,062 to US Dollars 3,853. The inflation was reduced from 9 per cent to 3.3 per cent.

The most important fact is that the debt to GDP ratio was brought down from 102 per cent to 70.7 per cent and remember he did all this whilst ending a 30-year civil war. In effect, I think only five years should be taken into consideration as the war ended in 2009. Now, I remember, sometime back, during the time of the war, one of my schoolmates, a successful entrepreneur of the IT sector, telling me over conversation that it was absolutely necessary to end the war militarily at whatever the economic consequences because Prabhakaran cannot be trusted. I remember him saying that the economies can be fixed and rebuilt, but a persistent war would mean the window of opportunity for us to progress as a nation would diminish. This is exactly what Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to achieve.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Sir, give me one more minute please.

Not only did he ended the war, he developed the country economically.

In contrast, this Government has been a total failure burdening the people with increasing levels of taxation, whilst at the same time spending more than Rs. 790 million in order to purchase vehicles for the comfort of the Ministers and of recent another fleet of vehicles has been purchased for more than Rs. 500 million. Also, Sir, the politicization of Chinese investment projects, particularly the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Harbour has resulted in an erosion of investor confidence. Now, to make a bad situation worse, the Governments inability to understand and manage the sensitivities of the different people of different sectors has resulted in endless stream of strikes and protests which would leave any investor thinking twice about investing in Sri Lanka. So, Mr. Presiding Member, we are at a precipice of a great fall; a fall if we take will spiral down and fall into a vicious trap. I believe Sir, while long-term polices need to be ironed out, a key short-term policy would be to increase confidence in markets. Perhaps, the single most important measure for this purpose would be to change the Finance Minister. We all knew on the appointment of the current Finance Minister that he was going to be no Wanninayake. We knew the track record of the present Finance Minister when he dismantled the Sathosa.

As time does not permit me to elaborate further, I leave with the parting note that if a change in the Ministry of Finance is done, as speculated by the newspapers, we will have some hope just as we had in the case of the Central Bank issue. But failure to do so, will result that we soon find out the light at the end of the tunnel which the present Minister of Finance is speaking of, is indeed an oncoming train.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman, you have six minutes.
