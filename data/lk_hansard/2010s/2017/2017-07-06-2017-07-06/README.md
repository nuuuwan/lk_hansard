If you could kindly look into this matter and re-commence this project it will be very much appreciated by the people of Battlicaloa.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .. . [11.46a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill that has been moved by the Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and on the Regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act.

I would really like to take time to speak on the first matter on the Amendments to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill. Let me right at the outset congratulate and thank the Hon. Minister for taking this step, which had been a long-standing request, primarily by the fishermen of the North. This particular method of fishing is universally accepted as one that is detrimental and very damaging to the marine resources. There is no two words about that. Yet, there was a long delay in making this Act an unlawful Act and prescribing punishments for it, because there were said to be international relations that have got entangled in this.

The Hon. Minister spoke about the fact that mostly it was Indian trawling boats that engaged in this exercise in the Sri Lankan waters. I do not even call them Indian fishermen because having studied the matter in detail, I have come to realize that it is not fishermen who are engaged in this particular method of fishing. Fishermen are used to various methods that they have been practising traditionally for ages. The trawlers that use bottom nets or dragged nets as they are called, are generally owned by various persons who have business interest and they employ workmen on those boats and there is no fishing that happens on the bottom trawlers.

363 364

They just sit in the trawler and drag the bottom of the sea. The seabed undergoes severe damage. All resources on the seabed gets scrapped up and we are told that whatever that is gathered by that method, less than 10 per cent is only taken as a catch. The rest is dumped back in the sea. There is no use thereafter. But by this particular method, the marine resources are totally depleted putting successive generations at peril. So, this is the kind of method that is universally accepted as I said as a very damaging practice, which can even not be described as a method of fishing.

The reason why it took so long, perhaps was because there were diplomatic issues when fishermen from India were arrested for straying into Sri Lankan waters. That always gave rise to tension; there were negotiations about their release and so on. But, this Bill seeks to do something very different and it is being done at a time when both countries have, as a matter of policy, jointly agreed that the practice of bottom trawling must be stopped. It is also with a sense of achievement that I speak today because, as the Hon. Minister acknowledged, I moved the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act (Amendment) Bill as a Private Members' Bill, not once but twice, in the last Parliament. But, when Parliament was dissolved, I had to move it again in this Parliament.

I must thank the Hon. Minister for including me in the two Ministerial-level delegations that had talks with the Government of India in November, last year in New Delhi and again in January, this year in Colombo. It was in November last year that the Indian Government agreed that bottom trawling must be banned and a Joint communique was issued after the talks in New Delhi, where the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, participated with two Central Government Ministers of India, including the Minister of External Affairs, Shrimati Sushma Swaraj. That Communique very specifically states that the practice of bottom trawling must be brought to an end. So, there is no dispute between the two countries. Both countries now agree on the policy that this is a damaging method and it must be brought to an end. Sir, I am glad that this Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill is being brought in such a context where this issue is no more in dispute. It is agreed by responsible persons from both countries that whoever it may be, the violators must be punished.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have five more minutes. But I suppose the subject matter is something else.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is closely connected to the subject matter.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I am just trying to get you back to the track for five minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is okay. Do not worry about that. I have dealt with the subject matter. I have dealt with the immediate subject matter. I am now dealing with the other issues that are closely connected to this. You took the Chair after I had dealt with the immediate issues. I was getting on to surrounding issues. There is a strong connection because this Bill, this Amending Act, is being brought by the Government consequent to a Private Members Bill that I brought from the Opposition ranks. It is a request of hundreds of fishery societies in the North that we brought this and the Government has heeded that, today. I congratulate the Government for that.

, .

So, it is in that context, when the Government has listened to the cry of the people of the North and is actually moving an Amendment to the legislation of this country that I am saying this. That is a good thing. This

must not stop only with amending the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act. This must continue to impact on the fundamental law of this country, the supreme law of this country, what is known as a social contract of a country. So, this is a good omen, a good signal today.

We have also been engaged in that exercise of changing the ground rules on which different peoples of this country can live together. Equality, however, whatever be their numbers, is a fundamental feature that must be recognized. It is on that premise that different peoples can agree to live together in one territory. I hope we will be able to achieve that in the new Constitution. Numbers do matter. In a democracy, it is a majority rule that will prevail. We will bow to that; but at the same time in different areas different peoples groups will be in the majority and power must be so shared that everyone will know that their will also has a place in making decisions with regard to the governance of this country and that they are not always subject to the rule of the majority to which they do not belong. So, it is important for a sense of belonging of everyone in the country that they also have access to powers of governance, that they can also make decisions for themselves on matters that affect their day-today lives. Therefore, now that we have embarked on this very important exercise, I would even dare say it is the most important exercise the legislature of this country has embarked on since Independence, because in 1947, we were given a Constitution that was not even passed here. That was passed in Buckingham Palace, that was passed in the British Parliament as an Order in Council. In 1972, there was no agreement. The Party in rule decided because they had a two-thirds majority. The people did not approve it. In 1978, the Party in power decided. The other Party in Parliament did not agree. It was not given to the people of the country for approval. So, for the first time ever we have an opportunity for the participation of everyone in this country and for the first time ever, I would say, it has a potential. According to the Resolution that Parliament passed unanimously, it must be placed before the people at a referendum. Give it to the people. People know what is good. People, if they are led properly, if they are advised properly, will decide rightly. That is the experience world over. People should not be allowed to be misled by miscreants. So, leaders of the country who have taken these bold steps must continue to convince the people that this is a good thing for future generations. If we go towards that objective of a Constitution that is acceptable to all the peoples of this country, I am sure all the peoples of this country will readily say, Aye.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) ..1.30 .

. . Sir, I would like to quote from the front-page news report titled "Govt. to go ahead with new Constitution" appearing in The Island newspaper of today.

The government said yesterday that it would go ahead with the Constitution making process, but the final decision on enacting a new Constitution would be made by Parliament.

'There is no need for anyone to get unduly agitated over it', Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne told the weekly Cabinet press briefing at the Information Department.

He said that the New Constitution Bill would contain proposals from a cross section of Sri Lankans and retain the unitary status of the country without doing away with the current status of Buddhism.

. . . Sir, I will quote from that document because it is a public document now; it is no more a confidential document of a few. The Hon. Minister has misled the country.

( ) (An Hon. Member) He is the Cabinet Spokesman.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, he is supposed to be the Cabinet Spokesman. He is a government by himself. That is what has happened.

Sir, I will quote the proposed Articles 1 and 2 - those Articles talk about the Unitary State in the current Constitution - for the new Constitution. There are three alternatives that have been proposed. Therefore, how can the Hon. Minister say that there has not been any such deviation? This document I have here with me gives one proposal, which states, I quote:

Sri Lanka (Ceylon) is one free, sovereign, independent, undivided and indivisible Republic consisting of the institutions of the Centre and of the Provinces which shall exercise power as laid down in the Constitution.

" " ! I quote:

Sri Lanka (Ceylon) is one free, sovereign, independent, undivided and indivisible Republic.

Where is the word Unitary? I ask, will the Government be able to answer that question. Do not mislead the country. The Maha Sangha has been correct.

On what is available before them, they have commented. So, we should not reject what the Maha Sangha has said unless the Government makes a statement to say that they are committed to the protection of the Unitary State.

Another proposal that you all are considering states, I quote:

Sri Lanka (Ceylon) is a free, sovereign and independent Republic which is an aekiya rajyaya/ orumiththa nadu".

" " ; " " . ; "Unitary" . ? . . "9. " ? " ". 9. . 9. . 9. ? 9. ? 9. 6 . 6 ? ".....Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana,..." . Now, they are trying to deviate from that to say "Sri Lanka recognises the equality of all religions and beliefs and guarantees to all persons the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution".

Prime Minister is here and if you want, I will quote again for the Hon. Prime Minister also to hear what the Hon. Minister Rajitha Senaratne, the Cabinet Spokesman, has said. The newspaper reports, I quote:

He said the New Constitution Bill, would contain proposals from a cross section of Sri Lankans and retain the unitary status of the country without doing away with the current status of Buddhism."

"The Island" also quotes him as having said that There is no need for anyone to get unduly agitated over it..., referring to the Maha Sangha and the Mahanayakas.

Now, what I have here with me is the document which I quoted from. It is an open document today; it is no more a secret document. The Hon. Anura Dissanayake says it is a secret document. No, this was discussed openly at the seminar held at the BMICH, after the Hon. Prime Minister left. I know the Hon. Prime Minister was not there when this was discussed. Now, it is an open document. So, why is the Cabinet Spokesman saying that the Mahanayakas should not get agitated? Obviously, there are proposals regarding Article 9 - Buddhism - of the current Constitution and other proposals included in this. Those proposals made with regard to Buddhism are going to deviate from the existing Article 9. So, the Mahanayakas have every right to express their views. Therefore, the Hon. Minister is wrong. This is what I am trying to say. - [Interruption.] The Constitutional Assembly has not discussed this, yes.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Mohamed Navavi, please commence your speech.

[4.58 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. I fully support this Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill, which has been presented by the Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, because so many small-scale fisherfolk in this country, especially in my area, Puttalam District, which is famous for fishing industry, are suffering.

First and foremost, I must thank the Hon. Minister for starting a large-scale housing project for fishing families in Kalpitiya and Serakkuliya. He started it after paying several visits to this area. It is a project we did not get for many years. Once again, I thank the Hon. Minister for giving this housing project to my electorate, Puttalam, because it covers 160 kilometres of sea and lagoon frontage and probably one fifth or one sixth of the fish sent out to the rest of the country come from there.

However, Sir, I would like to touch on this Green Tiger Prawn known as kurutu isso. Off Kalpitiya, there is a place known as Kudiramalai where around three to four kilometre circumference, these fisherfolk are engaged in prawn trading and this trade has been going on for well over 10 to 15 years. There are about 23 trawlers used to catch these prawns and their livelihood depends on that. To tell you frankly, the annual catch of prawns, I think, is about 115,000 kilograms and one kilogram is sold at Rs. 1,000 and mostly they are exported and we are getting about Rs. 115 million annually. But, they are small-scale fisherfolk living in Kalpitiya, Karaitivu and Puttalam. So, in order to help their livelihood, I would suggest the Hon. Minister to consider this trade, which is confined just to a small pocket of three to four kilometres. Because, as you know, these prawns live only for about 40 to 45 days. So, if you do not catch them or if they are not netted, they will die and not only the employment of these fisherfolk but also the amount of foreign exchange which we are getting by exporting those particular prawns will come to a standstill. Therefore, I agree and fully support this Bill because many fisherfolk find it difficult to do their job.

In the meantime, we will have to look into this Project and Hon. Minister, I would like to say that this Project was an ADB Project started in 1977. NARA is looking after them. They have a special committee and the supervision is done by them. There are only 23 trawlers and the fishermen are allowed to engage in that trade from 6 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. Small boats are used and the problems are monitored by that committee itself. Under no circumstances, this supervision has been done properly and there is a limit to them. We will have to consider these facts and see that these poor fisherfolk are not affected. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister, who moved this Bill in Parliament, to take a decision to look after these people.

I also would like to come out with the position of the Fishery Harbour in Kalpitiya. This Harbour is supposed

453 454

to look after the fisherfolk of Kalpitiya and Puttalam. Unfortunately, the Hon. Minister is not here, but, I have told him about this: just for the name's sake it is Kalpitiya Harbour, Puttalam, the management and everything is done by the officials of Wennappuwa and Nattandiya. All what I would like to mention is, we have no say in that. The officials are from Wennappuwa and Negombo. So, all these people come from Negombo, get into the boats and trawlers, go to the islands, do their fishing, come back and go off. So, I would like to tell the Hon. Minister that somebody might have to take over this. We have had so many Ministers and Deputy Ministers in charge of Fisheries like Hon. Milroy Fernando in Puttalam - I am sorry, I forget the names of the others - but, unfortunately, administration and everything of this harbour has been done by officials outside the Puttalam District. There might have been some laws. But, forget all those things. What we want is, if this harbour is in our Electorate or in our District, we should be able to manage it, we should administrate it and we should get the benefit of it. I am very sorry to say that all these fishermen outside the District come in their lorries, bring everything from outside, come to this harbour, go to these islands, take the catch they fish and everything and go back. So, I request the Hon. Minister, - I have already told him about this - in the future, this must be changed so that the administration should either go to the fisheries societies in Puttalam or to the GA of Puttalam and we should be benefitted.

Sir, I would also like to mention that for six months of the year we have plenty of fish in Puttalam. Then, in the other six months, these fisherfolk go to Mullaitivu, the other side of the Island, and they do their fishing there. For the last so many years, Hon. Festus Perera had been the Minister of Fisheries, -I just remembered the name-, then, Hon. Milroy Fernando from Puttalam had been the Minister of Fisheries. During that time, we had been agitating; we had been shouting at them, but unfortunately, we were unable to start a fish processing plant in Puttalam. For the last 20 years, we have been struggling for that.

I have already told the Hon. Minister that the possibilities are there in Puttalam to start a fish processing plant. Therefore, we can start a fish processing plant there and thereby the country will be benefited; employment could be generated and the people will be able to earn a lot of money.

So, these are the problems that we are facing today. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister again to consider looking after small-scale fisherfolk when brining in amendments to this Bill. As he promised me, most probably, there would be some decisions taken on the Kalpitiya Fisheries Habour. As I said before, I have already mentioned to him about the fish processing plant.

As you all know all the bad things are coming to Puttalam. First it started with the setting up of the Cement Corporation which gave us enough dust. Then, there came the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. Although it generates

900 MW electricity to the country, we are suffering. And now so many other things are also coming to Puttalam.

Even after all what we have given to the country as the people of Puttalam, we are not benefited. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to consider the plight of the poor fishermen and similarly help me in getting the required administration to the Puttalam Harbour. Thank you.

In the first year, ask them to take the prefabricated houses and if they do not like it, in the next year we will try to give them the type of houses that you want to be given to them. Next time you will tell it is about Rs.20 lakhs because you started with Rs.7 lakhs and today you said Rs.10 lakhs. When you say something be firm, do not change.
