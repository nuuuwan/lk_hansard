[3.07 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, today we are taking up some Items proposed by the Hon Minister of Finance. Among them is the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) (Amendment) Bill which is being brought, particularly, to give some concessions to the foreigners who are investing in property development projects in the country. As a matter of fact, we have observed that during the past few years, particularly after the conclusion of the war, there had been an immense interest in the property

development sector and this has now gained a momentum resulting in many high-rises coming up in all the metropolitan areas in the country, particularly, in Colombo. We also had to review our existing concessionary arrangements under the Board of Investment Law in order to promote more investments in this sector.

However, I would like to point out one issue, particularly, relating to the apartment complexes which are coming up all over the country. As the Minister in charge of water supply and drainage, I would say that the pressure on public utilities is also increasing day by day - that on sewerage as well as on water supply. We have now forecast what is happening and are preparing ourselves to be in a proper prepared state to see that these new developments will not suffer as a result of public utilities that may not be able to cope up with the speed in which these constructions are coming up.

While saying that, it is also important for us, as a Government, to consider the policy that has been stated by the Hon. Minister in his Budget Speech - to give more emphasis on middle-class housing. As a matter of fact, most of these apartment complexes are for upper middle-class and above. The range of prices of these flats are beyond the reach of the common man. Therefore, what is important for us is to look at proper incentive schemes to promote middle-class housing. Towards that end, in the last Budget Speech, the Hon. Minister of Finance did announce a few concessions for middle-class housing. What is important for various entities like the UDA, the NHDA is to make available sufficient land for investors to put up these middle-class housing complexes. We see some of these complexes are being undertaken by a few major construction companies in the outskirts of Colombo like Athurugiriya, Malabe, Maharagama and Homagama. What is important is to make available sufficient State land possessed by those institutions to investors in order to increase the number of middle-class apartment complexes, because that is finally going to result in easing of congestion in our roads. Most of the people are travelling from various parts of the Western Province and if they are able to shift towards Colombo and settle in these high-rises, that will result in the reduction of traffic congestion in our city as well.

Having said that, may I take a few minutes of your time, Hon. Presiding Member, to talk about another subject relating to transitional justice, issues relating to land matters in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The Hon. Member from Tamil National Alliance a while ago dealt with a similar subject relating to occupied lands by Government Forces in the Northern Province which are still not released. As a matter of fact, the Kepapulavu people are still on a hunger strike trying to get some of their lands released from the custody of the Forces. Having said that, it is also relevant for us to look at the need to concentrate on transitional justice issues which are affecting the livelihood of the people, particularly those of the farmers. Now, if you take the Eastern Province, there are a variety of cases in different areas where people who had gone and cultivated lands without any hindrance during the war, have been deprived from

935 936

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

access to their lands after the war. Particularly, having introduced Gazette notifications, some of those lands which they had been traditionally cultivating under LDO permits have now been denied to them and this has caused a serious impact in the livelihood of the people.

Now, I would like to bring the issue of the Radella West, Palliadi Watta Farmers Organization where about 63 to 75 families who are living and carrying out paddy cultivation in about 151 acres of highland and lowland areas. In this particular area in Radella West in the Lahugala DS Division, they have been cultivating these lands from 1978. They have been paying the necessary acreage tax to the Agrarian Services Department. These, unfortunately, have now been gazetted under the Kumbukkan Forest Reserve on the 1st of March in 2009. But, when the Divisional Secretaries intervened and complaints were made they had intermittently been allowed to cultivate. The Forest Department itself permitted cultivation of these lands up to about 2014. Thereafter, this has now been suspended. This is also a transitional justice issue which needs to be settled. These are people who have continuously enjoyed their rights to these lands from 1978 onwards and during the intervening- ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Are there records? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The records are there. Now, what has happened is the Forest Department has declared it as a conserved forest. That was in 2009. -[Interruption.] That does. Then, the Forest Officers are not allowing them to access those lands. I must point out another issue. Under the Forest Ordinance, if an area is gazetted as a conserved forest, within one month they need to come and get Parliamentary approval. If Parliamentary approval is not there, that Gazette lapses. This issue, however much you bring it to the notice of the Government Agent and the Forest Officers - I had a chat with the Conservator General of the Forest Department a few days ago and invited him to come to these areas and look at these lands himself. It will be very evident to him - to the naked eye - you can see that these are all sprawling areas of paddy-fields. Absolutely, there are no forests in any of those areas. If the Conservator General comes - [Interruption.] We did. We have had several rounds of discussions with the GA of Ampara, Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil, with the Lahugala Divisional Secretary and the Divisional Secretary of Thirukkovil. Similar problems are there in the Wattamadu area. So, these matters have been brought to the notice of the Government through this House as well as through other officials and the Conservator General of Forests. I hope the Conservator General will undertake a visit to these areas, see for himself the true situation on the ground and restore this right for these

poor farmers who are suffering without livelihood because of deprivation relating to this gazetting by the Forest Department.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . . [.. 3.17] ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) , . . , ( ) () . - - , .

His Excellency the President decided to visit Mullaitivu on the 25th of January, 2016. But, due to bad weather, he did not visit Mullaitivu. In front of 4,000 people, he asked us to conduct the meeting. Both the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan, Member of Parliament

975 976

for Jaffna and I were present at the meeting. We promised to the people that 243 acres of land would be released according to the instructions by the Presidential Secretariat. But today, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence has announced that he is not going to release that. Therefore, my question is, how is it possible? It is an order given by the highest office, by His Excellency the President. But, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence is not obeying the order.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , " " . . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .. . LANDS OCCUPIED BY SECURITY FORCES IN KEPPAPULAVU [6.25 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I have given notice of the following Motion to be moved at the time of Adjournment. I move, "Whereas several thousand acres of land belonging to the Tamil People of the Northern Province were forcibly occupied by the military forces when the armed conflict came to an end in May 2009. And since then people who were displaced could not be resettled in their original places due to their lands being illegally and unlawfully occupied by the security forces; Several agitations were undertaken to have those land returned to the original inhabitants. At the Presidential Election held on 08th January 2015, the joint opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena promised to give back all the private lands back to the people for their resettlement and the Tamil people of the North and the East overwhelmingly voted for him enabling him to win and become the President of Sri Lanka. In the two years of this new Government some lands were released to the original owners for their re-occupation, but most of the lands occupied by the security forces are yet to be released. In 2012, the then Government closed the illegal internment camp in Manik Farm, and in order to do that, moved the last occupants who belonged to the village of "Keppapulavu" in the Mullaitivu District out to a place called "Seenimoddai". Their village was and continues to be occupied by the security forces.

The people of Keppapulavu have been promised time and again that their lands could be released, but for years this promise has been breached. They have now started an agitation and have occupied the streets with their families for over a week and have caused to remain there until their lands are returned to them. I move that the Government takes immediate and urgent steps to return the occupied lands in Keppapulavu to the original inhabitants."

Hon. Presiding Member, this is a very serious situation, because today is the ninth day that several families have occupied the ways, the roads and the streets with their children and have remained there. This has come about because at the end of January, His Excellency the President was to visit Mullaitivu - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! . , [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELAVM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please continue. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was saying that the grave situation in Keppapulavu has been occasioned because towards the end of last month, His Excellency was to visit the Mullaitivu District and release a certain extent of land, not all of it. There is more than 1,000 acres that are under occupation. He was to release 243 acres. Unfortunately, His Excellency could not go to that event on that day. Our Party was asked to stand in and declare those lands to be released. His Excellency's Coordinating Secretary was present and handed over a document to the District Secretary in Mullaitivu, stating that identified land, 243 acres in extent, was being released for people's resettlement.

About 4,000 people turned up hopeful of being able to go to their original places. But, after the event, it was revealed that only 145 acres have been released, and of that too, 50 acres does not belong to that area, which belongs to a private person who lives somewhere else. So, in effect, only 95 acres have actually been released. The District Secretary feigns ignorance. But, there was an official promise given that 243 acres would be released. So, the balance - close to 150 acres - has not been released even though there was an express promise

1003 1004

given to the people through His Excellencys Coordinating Secretary and the people who came have refused to go back to their temporary shelters.

The climatic conditions are very bad in Mullaitivu at the moment. It is extremely cold at nights. Very young children and families are occupying the streets. People are saying, We will not return. Many have publicly intimated that they will rather take their lives than go back to these temporary shelters. The Government seems to be oblivious to this. The Government reacts fast when a private bus owners association goes on strike. Within 24 hours, there is action taken. When somebody else goes on strike, immediately, the Government gives in. But, here, our people, people who have lived on these lands and whose ancestors have lived on these lands for over 100 years - originally, it was in 1910 that the grants or licences were given - are unable to get back. Even after the promise was given, the Presidents express promise is being breached by the Security Forces. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence says, They will not release those lands., and the people are legitimately agitating that the President would keep his promise.

Close to ten days, this has gone on and the Government does not seem to be mindful that this is happening in a part of the country. I wish to ask whether this apathy that is being shown by the Government towards these people is because of their ethnicity and the place where they live. This is an area about which we spoke many times in this House and I have with me the Hansard of 8th August, 2013, when the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, the Leader of the Opposition moved an Adjournment Motion. I refer to Column 330 of the Hansard of that day and I quote:

I will, Sir, give the particulars in regard to these matters. The 59th Division of the army has built a large military facility in Keppapulavu in the Mullaitivu District. The families belonging to Keppapulavu were forced to relocate to Seenimottai, a barren area in South Eastern Keppapulavu as a temporary measure upon leaving Manik Farm in September 2012.

So, you see, Sir, this is a matter that has been agitated by us since September, 2012.

The Government was in an indecent hurry to close Manik Farm. Manik Farm, itself was an illegal internment camp. There was so much international pressure and UN Human Rights Council Sessions were in the offing in October, 2012 and in order to say that there are no more camps, hurriedly the then Government closed Manik Farm. The Minister of Justice in that Government is here today and might remember these events. The present Minister of Justice is also here, but seems preoccupied with something else and is running around the House, listening.

These people were therefore not allowed to go to their village. They were dumped in this place called "Seenimoddai" as I have mentioned in my Adjournment Motion of today and as we have mentioned time and

again in this House through several Adjournment Motions. I have personally visited that place in 2012. It was a jungle. I have photographs of that place. I have photographs of military intelligence personnel photographing us while we went and interacted with those people. I have plenty of photographs directly videoing and photographing my face in that jungle area called "Seenimoddai". They were told that it is temporary. You closed Manik Farm. We knew why it was closed; because UNHRC Sessions were coming up within a month. Just to announce to the world that there are no more camps, these people were dumped in the forest. They were told it is a temporary measure.

A temporary measure in September, 2012 has now extended up to 2017 and what is worse, as I have mentioned in the Adjournment Motion is, that a promise was given to give back private lands to the original owners by His Excellency the President when he was the common opposition candidate. It was given in writing. I was there when it was written and the phrase was agreed upon. The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka was there. He wrote the promise that was to be given to the people by his own hand before the President went to Batticaloa for a campaign meeting and it was carried by hand by Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga. We were part of the campaign. This was a written promise given to the people. And two years after that, the President fixes a date, fails to turn up, but announces to the people that these lands are being released. After that event, they find the lands have not been released or rather the military is saying, No, we will not release it.

This is a very serious issue and as we have been notified, people are not leaving the place. They have vowed not to leave the place. I do not blame them. We fully support their agitation that is going on today. If necessary, we will ourselves go and join them. How can it be that five years after they were told that this is just temporary and two years after the incumbent President gave a written promise when he was the common candidate and at an event when he actually announced identifying the lands, that it is still not given to them?

It probably happens only in this country and probably happens only in this Yahapalanaya. I am ashamed to even pronounce that word, "Y ahapalanaya" for this Government. If it treats its citizens like this, if it treats its Tamil citizens like this, it would not dare treat its Sinhala citizens like this. As I said, if there is a private bus owners strike, you react within 24 hours. But this does not seem to impinge on you the least. You are seated here but, many of the Ministers do not even know that this agitation is going on. I wonder whether the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement knows. He probably knows; but it does not seem to have moved even him. Why do you treat your citizens like this?

I wish the Government gives an appropriate answer today.

Thank you.

[6.53p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene - State Minister of Defence) The Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran in Parliament today is about a land which is now under the Air Force Camp in Mullaitivu.

On the 31st of January, a group of people had come and started an agitation in front of the guardroom of the Air Force Camp. However, once this issue came up, we spoke with the Air Force authorities and what they said was, they actually did not know that they were occupying private land and that land was given to them by the Forest Department. They had spoken with the Divisional Secretariat and the Forest Department had given them the clearance and the permit to establish the Air Force Camp in that area. That was just after the war.

The reason why they established this camp there, Hon. Sumanthiran, was that the LTTE airstrip was situated in that place. The importance of national security is the reason why the Air Force had gone and established the camp there. They have refurbished that airstrip and now we are using that, not only for the transport of military personnel but also for civilian transport as well.

With this issue that has come up, the Air Force authorities have spoken to the officials of the Divisional Secretariat to know what they have to say about this. Then, the officials of the Divisional Secretariat had come back and said that in 2005, some of the families have been given permits to come and settle in that area, and there is also the issue whether those permits have been renewed or not. However, when we spoke with the Air

Force authorities, they said that if the original inhabitants of that area could come forward, they would speak with them, come to an amicable solution and give some land for them to come and resettle in that area. So, it is not something that we cannot discuss and sort out. Definitely, we can go to that area, speak with the people and see if we can come up with a solution to their problem. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, may I? ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) Please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If that is a possibility, what do you suggest as a means of these negotiations? As I pointed out, in 2012 itself, the people were told that they would be allowed to go back. We have raised it every year by way of Adjournment Motions. Earlier, I read out from an Adjournment Motion in 2013. So, it is not as though that the Defence authorities did not know; it not as though that this has suddenly been discovered to be a forest land. From 1910, permits have been given. It is true that during the armed-conflict permits were not extended; people could not do that. But in 2005, as you yourself say, permits have been given. Sometimes, annual permits are not extended. But, that does not mean that people have not lived in that area. So, be that as it may, now that you say this is not a matter which cannot be resolved amicably, can we know what modality you suggest for somebody on behalf of the people and the authorities to sit down and talk about it? We need to tell them something; some process that the Government agrees now as a means of resolving this issue. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) Absolutely, Hon. Sumanthiran. I will speak with the Air Force Commander as well as the Army Commander and ask them to send representatives of the military to discuss this issue. Then, maybe, at the Divisional Secretariat, we can speak with the people and come up with a solution for their problems. I can set that up or if there is a better way, you can suggest that as well. There is no problem in that. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, 11.00 12.00 , time .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. Has the Hon. Prime Minister agreed to meet some people from Keppapulavu after meeting the families of the disappeared? ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) We are meeting them tomorrow. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is, tomorrow at 11.00 oclock. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, I am told that the Hon. Prime Minister has agreed to meet these people also just after meeting the families of the disappeared. Anyway, if some representatives come, then we can start the process. But, otherwise, would the Hon. Minister ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) ?

I am told that some representatives are coming. So, just after our meeting with the families of the disappeared, if that arrangement has been made, can we do the first meeting and then decide on the process that is to follow with the Divisional Secretariat and our Members of Parliament from the Vanni District? Three of them are here today. They also can represent them and be involved in the process. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) Absolutely. We can definitely discuss this tomorrow and see how we can proceed and go forward. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Hon. State Minister, -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan, !

() . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) The release of these lands has already been promised by the President. On the 25th of January, there was a meeting arranged with a large number of people; about 4,000 people came for that. Due to bad weather, the President could not attend. That is why he returned by helicopter. Then, another Parliamentarian and I conducted the meeting and promised the people on behalf of President about the release of lands. The President agreed to release 243 acres. But, only 95 acres have been released. So, the balance should be identified and released by the military. That is the issue. Please consider this issue favourably, because that has been a Presidential order. Consider this matter properly before deciding on it. If it was stated as 200 or 300 acres, we can say that the President made a vague promise. But here, the President has promised to release 243 acres, which were specifically marked. Before taking that decision, somebody had marked the land. That is why there has been a lot of suspicion about the military and these people have also been agitating against them. So, as the State Minister of Defence, please look into the matter and take a decision favourable for the people. Do not give reasons such as land permits have to be renewed annually and so on because, during the last 30 years of war, nobody have been able to renew the permits of those lands in the Vanni District. That is the history. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene ) Hon. Member, the 243 acres are to be released by the Army. That comes under the Army. I think the Army holds about 600 acres of private land in that area. Out of that, they are now releasing 243 acres and are planning to release 30 acres more soon after. There is a process and they are going through that. I think this particular incident happened in front of the Air Force Camp. As you know, we give priority to national security. Similarly, this Government has given priority to help the people who have been displaced and who do not have houses. That is a promise the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the Government have made. We can definitely come to some kind of an arrangement and come up with a solution for that. I think, tomorrow, we can discuss it and see how the process can be taken forward. () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Hon. Minister, if you are prepared to release the lands in Keppapulavu region, we are very thankful to you. I discussed this matter directly with the officers of the Air Force Headquarters there. Actually, they have only a small problem. One road leads straight to the landing area. So, other than that road, they are agreeable to release the other land. About 20 acres of private land is also there.
