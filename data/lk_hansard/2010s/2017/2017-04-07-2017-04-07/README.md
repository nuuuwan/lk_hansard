( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Item Nos. 153, 154, 155 and 156 are to be moved today. Now I call upon the Hon. Minister of Finance to move Item Nos. 153 and 154.

:

EXCISE ORDINANCE: NOTIFICATION

[1.30p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move,

"That the Notification made by the Minister of Finance under Section 32 of the Excise Ordinance (Chapter 52) on rules governing Distilleries/Warehouses and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1996/52 of 09th December 2016, which was presented on 07.03.2017, be approved.

(Excise Notification No. 991)

Sir, it is with happiness that I move the Excise Notification published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1996/52 of 09th December, 2016 and I would like to speak a few words on that.

As you know, the Budget did have a corrective action taken in line with the Government's policies of being able to ensure that correct motivational and demotivational activities are enforced. Through that process, tax on toddy shows an increase from Rs. 30 to Rs. 50 per litre. Our resultant factor is that we want to get it into a more formalized sector while ensuring that only the needy would get it; because taxation is a form of Government's revenue. As a result of that, the price of a bottle of toddy has been increased from Rs. 100 to Rs. 140.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Mohamed Navavi, please. You have ten minutes.

[4.58 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to participate in today's Debate. Today, we are debating two Notifications under the Excise Ordinance, Regulations under the Convention against Doping in Sport Act and Regulations under the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act.

Sir, we have to think of saving our nation from drastic alcohol, dope and so on. Today, the country is getting ruined by the use of Kerala Ganja - I mentioned this earlier also in this august Assembly. Almost weekly, 25-100 kilograms of Kerala Ganja is smuggled in from Tamil Nadu, through Jaffna to Negombo and distributed right around the country. As a result, the whole nation is getting spoiled, especially the younger generation. In my area, Puttalam, at least one or two consignments of Kerala Ganja is caught by the Police weekly. The smugglers are produced before the courts and remanded. But, today, the authorities hands are tied. According to the rules and regulations, the maximum fine imposed by the court for over 25 kilograms of Kerala Ganja is Rs. 50,000. If it is below 25 kilograms, the fine is Rs. 25,000. But the value of that consignment is around Rs. 10 - 15 lakhs. So, what happens is, when an ordinary poor labourer or a youth is caught, straightway the fine is paid and he is released and this business goes on. As a remedy, we have to increase the fine - say, a fine of 50 per cent of the value of the consignment - or when first-timers are caught, they should be given a suspended sentence. Then, I think, we can bring this under control. Otherwise, this is going to spoil the whole country. The Police is doing their best; the Navy is doing their best, but it is coming in from Jaffna to Chilaw and Negombo. So, we have to think of poor, young people because they are the people who get caught. They are distributing this for

1547 1548

[ ]

2017 07

easy money and as a result the whole community is getting spoiled. Specially the school-leavers, if they are to enter a university, usually it takes 1-11/2 years or to find a job or settle in the society; it takes some time and this is the period in which they get hold of these youths.

They infuse into the minds of these youth that they can earn easy money through this and that is why all these youngsters have got caught to this. It seems that addiction to Kerala Ganja has increased when compared with the addiction to other narcotics. So, we must put a stop to this. Therefore, I request that the fine be increased. We have to think of the society and the youngsters.

I can remember, as youngsters, when we were doing sports we used to take things like Glucose. You will not believe, Mr. Presiding Member, - I am sorry to say this - now there are some youngsters in my area who take a dose of Ganja just to have some extra stamina before a match. I am sorry to say this, but it is happening today. Whose fault is it? It is not their fault. It is our fault. Not controlling it, not taking steps to stop this nuisance and not taking action against the culprits are our faults. As I told you earlier, when we speak to the police officers, we understand that they are doing their best. But when these culprits come out of custody, what does the public say? The public says, The police take a bribe and release them. So, if the fines can be increased to the maximum - double or triple the amount - I am sure we will be able to stop this menace and get the society to move forward in the correct path.

Think of the sportsmen. When we talk of cricketers like Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and others, all of them are world famous. But I am sorry to say, even the game of cricket is now coming down because of this menace. Take for instance, IPL Games - how many of our cricketers took part in earlier IPL matches? But today only one or two cricketers participate in it. This menace is there behind all these. We are in a situation where we have to look after the young generation of our country but we are not at all interested in them; we are not at all worried about them and we are just allowing them to carry on. I know instances where young children with good family backgrounds have got caught to this menace. Because of our ignorance these poor youths get into this business and finally they end up in prison. Not only that, even after they come out of prison, they continue with it. And this is going on even within the prison.

The other problem that we face today is cultivation of tobacco plants. Even in my area, Kalpitiya, there are tobacco cultivations. People are cultivating tobacco there. After harvesting, tobacco leaves are dried and people start chewing it. They start chewing tobacco and finally end up with cancers. I am very happy to say that His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister have taken steps to put a stop to this. As a result, there is a decrease in tobacco cultivation. People tend to cultivate tobacco because of the high profit and very low cost of cultivation. People chew tobacco and keep it in their mouths for long hours and then they end up with oral cancer. It is happening. We know it. Therefore, as I said

earlier, fines must be increased. Department of Exercise should also get involved in this effort.

There is a fishing village called Udappu where innocent Tamils are living. Today they have opened liquor shops right around schools and the Udappu Temple, which is a very famous Temple there. A few years ago we objected to this, but very unfortunately, the whole village is spoilt today. We have requested the authorities to close down the liquor shop but they have not done it so far. Therefore, I have requested His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister to stop this. When you go right around the country, you will be able to see so many liquor shops that are there around schools and hospitals for which licences had been given by the previous Government. Even by the side of Magistrates Courts they do this business.

So, it is the duty of the Hon. Minister to go into this and close all these. I think you cannot have liquor shops within the 500-metre radius of schools and places of worship. But, when you go round, there are so many liquor shops. I think we will have to put a stop to it. There should be a difference between the previous Government and this Government.

Look at the newspapers today. Murders, accidents and all those things are happening due to the consumption of liquor. How are we going to stop this? We have to reduce them because you cannot go on saying, "We cannot put a stop to this." We have to do it for the sake of our country and for the sake of the community. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister and the Government to take necessary action to stop Kerala Ganja coming in. We have to put a stop to it by increasing the fines and the security authorities should also look into this.

If there are liquor shops near schools, temples, churches, mosques and in areas where there are court houses and so on, we have to close them. It is a good way of reducing the number of liquor shops in the country. We have to put a stop to this; then only can this be controlled. As I told you earlier, tobacco cultivation must be stopped in this country. There are so many other crops by which we can earn money and improve the standard of living.

The other problem we face today with regard to schools is, there are areca nuts and another thing known as "Baabul" which is consumed by school children. This too is brought from India. This is how the younger generation of our country is getting ruined today. Not only the younger generation, even families are being broken up, murders are taking place and accidents are taking place because of these harmful things.

We have to control this. We have not done that so far. Today there are three Hon. Ministers involved in this. I request all of them to consider this. I can remember, a person told me that Kerala Ganja is used for medical purposes. It may be used in other countries, but not in our country. This was told by a prominent politician, not the Hon. Minister. I request the Hon. Ministers to get involved in this and to increase the fine to the maximum

1549 1550

and take all necessary measures to put a stop to this, so that we can save this country, especially because we depend on the younger generation.

As I told you, the sportsmen of the earlier era were devoid of smoking and drinking. It is a fact. I am also a sportsman. But the sportsmen of this era are entirely different. Why? Because the society is spoilt. Therefore, I request this august Assembly and the Hon. Ministers to look into this. As we are living in a free world today and as we are living freely in our country, this also must be looked into. In the future drastic action must be taken to save the country and the younger generation. Thank you.
