"Developing countries must avoid a race to the bottom to supply cheap goods to the world's richest economies, according to a new report from UNCTAD, the UN's trade and development arm.

In its annual trade and development report, published on Thursday, the Geneva-based thinktank warns that the traditional model of "export-led development," which powered many countries in the runup to the financial crisis, is no longer viable."

.

"UNCTAD believes that developing country governments must focus on boosting domestic incomes for the poorest - and hence consumer demand - rather than pinning their hopes on a recovery in export demand among wealthier neighbours."

Sir, some of those headlines described the people's reaction to the Budget, 2018. It has effectively addressed the short, medium and long term requirements on the economic, social and environmental fronts in order to ensure an educated, healthy, and entrepreneurial country by the year 2020. Those are the broad objectives of the proposals that were brought forth by this Budget.

As the Minister of Tourism, on behalf of the tourism sector I wholeheartedly welcome this Budget which has given many concessions to the tourism sector and laid the foundation for sustainable growth of the industry for years to come.

Budget 2018 is a visionary blue print that will increase exports, boost tourism and foreign direct investment which in turn will form the launching pad for economic prosperity. It will help realize the Unity Government's Vision 2025 to make our nation an upper-middle income country by the year 2025.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you may continue after the lunch break.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Sitting is suspended for lunch till 1.30 p.m. , .. 1.30 .

, ..130 .

Sitting accordingly suspended till 1.30 p.m. and then resumed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Budget 2018 has chartered a strategic new direction led by the private sector which is a refreshing departure from the failed economic policies of the previous regime which championed, "Government-led growth," through the unsustainable practice of using massive foreign loans for unproductive, politically motivated projects.

These past sins have left the country with a heavy debt burden which we are now saddled with. However, led by our Finance Minister, the unity Government has taken up the challenge to put the country back on track to achieve a massive economic prosperity.

In line with the Governments Vision 2025, Budget 2018 paves the way for all our people, especially the low and middle income earners to achieve higher incomes and a better quality of life by utilizing the credit facilities that will be made available to them for entrepreneurial endeavours.

However, economic growth alone will not improve the quality of life of the people. Such growth must go hand in hand with good governance and the rule of law. This Government is firmly committed to both. This is important because at every turn, almost on a daily basis, we are being pulled back by the divisive actions of those who brought the economy to its keens less than three years ago.

Daily street protests, workers strikes over the flimsiest reasons, Sathyagrahas and other disruptive actions orchestrated by the defeated elements are holding back this country from achieving prosperity. While democracy is important and must be safeguarded at all costs, it should not be abused to the extent where it now threatens our economic well-being. It must be kept in mind that tourism is the first casualty of these well-orchestrated disruptions.

The patience and kindness of the unity Government continues to be tested by the defeated elements that keep instigating irrational trade union actions, brainwashing university students and the organization of pointless demonstrations that disturb peace and cripple civil life, especially the tourism industry. When these events are flashed across the international media, it sends a negative signal to those interested in either investing or simply visiting Sri Lanka.

The cost of the strikes and agitations is not only limited to loss of productivity, man-hours, fuel and disruptions of the economy, but also impacts the countrys ability to attract investments, promote tourism, increase exports and develop trade. The knock-on effects of these irrational actions orchestrated by a set of defeated elements will lead Sri Lanka to economic ruin.

Adding to our problems is the unfortunate natural disasters such as drought, floods, landslides and epidemics that plagued the tourism industry this year.

The tourism sector welcomes the progressive steps announced in the Budget that seek to promote entrepreneurship, attract FDI, boost exports including tourism and the revival of small and medium industries through the setting up of a dedicated bank that will collectively help grow the GDP by 5 per cent while targeting inflation at 6 per cent.

The tourism sector also welcomes the VAT refund system for tourists, rationalization of the issuing of liquor licences and associated taxes and imposition of 1 per cent tax on online travel agents which to some extent will help generate income from the informal sector.

This Budget coupled with the leadership of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will ensure that the Unity Government is on a course for a long innings in the service of the people.

The achievements of the Unity Government just over the two years are remarkable. I would like to mention here some foremost achievements among them. They are as follows:

restoration of democracy, re-instituting of law and order and rule of law, strengthening the reconciliation process, transparency in Governance and providing all citizens the right to information, re-establishment of good relations with foreign countries through balanced foreign policy, restoring the confidence of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and saving the former President from his hallucinated fears of the electric chair, restoration of GSP Plus, reducing the cost of fuel and gas and many other economic benefits and development of the tourism and export industries.

This Government with its astute diplomacy and statesmanship has won back international goodwill and support. This will facilitate global inclusion and restore respect for the Sri Lankan passport. The passing of the new Inland Revenue Act has simplified tax revenue collection leading to the economic stability and growth. This Budget assures that the environment will not be compromised in the pursuit of sustainable growth. As a matter of fact, there are many proposals that promote green energy and preservation of the environment.

I commend the Hon. Finance Minister for the emphasis placed on modernizing both the agricultural and industrial sectors, for focusing on diversifying our export portfolios, employment creation, infrastructure development, investments on housing, roads, health and education and provincial development.

This Budget makes Sri Lanka an attractive proposition for foreign investors with its conducive policy framework. The Budget rightly recognizes the need to promote investment areas with high impact to the economy due to value addition and employment generation. The key sectors in this regard are tourism, agriculture, fisheries, livestock, poultry and manufacturing.

I am thankful to the Hon. Minister of Finance for considering our input on the formulation of the wide range of proposals that will benefit the tourism sector. We must face the reality of declining foreign remittances mainly due to the adverse geopolitical developments in the Middle East. This could be offset by enlarging the tourism industry targeting more tourist arrivals to the country.

The Budget 2018 facilitates the three-year Tourism Strategic Plan that aims to increase the tourist arrivals to four million by the year 2020. The hotel associations are upbeat due to the progressive Budget Proposals such as the credit facilities for refurbishing and upgrading the hotels.

The Budget has also recognized the potential of water sports which is rapidly growing in popularity, hosting of

595 596

international competitions and duty waivers for the import of surfing items, jet skis and leisure boats. Special mention has been made for promoting aviation based sports which are relatively new to Sri Lanka.

Apart from these, we welcome the proposal to develop six historic forts sites in the coastline,; upgrading of railway stations on the upcountry line; development of domestic airports to facilitate tourism; development of two national parks; establishment of lifeguard centres and tourist police units; introduction of Sri Lankan street festivals in foreign cities and development of Branding Sri Lanka Cuisine initiative which will collectively contribute to the growth of tourism.

The people of Sri Lanka should be happy to note that the Government is committed to pursuing an equitable policy on wealth generation and distribution of income to all its citizens. Pursuant to this, the Budget proposes substantial capital allowances for investments in the North, the East and the Uva Provinces and the remote areas in order to generate employment and growth.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, as things stand, we are still a public sector-driven economy. Any development-oriented Budget plan or vision will be attainable only with due performance and execution of policies by our public service. There is an urgent need for reforms in the public service. In this context, I commend the Hon. Minister of Finance for the proposal to set up a monitoring unit to ensure proper implementation of Budget Proposals.

As much as we plan to create an export-led economy, it is important that the Government receives the support of all concerned, especially the business sectors and the chambers.

Some of the other progressive proposals I have seen in this Budget include empowering the farmer and agricultural sector envisaging transformation to commercial agriculture as the way to the future, proposal to strengthen family security with free health facilities and insurance cover for school children and extension of health insurance to retired government servants.

We are also pleased to note that the Hon. Minister of Finance has realized that a major stumbling block to our growth especially to the tourism sector is the outdated legislation that is in place. In this regard, we welcome his efforts to introduce new legislation, particularly to replace the 150-year old Customs Ordinance, 105-year old Excise Ordinance, the Inland Revenue Act, labour laws, legal, banking and public sector reforms to suit the modern requirements. These actions will remove the bottlenecks that impede our growth.

We are aware that the road ahead is not a bed of roses but one full of thorns. We are at the mercy of global interactions and the massive debt repayments that have to be made thanks to the Rajapaksas are very real challenges.

However, despite these constraints, we see light at the end of the tunnel. I congratulate the Hon. Minister of Finance for giving us hope and a year to look forward to and I wish him every success in making Sri Lanka a land of prosperity.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . The next speaker is Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have ten minutes.

[5.51p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you Hon. Presiding Member for giving me this opportunity.

I must congratulate the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media for presenting a very good maiden Budget. Normally, soon after a Budget, there will be criticism; newspapers will criticize everything. But, this time, I think, it is minimal, which shows that this is a balanced Budget accepted by everybody and we too, as part of the Government, are very happy.

I am actually very happy because Rs. 3,500 million has been allocated for education. We know that the Hon. Minister of Education started an ambitious programme called, " - ." I can remember, during the time of the earlier Government, each AGA Division had only two schools. But, once our Government came into power, that has been changed. My Electorate had only six schools but finally, we ended up with 32 schools and the construction of many of those have already been started and I am sure, with the allocation of such a large amount of money, we will be able to complete this ambitious programme.

It is not only that, but our Minister of Education has also started the "Smart Classroom" concept. As you know, sometimes many students fail to pass the G.C.E.O/L Examination by getting just a few marks short. As the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Thusitha Wijemanna mentioned, those children are unable to decide what to do. They are unable to move forward. But, with this "Smart Classroom" concept, for which Rs. 755 million has been allocated, those children who are unable to pass the O/L Examination are able to decide on their future. So, I must thank the Hon. Minister of Education as well as the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media for allocating such a large amount of money for that.

Then, we come to the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways. The Hon. Minister of Higher Education and Highways and Leader of the House is here. We, as Members of this House, are really thankful to him because each and every Hon. Member got a very large amount of money for the last two years and we were able to complete the construction work of roads. This time also a large amount of money has been allocated and I am sure the Hon. Minister will be able to help us in the future too.

Hon. Presiding Member, I just went through this document. Rs. 3,000 million has been allocated to my Electorate, Aruwakkalu in Puttalam for the waste disposal project. Three days ago, we completely cleaned our city because dengue has become a real menace there. Unfortunately, all the drainage work in Puttalam has

come to a standstill. So, I brought this to the notice of the Hon. Prime Minister and then to the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media and the estimated amount of funds that we need was informed to them. What we need is only Rs. 295 million. As I said, because of the dengue problem, we have done our work; we have cleaned the whole area and we are following the instructions of the MOH. But, it is very unfortunate that leftover water in the drains has become a real menace now.

.

So, please consider this, because Rs. 295 million is just a small amount when you compare it with the big amount of monies which have been allocated for another purposes. I request the Hon. Minister of Finance to consider this and allocate this amount of money, so that this menace could be eradicated from Puttalam.

I must also thank the Hon. Minister for allocating Rs. 2,750 million to rebuild the houses for the people in Mannar. Actually, this problem exists in one part of the Puttalam District. As you know, over 100,000 people came to Puttalam during the war and they have been residing there. After the war, some people stayed there and the others had gone back to their respective districts. Still there are 40,000 people who come from Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu. Though they are residing in Puttalam, they want to go back to their respective districts. Therefore, they have not been registered in the Puttalam District; they are not voters of our District and they want to go back. But, for the last one-and-a-half years, they were unable to go back to their respective districts because of this housing problem. I must again thank the Hon. Minister for doing this because the people who want to go back to their respective districts can go back and restart their lives. Today, they are unable to even get a letter from the Grama Niladhari of the Puttalam District because they are voters of other districts. Therefore, I think the decision taken by our Hon. Minister of Finance is a very good move, especially, to solve the problem of these people.

Now, I would like to come to the tourism sector. As you know, especially, the Kalpitiya area has really become a tourism area. The Hon. Minister has allocated money for the development of many forts including the Kalpitiya Fort. Also, I would like to mention that the tourists who come to Kalpitiya area are all middle-class tourists. Though the framework has been set, it is very slow. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to expedite this programme through the Ministry.

In addition, Hon. Member, I would like to mention that once the tourists land in Katunayake Airport, most of them find it difficult to get into another plane. There are well over 3,000 to 4,000 acres of land and 150 hotels in Kalpitiya. You can see that a lot of tourists are now coming to Kalpitiya daily. We have the Palavi Airport, which is about three miles away from the Puttalam Town, by the side of Kalpitiya area.

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Two years ago the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva came to Puttalam, visited that airport and said that he wanted to develop it, but unfortunately it has not happened. My view is, if we can redevelop it, we can attract more tourists and that will be a very good advantage for the tourism industry. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to consider this also. I think, they are going to develop four airports in the country. If we can develop this airport also, it will be a very good move for us in the future and through that we can improve the tourism industry there.

Sir, in Puttalam, there is a famous Tamil village known as, "Udappuwa." Unfortunately, that village is surrounded by the sea from one side and by the lagoon on the other side, so that they are unable to expand their land area. Also the land by the side of the village has been taken over by outsiders and therefore, the village cannot be expanded. So, for the last 20 to 30 years, people there have been suffering. Very recently, Sir, we tried to help the people there. In 1965, about 250 acres of land was handed over to that village. Thirty five to forty land permits were issued. Then from 1960 to 1970, people lived there. But, after about 15 to 20 years, those lands were taken over and handed over to outsiders to do prawn farming and other activities. Though all those activities have now stopped, unfortunately, those lands have not been given back to them. Only 65 acres of land has been given to the Udappuwa Village. Our request is, whatever land belongs to that village - about another 150 acres - must be given to the people of the Village, because it is unable to expand. Many lands have been released from the North and the East, but, this particular land in the Puttalam District has not been released. People of that area are all fisherfolk. They have been living there peacefully. They have never had any problem. But, what I feel is, in about 20 to 25 years, the number of families will increase and they will be unable to move about because they will not have an inch of land. I would like to request the Hon. Minister to consider this matter.

The Hon. Minister of Higher Education and Highways is also here. I can remember that the Hon. Prime Minister said, The day that people in Jaffna can reach Colombo in four hours, I will be the happiest man. Now it takes over eight hours to reach Colombo. But, there is a road between Mannar and Puttalam through the Wilpattu Sanctuary. That road is made motorable - even today you can travel on that, but it is a gravel road. If that could be tarred, then people from Jaffna can come through the Sangupiddy Bridge along the Mannar Road passing Puttalam and the distance will be shortened by 120 miles. We have been agitating for the last 10 to 15 years to develop that road so that people could travel easily. But, unfortunately, it was not done. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to consider that. With regard to that road through Wilpattu, I know there is a problem with the Department of Wildlife Conservation. But, all over the world, there are so many roads running through sanctuaries. So, why is only this road not allowed to be

developed? Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to discuss this with the Hon. Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife and all those dealing with the environment and develop that road and remove the restrictions, so that the people from Jaffna can come along that road, probably within five to six hours to Puttalam.

Then moving on to the transport sector, from Colombo to Jaffna, about 150 to 200 buses pass through Puttalam at night. For the last one month, five major accidents took place on that road. Sir, last week, a bus toppled, seven people died and about 15 people were critically injured. After that, there was another accident and that, too, happened in Chilaw. In another previous accident, a bus knocked against another vehicle and then, against a tree and the young conductor died on the spot. All these accidents happen on this road at night. There are two main reasons for this. One is, the "Yal Devi" train running from Colombo to Jaffna, which is comfortable and cheap for the people, does not have enough security officers, therefore, people are frightened to travel in that. So, I request the Hon. Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation to consider that fact and have more security officers deployed, so that the number of people travelling by bus can be minimized. Another train can operate to Jaffna at night.

Another request was made by the DIG, Puttalam with regard to this particular bus trip from Jaffna to Colombo or from Colombo to Jaffna, covering over 240 miles and which takes about eight hours. That is, at night, only one driver drives a bus on that trip. Just imagine a driver starting this trip at 10.00 p.m. and going on driving till 6.00 a.m., covering that distance. I think the DIG has already proposed to the IGP that two licensed drivers should be in a bus. Unfortunately, when one of those accidents took place in Chilaw, there were over 20 government servants working in Puttalam travelling in that bus. They too got injured. Some of those critically injured people had both their legs fractured. Therefore, my request is, each and every bus travelling from Colombo to Jaffna or from Jaffna to Colombo must have two licensed drivers so that they can take turns in driving. These are little things that need to be addressed. How many lives have been lost as a result of not addressing those issues?

So, I feel that what the previous Governments had not done, we can do, not only to satisfy the people, but also to avoid all these accidents. Also, if the Hon. Minister of Higher Education and Highways can develop the road from Mannar to Puttalam via Wilpattu, things can be improved a lot.

Sir, I am very happy to take part in this Debate on the Budget 2018, by which we have satisfied everybody. I think every institution and every section of the people are happy with it. If we can complete all what is proposed in this Budget, people would be satisfied.

Thank you very much.
