( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, you may speak now. [3.17p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for this opportunity to speak a few words on this amendment that has been presented to the House by the Hon. Prime Minister.

As the Hon. Prime Minister said, this is an important piece of legislation that the Government brought in. In respect of the aftermath of the war, there are a number of things that needed to be done. Truth had to be ascertained, justice had to be done, reparation needs to be made and guarantees of non-recurrence had to be ensured. In that respect, this was one small "baby step", as I said when we debated the principal enactment last August.

It is a matter of regret that although the Act was passed in August last year, to this day, it has not been in operationalized. I am happy that the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena clarified that as well. One sees the amendment that has been now placed before the House just to remove one Clause, and one sees that that has been made the apparent excuse for not operationalizing this very important, yet small step, in the direction of reconciliation in this country. It is an important step, as the Hon. Prime Minister himself said, that relatives of persons who are missing must know the fate of those who have gone missing. It is a horrendous crime to disappear people and the Government has taken the second step of gazetting and bringing in the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill to make that an offence. One hopes that also will not be delayed and that will be brought very soon to this House.

The delay in operationalizing cannot be said to be this small amendment that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna wanted. Once the Speaker signs a Bill that has been passed, it becomes an Act and this does not have to be brought into operation by a Minister. It is in operation. When the President allocates subjects and functions to various Ministers, there is a practice of identifying the different pieces of legislation under different Ministries and that has not been done. That not being done cannot be the reason for several steps that could have been taken by the Act that has actually come into operation with the signature of the Hon. Speaker.

I was hoping that the Hon. Speaker himself would be in the Chair when I said this. Being the Chairman of the Constitutional Council, he could have taken certain steps. The Constitutional Council has to appoint the Commission Members for this Office. Now that is a

responsibility of the Constitutional Council. The Minister has no role to play in that. Therefore, for almost one year, the Constitutional Council also has delayed being remiss in making those appointments. The Minister has certain functions to perform; where it says, "the Minister shall" - that Minister perhaps needs to be identified and until that identification is done, it may not be possible for the Minister to perform those functions. But where it is the responsibility of the Constitutional Council, there need not have been any delay and I think the Constitutional Council has failed to appoint those Members of the Commission and I trust that that will be done without delay.

There was a question asked about the Minister of Defence, His Excellency the President. I saw somewhere recently - I think in a speech he made in Sampur recently - the President has said, once this Amendment is passed, he will identify the Minister and gazette it under that particular Minister. I hope that guarantee will be fulfilled. Although this Office does not confer civil or criminal liability on any person, the functions of this Office is a very serious function; is an important function. It sets in motion a process through which the next of kin can actually be satisfied about the fate of the missing person. It is not enough merely making statements and saying, "Well, if they are not in detention or they cannot be found, either they must have left the country or they must be all dead". That will be a very insensitive way that a government deals with this serious issue of persons who have gone missing. There must be a process and I am glad that this Office is to be set up because this is the permanent mechanism, a mechanism that the world recognizes to be the right process through which all relevant inquiries can be made, so that the relatives can actually be satisfied that every effort has been taken to find persons who are missing.

The fear of the security sector in this regard is unfounded. Persons have been made to disappear not only by the security forces. It is true that several surrendered to security forces and thereafter have gone missing and the Government and the security forces must bear responsibility towards that and when inquiries are made, I believe, that will come out. But, over a long period of time through this protracted conflict there were others also who were responsible for disappearing people. At different times, in different places, people knew if somebody went missing where to go and look for them. For instance, when the Paranagama Commission held its sittings in Jaffna, people who gave evidence very clearly said, When my son went missing, I went to the EPDP office and asked, 'Why are you keeping my son there? and they gave us assurances, We will release them soon. All of these came in the newspapers. So, there was a time when disappearances were carried out by the EPDP. There were times when disappearances were carried out by several other armed groups in Vavuniya, in Mullaitivu, in Mannar and in Jaffna. Given periods of

1727 1728

time and places, our people know who carried out these disappearances. The truth with regard to all of these must be ascertained; must be brought out.

The LTTE too conscripted people, at least during the last stages of the war. It may be, some people will not say it for fear that they will be called, traitors. But, these are facts that are known to our people and one cannot hide this. It is important that the truth is brought out. Only when the truth is brought out, can there be true reconciliation. So, I urge the Government not to be fearful to operationalize this Office. It must be done. Everyone must know as to who did what, so that other steps that we take towards reconciliation can be meaningful; can be something that is evenhanded; it cannot be one-sided that all will take due responsibility of what they have done during this period.

I want to say a few words with regard to the Amendment that was brought to the Births and Deaths Registration Act since the Hon. Prime Minister made mention of that. We find that although Certificates of Absence have now been made possible, in actual fact, people are facing severe difficulties in obtaining these Certificates of Absence. There is no clarity with regard to this. People are fearful that if they obtain the Certificates of Absence, no further inquiries will be made; nothing can be further from the truth. Certificate of Absence is the first acknowledgement by the Government that that person is missing. Thereafter, the fate must be ascertained and if it is ascertained that the person is dead, then a Death Certificate can be issued. But the reason why a Certificate of Absence is issued is so that there can be certain other remedial measures that can be taken. The Office of Reparations must come into being and there must be other consequences with regard to dealing with property that was owned by the person who was missing, even marital rights and so on. The persons will benefit if they have a Certificate of Absence of their next of kin who has gone missing.

The officials in the District Secretariats and Divisional Secretariats also seem unaware or not very clear as to the provisions with regard to the Amendment that was made. I am told people are being misled with regard to this and I would like the Government to make clear, even through advertisements, pronouncements and perhaps through circulars issued to Divisional Secretaries and District Secretaries, the true position with regard to the Certificate of Absence so that our people will not be sent from pillar to post and will not have to be in a state of not being clear as to what they should do. Some are told, Well, if you obtain this, then no inquiries will be made. Some are told, Only if you get a Certificate of Death, then certain legal consequences can follow. So, there is a large amount of suspicion as to what a Certificate of Absence can accomplish. I urge the Government to make that clear.

With regard to operationalizing this Office on Missing Persons, we do hope that this long delay- I say this is an unwarranted delay because there was no necessity to wait for this Amendment. Pieces of legislations are passed in this House; Bills are passed and made into Acts. They are amended from time to time for various reasons. Merely because an Amendment should be made, it cannot be the reason why that Act should not become operational. This Amendment removes one Clause where the Office on Missing Persons was initially, specifically enabled to enter into contracts with certain entities, but that does not actually prevent this Office from entering into agreements, arrangements with any entity. This is a superfluous provision that is being removed, and that is why, I think, we will have no objection to this Amendment.

Thank you.

[3.31 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) (Amendment) Bill though enacted, had not been put into operation. We heard from the Prime Minister certain assurances have been given about the need to bring a closure to the misery of the people who have had their own kith and kin going missing during the period of conflict in this country, particularly, issues relating to the final phase of the war that ended almost seven - eight years ago, in the year 2009.

Now, it is important for us to bear in mind that the issues pertaining to the transitional justice agenda, that we had committed ourselves too, after the Resolution in October, 2015 in Geneva, has four important limbs. As to the limbs relating to, we can deal with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and an assurance of non-recurrence and steps to be taken to ensure non-recurrence of these issues of disappearances and the other is of course, the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons. The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran who spoke before me very rightly said that that is a very small step towards the transitional justice programme towards which the Government has made its commitment. Then, we have the need to establish the Office for Reparations. Then, of course, we have the other more controversial judicial mechanism with a special council and various other appendages that are required. This particular discourse is perceived as something that is having a lack of progress

1729 1730

[ .. ]

2017 21

in its implementation. I, as a leader representing a minority party, cannot run away from the realities. The culture of impunity and the triumphalist rhetoric that has persisted in this country ever since the war had been the cause for the lack of progress.

Now, midway through this Governments tenure, we unfortunately are witnessing once again the re-emergence of the partisan interests come into play. The re-emergence of partisan interests and their politics has been the main cause for these delays. For instance, our Government itself is comprised of a broad coalition of several political parties as well as when this broad coalition came, we also had within us several civil society organizations which came together to bring about a regime change in order to get rid of the disillusionment and anger that was there among the people particularly as a result - I mean, there were issues of corruption and various other issues and we have pledged to go forward and implement various programmes in order to achieve those objectives. But, when it comes to issues of transitional justice, I mean, we have to admit the re-emergence of these partisan interests that has now come into play.

Let us also look at the Hon. Members of the Joint Opposition here. They form a part of the ruling party which is on this side and we cannot deny the fact that there are significantly varying views on the causes of conflict and also on the economy. So, this is retarding the progress of an administration and that lack of progress is also having an impact in our commitments given in international fora like the United Nations Human Rights Council. This is something that we cannot run away from because it has been perceived over a period of time that our commitments are vague and that we fell short of our commitments made before the Human Rights Commission.

Now, we should not forget the fact that we co-sponsored the Resolution. Having co-sponsored the Resolution, the readiness of our Government to commit to the Resolution in full while taking ownership of its terms is also important. There has to be a timeline, within which all these commitments have got to be followed up. Of course, we can take some respite by the fact that since the Resolution of October, 2015, there has been a regime change in the United States as well. The new President and his team do not seem to be pursuing human rights agendas in other countries as aggressively as the former regime. Therefore, there can be some of those hawks who are looking to renege or to get away from internal obligations, maybe, hoping that the current US Administration may look away for a while and that might give us an opportunity to once again start shifting the goalpost.

This is where that whatever the Hon. Prime Minister assured this House becomes very important. He very clearly said that he wants a closure to the misery of the

parents and the relatives of those people who had gone missing. Particularly, the implementation or rather the conduct of the Office on Missing Persons cannot, by itself, fulfil the requirements without criminalizing disappearances. It is very important that enforced disappearances as a crime has to embodied in our penal statutes; it has to be brought in as a separate statute or as an amendment to the 100-year old Penal Code. So, "enforced disappearances" have to be made criminalized and together with that, we have to have security sector reforms.

Now, security sector reforms is another issue. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, Sir, I am winding up.

Then, of course, the release of lands is also connected to all these issues. In the theatre of transitional justice, the release of lands also comes up. A certain extent of lands have been released, but then, there are large segments of land in the Eastern Province which are occupied by Army and Navy camps. There are very plush hotels that have been built by the armed forces sitting on lands from which the people of the area have been earning their livelihoods. They have lost those lands. In the Eastern Province, I do not see much of a change. Of course, in Valikamam North, perhaps some lands had been released and some other lands are also in the process of getting released, but then, what is happening to the other lands in the Eastern Province? For instance, in the Thoppur village, there is a 10-houses scheme where an Army camp has been sitting for several years. They moved one camp, but despite the request, they are keeping the other camp. I had gone and met the Defence Secretary since he happened to be my own Secretary once. I am told that he is coming before the Committee on High Posts today because he is going to Germany as our next Ambassador. I had persuaded him several times to look at the grievances of the people in the Eastern Province, where large tracts of land have been occupied by the security forces. Those are private lands, which need not be occupied by the security forces after the war.

Therefore, I think the setting up of the Office on Missing Persons alone, Sir, is not going to solve the problem. We need to follow up on the rest of the pledges that we have made in Geneva. I would like to bring this to the attention of the Government through you, Sir, and conclude my speech.

Thank you.

[4.09 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees. We have been given an opportunity to say a few words on this law of the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) (Amendment), which had been passed by Parliament. Consequent to this Amendment that is being framed in regard to that law, the Amendment is of not much consequence but may I use this opportunity to state a few words both in regard to the law and also in regard to the manner in which this law has not been implemented since its enactment in August, 2016. There is a Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council in October, 2015. It took one year for the law to be enacted and we have almost come to the end of another year and the implementation of the law has not yet commenced. This is what we are all concerned about. We are gravely concerned because it is the view generally accepted that when a person has been compelled to go missing, that offence is, in fact, more serious than even a murder. In the case of a murder, a man is killed, it is known that so and so has been killed and any action can be taken in regard to that crime; the offender can be apprehended; he can be prosecuted or efforts can be taken in that direction. But when a person goes missing, that is the beginning and the end of the story unless there is some action that can be taken to trace that person. That is why, Sir, this law was enacted.

There is a public outcry, particularly in the Northern and the Eastern parts of the country on account of the fact that a large number of persons have gone missing. It would appear from the complaints that have been made to different Commissions that have been investigating this matter that over 20,000 persons had gone missing, according to the complaints made. Even in regard to security personnel, there is a complaint that over 5,000 persons have gone missing. That should also be investigated. Just as much as the complaints made in regard to missing persons of the North and the East are investigated, even the complaints made in regard to the security personnel who have gone missing should also be investigated.

I want to say, Sir, that from the time of the adoption of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution and from even before that, we have exerted all the possible pressure on the Government to act in regard to this matter; we have discussed this matter in Parliament; we have raised this issue in Parliament through Adjournment Motions; we have discussed this matter with His Excellency the President; we have discussed this matter with the Hon. Prime Minister;

We have discussed this matter with the Hon. Foreign Minister. We have discussed this matter at different levels in Government and we were disappointed and we are even now disappointed that there has been an inordinate delay in regard to the dealing with this very grave and serious issue despite the fact that it has had a very, very traumatic impact on the lives of tens of thousands of people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces whose kith and kin, husbands, sons and daughters have gone missing. So, we think Sir, that there should be no further delay in regard to this matter. This matter should be dealt with expeditiously. I have looked at the law and, of course, the Office on Missing Persons is going to be in Colombo. We would very much request that there can be an Office in Colombo, but there must also be an Office at least in some part of the Northern Province - either in Vanni or Kilinochchi or Mullaitivu or Vavuniya - where persons can complain and it will be much more convenient for them if that Office is situated in Vanni.

Sir, the date of operation of the Office on Missing Persons Law has not yet been determined in terms of Section 1 (1) of the Law. I think that should not be delayed any longer. With the passage of this amendment, that should be determined; the Minister responsible should be identified and the Law should come into operation without any delay whatever. This Law has sufficient power, Sir, because there are seven persons, who will be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. They are persons who are required to have experience in handling matters of this nature and they have got the power to search and trace the missing persons. They can establish tracing units that can deal with the task of searching for missing persons. There can be reparations granted to these people, psychosocial support can be given in order to enhance the social and economic conditions of the persons who have been traumatized as a result of the missing persons and warrants can be obtained from the Magistrate to look for these persons, to search for these persons and to enter any premises to conduct a search. There can be even excavation, exhumation of suspected gravesites where missing persons could have been buried. So, I think, Sir, the law has sufficient teeth to set in motion a process, which everyone would have to take seriously and, I would urge the Government, since there has already been a considerable delay in this Law being implemented and persons have been missing for a long period of time, several years long before the war, during

the war and after the war. There should not be any further delay in regard to this matter and it should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.

Sir, there is a general thinking among some sections of our society that we, as a party, have not exerted much pressure on the Government in regard to this matter. The matters that I have mentioned earlier in the course of my speech, would indicate that, in fact, we have done our very best to get the Government to act. But, unfortunately the Government has been slow in acting, possibly for two reasons. One is the campaign carried out by the Joint Opposition in particular, that national security is being threatened as the result of these things being done and secondly, that the war heroes who fought the war against the LTTE are sought to be prosecuted as a result of this law being implemented. This is not correct, Sir, because, after all, the fact that you trace the persons who have gone on missing, does not mean in, anyway, that national security is threatened, nor does it mean that soldiers who fought in the war are going to be prosecuted.

That is not the purpose of this law. The purpose of this law is to trace, discover and find out what happened to missing persons and if it is possible, to release them and make them available to their kith and kin and if that is not possible, to issue a Certificate of Absence. Then, they can use that certificate, that document, to be in a position to address various matters of concern to them in regard to relief, rehabilitation and resettlement. For various things that they are entitled to, they can use that document to address those issues.

Unfortunately Sir, in our part of the country we, the Tamil National Alliance, have some political opponents who have been rejected by the people. They contested the election in 2010 and they were given a licking; they contested the election in 2015 and they were given a licking and those persons who are not behaving now can be assured that they will be given a licking at the next election. That will also happen. They are carrying on a propaganda against the Tamil National Alliance which is a moderate political party. I take pride in the fact that I am a moderate; I take pride in the fact that I want reconciliation in this country; I take pride in the fact that I want all the people in this country to live together as the people of this country on the basis of equality and justice, but there are some jokers in our Provinces who do not appreciate these things; who always want to confront everyone. That is not our goal, Sir. Our goal is to bring about peace in this country by giving the Tamil people in this country a status which will enable them to have an adequate measure of self-rule in the territories which they have historically inhabited. That is our purpose. There are some people on our side who do not want that achievement. They want trouble; they want conflict. It is only when there is trouble and only when there is conflict that they can politically survive. If there is no trouble, they cannot politically survive.

1743 1744

So, Sir, the Government should not make things even more difficult for us by not implementing the law. The Government should implement the law and I would urge the Government not to delay these matters any longer. The law should be implemented with commitment and as I said before, I would strongly urge the Government to establish this Office in some acceptable place in Vanni in consultation with the people to make the implementation of the law convenient from the point of view of the people.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan.

[4.22p.m.]

.. ( , , ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Thank you Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees for giving me this opportunity. Today the Hon. Prime Minister submitted his Amendments to the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill. Therefore, I wish to speak a few words on it.

Sir Lanka's law enforcement procedures have recognized for decades that citizens have a right to obtain State assistance in finding missing family members through a complaint made at a police station. This procedure has been used in diverse situations of personal experience within families. However, in periods of internal conflict and breakdown of law and order, and since the first insurgency in the South in 1971, there has been a growing phenomenon of missing persons as victims of abduction and enforced disappearances. Families have also had to cope with the reality of persons missing in military action during the armed conflict.

The Sri Lankan State, the legal system as well as procedures of law enforcement agencies have all therefore recognized that the families of missing persons have the right to know what happened to that person and their location or place of residence.

It has been accepted that their families are entitled to know the circumstances in which they went missing or whether their death occurred after they went missing.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Edward Gunasekara to the Chair?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara - Minister of Sports) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Edward Gunasekara do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. EDWARD GUNASEKARA took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, they have a right to information on the cause of death, the location of burial, where ascertainable, and to receive the mortal remains of the missing person.

Successive Governments have appointed special Commissions to investigate issues of missing persons under specific circumstances. For example, the Presidential Commission to Investigate into Complaints Regarding Missing Persons - PCICMP. The final LLRC Report, in paragraphs 9.48 and 9.50, reminds that these Commissions have recommended measures to respond to the phenomenon of disappearances, including a special mechanism to address these issues and prevent further occurrences. The LLRC Report, however, refers to the failure of successive Governments to implement these critically important recommendations.

The LLRC Report points out that an initiative on missing person is one aspect of a long-term effort to achieve reconciliation and resolve conflicts that have emerged in the post-Independence period in Sri Lanka. They refer to the fact that reconciliation is a process and that closure is the first difficult emotive step for victims who have suffered the anguishing experience of a missing family member. The Report concludes that all efforts should be made by law enforcement authorities to trace the whereabouts of missing persons and ensure their reunification with their families.

In October, 2015, the Government of Sri Lanka reviewed these realities and recognized the importance of responding to the issue of missing persons. In co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution 30/1 and undertaking the commitment on responding to the issue of missing persons, the Government of Sri Lanka reaffirmed the view of the LLRC that establishing an Office on Missing Persons - OMP - would not merely give the necessary individual relief, but that it is also a first and necessary step in the path to national reconciliation after decades of armed conflict. In paragraph 4 of the UNHRC Resolution, the Government of Sri Lanka made a commitment to set up an Office on Missing Persons and an Office for Reparation, adopting a comprehensive approach to dealing with the past through a full range of judicial and non-judicial measures.

Article 12 of our Constitution guarantees to every individual in the country the equal protection of the law. Consequently, where there have been incidents of missing persons including those missing as victims of abduction, persons missing in action or otherwise, missing in connection with armed conflict, political unrest and civil disturbances, the State or the Government is constitutionally bound to take all necessary measures to search and trace the missing persons, to protect the rights and interests of the missing persons and their relatives and most importantly, to ensure non-recurrence of such incidents.

Legislation to establish a mechanism on missing persons is, therefore, a commitment undertaken by the Government of Sri Lanka to afford the equal protection of law to the people of Sri Lanka under its own Constitution. It is also in furtherance of the implementation of the LLRC Recommendations on a very serious problem that has not yet been addressed. It also fulfils the obligations of international law by Sri Lanka as a Member State of the United Nations.

The Office on Missing Persons will be testimony to the commitment of the Government and the people to reconciliation and respect for human rights. It will help to heal the wounds of polarization and disaffection in a post-conflict society.

It is important to highlight here that the Office on Missing Persons is neither a judicial body, nor is it an accountability mechanism. In fact, it is important to note Section 13(2) of the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Act, which expressly provides the findings of the OMP shall not give rise to any criminal or civil liability. Consequently, no person can be prosecuted for a criminal offence or be sued under civil or administrative damages based on the findings of the OMP.

In the above context, it is also important to draw your attention to Section 15 of the Act, which provides for complete confidentiality of the information provided to the Office on Missing Persons in confidence,

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any written law. Such information cannot even be obtained under the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016 and be compelled to be disclosed even under a court order in terms of Section 15(2) of the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Act.

The OMP addresses the grievances of all missing persons and of families of missing persons in the country without any ethnic division. Contrary to some of the statements made by even the so-called senior counsels to mislead the public, a simple reading of Section 27 of the Act clearly proves this. Section 27 defines the term missing person for the purpose of the Act to include the following persons: persons who are unaccounted for and missing in the course of or in connection with the conflict that took place in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces or is a member of the armed forces or police who is identified as missing in action. So, the OMP will also try to trace the fate and the whereabouts of the remains of the thousands of members of our own security forces who valiantly fought the war and have been missing in action. For example, this mechanism will, hopefully, provide some closure to the families of the 600 plus policemen who went missing and were killed by the LTTE in 1990.

The Act further defines the term missing person to include those who are unaccounted for and missing in connection with political unrest or civil disturbances. For example, we know that thousands of Sinhalese youth went missing in the 80s consequent to the JVP insurrection. Their mothers, fathers and families have not received any answers as to the circumstances under which they disappeared. The OMP will be in a position to provide them with the closure they have been awaiting vigilantly for decades.

In the Act, the term missing person further includes those who are unaccounted for and missing due to enforced disappearances as defined in the International Convention on Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances. For example, this country has experienced large numbers of journalists being abducted and being made to disappear during the different phases of our history. The OMP will provide some answers to the families of those disappeared journalists and of numerous persons, whose fate is unknown. It is, therefore, clear that the OMP is not a mechanism established to address the needs of any specific ethnic community or any specific situation. The law was passed to establish a mechanism that would address the serious grievances of the people of Sri Lanka across the board, of those of the North and the South, the East and the West, of Tamils, Muslims and all the people without any ethnic division.

The OMP is a permanent institution, not an ad hoc structure set up to address disappearances in one particular era. I draw your attention to Section 10(2) of

1747 1748

the Act, which provides that the mandate of the OMP shall extend to missing persons notwithstanding the time period in which they went missing. Thus, the Act has the mandate to address the disappearances not only in the past, but also of any person going missing even in the future. This will heighten awareness of the problem of missing persons amongst the population and deter future occurrences.

For those who have argued that the OMP has been set up for any other purpose other than humanitarian purposes, I draw their attention to the Preamble of the Act and particularly, to Section 2 which sets out the objectives of the Act, namely, I quote:

"(a) to provide appropriate mechanisms for searching and tracing of missing persons, and to clarify the circumstances in which such persons went missing, and their fate; (b) to make recommendations to the relevant authorities towards reducing the incidents of missing personswithin the meaning of this Act; (c) to protect the rights and interests of missing persons and their relatives as provided for in this Act; (d) to identify proper avenues of redress to which such missing persons or their relatives may have recourse.

I also wish to underscore that the Chairman and the Members of the OMP are appointed by none less than His Excellency the President on the recommendations of the Constitutional Council. The OMP is a much-needed humanitarian effort that is long overdue. I ask the Hon. Members of this House to visualize how each of them would feel if, God forbid, one of their own loved ones went missing. Firstly, if you cannot find that person any longer, would you not want some answers? Would you not want to know if he or she is alive or dead? And if, God forbid, that person was killed, would you not want to give that loved one his last rites?

There are thousands of citizens of Sri Lanka - Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims - who have been waiting for this moment for years and decades. It is the Governments paramount duty to provide them with some relief. And I appeal to the Hon. Members of this House on both sides of the Floor not to politicize this issue. It is a humanitarian issue and firstly, as fellow human beings and secondly, as democratically-elected Members of Parliament, it is our civic and constitutional duty to provide the long-overdue relief to the pain and suffering of the families of the disappeared.

The House has already passed the law and the Act is now part and parcel of the laws of the country. It is now our constitutional duty to duly implement it. Therefore, I ask the House to support the proposed Amendments to the Act to facilitate the due implementation of this law, which is of critical importance to Sri Lanka.

Thank you very much, Sir.

[5.54 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, the 11th of August, 2016 was an important day in the modern history of our country. It was also an important day for this House. On that day, this House unanimously approved the Bill that was before us on establishing an Office on Missing Persons.

By taking this important step to establish an Office on Missing Persons by an Act of Parliament, we sent an important message to all the people of our country; a message which echoed throughout the world. After two insurrections in the South of our country and after a prolonged conflict in the North and the East, we showed the world that day that we have now turned a new leaf in our nations journey. We showed the world that this House is united by compassion for all the people in all parts of our country who have suffered the fate of having their loved ones join the ranks of a category called missing persons. We also told the people of our country, loud and clear, that this House stands firm in protecting the fundamental rights of all Sri Lankans provided for in the Constitution of our country and, helping to heal the wounds of our people. We united that day to show the world by our actions that we in this nation are, in fact, guided by the teachings of Gauthama Buddha that we are governed in our actions by extending compassion for the grieving mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers in our country.

As you are aware, Sir, the mothers and the fathers agonizing over their missing children and the wives and children, grieving over their missing husbands and parents is not a phenomenon that is confined to any particular part our country. There are over 5,000 missing security forces personnel in this country. Their mothers, fathers, wives, children, sisters and brothers are still waiting to know what happened to them. There are mothers and fathers in the South of our country who have been grieving for their missing children from the 1980s and 1990s and are still living with the hope of finding out their fate. The mothers of the North and the East of our country, continue to fast and go on processions, grieving and crying and urging us to find their missing children.

Hon. Presiding Member, today, we have before this House, an amendment to the Act that was adopted on 11th of August and certified on 23rd of August last year. This amendment which was proposed in this House on the 11th of August, could not be incorporated before the approval of the Bill on that day due to the atmosphere that prevailed in this House. Therefore, steps have been taken

1777 1778

[ ]

2017 21

to introduce this amendment through this Bill that is before us today. I urge all the Hon. Members of this House to support this amendment.

His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, just last week, demonstrated his statesmanship, empathy, humaneness and respect for the grieving families of the missing during his visit to Jaffna. Those families, like the families of the missing from all regions of our country, who were consulted during the island-wide consultations conducted by the Consultation Task Force last year, long for clarity about the fate of their loved ones. Our Prime Minister has been echoing this message for the last couple of decades that natural justice should take place and he has been leading this from the forefront from all ends.

This Office is not our countrys first attempt to resolve cases of the missing. Previous attempts included steps taken during the 1990s and the appointment of Paranagama Commission. However, they were not comprehensive in nature and were limited in scope. This Office is of a permanent nature and has a broad mandate given by this House to search for and trace missing persons and to clarify the circumstances of their disappearance. It will be tasked with centralizing all available data on missing persons and will make recommendations to relevant authorities to protect the rights and interests of missing persons and their relatives. It will also make recommendations aimed at making sure that incidents of this nature will not happen in the future in our country. It will serve as a reminder to future generations of our country of the importance of ensuring that problems are resolved through peaceful means; it will be a reminder to us, all of the youth, from all parts of our country that this nation lost, and help us and generations to come, to resolve to never allow a repetition of such horrors.

The Office on Missing Persons will not prioritize the missing and disappeared of one community over another. It will investigate the circumstances of the missing irrespective of the date of disappearance. Members of the Armed Forces and the police missing in action, those missing in the context of the conflict in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and those missing from political unrest and civil disturbances from earlier decades, will also fall within the mandate of the Office on Missing Persons.

Sir, some of the Hon. Members of Parliament have attempted to mislead this House and the public of this country by stating that this Office has a prosecutorial or judicial mandate. If they only spend some time to read the Act carefully, they will realize that the mandate of this Office is purely humanitarian. It does not have any prosecutorial or judicial powers. Its aim is to ensure that we find answers for the grieving families and that we ensure that we take the required steps to make the people of our country enjoy sustainable peace and prosperity at least in the future, with no chances of the horror of

violence and pain that the people of this country had to face in the past ever being repeated again.

Sir, this is not an issue to be politicized. The question of the missing is a critical humanitarian concern. Every human being with an ounce of compassion can relate to the anguish of the families who do not know what happened to their loved ones. If one of our own children, if one of our brothers or sisters, were to vanish without a trace, imagine how distraught each one of us would be. If years passed since the incident, without a sign for us to mourn or to hope, our pain would not diminish. We would always wonder what happened to them. We would continue to wonder whether they are alive or whether they are dead. We would carry the agony of not knowing what happened to them, all the way to our graves, while our children and grandchild will also continue to carry this pain.

As a responsible Government, as a responsible State, as a responsible community, and as a responsible people who care for our fellow citizens, we must untie to take steps to establish this Office without delay and show that we are a compassionate nation.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , next Envoy on Youth . . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Sir.

On behalf of the Sri Lankans, I would like to read out very proudly the Official Media Release on this appointment that was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. It states, I quote: SECRETARY-GENERAL APPOINTS JAYATHMA WICKRAMANAYAKE OF SRI LANKA AS ENVOY ON YOUTH.

United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres has appointed Jayathma Wickramanayake of Sri Lanka as his next Envoy on Youth. She will succeed Ahmad Alhendawi of Jordan to whom the Secretary-General is grateful for his dedicated service in addressing the needs and rights of young people, bringing the work of the United Nations closer to them. The success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development depends on empowering young people as rights-holders, agents of change and torchbearers.

Having represented and motivated global youth development on an international level since the age of 21 notably during high-level United Nations initiatives including the declaration of World Youth Skills Day,

Ms. Wickramanayake has also played a key role in transforming the youth development sector at the national level, notably through the creation of a large movement for civic and political engagement of youth people named Hashtag Generation.

Presently working as an officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, Ms. Wickramanayake has previously served as Secretary to the Secretary-General of the Parliament of Sri Lanka (2016 - 2017), Project Officer - Youth, One - Text Initiative in Sri Lanka (2015 - 2016), Member and Youth Lead Negotiator, International Youth Task Force of the World Conference on Youth 2014 (2013 - 2014) ....

But it is a - [Interruption.] I cannot make it as a Statement at this particular moment, Hon. Member. Sir, I am only reading out a good notice coming from the Secretary-General - all we previously had were negative notices with sanctions coming on. This is at least to say youth in Sri Lanka is going to represent the world.

It further states, I quote:

.... and Official Youth Delegate to the United Nations, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development (2012 - 2013). She was furthermore a Senator in the Sri Lankan Youth Parliament (2013 - 2015).

Born in 1990, Ms. Wickramanayake is reading for Master of Development Studies, at the University of Colombo and holds a Bachelor degree in Science, from the same university.

So, on behalf of the President, the Prime Minister and the fellow Sri Lankans, I congratulate her and I wish that more of such talent from Sri Lanka be recognized. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much. . - seven minutes - . [6.13 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all, I must bring to your attention that what has been raised by the Hon. Minister is not a point of Order. If you give the Ministers their way, you cannot conduct the Proceedings of this House properly.

Anyway, I want to thank you for allocating seven minutes of the time allocated for this Debate to express my views on the Amendments to the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) (Amendment) Bill which was presented last year in its originality.

Might I digress a little bit from here, because I think there was an attempt by the Members of the Government to show what happened on that day; to show that it was a fault of the Joint Opposition. It should be noted that the Bill, according to the Order Paper, was supposed to be taken up for debate on the third week of May. But, on the request of the Government, the Bill was forwarded to the first weeks Business, nonetheless the Opposition was in agreement as long as two full days of debate were allocated.

It all started, Hon. Presiding Member, with the Prime Ministers condescending attitude. He felt that the LAWASIA Conference, for which he was the Chief Guest, deserves more merit to attend than a debate of national importance. He wanted a vote by 11.00 a.m. the following day. To the Prime Minister, I would say that this Bill, - the first of four such Bills, which will fundamentally influence on how the country is governed -

is a love child between the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the Human Rights Council in Geneva. This Bill is so treacherous and it will start a witch-hunt against our valiant armed forces. It does not even merit a two full days debate.

Even if the Prime Minister was ignorant of, or chose to ignore the structural changes in that - whether the citizens of this country are to adhere to laws of this country or to higher international laws, or how such international forces can use OMP to manipulate the course of this country which can be in the geopolitical interest of superpowers but detrimental to our own fate - the Prime Minister cannot surely give more importance to a law conference. Sir, even if the Prime Minister was ignorant, which he was not, he should have given the due courtesy to the citizens of this country, as this is a very divisive Bill, probably along ethnic lines. The citizens of this country deserve more respect and deserve to hear a debate on the merits of this Bill without being pushed aside by the Prime Minister. To be candid, Mr. Presiding Member, even for the Speaker, it was not one of his brightest hours either. For a man who has had such an illustrious career and now at the pinnacle of the temple of democracy, he should have done better. And the excuse that the order was decided at a Party Leaders' Meeting by the majority also does not hold. If this was always the case, then we would not need a Speaker. A system where Party Leaders by majority can decide on anything will surely suppress the true voice of the Opposition, as was the case that day. So, it is imperative for the Hon. Speaker to ensure that the voice of the Opposition is heard. The decision should not only be made on technicalities but more on spirit of democracy.

Now, there is also this small matter that when this Bill was passed, the Members of the JVP agreed with the Bill on conditions upon three amendments which the Government agreed. However when the Bill was published, those amendments were not included. I am not sure whether Section 11 (a) which provides the Office on Missing Persons the power to enter into agreements with any person or organization was one of those amendments, but even if it was so, then what has happened with the omission of the other two amendments? Does this make the Leader of the House who is present over here a liar as he agreed on the due amendments? Even if we are to agree that the publishing of the Bill on the first instance was done erroneously, the amendments could have been included now. The fact that it has not, goes to show that the Leader of the House indeed told untruth and led the JVP down the garden path.

Now, it is my opinion that this Bill should not be passed at all. This is just the first step of the Geneva Resolution 30/1 that was brought upon by this Government on itself. Co-sponsoring the Geneva Resolution 30/1 and the signing of the peace accord giving recognition to LTTE rule in the North and the East

1785 1786

will no doubt go down in the post-independent Sri Lankan history as the most treacherous acts which a Government has brought upon its own people. It is small wonder that both Governments were led by the same man.

Let me emphasize this but it is not to say that a country that has been ravaged by a 30-year war does not need any closure and reconciliation. Of course, it does. And of course, we believe a mechanism must be developed and be given due process. We believe that process should be local with observers from friendly nations, and most of us believe that the process should be about reconciliation and not retribution. The process cannot be one-sided either as in this case. We already know of the members of the armed forces killed and missing in action. So any Commission or any Office which seems to find information on one side without highlighting the atrocities of the other seems to be one-sided.

There is also the question that it is not morally correct to punish valiant soldiers who brought peace upon this Island. Without them, we would still be ravaged by war. It was only recently that the British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the UK forces will be exempted from any European Human Rights Laws in conflict zones. It seems odd here that in Britains case it is protecting its soldiers whereas we are only too happy to build the foundation for the prosecution of our forces. Also, Sir, more importantly, action taken against the armed forces - even a small issue like not issuing visas- would be viewed by the majority Sinhalese as an attempt to punish the soldiers who has brought them victory.

So, for all these reasons, I do not believe that the Office on Missing Persons will bring reconciliation. In fact, it will do exactly the opposite. It will create a deep rift between the Sinhalese and the Tamils and can lead to more hatred in the country, which is already deeply divided. So, for all these logical reasons, this is not a good piece of legislation and this must be repelled at its earliest, but not without finding a meaningful solution for closure for the victims of the war.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Now, wind up, please. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Since the time does not permit me, I do not wish to speak further, but I think we really need to study the nitty-gritty of this Bill and also look into how this Bill could be used by foreign powers to manipulate the governance of the country. Thank you.

We have got the issue of weighbridge sorted out. I will take a personal initiative on corruption with regard to payments and attend to it because I see payments being made in an ad hoc manner. As we all know, the local bodies have been corrupt, but with regard to the Colombo Municipal Council, there needs to be a focus and a direction.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Please do not disturb my speech. -[Interruption.] I will have an investigation on that. As regards to Meethotamulla-[ ] . . . [ ] - I do not want to be disturbed by both my Hon. Friends, the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana and the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage. You all can make allegations. But we have to work together. Dengue has increased not only in developing countries but in developed countries also. It is not only infrastructure that matters. , . But, now in unclean water also you get Dengue mosquito breeding. Therefore, we all have to act with responsibility. It is easy to point the finger at the Government; it is easy to point the finger at anybody. But, we also have to know that this is a national issue and we should not try to politically benefit from this issue. It is very unfortunate that some Hon. Members of this House want to point fingers at the Minister of Health and the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government. This Adjournment Motion also has referred to the fact that unavailability of elected Members in the Local Authorities is the reason for this.

I would like to inform this House that the Bill is ready with all the amendments. Yesterday, it appeared in the Order Paper. So, as regards to holding of the election we have taken all the necessary steps. This Government for a moment is not fearful of holding an election. It has happened so because the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa did the delimitation to his fancy. He did it in the way he wants. That day, I told the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma also, if he was responsible for delimitation this could not have happened. But unfortunately, it was done according to the whims and fancies of one particular individual.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I would like to educate the Hon. Members that His Excellency the President called for meetings of all Secretaries and Commissioners and we have been having

dialogues continuously to deal with the dengue problem. Our Ministry has also continuously summoned the Secretaries and Commissioners. Therefore, we need not be educated. You all are trying to educate us on how to function, but I think, because of the manner the previous regime functioned only it was thrown out of office. So, give this Government an opportunity to function without being critical and finally the people will judge. You all are trying to say that during your time it was very rosy - I was also in that Government - and criticizing the fact that there is dirt on the streets. We know why. . . . , . . . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to end my speech by saying that they should act with more responsibility; they should not play politics with dengue; they should not play politics with dirt because these are national problems. Also Members should not use an Adjournment Motion dealing with dengue to request the Government to hold the election under the earlier system. The reason why you wanted this Adjournment Motion is to do bankrupt politics and not for the benefit of our masses.

Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to. .. 7.28, 2016 08 , 2017 22 .. 10.30 .
