(a) Is he aware that-

(i) the loan scheme named SMILE III was implemented for small and medium-scale industries and micro industries on a concessionary interest rate and with a two-year grace period in order to empower entrepreneurs;

(ii) the Project Director published newspaper advertisements on 10th July 2016 and gave publicity regarding granting of loans;

885 886

2017 27

(iii) even though ten commercial banks came forward to grant loans under this scheme and nearly five thousand applicants applied for those loans, granting of loans has now been stalled;

(iv) even though most entrepreneurs have completed signing of deeds of security and deeds of mortgage by making preliminary expenses, loans have not been granted; and

(v) this situation has resulted in improvement of businesses and emerging businesses being stalled while being a blow to the national economy?

(b) Will he inform this House as to why people were inconvenienced by publishing newspaper advertisements on 10.07.2016, if granting of loans is not possible?

(c) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka) .

.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . .

( ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce)

(a) (i) Yes. SMILE III is a revolving fund loan scheme which has been implemented since 2012. Fund allocated to this loan scheme was Rs. 11.2 billion with interest. The account is maintained with the Central Bank. (ii) Yes. The Project Director did publish newspaper advertisements to make the public aware of the existence of such a loan scheme. Otherwise, they would have not known about the loan scheme. (iii) Since 2012, the Project Management Unit has received 13,385 applications out of which 11,309 applications have been selected as eligible to consider granting of loan by the respective Committees. The Project Management Unit has already granted loans, through the selected banks, to 2,530 applicants amounting to Rs. 11,200 million.

(iv) Does not arise in view of the answer to (a) (iii) above.

(v) This situation has neither affected any

business nor is a blow to the national economy. The loan scheme contributes for the uplift of the national economy. Already 2,530 small and medium-scale industries have been benefitted by this loan scheme.

(b) People were not inconvenienced by the publication of the advertisement. They came to know about the loan scheme only through this advertisement. I assure the Hon. Members of this august Assembly that each and every eligible applicant will be granted loans through this scheme. However, time delay is unavoidable due to immediate non-availability of funds.

(c) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka) . 206 . 2062. -2062 .- . . .

. . . . But, this is a very special loan scheme. It is very unfortunate that once a person asks for a loan under this Scheme, it is granted under the regular scheme. This has happened. And, if I ask for a loan of Rs. 100,000, first they approve it, but they grant only Rs. 50,000. So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am asking the Hon. Minister whether he is aware of these things.

Then, you should have an assessment of how many loan applications you will receive and how much seed capital you all have. All those have to be taken into consideration. I feel that you have not taken these factors into consideration. Otherwise this will not flop. This Scheme is a flop.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) what is the interest rate of the loan? Everything depends on the interest rate.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) It is less than the rates of other loans. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Can you specifically say what the special interest rate of the loans is? - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka) Hon. Deputy Speaker, that was the expectation. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Exactly. ( ) (The Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka) But it is not happening. This is granted as a regular loan.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) People are expecting a concessionary rate.

ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES ACT: RESOLUTION

[. . 66.29] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) :

"6979 6 2 2067 25 2029/23 2067 25 .

(2017 2 .)" . . Question proposed.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the House, you have eight minutes. You can make your speech now if you wish. Otherwise, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran will start.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . websites . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, you can commence your speech. [11.30 a.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Government has placed before this House for debate the Proclamation by His Excellency the President declaring as essential public service under the Essential Public Services Act, No. 61 of 1979, the supply or distribution of fuel including petroleum products and gas and all services, work, labour of any description whatsoever, necessary or required to be done in connection with the discharge, carriage, landing, storage, delivery and removal of oil or fuel from vessels within any port as defined for the purpose of the Customs Ordinance. This is being done under the Essential Public Services Act, No. 61 of 1979, a very important Proclamation. There was trouble in this House yesterday with regard to the strike action that had been commenced by the employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Sir, I would like to congratulate the President for declaring the supply of fuel as an essential service in this particular context.

It is an important Debate that we are entering today in this House. For long years, we have supported the right of trade unions to resort to legitimate trade union action. I do not think any Hon. Member of this House from either side of the divide will dispute that workers in this country must have right to join and take trade union action, collective action, so that the rights - their rights, rights of the industries that they are engaged in - are protected. But, there comes a time when one asks the question as to whether the pendulum has swung the other way a little too much and today, I think, is an opportune moment to ask that question. Inasmuch as we all recognize and would want to protect the rights of workmen of the labour force of this country, we would also like to see that sacrosanct rights of theirs being exercised in a very responsible and constructive manner. It is a matter of regret that we see strike action at the drop of a hat belittling the most potent weapon in the hands of the workforces.

Trade union action has many facets to it. The Trade Union Ordinance, which is an old piece of legislation declares those rights. Article 14 of the Constitution very clearly protects the rights of workers to join and take trade union action. But, it must be legitimate and responsible trade union action. I believe, I am expressing the general sense of disillusionment of the people of this country today when they see various organizations calling themselves trade unions resorting to what they term "trade union action", but in effect political action, to cripple the functioning of the country.

The leading group of this is the Government Medical Officers Association, a group of professionals who ought to know better, who is said to have taken an oath - an ancient responsible oath - but who behave in this country worse than even criminals at times. I say these words

905 906

[ ]

2017 27

advisedly and with responsibility, because if you deny medical attention to those who require it, then that is criminal negligence and you do it to attain your own selfish objectives - I would say, it is worse than criminal. I will not say all the medical professionals, but, today, certainly those who have taken control of this association called the GMOA, are often holding the country to ransom. This feature has been there for quite some time; it is not something arose yesterday, and they have used this important resource that has been bestowed on them by the taxpayers of this country, because they have gone through the tertiary education, they have gone through the medical education in this country for free. The whole country has paid for that. Why? Because we want doctors, we want health professionals attending to the sick. We have what most countries in the world do not have and that is free medical care. To sustain that industry we produce doctors, and all the people of this country - even those who do not pay direct taxes but everyone in this country pay indirect taxes - even the poorest contribute towards that medical education and they behave in this most irresponsible manner.

When I saw the gazette notification with regard to workers in the fuel supply area I wondered about the medical professionals. Of course, you do not have to declare that as an essential service. Everybody knows that medical services are essential. You do not have to have a gazette notification calling it an essential service. They know it better than anyone else for they take that oath, the Hippocratic Oath and dare behave in this fashion actually putting the lives of people physically and literally at stake. I personally know people who have died for lack of medical attention in the last couple of months whenever GMOA has gone on strike for some flimsy reason or another.

I am not saying that strike action is always irrelevant. There may be times when that is necessary, not only for doctors but even for others. There may be times that it is necessary and we must safeguard that right of the workers. But the tragedy today in this country is that the workers themselves are putting that right at risk. They will no longer have that right if they abuse that right; if they behave in a fashion that is most irresponsible. There are many actions that are taken as trade union actions. Lockout is what the employer can do but strike is the ultimate weapon. It is not the first thing that you do. But the tragedy, as I said, today is the trade unions do not know of any other trade union action. They do not know that they must give notice of trade union action. They do now know that they have to start with different kinds of protests and that if nothing works, if everything fails-

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) A process. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, there has to be a process. If everything fails, it is only then, you take this extreme step of going on strike. Transport is, in fact, essential to the life of the

community. You cripple that - even if it is some legitimate concern that you have, then those must be addressed first. There must be discussions held and constructive engagement must be entered into. In the context of what is happening today, I do not believe that strike action is appropriate even as a last resort for the demands that these trade unions have put forward. That is a matter that concerns the economy of this country, the relationship this country has with other countries, the serious debt this country has been committed to and the Governments action to come out of that debt - a whole host of issues, not just a very narrow issue about Hambantota, Trincomalee or anything like that. It has to be looked at from broader concept.

These persons may be stakeholders; I do not deny that. They may be stakeholders, but there are many more stakeholders. In fact, the whole country, all the people of the country, are stakeholders in this and in order to achieve their narrow political objectives to resort to strike action is criminal and I am glad the Government, at least now, has taken swift action to declare it as an essential service. Declaring it as an essential service is not sufficient, but stern action must be taken to enforce the Proclamation that this is an essential service. Not only this, even the other areas that are essential to the life of the community must be treated as such and it is unfortunate that such action has to be resorted to. But, in the context where persons behave in this irresponsible manner, we believe the Government is left with no other option, but to use the law which provides for such action. Thank you.

[1.43 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Presiding Member, we are debating today a Proclamation made by His Excellency the President pertaining to an essential Public Service relating to fuel including petroleum products and gas and various aspects relating to that particular matter.

In this country, we have had trade unions for a long period of time and I think trade unions are a vital and important component of a democratic society. The rights of workers need to be protected at all points of time and I think trade unions play a very important role in ensuring the rights of workers are protected. In that sense, Sir, we have always respected trade unions, we have always given our support to trade unions to ensure that workers' rights are protected. Trade unions also sometimes engage in trade union action for national reasons, for reasons which they claim are related to the country's future.

I think, the action currently contemplated by the trade unions relating to petroleum and gas was on account of certain decisions taken by the Government in respect of certain proposed projects in the South of this country and the East of this country and the trade unions seem to think that that should not be allowed, that it should be resisted and they had initiated some trade union action to cripple certain essential services relating to gas, petroleum, oil and so on and the President's Proclamation is to ensure that these services are available to the people of this country without any impediment.

Sir, when the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena spoke in the morning, in fact, he referred to me and called upon me to be supportive of democracy. He, in fact, requested that elections be held in this country soon - not Local Government Elections or Provincial Elections but elections to the national legislature should be held soon - and he said that this Government must go home. This has been a consistent objective of the Joint Opposition. They have been consistently demanding that the Government must be crippled, that the Government must be toppled and that the Government must be prevented from functioning in keeping with the democratic verdict of the people of this country.

I think, Sir, we cannot forget the fact that there were Elections in 2015, first the Presidential Election in January, 2015. Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa who had served as the President for two terms sought a third term by even amending the country's Constitution to enable him to seek a third term and the people very politely said to him that he would not be elected President of the country. He was defeated by President Maithripala Sirisena quite convincingly. In fact, President Maithripala Sirisena defeated him more convincingly than when Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected President in 2005 for the first time.

So, the verdict of the people was that they would not have Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the President and in terms of our Constitution and the democratic verdict of the people, that is a verdict which has to be respected for a certain period of time and no one is entitled to demand that that verdict be abrogated or that that verdict be toppled or disregarded. That would be undemocratic. What followed on that? After the Presidential Election, we had the Parliamentary Election in August, 2015 and Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa was projected by the Parties in the Joint Opposition now and by the UPFA as the countrys Prime Ministerial candidate. The country was aware that the choice, the contest was between Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who then functioned as the Prime Minister of this country, who had been appointed as the Prime Minister of this country by President Maithripala Sirisena on his election as President - he was Prime Minister until the Elections were called - and Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa who was the candidate of the UPFA for the position of Prime Minister. The people once again delivered their verdict. The people, once again, came to the conclusion that they would not elect Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa as their Prime Minister and they rejected that claim that he be made Prime Minister. You cannot deny these facts.

The UNP won 106 seats and the Joint Opposition, the UPFA won 95 seats and the difference was 11 seats. There were 6 seats won by the JVP and there were 16 seats won by the TNA which were not supportive of Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa. They were all against him. And despite his effort to become Prime Minister, after his failure to be elected as President, there was a verdict of the people that he could not be Prime Minister and that they would prefer Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue as Prime Minister. So, what is the support that you want me to give you? There is a verdict of the people, a clear verdict of the people both at the Presidential Election and at the Prime Ministerial Election that Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa is neither acceptable to them as President nor as Prime Minister. That is a very clear democratic verdict. You cannot get over that.

You cannot topple governments as you like. If you are able to topple governments as you like despite the verdicts of the people and despite the provisions of the Constitution stating that governments elected are entitled to continue to function for a certain period of time unless they are toppled in keeping with the Constitution on the basis of a No Confidence vote in the House or something like that. You cannot topple governments through strikes; you cannot topple governments through conspiracies, you cannot topple governments by persuading essential services to breakdown and that is what this Proclamation made by the President seeks to prevent. Trying to topple Governments by getting essential services to break down, I think, is utterly, thoroughly undemocratic and cannot be accepted and in the context of the Oppositions demand consistently and continuously that this Government must be toppled, one is entitled to think that the Joint Opposition which is headed by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa is responsible for a number of disturbances that are taking place in this country which are impeding and interfering with governance.

931 932

People are entitled, Sir, to the benefits of proper governance by a government elected by them. I think I must also caution this Government. You must have the spine to govern. You must make decisions that are necessary. The countrys economy is in a very serious state. The country is neck-deep in debt. The country must be redeemed from this position. If this country is to be redeemed from this position the Government must take bold steps, the Government must take bold decisions and the Government must be in a position to implement those decisions. I think it is your failure to make bold decisions and your failure to implement bold decisions that encourages the Opposition to become difficult. You should demonstrate that you are governing efficiently and effectively. That is your duty and if you do that, I think, you will be in a much better position to silence the Joint Opposition and make sure that you are able to carry on.

I am happy, Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka is here. I referred to you when I spoke on a matter in Parliament a couple of days ago when there was an Adjournment Motion in regard to missing persons. There is an effort being made in this country to show that this Government is about to betray the armed forces in this country. We do not agree with that. There is no effort on the part of anybody to betray the armed forces. The soldiers who fought the war, fought it on behalf of the Government, on the decision of the Government, as per the directions of the Government. There may have been soldiers- there were soldiers- who committed certain crimes. They may be responsible for various matters, but that is not applicable to all the soldiers. You cannot say that every single soldier who fought in the war is a war criminal or that he is guilty of some offense. But, if soldiers are responsible of contraventions, violations of the law, violations of international humanitarian law and violations of domestic laws of this country, they certainly must be dealt with. There is no question about it.

But, we all saw the way in which Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, whom you claimed as being the best Army Commander in the whole world, was treated after the Presidential Election in 2010. You were in prison clothes. We saw you; We felt sorry for you; You were humiliated; you were insulted. You were the Army Commander. You won the war for the Government, but you were treated like dirt. You were charged on frivolous matters, on matters that should never have constituted the basis for a proper charge against anyone, leave aside the Former Army Commander. You were convicted. You were deprived of your Title. That is the way you were treated. How can we accept that these persons who treated you in that way are concerned genuinely about war heroes or about soldiers? Are they not merely trying to provoke tension in this country; to promote communalism in this country; to promote division in this country and to prevent reconciliation in this country which is fundamental for the future of this country? The National question needs to be resolved. It is a responsibility of the Government. We must unite all the people in this country and bring them together.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I am finishing, Sir. How can that be done, if you are going to promote communalism, if you are going to promote division and if you are going to promote rancour? You treat Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka like dirt, and claim to be very concerned about your soldiers. Who will believe this? How can it be believed? So, I think, Sir, this type of thing must stop. We must all work towards a better future for this country. This Government has been elected to be in power. Please, govern! Please, do not dilly-dally. Take bold decisions, implement them and show that you can govern.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. Next, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. [. . 6.58] ( ( - ) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - State Minister of Finance) . , " " . . . . , . , . . , , .
