[5.14p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this important Order under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act.

Sir, I represent the Puttalam Electorate, which is part of the Coconut Triangle that consists of Kurunegala, Puttalam and Colombo. About 20-30 years ago, when we spoke of export items, it was always about tea, rubber and coconut that we talked of. The coconut industry was one of the most important export-oriented industries. Thousands of people were employed in that industry and so many factories were in production. Earlier on, I can remember, so many desiccated coconut oil mills were functioning. In addition to that, coconut was exported. That was the position 30 to 35 years ago.

But, very unfortunately, the situation has changed today. We have come to a position where 50 per cent of the coconut oil mills are closed today. One of the biggest oil millers in Colombo, the BCC, is completely closed now. Fifty per cent of the desiccated coconut mills are closed and coconut has now become only a consumer product. Why has this happened? The reason is, the coconut industry has been neglected. It is not the fault of this Government, which has been in office for the last two-and-a-half years, but the fault of the former Government. It is they who neglected the coconut industry.

For the last 20 years, coconut plantations have been completely neglected; they were not replanted. As you know, there are so many major companies like the JEDB, the Chilaw Plantations Limited, the Kurunegala Plantations Limited and the LRC, which own thousands of acres of coconut plantations today. Very unfortunately, they had not replanted those. When you replant a coconut plantation, a coconut tree will take at least five to seven years to bear coconuts and after that, it will keep on bearing for 50 to 70 years, producing more and more coconuts. All those estates under the LRC earlier on were handed over to these private companies, which have completely neglected those.

Sir, I am in the Sectoral Oversight Committees on Agriculture and Lands. We asked them for details of those estates and when we got those, we found that almost 50 per cent of the estates are barren now. All the coconut trees have died; they have not replanted and in certain estates, they have started replanting some other crop, which is of no use to this country. The reason why the price of a coconut has gone up to Rs. 100 is because

839 840

[ ]

2019 06

the harvest is decreasing. Therefore, this Government has to start replanting the plantations with coconut seedlings.

Today, it is raining heavily in Colombo. But, on the other side of the country - in Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Kugunegala - there is no rain at all. For the last four to five years, the rainfall has come down drastically and we are suffering. So, my request is, start from the bottom and replant the estates.

The Government should get involved in this matter; all the Ministries involved in this industry have to come in. In the dry zone and the intermediate zone, we have rains only for two or three months - I am happy that the Hon. Ministers are coming in - and the coconut cultivation in these zones are going down; trees are dying because of lack of water. So, tube wells and drip irrigation systems have to be given to most of these estates. By providing tube wells and drip irrigation systems at subsidized rates for the big estates, we definitely can keep this industry moving.

Sir, fertilizing is also another big problem for the coconut industry. Today, fertilizer is given at subsidized rates for all the agricultural products including paddy. But, unfortunately, no subsidy is given for coconut fertilizers. A bag of 50 kilogramme of coconut fertilizer costs over Rs. 3,500, which some estate owners are unable to afford. So, they do not use fertilizers for their cultivation and day by day the coconut production is coming down. So, we will have to reorganize this industry and especially we will have to help all those farmers, the estate owners who are trying to improve the coconut industry. If you do all this and if you get hold of lands owned by big companies, that is good for the coconut industry. Right throughout, I have been telling that we have to get hold of thousands of acres of land owned by big companies where they have not cultivated coconut. This is a must. If you can get them, in the future this industry can come up.

The most important thing about the coconut tree is, every part of it is made use of. Not only coconut, coir, then ekel, all these things are exported. So, every part of the coconut tree is made use of; there is nothing that goes waste. Therefore, I hope that all the Ministries get together and revive the coconut industry. If you take my area, the Puttalam Electorate, coconut plantation is done in 90 per cent of the area. But, today, it is dying due to lack of water, and no proper subsidized scheme is there to help the farmer. By giving husk pith and so on, we are not going to improve the status of those estates. Therefore, I request the Hon. Ministers concerned to get together and make a combined effort. The Plantation Ministry, the Agricultural Ministry, especially the Development Ministry, all these, must get together and develop this industry. As I said earlier, this Government is not at fault. This was not done for 10 - 15 years. If they have reorganized the coconut industry 10 - 15 years ago, today we will not be suffering. I request the Hon. Ministers concerned - most of the Ministers are not here- to get together and take the necessary steps to develop this industry.

Another most important thing is auction centres. There is only one auction centre in Colombo. So, the people in the other parts of the country have to come to Colombo to auction their coconuts. My request is, since Puttalam, Kurunegala and Negombo are in the coconut belt, we should have auction centres in these areas, so that the cultivators can auction their coconuts without any difficulty.

I must also mention a problem that we had to face last week. Last week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, some newspapers were saying that small Parties, such as the SLMC, the ACMC and the Hon. Mano Ganesans Party were trying to create problems. I would like to mention one thing. It is we who brought in this Government. I have been with His Excellency the President for 25, 30 years.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up your speech now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Please give me one minute more, Sir.

For all these years, we never had any idea to go against the Government. It is only that we put forwarded some proposals. So, I would like to tell this House that we will never go against this Government, because we are the people who brought in this Government, we are the people who are with His Excellency the President, we are the people who are with the Hon. Prime Minister. Therefore, I would like to say that we will never go against this Government even in the future, but will strengthen this Government and see that the people are benefited.

Thank you.

The Extradition Law of 1977 governs the subject of extradition in Sri Lanka. All subsequent laws with extradition clauses must be read in conjunction with the 1977 Law. A good example of such an extradition clause is section 7 of the Torture Act of 1994. In fact, section 8 of the Enforced Disappearance Bill replicates section 7(2) of the Torture Act. The wording is virtually identical. Thus the Enforced Disappearance Bill does not alter Sri Lankas extradition law; it merely reinforces what other laws such as the Torture Act - an Act passed during the Peoples Alliance government when Professor G.L. Peiris was Minister of Justice - already establish.
