( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Now, this problem regarding the Vavuniya Campus is not due to our fault. You must have five faculties to open a campus. You have only two. So, we had told the authorities of Vavuniya Campus to send a proposal for five faculties. The moment they send the proposal, we will approve it. So, the delay is on the part of the authorities of Vavuniya Campus. There are only two faculties. You must have five faculties. Once they send a proposal for five faculties, we can open it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) Okay. Thank you.

[6.37 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, let me appreciate the Hon. Ministers proposal to strengthen and develop the education sector. I must thank him for that.

Hon. Minister, you are from Kandy, you are in an elevated position. Everything is elevated there. But, we are in the North. I think, the least-developed province in this country today is the Northern Province. Everyone is aware of it. All sectors including education, sports and health has to be elevated. Everything has to be elevated because everything was destroyed by the war in 2009. In another two years time it is going to be ten years. When we compare the development that has taken place in the North, we have been repeatedly requesting the Government to consider this and develop the North in order to bring it on par with other provinces. But, it is very unfortunate that it is not happening. I know you, as a Minister, are much concerned about this. Education is our capital. As you know, mainly in the North, education is our capital and the rest comes subsequently. Anyway, I want to give you some information in Tamil. Kindly, take them into consideration and thereafter, I will come to the subject of allocation.

Hon. Minister, in August, 2017, you had given consent to grant the Vavuniya Campus the University status. But, in the Budget, no allocation has been made to elevate this Campus to the University status. You have allocated money mainly for library and other facilities. As everybody and you know, for the youth in the Vanni District, job-oriented higher education programmes such as ICT, Information Technology and other programmes have to be conducted by the university so that they can find employment easily. But, we do not find any new courses introduced there. The Vanni District is the most affected and the least developed area in the North. Just for namesake, we have a campus and Hon. Minister, even after you gave your consent to elevate this to an independent university, it has not been done yet.

805 806

Then, I will move on to the Technology Degree programmes.

In the Budget, we could see that Rs. 5,000 million has been allocated for new Technology Facilities of seven Universities: Rajarata, Ruhuna, Sabaragamauwa, Kelaniya, Colombo, Sri Jayewardenepura and the South-Eastern University. It is very strange why the North has not been considered under that. You are going to introduce a degree programme for 3,000 students. Why has the University of Jaffna not qualified for that or was overlooked? We would like to get a reply from the Hon. Minister. But more than a reply, we want the University of Jaffna also to be given those facilities and a degree programme to be introduced.

In the Budget, I also noticed that five Technical and Vocational Schools are going to be established in Badulla, Kandy, Trincomalee, Ratnapura and Anuradhapura in three years with technical inputs from the Swiss and German Governments. These Technical Schools will provide world-class training in hospitality management, civil, electrical, motor mechanical engineering et cetera. So, you could see that Universities outside the North are being upgraded and new courses are being introduced, but not in the North. So, we want to know the reason for this from the Government. Why is that? I would not say that you are discriminating us because I appreciate your Budget, but what I say is, there is something wrong somewhere. That is all I can say. So, I insist that these two initiatives be taken in Jaffna too. Please, kindly do that, Hon. Minister.

Then, as you are aware, on the 09th of August, 2017, the Cabinet had approved the construction of a building for the Clinical Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna. They have even met the Hon. Prime Minister to get this expedited. The University of Jaffna has the third Medical Faculty in Sri Lanka, but only that does not have properly structured professional departments with clinical facilities. The Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. S. Raviraj, has written to the Chairman of the UGC about this, but to date, there is no proper reply. Likewise, there is another Cabinet Paper which has already approved Rs. 1,125 million, but it has not been allocated for in the Budget. How can the officials overlook that? There is a Cabinet Paper which has already been approved, but it is not allocated for in the Budget. So, kindly take that into account. It has to be included.

The Faculty of Allied Health Sciences of the Jaffna University has courses on Nursing, Pharmacology, Laboratory Technology and so on. Now, they are also going to introduce new courses on Physiotherapy and Radiography. The particular unit in Karapitiya, Galle of the Ruhuna University was given Faculty status, but that of the University of Jaffna is still affiliated to the Medical College as a unit even though it was started ten years prior to the Faculty of the Ruhuna University.

So, could you please kindly amend these differences? It has to be given Faculty status. It has the qualification. You all have given more consideration towards out of the North, not the North. Sir, please note that the Allied Health Science Unit should be given Faculty status as soon as possible.

Hon. Minister, finally, I want to bring to your kind notice about the roads in the North. Some roads, for which you have made allocations, have not been completed. Still, they have not completed the job of the first road that was given Rs. 60 million. The second road was given this year and they have not even started it. I have a letter with me. You have promised even the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, but it has not been done. Here is the letter. This letter was signed by you. Hon. Minister, the road work has not been started yet. Kindly look into that. When we are given money, we are answerable to the people. I am sure the Chairman of the RDA is here. Kindly take this into account.

There are so many matters. Since my time is running out, I cannot explain those individually. The first phase of the road that was given Rs. 60 million is not over. Only half of the payment is made and the contractors are not continuing with the job. It is more than one year and the public is anxiously awaiting the completion of the road. Sir, please see that the job is done.

There is a trunk road which has not been considered. In Jaffna, there are four trunk roads which were done not under this Government, but under the previous government. The Jafna-Manipay-Karainagar road, which is leading towards a naval point is a trunk road, a RDA road. Why is it overlooked? Please consider this. There are so many Ministries dealing with roads, but none of them are concerned about the roads in the North. I think there has to be a fair allocation. All the roads in the North were damaged due to various reasons such as bombardments and shelling.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .
