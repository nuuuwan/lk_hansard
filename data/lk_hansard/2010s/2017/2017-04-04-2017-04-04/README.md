SITTINGS OF THE PARLIAMENT

0 ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I move,

"That notwithstanding the provisions of the Standing Order No.7 of the Parliament and the motion agreed to by Parliament on 08.03.2016, the hours of sitting of Parliament on this day shall be 1.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m.. At 4.00 p.m., Standing Order No. 7(5) of the Parliament shall operate. At 5.00 p.m., Mr. Speaker shall adjourn the Parliament without question put."

. . Question put, and agreed to. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I would like to refer to the front-page news report of the "Daily Mirror" of yesterday, 03rd April, 2017, which carried the headline Broad agreement on devolution of power. This interview had been given by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran on behalf of the Steering Committee regarding the proceedings of the Steering Committee. What is stated in that headline of the "Daily Mirror" is totally false, incorrect. It is misleading. Sir, I would like to read from that news report. The Hon. Sumanthiran is also here.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, read only the particular portion. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Okay, Sir. It states, I quote:

1205 1206

[ ]

2017 0

The Steering Committee working on Constitutional proposals had broadly agreed on power devolution and the interim report based such concluded matters would be presented soon,...

And he goes on. I do not want to read the whole news item. But, it is the headline which is totally incorrect and there had been no such decision made by the Steering Committee and no authority given to the Hon. Member to make such a statement on behalf of the Steering Committee. So, I hope this would be corrected. Of course, my statement has been corrected and it appears in Todays Daily Mirror. But, what is stated in the headline of yesterday's "Daily Mirror" in relation to the Steering Committee is totally incorrect.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, you can reply to it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, may I say that the news report quotes me correctly and if there is anything that I have misrepresented, as the Hon. Member says, with regard to the Steering Committee matters, he can raise it at the Steering Committee. But, I take the responsibility for this. I have read the news report and it quotes me correctly.
