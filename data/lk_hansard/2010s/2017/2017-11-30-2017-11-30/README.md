( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, he wants to ask the third Supplementary Question.

2393 2394

[ ]

2017 10

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Minister would answer that. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You can ask only two Supplementary Questions now. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, there was an approved Water Supply and Sanitation Project of the ADB to improve the capacity of Iranamadu Tank in Kilinochchi and to take its water to Jaffna. Now, are you all going to continue with this Project or are you going to start totally a new project - that is to collect the rainwater in the Peninsula in the lagoons and then to improve the water supply to Jaffna. I am asking this question because there is an alternative that you are discussing. Can you tell us about it because Jaffna has been suffering for so many years without having drinking water.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) This question, Sir, has been asked for several times and I have replied it.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) He was the former Minister in charge. That is why I asked you to make a comment on that.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I know that. I thank the former Minister for his concern regarding this issue. We have some problems with the farmers in Kilinochchi. But, to overcome that difficulty, we have now raised the bund of the Iranamdu Tank. Now, the capacity of the Iranamadu Tank has been increased and we are trying to convince the farmers of Kilinochchi through that. The political issue is also still there. But, our alternative, of course, is for a desalination project under the Asian Development Bank funding and the tender process is going on. But, that can only be an alternative. We cannot have it as a full-time operation. We need to have surface water supply. This issue is essential. We are also looking at the matter in the Lagoon that you talked about.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, thank you Hon. Minister.

On the other hand, the Hon. Member said that I have not visited Jaffna. But I will make a bet with you that I have been to Jaffna more than you.

Whereupon THE HON. BIMAL RATHAYAKE left the Chair, and THE HON. SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Go ahead, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Chairman, I was making a request to the Hon. Member presiding before you took the Chair, a very humble request, that you would be pleased to permit me to table my speech that has been prepared on behalf of the Ministry to be included in Hansard, since I had to take much of the time allocated to answer certain criticisms levelled against us.

Sir, you are quite aware particularly of certain projects that we are implementing in your own district.

Then, Hon. Chairman, on the question of Treasury Guarantees which are given for local loans and on Sovereign Guarantees which are given for foreign loans, all loans are taken only after obtaining Treasury Guarantees or Sovereign Guarantees which has been the practice as far as we are concerned. I must also say here that during the past few years we have not been allocated any specific sum for investment in the drinking water sector through the Consolidated Fund and we have been asked to borrow directly and that has caused a severe stress on our financial status. In order to overcome that, we are now looking at other means of engaging with the private sector, particularly through PPP schemes. One of the main PPP projects that is to be implemented is presently going through the tender procedure and it will soon be finalized. That is called "Weliwita Bulk Water Supply Project" which will supply water to the Colombo City. Together with that, we are looking at a variety of other options as well.

Sir, I also need to deal with a few other questions that have been raised here, particularly the question of HDPE pipes raised by the Hon. Anura Dissanyake. I must say that there is only one HDPE pipe supplier in Sri Lanka and he has got the SLS standard. In fact, it is a matter regarding which I too intervened and tried to address. I spoke to the Project Director and since there is only one local supplier with these standards, the argument is, in order to invite competition, that we have to call for international tenders. But, this is a policy issue and we must address this issue and support the local industry. Since there is a local industry already producing these pipes, it would certainly be an issue regarding which a policy decision must be taken to support the local industry. This is a matter regarding which I too agree with the Hon. Member who raised this issue.

Then, on several other issues too, we have to give our response. The Hon. Member raised another very serious allegation pertaining to the Polonnaruwa East Water Supply Project. This Scheme, I must say, is covering an area which has been very seriously affected by chronic kidney disease. So, the Cabinet has taken a policy decision that wherever there is an area affected by chronic kidney disease, the Treasury will bear the entire responsibility to pay back the loan. Based on that, though this loan is quite a large amount, we must say that this loan is being procured through the Chinese Exim Bank

2539 2540

on their concessionary loan scheme with a lower interest levy. Though there is only a single bidder whose bid is to be negotiated, we have put in some strict conditions that the contractor will not be paid any price escalation and that the risk of foreign currency fluctuations should be borne by the contractor.

Together with that, a shorter implementation period will be available since the procurement has to be completed by 2019 because there was a Cabinet decision to complete all these projects in the areas where CKD is prevalant by 2019. The Chinese Exim Banks soft loan package is what is being procured for this purpose and this loan will be serviced entirely by the Treasury with no burden on the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. We are also compelled to look into this issue, particularly since we have to somehow reach a 60 per cent target by 2020 and we also have a much bigger role to play in reaching the 2030 - Sustainable Development Goals, which have been identified by the United Nations.

Then, about the new bank loan that we have taken through a Joint Cabinet Paper in order to pay back some of our commitments, that loan has been arranged through the Treasury due to the non-availability of counterpart funds of the Government of Sri Lanka for a variety of loans that we have taken. Those counterpart funds had to be met and then, we have to pay other levies such as the VAT and other taxes that have to be paid to the contractor. Therefore, the Treasury was advising us - three other Ministries together with us - to go for an overdraft from the commercial banks and that too, has to be negotiated by the Department of External Resources.

Then, we will be able to, at least, settle those commitments. In the meantime, the Treasury has fully undertaken to repay that overdraft. Therefore, that again is not going to be a further burden on the National Water Supply and Drainage Boards stressed finances and that should be mentioned here.

There was also a question raised about the Public-Private Partnership relating to a desalination project. There was an unsolicited desalination project which had been awarded to one of those parties that was mentioned by the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Here, I must say that it has not been finalized yet. Only a proposal was submitted by a private party on the request of the Northern Provincial Council and that issue is still pending.

Then, moving on to the issue relating to the salaries of the workers of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, it is true that we had agreed to revise the salaries every three years. A committee has been appointed with the Additional General Manger in charge and that committee will study and provide the recommendations. I also expect the trade unions to agree to a Collective Agreement before we are able to give them another revised salary scheme.

Then, the Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan raised certain issues relating to water projects in the Mannar area.

Uthayapuram, Pesalai and some other areas which he had referred to are included under the Asian Development Banks Project to supply water to the dry zone and presently, they are under a procurement process.

Then, for the project proposed for Sannar, Eachchalampattu and Kayanagar areas, an estimate of Rs. 100 million had been made and we are waiting for some funding to be made available.

I must also add here a few words in Tamil, Hon. Chairman.

1 - 10 . 07 07 / . ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) , ,- ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , ? ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) , . , . It is about the Belgium Water Supply and Sanitation Project which is to be carried out in Wennappuwa, Nattandiya and Dankotuwa areas. The estimate for that was US Dollars 20,000 million. It has been reduced to US Dollars 11,000 million. Now, what they are asking for is another US Dollars 450 million till you finish the Belgium Project. I just want to know about the current status of that Belgium Project to be carried out in my area.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) For that Project, we had asked for some funding from Belgium. In fact, the Hon. Chairman knows that Belgium funding is at a very concessional rate.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But, the loan cycle takes quite some time to negotiate. Of course, the counterpart funding issue, we can sort out. At the moment, the funding option is sorted out through the Department of External Resources.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay. Thank you very much, Hon. Minister.
