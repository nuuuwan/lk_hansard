I shall now quote from the Joint Statement on SAITM Medical Degree issued by the Deans of the Faculties of Medicine. It states,

There has been no Gazette notification that the conditions stipulated by the Specified Authority in Gazette no.1721/19 of 2011.08.30 have been fulfilled.

As of now, SAITM has not obtained the compliance certification (required under the above rule) from the specified professional body, which is the SLMC in the case of degrees in Medicine.

The above sequence of events makes it clear that there were many irregularities, if not outright deception of the public, in the manner in which the SAITM medical degree programme was established.

This is not what Ramesh Pathirana states. This is what the Deans of the Faculties of Medicine state.

Sri Lanka offers free schooling to all students, starting from primary school at the age of five through to the university. According to the statistics in 2013, there are 9,905 functioning Government schools with a total student population of 4 million. Unfortunately, most of them are not able to attend a State university as places are limited and competition is fierce. Only 39,591 students, which means, 16 per cent of them, get an opportunity to enter a State university annually. There are 15 State universities enrolling 105,127 undergraduate and postgraduate students. But, there are another 238,561 students eligible to enter the university. In other way, only 16 per cent of the students enter to the State universities and 84 per cent of the students, who are eligible to enter the universities, do not get an opportunity to enter a State university. This is a disappointment for those youngsters. As I said, 84 per cent of the students do not get a chance to study at a university inside the country and only 16 per cent of the students get good opportunities to get free university education annually. So, I humbly request the university students not to let down the other 84 per cent of the students, as they are your colleagues, who have been studying with you since primary school.

Roughly, 12,000 Sri Lankan students go to study abroad each year. That means, US Dollars 400 million goes out of the country along with those students. This is happening at present. The current world trend of education has completely changed. We are in a globalized world. There are no barriers or differences among the countries and the regions.

The SAITM was recognized as a degree-awarding institute by an Order published in the Gazette Extraordinary, No. 1721/19, dated 30th August, 2011, in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. The medical students graduate from the SAITM are required to obtain provisional registration from the SLMC under the Section 29(1)(b)(i) of the Medical

409 410

Ordinance Chapter 105 to commence their internship training at a Government hospital.

On completion of their intern training, as required by Section 32 of the Medical Ordinance, they are eligible to apply for registration with SLMC to practise as a doctor. As a Government, you have to have a policy to overcome challenges for education in the globe. But unfortunately, educational policies are trapped into politics. Some are trying to come to power with the help of the16 per cent of student population which is entering universities every year. But, please keep in mind that you are ignoring the rest, 84 per cent of the students, who are losing their opportunities to enter universities.

Ultimately, I want to present my suggestions to this august Assembly with regard to the SAITM. The first point is that the student intake should be restricted to once annually with the involvement of the University Grants Commission as is practised presently. I think, now there are two intakes within a year, but it has to be regularized.

The second point is that all the SAITM students will have to be given a chance to get clinical training in the State hospitals and health institutions, especially for Forensic Medicine and Family Health Medicine. Usually, it should be the same with the other sections also. Even though the Government provides them with facilities for clinical training in the Kaduwela MOH and the Avissawella Base Hospital, the Consultants in those Hospitals were threatened through anonymous telephone calls. This is how the educational system is trapped into a problem. This is not the way of handling the problem.

My last point is, if the Sri Lanka Medical Council has a controversial policy regarding the SAITM matter to implement the Court order, the Government has to appoint a special Examination Board under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education immediately without further delay and conduct the final MBBS Examination of the SAITM students who have completed their studies. I feel that the SAITM students will get a chance to prove their ability and protect their dignity through the final Examination.

The Government must create more opportunities for the younger generation to get free education. Free education is a good concept mainly for poor people, but it does not mean restricting higher education only to a certain percentage of students who are entering the Government universities.

I humbly request the politicians to do their politics with public, not with the students and emergency health service units.

Thank you very much.

[4.22 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. Before I express any views in respect of the subject matter today, as a matter of principle, I need to disclose the fact that I have advised the Sri Lanka Medical Council in regard to this issue of SAITM previously. Once before also when I spoke in this House, I made the same disclosure.

Having said that, there are, in my mind, three separate issues that are being discussed today. Firstly, the issue with regard to how the SAITM came about. Secondly, what do we do with this problem of SAITM? That means, what do we do with these students who have been trained there presently? And thirdly, what is the future of either medical education or broadly tertiary education in this country?

Many Members have spoken in this House with regard to how SAITM came about and I am in agreement with a lot of the sentiments that have been expressed. When SAITM was recruiting, at least, the first two batches, there were cautionary advertisements placed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council stating that this is not an institution that is approved by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. It is despite that warning that SAITM admitted students and rashly continued with this education putting the lives and the future of those students at grave risk. That must be acknowledged in any discussion with regard to this issue. It is not only the Governments responsibility and I would say, the Government bears a great deal of responsibility in this, but the owners of SAITM also rashly put the lives and future of these students at grave risk. That is what has led to this situation today.

However, the situation changed slightly after the initial twining programmes were done away with and the training was to be here entirely. Even though the University Grants Commission gave permission to function as a tertiary educational institution, as a degree-awarding institution, the licensing with regard to the medical profession goes through only one gate and that is the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Without obtaining that assurance, through whatever processes that were available, SAITM continued to take more students and trained them and presently, close upon 1,000 medical students who have completed their studies are there in this institution.

As a member of another profession which also has only one gate that licenses our practice - the legal profession - I can understand that strict licensing regime. The Council of Legal Education has to grant that licence. Although the degree training happens in at least three universities in this country with regard to legal education, they only obtain a degree. If you are to obtain the licence to practise as a lawyer, you have to sit one examination and presently, you have to sit all the examinations of all three years that are conducted by the Sri Lanka Law

437 438

College. Similarly, wherever you are trained, Sri Lanka Medical Council should grant that licence. The unfortunate fact is that training standards are so varied even amongst the Government universities of this country and there is no one standard that has been prescribed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. I think, that is a serious error. The Sri Lanka Medical Council must have one standard and if that is to be applied then, any medical student whether they are trained here or abroad can go through that gateway.

The issue with regard to the present situation is that there is a judgment of the Court of Appeal and that must be obeyed. There are no two words about that. Within six weeks of that judgment, if no one appeals, that becomes a final judgment and that must be obeyed. It is futile to discuss the legality outside the court once a student has obtained a judgment there. It is a matter of regret that a student had to go to court and establish the legality of that education when the State should have provided the means and made their future certain without them having to have recourse to court.

Now, the third issue with regard to the future of tertiary education is a separate one. I agree with a lot of sentiments expressed that tertiary education must be open to non-State entities as well. We have come to a level of development in our country where it becomes important, it becomes necessary to open those doors and not shut them. SAITM may be a wrong example of this. I believe, it is a wrong example. But the future of that institution will be determined as to the legality pronounced by court. But that cannot be the standard by which the State takes decisions with regard to opening up tertiary education to non-State entities.

That is a policy issue that must be discussed in full and proper decisions taken. Even if it is medical education there must be a framework set out for non-State actors as to how they commence; how they obtain approval; how they ensure that the graduates who emerge from those institutions can - without having to go to Court and compel the Sri Lanka Medical Council to register them - obtain those registrations. It is a matter of regret, as I said before, that students have been forced to vindicate their legal rights to go to Court and compel the one and only gateway, the Sri Lanka Medical Council, to register them. That is a failure on the part of the Sri Lanka Medical Council; that is a failure on the part of the Government and that is a failure on the part of the owners of SAITM that we have come to this sorry state today. But if we are to move forward, the issue of SAITM, I think, will be decided by court and that must be obeyed. Apart from SAITM, the Government must start a proper discussion as to the policy of opening tertiary education to be conducted by non-State entities.

Thank you very much.

[6.08 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I rise today to discuss an important matter which has been on the forefront of our countrys discourse over the last few years. Sir, as this House is aware, over the last few years there has been a lot of hue and cry about the capabilities and specifically about the degree-awarding status granted to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine, abbreviated as SAITM, in 2011. At this juncture, Sir, given that there is much debate on this matter, from unruly pandemonium in our streets to hazy information being released to the public due to political manipulation and hidden agendas, it is our duty as Members of this House to provide the public with clear and factual information with ample evidence to put this matter to rest, similar to how the

473 474

Court of Appeal reached their ruling on 31st January, 2017, directing the Sri Lanka Medical Council to grant provisional registration to SAITM graduates.

SAITMs Medical Faculty began in 2009, first as an off-shore campus of the Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy of Russia. However, in keeping with the recommendations of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, the letter dated 09th August, 2010 addressed to the Secretary, Ministry of Health by Prof. Lalitha Mendis, the then President of the SLMC, which I am tabling* for the reference of this House, states, I quote:

It is the view of the SLMC, based on legal opinion that SAITM cannot exist as the 'off shore' campus of the NNSAM ....of the Russian Federation. It may however exist as a Degree Awarding Institute referred to in the Universities Act ... and also in the Medical Ordinance ...

The then President of the SLMC goes on to state in her handwriting below the letter under the subheading Advantages of Converting to a Degree Awarding Institute, several advantages attributable to SAITM should it pursue degree-awarding status.

It is with this recommendation from the very SLMC, that it is currently exhibiting unnecessary opposition to its own recommendation, that SAITM applied for approval and acceptance of its Medical Faculty as a Degree Awarding Institute under Section 25A and Section 70C of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.

Having said that, SAITM in compliance with the stated Acts, applied for approval and acceptance from the Specified Authority, which was the then University Grants Commission headed by a Chairperson personally picked by the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and included members like Prof. Carlo Fonseka who is now the present President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council. The UGC, with no recorded protest from any of its members, including Prof. Carlo Fonseka, recognized SAITM as a Medical Degree Awarding Institute, and further in the Gazette published on 30th August, 2011 and thereafter, on 26th September, 2013, SAITM complying with all aspects of the Universities Act, No.16 of 1978, was officially recognized as a Medical Degree Awarding Institute by the then Minister of Higher Education, none other than the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, subject to SAITM meeting applicable conditions within a set time period. I wish to table* both Gazette Notifications for the reference of this House.

At this juncture, in two letters dated the 27th of August, 2014 by the Secretary of the Ministry of Higher Education, the new Specified Authority appointed by the Minister as per Section 70B of the Universities Act,

confirmed that SAITM has fulfilled all conditions stipulated in both Gazette Notifications within the specified time period. I wish to table* both letters from the Ministrys Secretary for the reference of this House.

At this point, it is quite clear to surmise that as both Gazette Notifications stated that the Minister in his delegated powers by an Act of Parliament, namely the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, has the authority to recognize SAITM as a degree-awarding institute subject to conditions, and now that the conditions have been met as confirmed by the letter sent by the Secretary to the Ministry, SAITM is a fully-fledged degree-awarding institute.

It is at this juncture that the Sri Lanka Medical Council was duty-bound towards passing approval with respect to the functioning of SAITM which is in conformation to the prescribed standards, as per the Medical (Amendment) Act, No. 30 of 1987. The SLMC was noticed in May, 2014 that SAITM had fulfilled all conditions with respect to the Gazette Notifications, but it was not until July of 2015, conveniently after the change in Government, that the SLMC decided to conduct its inspection. It is important to note that even though the Hon. Members of the Joint Opposition currently vilify the Court of Appeals ruling in favour of SAITM, as evident in several media statements recently, it was in fact their Government which ushered in the establishment of SAITM in the first place, and even provided scholarships to certain students to be educated at SAITM. Hypocrisy abound.

The SLMC conducted its inspection of SAITM and its facilities at the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital or NFTH on the 13th and 14th of July, 2015 with nine inspectors, with one more joining the inspection team on the 15th of July, headed by Prof. Rizvi Sheriff.

The SLMC submitted its final report with its recommendations to Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, on 4th September, 2015. In the final report, it summarizes SAITMs main deficiencies; general inadequacy of clinical exposure in all areas, lack of facilities for training in practical clinical forensic medicine, and the deficiency in exposure to preventive care services in the State sector. The final report did not provide remedial measures for SAITM to overcome the said deficiencies. The final report goes on to state that the inspection team recommends that the SLMC does not recognize graduates of SAITM as suitable for provisional registration.

However, at this point, it is important to note that the initial report made available by the inspection team states the aforementioned main deficiencies and thereafter states, The Inspection Team recommends that the SLMC recognizes graduates of the Faculty of Medicine SAITM as suitable for provisional registration, subject to the

following conditions, a deliberate and an intended omission from page 18 has been made in the final report. The initial report then goes on to provide five principal recommendations and four additional recommendations.

I wish to table* both the final report and the initial report for the reference of this House to see how page 18 was amended. Also, it is important to note that even the court noted that the inspection team in their conclusion of the final report has surprisingly recommended that the SLMC does not recognize graduates of SAITM but their observations do not match with the final recommendation.

While perusing the Minutes of the special meeting of the SLMC on 7th August, 2015, it can be clearly seen how its President, Carlo Fonseka, deliberately manipulated the proceedings to suit his agenda.

In one instance, SLMC Member, Prof. Narada Warnasuriya, voiced his opinion with reference to the draft letter of recommendation which rejected SAITM. It is mentioned in the Minutes of the SLMC special meeting held on 07th August, 2015. It states, I quote:

Prof. Narada Warnasuriya said that the draft letter is a biased one. He has further said that of the many things mentioned in the letter, he agrees only with the facts that the clinical training provided to students at SAITM is inadequate. He said that many things in the letter are statements with serious inaccuracies.

It further states, I quote:

Prof. Narada Warnasuriya and Prof. Nilantha de Silva argued that the inspection team had a right to make recommendations to improve the SAITM. Prof. Warnasuriya said that in the review procedure carried out in our university system an appropriate recommendation for improvement is a constituent.

I wish to table* a copy of the Minutes of that meeting for the reference of this House to witness manipulation by the SLMC to suit their cause.

Why did the SLMC at the last minute change its decision on endorsing SAITM ? Why did the SLMC go against the findings of its inspection team which provided remedial conditions and recommended that SLMC should recognize SAITM? What about the prescribed standards that the SLMC claims to enforce? Why did the Court observe that the guidelines which the SLMC acts upon does not carry any binding effect or legal basis to act upon? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) I think I have got fifteen minutes, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No, you had only ten minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Okay. Let me finish.

The answer is simple. That is, political agendas, subordination, corruption, selfishness, arrogance and the influence that the trade unions like the GMOA have over the SLMC. It is important and worrying to note that the SLMC is made up almost to its entirety of members of the GMOA. If the GMOA and the SLMC are so interested and consumed in the health and well-being of the community and the people, then why do they manipulate and brainwash innocent university students who should be studying instead of roaming and protesting on streets? They demand free education to become medical doctors at our expense - the taxpayers - and thereafter demand the right to continue selling healthcare at a price that they determine to the same taxpayers who paid for their education. Are they really interested in our well-being? The only solution is to ensure that the community at large is also represented in the SLMC in a democratic and transparent manner, similar to what is being practised in Britain, Australia and Canada. This equal representation would not allow such a dangerous precedent gripping our country again.

Therefore, I request this House to urge the SLMC to implement the Court decision and allow the graduates to obtain provisional registration.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have only three minutes. [6.20 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

Sir, first and foremost, I would like to remind you that, as far as I know, we are short of 16,000 doctors in the country. Annually, only 1,400 doctors pass out. If your take the Puttalam Base Hospital in my Electorate, the doctors' cadre is 90 or 95, but only 50 doctors are there. So, my question is, if our necessity is 16,000 doctors and if only 1,400 doctors pass out annually, how are we going fill that requirement?

As far as I know, there was a similar problem with regard to nurses also. The Hon. Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine took a decision to increase the intake of trainees to the Nurses' Training Schools and therefore, in the future, we will be able to cover the shortage of nurses. But, what are we going to do about the shortage of doctors? Can the Government increase the annual intake of medical students? We may or may not be able to fill the requirement of doctor. So, by closing down all the private medical college, we will not succeed in producing the necessary number of doctors.

There are private medical colleges in other countries. In India, there are many private medical colleges; in Pakistan, there are many private medical colleges. Since we have a shortage of such institutions here, our students go to those countries and study. So, I find no reason at all for not allowing private medical colleges to come up here. The issue of SAITM should have come up a long time ago, but as the Hon. Member who spoke before me said, it never came up. But, after allowing registration of students and all the approvals, restraining an institution like SAITM is impossible now.

Now, just look at the problems of university students. These students, with the greatest difficulty, have entered the university, but today, they are on the roads protesting without studying. I request those students, please concentrate on your studies. By being on the roads without studying, you are getting delayed from coming out of the universities. Not only that, if you are to come out of the university in three years, you would take about four to five years to come out. In the meantime, the students who are waiting to enter the universities also get delayed. Therefore, I think it is the duty of the students to do their studies properly and think of their parents. Their parents have been spending a lot of money on their education, thinking of the future of the children. But, very unfortunately, certain politicians, just to fulfil their needs, are instigating those students and they, who must be studying in the universities, are suffering today. At the same time, the students who are expecting to enter the universities are also getting delayed, creating a big time gap. Therefore, I request the students to concentrate on their studies and allow the politicians to solve whatever problems there may be. There may be problems and those must be sorted out. Definitely, to fill our requirement of doctors in the future, SAITM must go on and we need more private medical colleges in the country.
