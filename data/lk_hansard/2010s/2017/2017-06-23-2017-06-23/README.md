( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, we are gathered today to pay tribute to four former Members of this august House. Among them, I must first recognize the services of the late Hon. A.M.S. Adikari, who had been, in fact, a colourful figure to have been serving the people from this House.

In his political career, he had been one of those people who entered local politics at the ripe young age of 23 years, having been elected to be the Chairman of the Kekirawa Urban Council. Since then, the gradual rise of A.M.S. Adikari was a foregone conclusion, simply for the reason that he was a man of the people, who had strived to serve his people, despite successive defeats both in 1965 Election and 1978 General Elections. Having been defeated, he did not give up his commitment to serve the people and ultimately succeeded in winning a by-election in 1974 and came in to Parliamentary politics. Ever since then, with the landslide victory of the United National Party in 1977, he had the trust and confidence of his then Leader, the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, as enunciated by the present Leader, Prime Minister Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. He was entrusted with important portfolios both during the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardenes time and the late President Ranasinghe Premadasas time. He held the portfolios of Minister of Posts and

Telecommunication as well as the Minister of Tourism and also, I believe, he served as a Deputy Minister of Irrigation, Power and Highways and that perhaps was one of those important Ministries, particularly for a Member serving Kalawewa Electorate.

I also have some early memories of the late Hon. A.M.S. Adikari, since I happened to live in Kalawewa when my father was the school principal at the Kalawewa Muslim Maha Vidyalaya. I had lived in the principals quarters there and known the way people have been speaking about the manner in which A.M.S. Adikari behaved during the 1958 communal riots. He was there to see that the trouble does not affect innocent people. There were several Northern Tamil teachers serving the schools in the Anuradhapura District. Particularly, there were several teachers even in my fathers school. It was people such as A.M.S. Adikari who came to the rescue of those innocent Public Servants when those mindless communal clashes took place in 1958. People of the area very fondly remember the services of the late Hon. A.M.S. Adikari. We can speak about his services particularly to Tambuttegama and Galnewa. In all these places, he had built up several public institutions and had helped these areas with services as a Member of Parliament. Hon. Speaker, I would like to pay my tribute to the late Hon. A.M.S. Adikari while sharing our heartfelt grievances with his family.

Since I have got to participate in a function with His Excellency the President at the Sugathadasa Stadium in a while, may I also be permitted to say a few words on the other Votes on Condolence relating to the late Hon. Chandra Ranatunga as well.

The late Hon. Chandra Ranatunga was, once again, another servant of the people, who was known for his humility and attachment to his electorate to such an extent that he never gave up his rural roots. As somebody hailing from the Southern Province, having come and settled down in the Sath Korale area, he had been someone who had practised in the Courts of Mawanella and Kegalle continuously until he took to active politics. His commitment to the people is still remembered. Like, the late Hon. A.M.S. Adikari, the late Hon. Chandra Ranatunga as well, was someone who had no differences when it came to dealing with people of other communities. The Muslims of Mawanella remember his services and his commitment. Whenever there were any minor clashes of a communal nature, the late Hon. Chandra Ranatunga was readily available to defuse those tensions and help the people of the area.

I had also known that during his tenure as a Deputy Minister in charge of construction and subsequently, as State Minister of Construction, he had served immensely, not only the people in his electorate, but also the people of the entire country. His honesty and commitment to social service was something that needs to be mentioned.

1997 1998

[ . . ]

2017 23

He was remembered as a very honest and a clean politician as well as somebody who committed himself to social service. As a member of the Lions Movement, he had served the Lions Movement very dedicatedly and that is something that needs to be remembered.

Hon. Speaker, may I also say that I had the good fortune to be a colleague of his son, Ranjan, who is presently practising in the Courts of Kegalle and Mawanella. We had the good fortune of being members of the same sports teams for the Law Collage and also had the pleasure of playing for the Law Collage together.

Sir, I would extend my deepest sympathies to the families of the late Hon. A.M.S. Adikari and as well as of the late Hon. Chandra Ranatunga and conclude my speech.

Thank you. [.. 12.10] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim - Minister of Public Enterprise Development) , . . 1994 . . . . , . . . , , .
