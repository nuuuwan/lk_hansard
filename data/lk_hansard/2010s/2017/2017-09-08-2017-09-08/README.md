[2.44 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene - State Minister of Defence) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all, I would like to thank the Hon. Douglas Devananda for bringing in this proposal as a Private Members Motion. Speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I have absolutely no objection to his proposal. I think it is absolutely vital that we commemorate every single person who died during the war, not persons of a particular race or community. Be it Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or Burghers, we all got affected by the war. So, on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I would like to say that we wholeheartedly support this Motion.

However, we do have a few observations. I will just let you know those observations and we can discuss them later. The first observation is that the memorial should be erected at a suitable location giving due consideration to the fact of accessibility by the public and the security. Since most of the victims are from the Districts of Mannar, Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa, we feel that the most suitable place would be Anuradhapura as it is central to all those areas. But, that we can discuss and come to some kind of arrangement in the future.

The second observation is that a particular day, such as the third Friday of the month of May in each year, should be declared as the day of commemoration to avoid any disagreement about the date.

Thirdly, the responsibility of management and maintenance of the memorial should be entrusted with an appropriate Ministry or a public entity such as the Ministry of Home Affairs or the relevant district secretariat under the guidance of the Presidential Secretariat.

Those are the three observations, Hon. Member. Of course, we can discuss them and come to some kind of agreement. But, wholeheartedly, we support your proposal. Thank you.
