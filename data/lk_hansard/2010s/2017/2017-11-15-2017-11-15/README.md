I quote the letter which states,

Such interventions will help socially-integrated ex-combatants, refugee returnees, displaced communities, war widows, and war-affected disabled to economically engage in the economic activity as a healing and trauma recovery process and thereby ensure non-recurrence of such events in the future while ensuring a violence free society.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. [11.44a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this maiden Budget of our debonair Minister of Finance, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, shows his ability to integrate designer credentials by calling it the Blue-Green Budget and giving it the title Enterprise Sri Lanka. The innovative thinking that went behind the conceptualization is typical of our Minister, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. Under the Green economy concept, he is focusing on climate resilience including waste disposal restrictions on factories and hotels. Then, under Blue economy he is also talking about tapping the unexplored ocean resources, improving the sustainable fishery ventures, coastline protection, prevention of pollution and degradation of water resources. All of this shows some continuity with the Governments "Vision- 2025", and we are indeed quite pleased that there is some very clear policy consistency in these proposals.

The current macroeconomic climate is, of course, clouded by indications of retarded growth and decline in export earnings and Foreign Direct Investments. To compound these matters further, inadequate foreign-exchange reserve cover too was an issue that the Hon. Minister had to tackle. Apart from these challenges, climate related disasters compounded the structural weaknesses that the country was facing.

Debt servicing requirements between 2019 to 2022 is in the region of almost US Dollars 15 billion. Therefore, this Budget had to be prepared in the background of such challenges and he had to focus on two important areas; one is to stabilize the macroeconomic fundamentals and the other is to stimulate growth. The clarity of linking these issues with the policy proposals has taken the usual monotony that we hear from the Finance Minister, particularly, the absence of populist and ad hoc proposals is a matter of encouragement.

In the meantime, a tax on financial transactions by the banks, sugar tax on sweetened beverages, cellular tower levy, SMS messages advertisement levy and carbon tax on motor vehicles are all innovative new taxes aimed at improving the environment and health conditions of the people while earning revenue makes this designer Budget somewhat lean and mean.

Rationalizing the tax system had been replete with all types of exemptions complicating the tax effort in the past.

931 932

Now, this Government in deciding to minimize exemptions, tax holidays and special rates have taken some important steps to introduce a fair and effective tax administration in keeping with Vision 2025. While improving the tax base, I must say from a critics point of view, it is somewhat questionable as to how far the Governments objective of shifting tax dependency towards direct taxation could be achieved. Whether the type of targets like indirect to direct tax ratio of 20:80 to 60:40 could be achieved with the proposal is something that we have to observe very carefully. Let us also not forget our own disagreement within the Unity Government forced us to revise the upward revision of VAT during the last year, which has to be repealed and re-implemented. Let us hope that we will not repeat such things if we are to avoid fiscal targets being under achieved.

A very significant amount of focus have been given in this Budget towards attracting Foreign Direct Investments which is of non-debt based type. We seem to be correctly moving away from para-tariff structures mainly introduced to fund the military effort during the war and unfortunately which was continued to buttress the need to continue the protectionist economic vision of the previous administration.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have five more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

We must now concede that this eroded our economic competitiveness over the last few decades. It is time that we encourage our businesses to successfully integrate with global value changes. Removal of 1200 para-tariffs on import items that do not carry customs duties; removal of CESS from 253 items to stimulate emerging ventures like tourism and value added industries are all welcome measures.

Then, we also heard the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe talking about capitalizing Sri Lanka's advantage as a trading hub. There had been certain proposals relating to liberalizing the shipping agency business regarding which I too shared some of my reservations in the Cabinet yesterday. I hope that the Hon. Minister will address this issue when he meets those delegations and resolve that thorny issue which concerns many businesses in the country. Almost 500 to 600 shipping agency businesses are to be effected, if that proposal is to be implemented.

Coming back to some of the Proposals in the Budget, I must refer to a few of these Proposals which relate to my Ministry.

There is a decision to introduce some Climate Resilience Programmes particularly in the Kelani basin which caused many floods in the recent past. The flood protection wall as well as the impounding reservoirs proposed, Wee Oya, Nawatha, Holombuwa and Reucastle to enhance the water retention capacity, is a very welcome move and almost Rs. 4,900 million, nearly Rs.5 billion, has been allocated for that project. They are also looking at similar mechanisms in other perennial rivers including Kalu, Nilwala and Gin Rivers.

I would add to this a request to also look at the reservoir in the area called Yatimahana on the Maha Oya basin which is situated below Mawanella, because we are already tapping the Maha Oya in almost 18 places in that river basin. Therefore, this impounding reservoir at Yatimahana helps the water consumers downstream in the Maha Oya basin.

I have also been looking at the other Proposals particularly the groundwater monitoring proposal which covers eight districts. Installing monitoring equipment in three identified river basins have been mentioned. Almost Rs. 1,500 million has been allocated for that. This includes Malwathu Oya, Kumbukkan Oya and Maduru Oya. Since Kumbukkan Oya has been mentioned, Heda Oya which flows through Siyambalanduwa up to Pottuvil and beyond, is another river that needs to be properly monitored when it comes to groundwater table issues. Therefore, I would request the Hon. Minister to include Heda Oya too if rivers such as Kumbukkan Oya is included.

Then, there is an important Proposal regarding pollution levels in the waterways to be reduced. Rupees 750 million has been allocated for that. While welcoming that, I would also mention that Kelani basin being targeted is a very, very important proposal and that too is quite welcome.

Then, there are Proposals that relate to my Ministry particularly the Greater Kalmunai and Samanthurai Township Development Masterplan. A very large sum has been allocated to improve the living conditions of the people in that area. I thank the Minister for consideration of that as well as I would like to just point out the need to look at creating commodity exchange in this country and we have already proposed three warehouses for storage of agricultural produce in Polonnaruwa, Ratnapura and Kilinochchi. But, rather than just creating warehouses, if commodity exchange is to be setup, that will allow investments to come to set up warehouses by the private sector in order to have commodity exchange in the country, which would bring fair prices for both the farmers and the consumers.

Thank you very much. [.. 11.57]

I must state with great satisfaction about the modernization that has taken place: the Inland Revenue Act was basically going to be redone; it was expedited and it is now something of the past; there is the RAMIS which basically helps get the revenue collection on a very updated manner; there is the establishment of National Single Window and the Integrated Treasury Management Information System. All these are measures taken up to ensure that the Finance Ministry is at the apex of finance activities and able to lead the country and show the other Ministries that it is the apex body.

I think the Finance Minster, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera has been able to facilitate all these and give leadership to that area, for which I must congratulate him.

, . The monetary policy and the fiscal policy must work hand in glove and that is the only way that you can take the country towards a rapid growth. If you look

at countries like Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia, which are at the moment up-and-coming countries in Asia, they have been able to ensure that financial discipline comes into fiscal policy and the monetary policy and fiscal policy work together in government. So, I hope that this will be corrected very soon and the follies that have been done by the past, which is being carried on by the same officers in this administration, should be corrected to go forward. Before, too long, I am sure it will be highlighted in all the reports that are coming on many matters. I leave that to the future to disclose rather than mentioning it now.
