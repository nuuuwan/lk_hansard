( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, I have to act upon the reports submitted by the Provincial Councils and that is the mandate I have. I have no power to carry out an investigation with regard to that. The Hon. Member informed that the Chief Minister has visited several countries, but that could have been in his personal capacity. What the Hon. Member officially asked was, what are the countries he has visited? If the Hon. Member has a problem, he could meet him and ask as to what the countries he has personally visited. As regards to every visit, this Parliament does not have the mandate to answer. Only with regard to official visits, which are brought to my notice, this Parliament has the mandate to answer.

Hon. Speaker, prior to this also, I have informed that Provincial Councils are a devolved subject. Based on the reports submitted to me, I inform Parliament. There is no other mechanism.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon.Minister, you can check on the accuracy of what he said.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, I can check on the accuracy by asking the Chief Secretary, but beyond that I have no mandate.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, why do you not check the accuracy of the accusation? That is all.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, firstly, if I have the mandate to check on the accuracy, then I will have to check the accuracy of every statement given by the Provincial Councils to me. My mandate is to act on what the Chief Secretary brings to my notice.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You can check with him. You are answerable to Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, this is the report given by the Chief Secretary. I have no mandate to act beyond that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.M. Marikkar) , . .."" , .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, I think the Hon. Member does not have to bring that to the notice of the House as to who helped President Maithripala Sirisena to come to power. I mean, he is trying to colour the issue. If he has a question with regard to my Ministry, he can ask that, but he is trying to create a drama for his political benefit. I think he wants to be a drama queen. I ask you to do a teledrama. I think the Hon. Member wants to participate in a teledrama.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. We should not get into an argument on this issue. - [interruption]

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I

DELAY IN HOLDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ,, .

According to the latest figures published by the Elections Commission of Sri Lanka, the number of registered voters in the Island is as follows: Western Province - 4,242,208; Southern Province - 1,939,418; Sabaragamuwa Province - 1,492,581; Uva Province - 986,523; Northern Province - 802,842; Central Province - 2,009,805; North Western Province - 1,831,032; Eastern Province - 1,118,270; North Central Province - 949,516 and the total - 15,421,205

In each Province, there are over millions of registered voters. Therefore, over 15 million citizens of the country, are being deprived of their democratic right to vote to elect over 6,000 representatives of their own choosing in over 335 Local Government Institutions.

The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, gave an assurance to the House on the 28th of April, 2017 - just three weeks ago - regarding the Local Government Elections that the necessary instructions will be issued and the Commission can come into operation in order to

507 508

2017 23

hold the Local Government Elections. I would like to ask the Prime Minister:

(a) the Joint Opposition demands, having conveyed before, to know why does the Government not immediately give the necessary mandate to the Election Commission to hold these Local Government Elections, which is long-overdue, for over two years as per today.

(b) When does the Government propose to do so?

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister. ( (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe , ,., . 3() 17 . ,.,,, . .,.

If I may say so, Mr. Deputy Chairman of committees, in 2015, we, the Government, inherited an economy in shambles. The fiscal sector was in shambles; the external sector was in shambles; the monetary sector was in shambles and the real sector was in shambles. In fact, falling Government revenue; high Government debt; unproductive investments; inefficient transfer payments; in the external sector - falling exports, widening imports, unsustainable short-term capital flows, borrowed international reserves and in the monetary sector - artificially over-valued exchange rate, high market liquidity without being channelled to productive lending and in the real sector - consumption-driven economy, lack of private investments and low productivity were all interconnected and we inherited this economic legacy.

,,, . ., .

Sir, if I may say a few words in English, my primary objective as the Minister of Finance will be to transform the Treasury into a facilitator and an enabler of sound Government policy and project implementations under the guidance and vision of the President and the Prime Minister and of course, the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. I have, as many of you may know, throughout my political career, maintained that the private sector should be the engine of growth if we are to harness the full potential as a country.

In fact, as you all know, in 1948, when Sri Lanka gained Independence 69 years ago - will be 70 years in a few months time in February, 2018 - Sri Lanka was one of the most developed countries in this part of the world. Some of you may have read Lee Kuan Yews memoirs, From Third World to First: The Singapore Story and there he writes extensively about Sri Lanka - that Sri Lanka was a model Commonwealth country at Independence, how we had the best universities, how we had the best Government Service, how we had an excellent judicial system, that the police were considered to be the best again in Asia; but there again, he says he saw a promising country, a country with so much promise going to waste over the years.

521 522

In fact, in my opinion, there are two principal reasons why such a great country like Sri Lanka with such wonderful human resources and natural resources could not achieve the status we should have achieved by now. In fact, we should have been far more advanced than Singapore today had we gone according to plan, but unfortunately, terrorism of two kinds, I think, obstructed our march forward.

One was terrorism due to extremism - extremism both in the South and in the North; extremists on both sides of the divide. Because finally extremism, whether it comes from the Tamils, the Sinhalese or the Muslims, are all different faces of the same coin. That led to a bitter, brutal war which destroyed innocent lives of our country. Remember, all those who died in that war were all Sri Lankans. It was not a war against a foreign enemy. Even those young people who went astray in the North were all Sri Lankans, just as the young people in the South who went astray in the 1970s and the 1980s, and thus, we could not achieve the targets.

And the other form of terrorism, of course, was corruption. Corruption was the other bane of our country which stopped our forward march.

So, now the time has come for us to unite against both those forms of terrorism. Extremism and corruption should be wiped out if Sri Lanka is to achieve the economic prosperity that our people so badly deserve. So, that is why this Government under President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe has now presented a clear vision for the future and in order to achieve that vision - the economic prosperity - we must of course also ensure, as I said earlier, the private sector is involved in the development and the forward drive.

In fact, I will continue the work of my predecessor and our leaders to bring the country out of the debt crisis that plagued us for many years and to increase public confidence in Sri Lanka both internally and internationally to fuel the economic potential we are capable of. Just as the introduction of the Market Economy by President J.R. Jayewardene in 1977 - actually, it will be exactly 40 years next August since the UNP Government revolutionized this country and Sri Lanka entered a new era of development and prosperity.

The benefits of that "Jayewardene Revolution" are still felt by many of us today. In fact, many of the things which the younger generation are taking for granted - television sets, three- wheelers, private buses, computers - all those were the result of that great Revolution. It is now time for the next wave of reforms which will take Sri Lanka forward; which will make Sri Lanka a modern, dynamic, democratic economy and our target is to ensure that Sri Lanka becomes the hub of the Indian Ocean by the year 2025.

Thank you. . . Question proposed.

[6.15 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.

I also wish to congratulate the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera who has been appointed as the Minister of Finance and Mass Media. He has been in politics for the last 20 to 25 years and held different portfolios. I know that he is an able Minister and I wish him all success. At the same time, I also like to commend the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake for doing a very good job as the Minister of Finance.

Today, I want to speak on Item No. 2 - on "Stores Advance Account (Explosive items)". Sir, in Kalpitiya and Kandakuliya in Puttalam, about 3,000 acres is being used by the Air Force to conduct shooting practices. This has been going on for about 20 years but that was during the time of war. Firstly, they acquired 1,000 acres of agricultural land, then it was increased to 2,000 acres and finally it has gone up to 3,000 acres. Target shooting practising by new Air Force pilots is a dangerous exercise. For the last 10 to 15 years, over five people have died, over 250 houses have been damaged and the cattle straying in these lands also have got killed. This has been going on for ages. This land is an agricultural land. When the war came to an end we hoped that they will reduce the extent and give the lands back to people so that they could cultivate and increase the agricultural produce. For the last one-and-a-half years, we have been trying to get it done, but we have not been successful.

Since last one month we are faced with another problem. We were made to understand that the Army is acquiring 10 acres of land there to put up a massive building to store arms and ammunitions and especially, arms and ammunition from Avissawella will be moved there. We have also been made to understand that the damaged weapons of the forces will be brought to that area to be destroyed. Hon. Minister, I would like to remind you that this area is surrounded by several villages and over 150,000 people are living peacefully. The famous Thalawila Church is also situated in this area. We saw suffering and losses caused in Avissawella. All that has to be considered when doing things like this. But today what is going to happen? By constructing this store, they are going to create problems in Kalpitiya and Puttalam. Therefore, I request that this be stopped immediately. Our area, as you know, is a tourist destination and it is improving. But putting up this store may probably end up in a problem.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Navavi, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, give me two more minutes.

These are the problems that we are faced with today. I visited the mosque in Kurunegala which was damaged. Then in my area, in Marawila, a business establishment was completely damaged and the loss was well over Rs.10 to 15 million. We would like to remind you that all minorities of this country got together to change the former President and the Government because we had confidence in His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, the Hon. Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Government.

There is a force which is acting against the Government. They want to create a problem between the Government and the minorities. When people ask questions we have to answer, but we are unable to answer. Therefore, I request His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and Members of the Cabinet to get together to solve this problem, so that we all can live peacefully.

Sir, I would like to remind you that this had been going on for the last three to four years. Last year, just before we started our Ramazan, we had to face this problem. In the year before last, we had the "greaseman" problem. All these problems started just before the Ramazan and you know that it is a holy month for us. In that holy month, we pray, but we have been disturbed right throughout.

When I visited the mosque in Kurunegala that had been damaged, the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife was also there. We were able to make them silent but this cannot go on.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Now they have started attacking business establishments. In such an attack in Marawila, the loss was over Rs. 10 million.

This is happening everyday. Therefore I request His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and everybody to get together to solve this problem so that all of us could live peacefully.

Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

[6.32 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this Adjournment Motion has been moved by the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman, Member of Parliament, and it states, in my respectful submission, a very legitimate complaint. People who live in this country, irrespective of their ethnicity or their religion, want to live in peace and harmony with all other citizens. Particularly after the devastating war that went on for almost three decades in the country, I think this desire is uppermost in the minds of most people and they want to live in harmony, peace and in goodwill with everyone.

There are some elements, Sir, who are seeking to disturb this situation in the country. What motivates such elements is not very clearly known, but I must say that this situation should not and cannot continue. I have received complaints from different organizations that various institutions and establishments in different parts of the country have been subjected to violence - that is very alarming. Private property has been very substantially destroyed as a result of these acts of violence. There have been other violations where people have been dispossessed of lands and people have been made to entertain fear as to whether they can live peacefully without being disturbed by others in this country. That, Sir, is not a very welcome situation and in my respectful submission, this situation should not be allowed to continue because if it continues, it will only get worse.

The rule of law must prevail; the law must be enforced. If the country is to progress - as we all hope that the country will - the unhappy experiences of the past should not be repeated. All citizens in this country, whichever ethnicity they belong to, whichever religion they belong to, should accept this reality.

In my respectful submission, the Government should also take appropriate, prompt and adequate action to ensure that persons who violate the law are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and that such activities are nipped in the bud and curbed. I think that is the duty of the Government and the Government should be seen to be acting as required in such situations. Misguided elements should not be allowed to hold this country to ransom.

Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Muhammad Ibrahim Muhammad Mansoor. - [Pause.] Since he is not here, the next speaker is the Hon. Rauff Hakeem.

[6.37 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to follow the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, to say a few words on this Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman. It is a very neutrally worded Motion, and I quote it:

"It is not a secret that all communities in this country contributed to elect the current 'good governance government'. Accordingly, our priority task in this post war period that has come after the war situation which made ethnic harmony collapse, is taking forward the reconciliation process to rebuild peace, harmony and trust amongst communities.

However, a small group of extremists seeking narrow political mileage are taking action to cause disharmony among communities by undermining the reconciliation efforts. This situation is not favourable at all for our country.

Therefore, it is moved in this august Assembly that appropriate measures be taken to take forward the reconciliation efforts currently undertaken by the government in a stronger manner and also to suppress the actions of the extremist elements that obstruct the said reconciliation. "

Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is no secret that since the 16th of April last month, up to now, there had been more than 20 incidents of grave nature that had taken place which can fall into the category of hate crime. In some places these incidents have taken place in the very eyes of the

601 602

guardians of the law - the police of this country. While they were bystanders, these disruptive elements have gone berserk, have destroyed huts and houses and have attacked shops.

In the meantime, the apathy shown by the mainstream media in this country regarding the incidents is also worrying. For instance, I believe that deliberately some of the mainstream media has not given any coverage to these hate crimes, particularly the mainstream Sinhala media. This is a matter of concern for all of us. Even in the English media most of these grave matters have not found sufficient space. I would like to very categorically say this because this is a very worrying phenomenon.

I must record here some of those incidents. On the 17th, the Kohilawatta Mosque was attacked and then the Panadura Town Mosque was attacked. The mainstream media, "Lankadeepa", "Divaina", "Dinamina", "Rivira", "Mawbima", "Ada", "Siyadesa", "Lakbima", "Daily News" , "Daily Mirror", "Daily FT" and "The Island" did not report those incidents. The next day, a shop in Panadura was attacked. There again, "Lankadeepa", "Divaina", "Dinamina", "Rivira", "Mawbima", "Siyadesa", "Lakbima", "Daily News", "Daily Mirror", "Daily FT", "The Island" and "Ceylon Today" - none of these newspapers - reported these incidents.

Then, there was the Toppur incident in the electoral district of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. They are poor people who have been living there for ages. Suddenly, the Department of Archaeology and some priests in the area have come and created havoc. They have destroyed huts and chased the people out. Similarly, this happened in the Presidents own district, in Onegama, a village close to which I had lived for 25 years. I have been to the shrine which was in that area as a child. People have been dealt with in a very unruly manner while the police had looked away. This is a very grave situation.

I brought this to the notice of the Hon. Minister of Law and Order. He has assured us, even in the Cabinet today, that within the next three days substantive action will be taken to arrest this unholy trend which is moving towards a culture of impunity which we saw back after the former regime. The former regime was brought to its knees because of these incidents.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You have to wind up, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, let me wind up.

This worrying situation needs to be taken into account very seriously by the Government as promised to all of us. The Ministers and Members met with the senior leaders of the Government. In fact, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and I, after an incident in Eragama, went and met His Excellency the President and briefed him about the nature of the incident and the purpose of these perpetrators. It is not aimed at the minorities or Muslims alone. It is aimed at the stability of this Government, the continuity of this regime. Therefore, serious note must be taken about these incidents and sufficient action must be taken. There is enough room in the law to take the culprits into account and punish them. Thank you.

[7.18 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we all thought that our nation just emerged from three decades of brutal civil conflict which quite literally ripped our nation into two. What we

615 616

[]

2017 23

also thought was that we now have a golden opportunity, the opportunity to reconcile, reincarnate and revitalize our country. But, unfortunately, our expectations have been shattered and the law and order system is in shambles. Unfortunately, what has now occurred is that ethnic polarity has become so stark that each community is left to assume a sense of vulnerability. This sense of vulnerability, as proven since the time of our Independence, has been engineered by those behind the scenes in the establishment to ensure political stability by alienating and consolidating on communal lines.

I may sound hypocritical, as I too am an elected representative of a party that has pursued an agenda on behalf of the Muslim community in Sri Lanka. But, in my defence, I must state that I am also a victim of the unfortunate political disparity that has befallen our democracy. Furthermore, the history books will reaffirm that I have always placed our national interests first, considered them foremost and have made tremendous personal sacrifices in preserving Mother Lanka's sovereignty, at the expense of any political or communal gain.

[7.25p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Deputy Speaker, an issue of serious importance has been raised by the Hon. Member of Parliament for

Colombo District, the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman. He has referred to a series of incidents targeting the Muslim community: attacks on Muslim mosques, contemptuous vilification of the Almighty Allah, attacks on Muslim businesses, anti-minority vehicle parades and other hostile hate crimes. The invasion of the Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages and the illegal attempt to compel the Hon. Mano Ganesan to agree to demands made in violation of the countrys Constitution are serious violations of the Constitution and the criminal laws of the country.

It is the duty of the Inspector-General of Police - the IGP - to investigate the crimes and deal with the perpetrators according to the law. He has, under him, a large force to diligently deal with these matters and specialized agencies like the Criminal Investigation Department - CID - to carry out detailed investigations. Under our Government, there is no need for the IGP to wait for anyones orders.

It is the declared policy of the State that no one is above the law. The matters raised by the Hon. Member fall appropriately under the IGP. There is strong criticism against the Government that the police have failed to carry out their duties promptly, as required under the circumstances. Over 20 hate crimes and extremist violence have taken place against religious minorities within the last one month alone. The alleged accused in some of these cases have been clearly identified. So, what is the IGP waiting for?

We, as the citizens of Sri Lanka, are facing the greatest peril in our history. A biggest scourge has arisen in the form of unruly elements, tearing the very fabric with which our nation of Sri Lanka is woven. Everyone is now talking about the plague that is enveloping our peaceful nation, holding us for ransom in an otherwise peaceful country. A handful of people are engaged in destructive politics and a religious war, if I may say so.

I am speaking here not as a Muslim Minister, but as a citizen of Sri Lanka. We attained the biggest freedom when people voted in this Yahapalana Government as a beacon of democracy to start a new era of security, peace and prosperity. Having emerged from the terrible 30 years of ethnic war, we faced fascist forces that nearly took away our long-cherished liberty. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave us hope to move this country forward towards a very stable future and good governance.

In fact, we are just experiencing the prospects of our future and international goodwill. Leave everything aside, our Government is intent on bringing economic emancipation of millions of Sri Lankans to move above the poverty line. The President and the Prime Minister

619 620

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

2017 23

have promised us and are showing the way for development of our country to attain economic prosperity by providing a decent income, a roof over our head and above all, employment.

These ideals are not to be attained all by our efforts. We depend on international support, which is now trickling into our country. The European Union has reinstated our GSP Plus concession as a goodwill for our international commitment for peace and fair play. So, we are on the path for national development by multiplying our economic resources with foreign support. In order to achieve this, we must show to the world that we are committed to peace and democracy. But, what is happening in our country today? Some elements are taking us down the roads of abysmal destruction. In the name of religion and racism, they are almost adopting terrorist tactics to scare off minorities, who themselves have suffered immensely in the past just as much as the Sinhalese, the majority community in this country.

I believe in the freedom and ability to practise ones own religion without fear or obstruction given to us as a Constitutional right. Besides, it is our responsibility to ensure that Buddhism as the religion of the majority in this country takes the pride of place. But, that should not be achieved at the cost of fear and anxiety among the trampled people or minorities. The international community is watching us, in which direction we are moving; they have given us another chance to move forward towards peace and progress. We should not throw away the goodwill that is slowly building up.

The Bodu Bala Senas activities are making our whole country a laughing stock, nay a dangerous place to live in. More recently, destruction of properties and business premises has occurred and places of worship are coming under attack increasingly by those who say they are aligned to Bodu Bala Sena and its infamous leader Rev. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero. Wherever he goes, he breathes fire, rousing the base sentiments of his gullible followers who resort to destruction of our business premises, mosques and homes. The thugs are waiting to rummage through the burning establishments to rob or steal. As everybody knows, Ven. Gnanasara Thero is not all championing the cause of Buddhists. He is preaching utter racism and terrorism to threaten the existence of other minor communities in Sri Lanka including the Muslims.

When my community is under attack, I cannot remain silent and be deaf, as if nothing has happened. Day in, day out, there is some incident unleashed to drive fear into the hearts of the Muslims solely because they practise the religion of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (Sal). All kinds of falsehood are spread maliciously by the Thero to rouse hatred among the fellow Buddhists.

Right now, people are asking how Bodu Bala Sena and its leader Rev. Gnanasara Thero are allowed to behave like a bull in a china shop. Where is law and order? Are we not conducting a legitimate Government? Are we not a Government which represent all shades of people in this country?

Our Constitution, beyond doubt, ensures religious and personal freedom. No one can insult others' religions or their God or Gods. In our case, the worst unpardonable insults are hurled at our God Almighty Allah and the beloved Prophet (Sal). Our youths also can turn violent once their hurt and patience overflow. They are not cowards to face the thuggery, but we, as elders, take care to restrain them to maintain utmost harmony with our fellow citizens. But, I must assure our people that Bodu Bala Sena does not represent the average Sinhalese or Buddhists of this country. The Sinhalese are very peace-loving, accommodating and understanding.

Every year, I have been invited by the Gangaramaya Temple for the opening of the 2nd days Vesak celebration along with the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy. I attended this years celebration too. I must declare in this House what mental change I underwent when I visited the Gangaramaya Temple during this Vesak and listened to the excellent speech delivered by the prelate of the Temple, Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Maha Nayaka Thero. He personified peace which Lord Buddha preached throughout his lifetime. Islam is a religion of peace. But, equal merit must be given to Buddhism as a religion of peace. The chief monk explained in detail how and why it is important for the Buddhists to reinforce peace at all times. He emphatically put that Buddhism, as a religion, never stood for violence, but loved other religions and cultures. I was very moved after attending that function and listening to his enlightened speech. I believe he represents true Buddhism. Not an iota of hatred and ill will did he harbour towards other fellow communities. After attending the Vesak function, I urged my followers to visit the Temple and listen carefully to the message of peace and goodwill preached by true Buddhists.

This year, immediately after the very successful Vesak celebrations with the participation of all communities, the controversial Ven. Gnanasara Thero and the BBS attacked the Muslims and Tamils. When things like this happen, the consequences will be far-reaching unless we nip in the bud the hate speeches and incitement to violence. No decent society and government can allow this.

We, as Muslims, demand our constitutional rights to live as peaceful citizens in Sri Lanka shoulder to shoulder with our Sinhalese brothers and sisters and the Tamil people. Time has come for the Government to act. If timely action is not taken to curtail the BBSs rampage

621 622

towards the minorities, Sri Lanka will move towards nothing, but disaster, nationally and internationally. Much death and destruction would take place, which will put Sri Lankas forward march behind for decades. The international community will withdraw their goodwill and support to make us pariahs of the world. By just destroying the Muslim faith and institutions, what good will it accrue to the BBS? Are they going to reach Nibbana? Has the great master Lord Buddha exhorted them to engage in violence and destruction?

The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation is deeply concerned that extremist violence and hate crimes against the Muslims and Tamils as well as the negligence of the police to take prompt action as required by law are both threats to the process of national reconciliation initiated by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena.

Before I conclude, I urge the Government to act fast, to act now and to act with firmness and determination to eliminate this BBS menace. Otherwise, take it as we all are doomed as a nation with a bleak future ahead.

Thank you.
