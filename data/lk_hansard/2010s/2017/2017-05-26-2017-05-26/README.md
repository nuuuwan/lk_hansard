QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE CONTROL OF DENGUE OUTBREAK ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I raise this Question under Standing Order 23 (2) seeking an answer from the Minister of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine.

The records show that there have been over 45,000 cases reported of the dengue epidemic in the Island up to mid-May this year, which is more than the whole of the year 2014. This is despite this being the off-peak period - January to April - for the disease. Last year, there were only 19,083 cases reported in the first five months, which is an increase from 14,956 cases in 2015. So, there is a definite rising trend of infection, which is now gaining epidemic proportions. Over 130 people have died from the disease so far this year. About 43 per cent of cases have been reported in the Western Province, where the hospitals are today overflowing with patients and all beds are full. These references have been quoted from "The Sunday Times" of 14th May 2017. I do not want to take much time on this, but there is a detailed article where the Ministry of Health has stated that they alone cannot handle this situation. So, it is a national disaster that the Ministry alone cannot handle.

There is no doubt that dengue is spreading so quickly because there have not been sufficient countermeasures adopted. The fact that nearly half the cases occur in the richest and the most developed provinces indicates that there has been a breakdown of anti-dengue activity. There has been a collapse of Local Government services due to the lack of political representation. We have dissolved 360 Local Government Authorities in the country. The officials alone cannot run without the elected representatives. Now, this is also contributing to this problem which the Hon. Minister would accept.

The collection of garbage is irregular and incomplete. Some Councils no longer collect plastic waste, which provides ideal breeding grounds for mosquitos. Regular spraying for mosquito breeding places has almost stopped. With the onset of the monsoon - we are already in the monsoon - the crisis is going to increase and there is a danger of a rampant epidemic of dengue.

I have raised this Question on the 23rd of March, 2017 and the Hon. Prime Minister gave assurance to the House. Since 23rd of March, 2017, we know that the Hon. Minister has taken so many steps. But, it is not enough because it is a very serious situation which is spreading like the flood situation and we should pool our resources to bring this situation under control. The private sector, the volunteer organizations, schools and various organizations should be called irrespective of political differences to control this situation.

(a) What immediate steps will the Government take to prevent the rampant spread of dengue which has become a national health crisis today?

(b) As this is a national epidemic, health officials also have accepted that they alone cannot handle the present situation,

hence, what steps will the Government take to muster departments, private sector, Local Government

971 972

2017 26

institutions and the general public in controlling this national disaster?

Finally, may I conclude by making a reference - , . , . 71 , , . . , . . . , . .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , ?

() (, ) ( ( ) - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne - Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine) .

Hon. Deputy Speaker, as the Question is being raised in English I will give the reply in English.

First of all, I must give an overview of the situation not only in Sri Lanka but globally. The global situation is, during the past three months the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) has sent over 900 dengue alerts globally. Over 35 per cent, that means about 400 of these alerts, have been from the South Asian region. Therefore currently dengue is considered a global pandemic.

Further, it is noteworthy that countries that have not reported local outbreaks in the past are now becoming outbreak prone. For example in the US States of Florida, California and Texas; in Europe Southern France, Italy and Portugal; Queensland in Australia and Tokyo in Japan to name a few.

The probable reasons for this predicament are the changes observed in the global weather pattern with warmer months and unusual monsoon patterns, complexities of urbanization, migration of people from non-endemic rural areas to urban areas, co-circulation of all four serotypes of dengue and difficulty in mosquito control with existing tools et cetera. Earlier, there were only two categories of dengue - II and IV - in Sri Lanka, but now we have found dengue I and III also.

Singapore being one of the cleanest of cities in Asia reported 30,000 cases of dengue last year while Malaysia reported over 100,000 cases and 400 deaths. The mortality is more than 0.3 per cent.

In Sri Lanka we were able to eliminate Malaria which was prevalent in more rural areas among socio economically deprived populations and the country is now facing a formidable challenge with dengue, which some experts consider as a proxy of socio economic wellbeing of the country. What we have found is that with more development there is more dengue globally.

Although dengue was first reported in early 1960s, it was not until the year 2000 that the magnitude of dengue epidemic increased in Sri Lanka, affecting all 25 districts.

From 2009 to 2014, Sri Lanka experienced an exponential increase, compared to the previous decade, with an average of 35,000 cases each year. In 2009, 343 deaths were reported with 1 per cent rate of mortality. So, I must tell the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena that this actually increased when the Local Government institutions were operational.

With the efforts taken by the Ministry of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to minimize deaths, we had been able to bring down the number of deaths to 56 in 2015 and 98 in 2016, respectively with less than 0.2 per cent rate of motility. Earlier the rate of mortality was 1 per cent and now it has been brought down to less than 0.2 per cent. Even, this year it is only 0.29 per cent. Actually, bringing down the rate of mortality is the main responsibility of the Ministry of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine.

It is noteworthy that we are currently experiencing a higher proportion of the severe form of dengue needing hospitalization with a greater proportion of young adults and older people being affected with delays in health seeking.

There are several incorrect interpretations highlighted in the preamble of this Question. They are as follows:

A. January to April being off-peak for the disease: Northeast Monsoon extends up to February and Southwest Monsoon beings in April. Therefore, a slight downward trend may be shown in March. However, there is no off-peak for dengue which is an endemic disease in the country as cases are reported throughout the year. Also, Hon. Member, you said that the number of cases reported had increased now more than it was reported in the year 2014. But there had been 47,246 dengue cases reported in 2014, which was more than today.

B. No sufficient counter measures adapted: This is not factual. Both clinical and preventive health

973 974

services are fully engaged in reducing mortality and mitigating the outbreak. Sri Lanka is amongst the very few countries which has a National Dengue Prevention and Control Programme with an annual dedicated budget of over Rs. 400 million. We are the only country which has a National Dengue Prevention and Control Programme in the entire South Asia.

C. A breakdown of anti-dengue activities: No such breakdown has occurred. In fact, 350 new personnel were recruited as Field Assistants for the Western Province to support control activities.

D. Regular spraying for mosquitos has almost ceased: Over 250 fogging machines had been newly distributed across the country over the past two years and regular mosquito control activities are put in place. Further, more than 600,000 premises had been inspected over the past three months with the assistance of Tri Forces and police.

As the reply to Question No. 1,What immediate steps would the Government take to prevent the rampant spread of dengue which has become a national health crisis?, I can give you the following reply.

In terms of clinical care, the steps we have taken are as follows:

1. Upgrading of all major hospitals to cope with the increased influx of patients.

2. A 60-bedded special unit was established at IDH.

3. Teaching Hospital - Ragama and Teaching Hospital - Kalubowila were provided with special Dengue High Dependency Units (HDUs).

4. Necessary medical officers and other staff have been deployed to facilitate optimal patient care.

5. The essential saline, Dextran 40 has been imported.

6. Continuous training of doctors and nurses on clinical management.

7. Supply of more than 100 cardiac monitors and 50 portable ultra sound scanners during this year.

8. Giving training to private sector health staff and general practitioners.

9. Reviewing all dengue deaths subjected to institutional and national levels by an expert panel.

Then, in terms of prevention, we have taken the following steps:

1. Presidential Task Force was convened with the patronage of His Excellency the President.

2. National Mosquito Control Week was conducted in April.

3. More than ten special programmes were conducted in vulnerable areas.

4. Joint operations to collect non-degradable waste with the Local Government bodies.

5. Extensive use of print and electronic media to create public awareness.

6. Conducting regular meetings at national and subnational levels to monitor activities.

7. Conducting a dengue vaccine trial in Sri Lanka.

8. Engaged in advanced technological interventions.

The reply to Question No. 2, What steps will the Government take to muster other sectors and the general public?, is as follows;

1. All relevant Ministries including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Administration and Management, the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment and the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media were summoned and briefed with a comprehensive Action Plan which included a three-month extensive campaign during the Monsoon period.

2. Conducting weekly clean-up campaigns (dedicating one hour) including all sectors and the public.

3. Printing and distribution of leaflets, hand bills and posters.

4. Regular radio and TV appearances by experts on dengue.

5. Engaging NGOs, CBOs and community leaders for dengue control activities.

6. Extensive mobilization of tri forces (50 rapid response teams for each district).

7. Construction sites to be given strict instructions to prevent water clogging.

8. Schools to dedicate one hour weekly for inspection and cleaning.

9. Strengthen the activities of the environmental police division.

10. Facilitate garbage and solid waste separation through Local Government institutions; that is, container management.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, can I have a little clarification? The professionals involved in the health sector are the doctors. The GMOA has said that a very serious situation is developing in regard to the spread of dengue. I am not talking about the

975 976

[ () ]

2017 26

other dengue. I am talking about the real dengue. The GMOA has warned that this situation has to be taken into serious consideration in order to control the spread of dengue. Is there a good rapport between the GMOA and the Ministry?

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Sir, whether we have a good rapport with the GMOA or not, we have taken all necessary decisions. We have deployed relevant people including the tri forces. The GMOA is doing politics today. They do not talk medically. I do not think, they have any knowledge about the global situation. Today, this is a global pandemic. You cannot only blame us. It is not only Sri Lanka but all our neighboring countries are faced with this pandemic. I just came from the WHA and they have commended the actions taken by us to control dengue. It is a global problem now. Globally the worst affected region is South Asia. In fact, there are 900 alerts from the American Center and 400 of these alerts have been from the South Asian region.
