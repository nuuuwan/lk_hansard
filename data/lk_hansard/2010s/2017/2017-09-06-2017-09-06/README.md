QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I

GOVERNMENT STAND ON STATEMENT MADE BY FIELD MARSHAL SARATH FONSEKA REGARDING WAR CRIMES PROSECUTION AGAINST GENERAL JAGATH JAYASURIYA

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , 03(0)

. . .

Sir, General Jagath Jayasuriya, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Suriname, former Army Commander, Chief of Defence Staff and Head of the Joint Defence Council, who was actively in the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and its victory, is being hunted by ex-LTTE and Eelamist Diaspora legal teams, who have brought war crimes prosecutions against him in Brazil and Colombia. The statement made in this regard by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena is contradicted by a statement made by Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. The questions that I want to raise are as follows:

(1) Will the Hon. Minister explain and place before the House the details of the above-mentioned legal action being taken against General Jagath Jayasuriya, any other members of the Sri Lanka security forces, Ambassadors and members of the Diplomatic Corps and civilians who hold or have held office in the Government?

(2) What is the precise position of the Government in regard to such legal action against General Jagath Jayasuriya, any other members of the Sri Lanka security forces, Ambassadors and members of the Diplomatic Corps and civilians who hold or have held office in the Government and what action is being taken to protect them in the above-mentioned countries and in other countries?

(3) Do the statements made by Minister Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka represent current Government policy, and if not, what action does it propose to take against this and against further betrayals of the countrys heroic forces by members of the Government or by its supporters holding high office?

, , , -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , , ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs will answer in two weeks time.

OF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AND

Hon. Speaker, I also wish to state that the setting up of an export-oriented tyre factory in Horana is perfectly legal and the agreement was signed by the Board of Investment after Cabinet approval was granted. Only the tax concessions available at the time the proposal was received have been granted and no special concessions have been given by the Board of Investment to this company. Originally, the investment was to be US Dollars 75 million, but we are now aware that this company will invest US Dollars 125 million within two years and a further US Dollars 125 million within four years. Around 3,000 will be employed and the export turnover will be over US Dollars 400 million on completion of this project. This is one of the biggest investments in recent times in the manufacturing sector.

It has also been reported in some newspapers that the land for this project was given for one US Dollar per acre. It is a diabolical lie; it is a complete distortion of the truth. The land belongs to the BOI and a value for the land has not been fixed or regulated since this an undulated land and no infrastructure has been provided by the BOI. In zones like Katunayake, Biyagama, Koggala et cetera, the infrastructure is provided and developed and therefore, the land value is regulated and gazetted. Therefore, the Board of Investment received a valuation for this land from the Chief Government Valuer and that was the price the investor was required to pay.

( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let him finish his Statement. Then, I will give you time, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) point of Order . [ ] point of Order . It was completely out of order. - [Interruption.] Point of Order . . . . [ ] . .

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) The BOI further negotiated the price with the investor and received Rs. 40 million more agreeing to provide some services, which, in fact, did not cost Rs. 40 million. The total amount paid by the investor was Rs. 210 million.

The steel factory also referred to in the news report had been acquired by Mr. Lokuvitarana in 2011, during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's regime. The Board of Investment has consulted the Attorney-General to see if the agreement has been violated and the Board of Investment will act according to the Attorney-General's instructions, if there are any such violations. There has been no interference by me or any Ministry official on this matter.

Sir, as the most Ven. Ajahn Brahm said, "when life shovels mud on you, shrug it off, tread it in, and you will always stand higher in life".

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) Sir, I rise to point of Order.
