Presented by the Hon.Gayantha Karunatileka on behalf of the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government; to be read a Second time upon Tuesday, 07th November, 2017 and to be printed; and to be referred to the relevant Sectoral Oversight Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) point of Order ?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ) ) .

) . . . ) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) ) . [ ] . . ) .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That, we have agreed with the Hon. Speaker, to correct it by way of a Resolution to avoid any delay.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) There is no problem with that. That is all.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, there is a change in that agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) How can you change that, Hon. Speaker? We all agreed with you, Sir, that the Resolution can be moved in a day and that is settled. Now, the Hon. Prime Minister says that he has been informed by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government that they have to move an Amendment.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) But, Hon. Member, the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government has consulted the Attorney-General and he has advised that the Amendment must necessarily come.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Which means, Hon. Prime Minister, that the Local Government Elections will not be held in January.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) It need not be postponed and it depends on the Amendment. In fact, I spoke to the Election Commission on this, whether we can get the Amendment passed and how long it will take. I think the Hon. Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government is presenting the Amendment to the Cabinet next week.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Which means, that the Hon. Minister has to present it to the Cabinet, get the approval and then come to Parliament. So, when it comes to Parliament, there would be a minimum of one months delay. That means, nominations cannot be gazetted for an election in January. So, the election will be-

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) One of the issues that are being discussed is, whether we can gazette it and then, get the Amendment to catch up on it. That is something that we have to discuss.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. Minister can present the Amendment to Parliament on a day out of the 30th or the 31st of October or the 01st of November, when the Constitutional Assembly meets. We can meet half-an-hour earlier before the Constitutional Assembly starts.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, you cannot. The Constitutional Assembly is different to Parliament.

1421 1422

2017 01

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Before the Constitutional Assembly starts, Parliament can meet for half-an-hour.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Then, you have to summon -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Sir, we need not meet in this Chamber. We can have a Party Leaders' Meeting and discuss it. That would be much better.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We can come to an agreement. The issue is, it takes time, Hon Prime Minister, and that period delays the election by another two months.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Shall we - I will get the Hon. Minister also to join - hold a discussion on that?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, if we agree to do it by a Resolution, that correction can be made by Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) So, if that is done, if that correction is made by Parliament, there would not be any delay.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) But, the Hon. Minister is not agreeable to that, Hon. Prime Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Prime Minister is agreeable. So, what is there for the Hon. Minister to not to agree?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. Minister is not agreeable as he has advice from the Attorney-General.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Prime Minister, if the House agrees, if you are agreeable and we also had agreed, how can the Hon. Minster say, I am not agreeable? Why did he move the Amendment in English when he should have moved that in Sinhala? He moved that in English and he is only trying to delay the election unnecessarily. Hon. Prime Minister, by Resolution, we can correct it.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Shall we get the Attorney-Generals opinion also, if that is not a problem?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I agree with what you are saying.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Actually, I was not here when you all discussed this matter and what to do with Ambagamuwa and Kalmunai. I was told only yesterday. Even the Hon. Members of the JVP took this matter up with me. I spoke to the Hon. Minister. Then, I spoke to the Commissioner of Elections on the issue of the Amendment. I think the best is for us to hold a Party Leaders' Meeting next week. But, the Amendment will come to the Cabinet on Tuesday. So, we can meet next week.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) So, after Tuesday, we can meet, Hon. Prime Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes, after Tuesday, we can meet. We have no issue at all.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We can meet, but what I am saying is-

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We will try to expedite it. That is the best thing. You also want it.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) How can we expedite it, Hon. Prime Minister, when any citizen can, constitutionally, challenge it? We can agree, but a citizen can challenge it. But, if we go by a resolution -

1423 1424

)

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) If it can be done by Resolution, I have no problem with that. But, since the Hon. Minister says that he has been advised by the Attorney-General, we have to consult the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General has gone to the Bahamas. He is returning on Sunday. I also want to speak to him.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I hope he would not end up in Cuba.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) He would not end up in Cuba.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) So, if the House agrees, I can agree to a Resolution. There is no problem with it.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva) Hon. Member, this bus-stand was built during the previous regime. They have selected the venue. Both CTB as well as the private buses do not want to go there. The CTB says that if private buses go there, they will also go there. The other issue is, your trading community in Vavuniya do not allow all these people to leave that bus-stand and go there. This is the problem. So, this is an internal problem in the North. Therefore, we do not want to interfere with that. Otherwise, we can deploy police and do various things. But, I am looking at a bigger

1433 1434

picture. I have asked all the CTB buses to go there. But, they are picking passengers from the other places and then come to this place. So, it is a struggle between the CTB and the private sector supported by your business community in Vavuniya. Therefore, you should speak to them and settle this issue.

When we consider benefits for citizens, there are direct and indirect benefits of traffic management and enforcement. We can have new travel options and services. We can allow new policy ideas to be introduced for improving traffic conditions to reduce localized pollution and emission. We can reduce traffic congestion and give priority to public transportation. It will enable a much more effective response to traffic congestion. We can have smooth traffic flows by prioritizing traffic in response to the demand at the real time. If we can control the inbound flow, more than 50 per cent of traffic police personnel can be reduced and thereby we can increase the income of the Government. Economic development in the Western Province can be increased by reducing traffic delays.

Indirect benefits of traffic management and enforcement includes meeting pollution and emission targets throughout the city, improvement in driver discipline on a daily basis, reduction of violation of traffic laws, improvement of road safety and saving of expenditure on importation of petroleum. Also, we can have a technological platform on which additional services can be developed by private partners.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

. [3.41p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity.

As far as our country is concerned, millions of people are always on the road, driving and riding. When people go out daily, almost 50 per cent of them feel that they would not be able to come back peacefully because of the conditions of the vehicles plying on the roads. I think the

Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister have brought in very good Regulations under the Motor Traffic Act, which will enable us to control the usage of roads by vehicles.

As you know, Hon. Member, day by day, the number of vehicles are on the increase. If you go right around Colombo, you will see the number of vehicles in car sales. If all those vehicles come out on to the road tomorrow, I do not think we will be able to get out of Colombo even for five hours. Now, this is the position.

The modes of transport of the ordinary people, as you know, are trains, buses and of course, three-wheelers. When I was the Minister of Transport of Wayamba, I came across a case of a family; a couple who did not have a child for ten years. They made a vow at one of the Buddhist temples. After some time, they were blessed with a son. Annually, they were going to that temple to fulfill the vow. This is a true story that I am saying. After completing the prayers and the vow, the family came out of the temple with the child and there came a CTB bus driven fast, knocking down the mother and the father. They escaped, but that poor child died. I am sure the Hon. Deputy Minister knows about this case, which happened in Kurunegala some time back. After the police inquiry, they found that the bus had been driven by the conductor, who had no licence. So, this has been the pathetic situation. But now, little by little, the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister have taken steps to make rules and regulations to guide the drivers so that there can be a control on this situation.

Then, we must speak about three-wheelers. You know, most of the young people go abroad to make money. Once they come back with a little bit of money, the easiest thing for them is to buy a three-wheeler and be on the road. But, what is the training that they get? They do not get any training. For instance, take the SLTB. If a driver is recruited to the SLTB, he will have to undergo a training for six months to two years. After the training, they are given small buses so that they could run in limited areas. Only after that, they are allowed to drive massive buses on the main road.

But, if you take the case of a private bus owner, there is nothing of that sort. He applies for a licence and the moment he gets the licence, he starts driving the bus on the main road. This is the main reason why all these accidents occur today.

If you just go through all the accidents caused by buses, I am sure you will find that 80 to 90 per cent of the accidents were caused by private buses. Recently, in my area, a conductor met with an accident and he was in pieces. Why I say this is because when the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister make whatever rules and regulations on driving and riding, they must make it a point that all the drivers undergo a proper training. If they do not do that, this reckless driving will keep on killing people and be never-ending.

Especially when you talk about three-wheelers, as I said before, the moment those youth come back from

1481 1482

[ ]

2017 01

abroad, they buy a trishaw or a three-wheeler and get on to the road and they have no proper education, discipline or courtesy. If a vehicle moves on the road, they just cut across and if you look at them angrily for doing that, they will just stare back at you. So, I think the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister should, hereafter, issue licences only to those who have at least qualified in O/L. That is a must. They should have a basic education so that, at least, there will be some courtesy. And also, you must have a three-month course just to educate them on how to behave and how to speak to people who are travelling on the road. These are the problems that the ordinary persons are facing today. Today, I faced that problem. When my vehicle was moving, one three-wheeler driver cut across the road and my driver stared angrilly at him. Then, the three-wheeler driver asked, ? ? So, this is what we are facing today. Some of those vehicles are worth millions and because of the conduct of those rotten drivers, we face problems.

So, I think, it is better, when you issue licences to bus drivers, to make it a point that they have at least a basic education. I think our country has enough three-wheelers, I do not think we need any more in the future. So, to curtail this situation, Hon. Minister and Hon. Deputy Minister, please see that they have a minimum education and that they undergo a course for three months or six months so that there will, at least, be some courtesy because most of the crimes, rapes, transport of heroin, all these things happen in three-wheelers. It is actually a menace and at the same time, 90 per cent of the accidents occur because of three-wheelers. Therefore, my suggestion is, get them to have a proper education and a proper training so that they will learn how to drive safely on the road.

At the same time, Hon. Minister, I want to have a discussion with you on another matter. In Puttalam, we have a big cement plant which supplies for 45 per cent of the demand of cement in our country and daily, over 100 to150 lorries from all over the country come to Puttalam to transport cement. So, our roads are overcrowded.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

Why I want to mention this is because we have a railroad by which they supply limestone to the cement plant and that railroad is free from 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. and no trains use that during that time. And also, there are a plenty of warehouses in places like Colombo, Kandy, Badulla and Anuradhapura.

So, to safeguard the roads and reduce the fleet of vehicles, I tried to make an arrangement with the Cement Corporation to transport cement by train. I request you to

give those warehouses on lease. If you do that, less vehicles will be coming there and cement will be available in places like Kandy, Colombo and even Badulla.

( ) (The Hon. Ashok Abeysinghe) Hon. Member, we have already discussed that matter. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much.

I do not know whether you have discussed with Prima Group and Cement Corporation in Trincomalee.

( ) (The Hon. Ashok Abeysinghe) Yes. We have discussed with them. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much. If you do that, I think, less vehicles will be coming.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

There is a big problem in Colombo-Puttalam-Jaffna Road. It is impossible to go at night. So many speedy buses go to Jaffna along this road. After we opened the Jaffna railway line, it has come down. Over 200 buses are going to Jaffna in our road. If you can arrange another express train to Jaffna, I am sure this congestion will come down because people love to travel by train to Jaffna. Therefore, please consider that also.

Thank you very much.
