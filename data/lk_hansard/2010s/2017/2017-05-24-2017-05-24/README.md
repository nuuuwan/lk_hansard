, , , hate speech crime . . .

Hon. Presiding Member, our effort to introduce "hate speech" as a penal offence in this country through the Penal Code suffered some setbacks because some of the human rights lobby members and some of our Parliamentarians took up objections regarding the wording of the definition of this crime since it had totally been imported from the existing Prevention of Terrorism Act. Therefore, there were some legitimate objections based on the fact that there is a very thin line between "free speech" and "hate speech" and therefore, the way in which it had been formulated may give rise to incidents like that of Mr. Tissainayagam, the journalist who had been remanded and convicted on a very flimsy charge for having written something in the newspapers - encouraging terrorism was the assumption - and that such attempts could be made in the future. That is why some of these objections were taken in order to see that this fine distinction between "free speech" and "hate speech" be properly distinguished and that we introduce a proper provision enabling hate speech to be made a punishable offence in this country.

I think it is time for us to re-examine this issue and include "hate speech" as a punishable offence through our

Penal Code because that will finally result in the Attorney-General himself bringing charges against anyone engaged in that crime, irrespective of race, creed or religion, to bring the offenders before the courts of law and punish them, if necessary. Also, I must point out that the existing provisions in the ICCPR Act too provide for "hate speech" to be considered as a criminal offence and that to be indicted before the High Court. So, already the provisions exist in the ICCPR Act and that too could be resorted to.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) What about Section 391 of the Penal Code?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, Section 391of the Penal Code also, to a certain extent, enables this, but the improved provision exists in the ICCPR Act, which had been adopted by Parliament and which provides for this "hate speech" to be considered as an indictable offence before the High Court with a very stiff sentence of almost 10 years.

Having said that, I must also remind the Hon. Minister that during the period in which I was holding that Ministry, we initiated two other legislations which are still pending before the drawing boards of the Ministry of Justice and that too should be brought to a closure. One is, the Sentencing Policy Act, with which we decided to streamline the policy on sentencing, so that there will not be conflicting sentences for the same type of offence given by different judges. As this issue needs to be resolved, we had some assistance from the Attorney-Generals Department of the Australian Government in drafting this Sentencing Policy Act and that too needs to be finalized quickly. Together with that, I think the Hon. Minister, who is also an eminent Presidents Counsel, will understand the need to enact the Contempt of Court Act, which may also assist the proper administration of justice in this country. Respect for courts and respect for judges, sometimes, is taken to some absurd levels and it is being abused. Therefore, to prevent abuse of the contempt of law jurisdiction that is availed of by the courts in this country, it may be better for us to set the policy correctly and to create a separate Act. Leading, eminent Presidents Counsels in the calibre of Mr. Kanageswaran, Mr. Shibly Aziz and many others have spoken at length on this subject and there is enough material for us to consider in order to bring in a totally new contempt of court legislation so that that also could be streamlined.

Having said that, I must say that this particular Bill, the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment), could be termed as one of the important pieces of legislations that would be passed during the tenure of the current Minister, because this will bring in a paradigm shift in the way in which our civil courts function in this country. This is

697 698

certainly going to contribute towards a reduction in the laws delays which is the primary purpose of all these amendments. These amendments are salutary, but it might need various other steps to be taken, at least we need to plan. Once this Bill is certified by the Hon. Speaker as an Act and when we are going to implement it, we will face several problems, particularly when it comes to manpower. I think the Judicial Services Commission will have to be informed and we need to get ready to recruit more judges to handle the pre-trial procedures that are mentioned here. The extensive provisions that deal with the pre-trial procedure is a very welcome move which has been pending. In fact, this is a part of the Judicature Act; it is already there. The Recorders and the Master of the Rolls which are practised in many other countries, we are adapting them to our judicial system. This is a very welcome move and I am sure that the entire legal fraternity will welcome this.

When I was the Minister, there were some objections to judicial mediation. The Hon. Minister mentioned in his speech that that is something that subsequently we can convince our legal fraternity to accept though there had been some objections. We have now decided to drop that, but in the future we should adopt it because that is only the natural consequence of all these steps. So, we must allow mediation also to be brought in to the Civil Procedure system in this country.

As a matter of fact, when I met with the Chief Justice of Malaysia when I was the Minister, he told me: A cardinal principle that all Ministers of Justice should follow is, you should not listen to your friends in the legal fraternity when you are bringing in legislations. If you try to consult them on everything, they will not agree for changes. So, it is sometimes better you bring the legislation in and then get them to comply. But, of course, we have never been doing it. We are all members of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka. I am sure they will see the need for a change in this regard as well.

So, having said that, I find that many of these provisions that have been brought in are so salutary that they will drastically reduce the laws delays in this country.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)Hon. Minister, you have two minutes more. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Okay. As a matter of fact, the provision enabling the witnesses to tender their evidence through affidavits is a welcome feature and it will enable the courts - with the consent of parties - to entertain sworn affidavits which

will finally enable the opposing party to obtain copies of affidavits and cross-examine the witnesses, if necessary, on the important aspects relating to the case and thereby reduce the unnecessary delays in our courts system.

The Service of Summons issue is also a very important factor. We know how litigants suffer when defendants avoid summons. It has been observed that as a matter of practice at least cases are called a minimum of three chances in open court before a summon is served and many a time summons are avoided through various means. Even writs cannot be issued; decrees cannot be served and several difficulties have been faced. I am sure, this improvement where the summons to be sent to the registered attorney - at least the documents to be served - by electronic mail is a very important feature.

I am sure the Hon. Minister would consider introducing e-filing and digitizing to our entire court system. I think it is time that we digitize and make a paperless court. I do not think we need to maintain documents manually. Today, we hear of court records go missing in several court houses. They are destroyed; they are stolen. Sometimes courts have been set on fire to destroy the records available. Several unfortunate incidents have taken place and people have suffered immensely because these things are happening. Therefore, e-filing and digitizing our courts is an absolute necessity. We started a pilot project in Matara some time ago with the help of the University of Ruhuna. They are doing it now.

I think the Hon. Minister should go to Singapore and have a look at the process there. You must talk to Mr. K. Shanmugam who is the present Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was previously the Minister of Law as well. When I visited, he made arrangements for me to go and look at the way in which the entire Singapore court process is taking place. They conclude a civil case within eight months, a criminal case within a year, and he told me that this has enabled Singapore to become a successful economy because investors are quite happy that their disputes are settled within a year. Rarely does it go beyond a year. All that is because of electronic filing of documents, adoption of simplified pre-trial procedures, and enforcement of very strict ethical practices - interfering in matters and unnecessary procrastination when it comes to conclusion of cases by the legal fraternity is not allowed. I welcome all the important measures that had been introduced through this groundbreaking legislation - I would call it a groundbreaking legislation which would enable speedy disposal of cases before our courts of law.

Thank you very much. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Presiding Member, I just want to make a small clarification.

The Hon. Rauff Hakeem reminded of the Amendment we proposed on hate speech. In fact, hate speech is an offence in terms of Section 291A of the Penal Code. It states, I quote:

Whoever, with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person, or makes any gesture in the sight of that person, or places any object in the sight of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both."

Section 291B of the Penal Code goes on to state, I quote:

"Whoever, with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of persons,..."

What we were trying to do was - the Hon. Minister, Rauff Hakeem knows about it. - we wanted to make a further amendment in consonance with the ICCPR rules and in fact, that Amendment was approved by the Cabinet. It was presented to Parliament and later some of the parties opposed it, especially the TNA, if my recollection is correct, went to the Supreme Court challenging this Amendment. We compromised. They were satisfied that the existing provision is sufficient to implement the law and then we withdrew that Amendment. I am also of the view that it is not really a matter of any lacking in the laws, but a matter of implementation of the laws. There are three areas we are seriously considering. One is to have a sentencing policy; the other is to have a bail policy and also there has to be some procedure for contempt of court. At the moment, we are looking at these three aspects.

Thank you.

Prime Minister as well as the Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, the Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka explained as to how these things happened. In fact, we discussed this matter in detail in the Cabinet yesterday. The Government took a firm decision to implement the law irrespective of race, religion or any other affiliations. Therefore, we have certainly given that power to the police. We expect the police to implement the law.

Then, with regard to the second matter you mentioned, of course, we closely work with the TNA Leaders. There was a series of cases pending in courts. Therefore, we took measures to have a special High Court to decide on all these matters. Now, you know that the number has

been reduced to 45. Since there is a special High Court Judge appointed especially for these cases, we hope all these will be concluded within the next few months.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you.

In fact, there are only a few, maybe 10 or 15, cases. What I referred to was, the special High Court that was established in Colombo. I will certainly get the numbers in both courts and inform you the next day about our plan as to how we dispose of all these cases as early as possible.

[4.50 p.m.] .. ( , , ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, the Civil Procedure Code was enacted during the late Nineteenth Century and has remained substantially a procedural law applicable in Sri Lanka in respect of institutions and conduct of legal

actions in Sri Lanka. It has been amended from time to time, but yet there are several provisions in the Code that requires amendments in order to expeditiously dispose of the several cases that are pending in the courts today. Throughout the world, countries are taking steps to ensure that actions instituted are expeditiously concluded and Wolf Report in the United Kingdom is an example of the revision of the procedural law.

If you see today in Sri Lanka, with due respect to the Honourable Judges, there is a tremendous delay in the procedural application in the civil procedure as well as the procedural matters of the court is concerned.

I must at the first instance congratulate the Hon. Minister of Justice for having brought these Amendments in the Civil Procedure Code, which will really expeditiously be enacted so that there will be some sort of quick justice brought to this country.

The main proposed Amendments to the Civil Procedure Code are as follows:

1. Amendment to Section 5 has given a wide definition to areas that were either not specified or considered as grey areas such as "Court Expert", "Local Authority", "Provincial Council" and "Public Corporation". These definitions have been clearly laid down in that Amendment to Section 5.

2. Section 27 is amended to include digital data of registered attorney such as email and other electronic addresses.

3. Amendment to enable the client to specify his legal representative in the event of his death. The same is connected to Section 393 of the Civil Procedure Code.

4. Section 29 is amended to enable effective service of summons and notices.

5. Section 79A is a proposed Amendment to accommodate the introduction of a pre-trial hearing. This will benefit parties to attend to formalities without postponement of cases in judicial hearings.

6. Section 80 is replaced in order to fix the date of trial in a more effective manner. The new Section 80A is to avoid any delay if parties seek to delay proceedings by pre-trial steps.

7. Section 93 - amendment of pleadings - is amended to accommodate pre-trials.

8. Sections 142A,142B,142C,142D,142E,142F,142G,142H,142I,142J are dealing with the new concept of pre-trial steps in order to make an effective adjudication of cases without undue delay.

9. Section 148 - Adjournment for evidence - is repealed.

721 722

10. Section 149 has been furthered by 149A. 11. Section 151A is a proposed Amendment with regard to affidavit evidence in order to safely adjudicate without delay.

12. Sections 193 to 198, which deal with death of parties, have been repealed and have been substituted with new sections to effectively nominate parties where death will not delay substitution and action.

The present Amendments seek to bring about certain important changes which should definitely help in the speedy disposal of actions.

Firstly, a provision is made in relation to pre-trial procedure, which is a very important Amendment that has been brought in the Civil Procedure Code. This is one of the most important innovations in the procedural law of Sri Lanka contained in this Bill that is presently presented. There were to some extent provisions relating to pre-trial in the repeal of the Administration of Justice Law. In jurisdictions such as United Kingdom, there is provision for a Master of a Court to deal with many matters which are of a pre-trial nature. The present Bill makes pre-trial a mandatory provision. Once the answer or replication is filed, as the case may be, in the Court shall appoint a date not less than three weeks and not exceeding two months for the purpose of pre-trial proceedings.

At the pre-trial proceedings, parties could tender their proposed admissions and issues and this should be filed in the Court Registry 14 days prior to the date of the pre-trial hearing. The Bill also provides that the pre-trial proceedings should ordinarily conclude within three months from the commencement of the hearing. So, if it can be completed within three months, it is really a commendable thing. At the pre-trial proceedings, the judge could obtain an agreement relating to admission of facts and documents, identify the witnesses based on the admissibility of relevancy, assist the parties to arrive at an adjustment, settlement, compromise or other agreement with regard to matters in issue and take all steps as may appear to the judge to be necessary for the expeditious and inexpensive disposal of the action. A decision of a judge conducting a pre-trial hearing arrived in a manner agreed between the parties shall be binding on the parties. When such agreement is reached, the judge would read out and explain the effect of such agreement and record that the parties understood the contents and the parties shall sign the agreement. In the pre-trial proceedings, agreement could also be reached in regard to proof of documents, number of witnesses to be called, adjustments, settlement or compromise of actions.

Secondly, this Bill also mandates a person to institute action to nominate a successor in the event of his death.

This is also a very important provision. A similar provision also exists in the partition law. The Bill provides that where a registered attorney is appointed, that party shall also nominate at least one person and not more than three persons in order of preference to be his legal representative for the purpose of the action, in the event of his death pending the final determination of the action. This provision is also really a commendable Amendment because, to get a legal representative in the event of a death of a person, there has to be testamentary proceedings and he will have to be adjudicated as an executor or administrator and only after that situation that he can be substituted in a court action. Therefore, this is also a very good nomination that we can have for this purpose.

There is also a provision relating to continuing of action when there are more than one plaintiff or defendant and the continuation of action when the cause of action survives after death. Substitution of legal representatives is well known in Sri Lanka when a party dies during the course of the proceedings and it is a long-drawn-out procedure, which takes considerable time and therefore prolongs the length of the trial. The provisions contained in the Bill would greatly assist in expeditiously disposing of matters where a party dies during the course of the proceedings.

There is also provision relating to the admissibility of documents obtained from public offices and these documents are admissible unless challenged. At present, considerable time is spent in formally proving documents which are official in nature and this time could be saved by the provisions of this section.

There is also a provision relating to giving electronic addresses in the Proxy. In case, such notices could be given to such addresses this would greatly help the mode of giving notice.

Another provision contained in the Bill is the leading of evidence in chief by an affidavit. This would shorten the length of the trial and evidence in chief of witnesses need not be given orally by way of affidavit. The opposing party could cross-examine the affirmant so that there will be no prejudice caused to the parties. This procedure has been successfully used in the Commercial High Courts of Colombo and widening the scope of this provision to other courts is greatly welcome.

It would therefore be seen that the various provisions contained in the Bill are of statutory nature and is one step forward in concluding the large number of pending cases in our courts more expeditiously.

Therefore, I congratulate the Hon. Minister of Justice for having these Amendments brought in by this Bill and I am sure by doing so, we can expeditiously conclude long pending proceedings in the District Court of Colombo.

Thank you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) , - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) () . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) , , especially in the presence of the Hon. (Mrs.) Shanthi Sriskandarasa.

Constantly, there had been allegation against the Government that we are not taking proper steps and not disposing cases filed under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and that we are purposely delaying. That allegation is not reasonable, Hon. Presiding Member, for the reason that we have established two special High Courts to dispose of all these cases. Forty-six cases are now pending in the special High Court in Colombo and there is another High Court which was established some time back in Anuradhapura where there are only 12 cases pending. That is why the Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan mentioned that that High Court is taking up many other cases without giving priority to these 12 cases.

During the year 2016, more than 50 per cent of the cases had been concluded. I very often check on these cases as to why they are not finalized. Factually, the main reason is that there are only a few Counsels who are defending the accused in these cases and those Counsels always come and ask for dates not within a short period of time, but they want dates after a long period of time. That is not the only reason but 90 per cent of cases are being delayed not due to any inefficiency of the Attorney-Generals Department or the presiding Judges, but it is because of the Counsels who are appearing on behalf of the accused. They want dates after a long period of time and they are not ready for trial.

Therefore, I wish to bring this issue to the attention of everybody concerned. If the Counsels appearing for those suspects would co-operate to dispose these cases at the earliest, certainly within a few months, this will be over very soon.

Thank you very much.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka) , " " .

. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Then, the Adjournment Motion to be moved by the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. - , ISSUE OF UNEMPLOYED GRADUATES IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN PROVINCES [6.25p.m] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

Whereas unemployment amongst youth both males and females, after qualifying as graduates has been an acute problem in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in Sri Lanka.

And whereas this problem has been accentuated in the Northern and Eastern Provinces over a period of time as a consequence of (i) diminishing employment opportunities (ii) lack of regular recruitment to public service (iii) lack of employment opportunities in the private sector.

And whereas this situation had come about, as a result of the violence and instability that has prevailed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces consequent to the armed conflict that had prevailed for almost three decades.

And whereas it is now eight years since the armed conflict came to an end but this issue of unemployment amongst educated youth has remained unaddressed.

And whereas thousands of youth both in the Northern and Eastern Provinces have in the past several weeks continued to stage demonstrations to emphasize their plight and to urge that their grievances be suitably addressed.

And whereas the Chief Ministers of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, other Ministers and officials of the said provinces have had discussions with His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister, other Ministers and officials of the Central Government to address this issue in a meaningful way.

And whereas there are vacancies and unfilled positions in both the Central Public Service and in the Provincial Public Services of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, which if filled could address this issue of unemployment amongst unemployed graduates in the Northern and Eastern Provinces at least to some extent.

And whereas youth from all ethnic groups are amongst the unemployed graduates, the worst affected were Tamil youth who were the most victimized as a result of the war and as a step to promote reconciliation and return to normal life, employment of these unemployed graduates should be addressed as a matter of urgency in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

I therefore urge that the Government meaningfully addresses and resolves this issue at the earliest, also in consultation with the Chief Ministers of the Northern and Eastern Provinces."

Having moved my Adjournment Motion, Sir, may I have your indulgence to make a few comments in regard to that. According to figures available, in the Northern Province, there are 4,429 unemployed graduates while in the Eastern Province, the number is around 4,500. I might say that the number of unemployed graduates in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces is much higher than the number of unemployed graduates in other provinces in the country. Comparatively, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces are in a much worse off position than the graduates in the other provinces. I will give the Government some details in regard to unemployment, particularly in the Eastern Province. My Colleagues, who will speak after me, will be furnishing some details in regard to unemployment in the Northern Province.

According to the information available, Sir, there are 4,784 vacancies for teachers in the Eastern Province. I discussed this matter with the Chief Minister this morning and I was told by him that approval has been granted by the Management Services Division and the Finance Division to recruit 1,700 graduates immediately as teachers and they are expecting financial approval for yet about another 900 graduates shortly. The approval for the employment of the balance 1,535 of the cadre is expected to be received shortly and that should be expedited. If these vacancies, the vacancies that exist in regard to teaching in the Eastern Province, are filled, Sir, the number of unemployed graduates in that province would be substantially reduced. Apart from that, there are vacancies in the different Ministries in the Eastern Province. In the Chief Ministers Office, there are 351 vacancies; in the Ministry of Health, there are 341 vacancies; in the Ministry of Agriculture, there are 558 vacancies and in the Ministry of Education, there are 1,535 vacancies, totalling in all to 2,785 vacancies. The Chief Minister has discussed this matter with the President and he has been given the assurance that this matter will be dealt with early.

I also wish to mention, Sir, that while graduates are recruited, the vacancies for graduates in the fine arts sector related to the culture of the Tamil people - music, both vocal and instrumental, and dance and drama, which are important aspects of education - also need to be addressed.

One problem that we have, Sir, in the recruitment of graduates is the age limit. Presently the age limit is 35 and under. I think this should be altered given the conditions that have prevailed in the North and the East over the past 30 years. This age limit should be increased to at least 40, if not a little beyond that, because the number of persons who are qualified to be appointed and who are unemployed are not in a position to apply for an appointment in view of the fact that their age is a barrier to recruitment.

I think, Sir, it would not be wrong to state that there is a responsibility on the part of the Government, on the part of the State to provide employment to educated youth. Of course, this will also depend to a large extent on the level of development that has taken place in the country and it maybe on account of the conflict that we have had for 30 years we have not developed to the extent to which we should have developed. We are, therefore, somewhat seriously handicapped in the matter of being able to provide employment to our educated youth and consequently, educated youths are being deprived of leading a decent life and making their own contribution towards the development of the country. I think, Sir, the Government should address this issue as a very serious issue, particularly when the Government is committed to a process of reconciliation and return to normal life in the war-affected, conflict-ridden areas, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The Government, I think, is under obligation to address this matter meaningfully and purposefully, to deal with this question in an effective and meaningful way.

I want to mention the fact that on two prior occasions - one is during the time of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and again during the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa - a large number of graduates were recruited from throughout the country. They were paid a nominal salary to start with, but they were given a training and according to the training given to them, they were absorbed into the Public Service later, after that training had been completed. The Government should seriously consider adopting a step of that nature where people are recruited, given some training and thereafter they are provided with employment consistent with the training that they have undergone.

We would appeal to the Government to regard this issue as a very serious issue because the people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces who have been the victims of the war for several decades have many complaints to make in regard to missing persons in their

families, in regard to their lands being occupied by the armed forces and not being released, in regard to persons being held in custody, in regard to rehabilitation, resettlement, housing, employment - various matters, and the demonstrations being carried out by educated youth, graduates in the Northern and the Eastern provinces are yet another sad phenomenon. I do not think that should continue and we would appeal to the Government to take some action to bring about some alleviation in the situation at the earliest.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan will be seconding the Motion and after that the Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka will speak.

[6.44p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka - Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity. The Hon. Prime Minister wanted me to respond to the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. The Hon. Prime Minister regrets very much that he is unable to be in the House at this moment due to a prior engagement. The Hon. Prime Minister visited Jaffna over the weekend and the issue of unemployed youth and unemployed graduates was discussed in detail there. Jaffna District MPs were involved in that discussion; the Chief Minister was also there and so were some Ministers of the Provincial Council.

The war situation that prevailed in the North and the East unfortunately stopped employment creation in those parts of the country. So, there has been a severe imbalance of creation of employment in the North and the East, which the South did not suffer as much - not even the remote areas. We want to resolve this issue and the Hon. Prime Minister wanted me to communicate to the House that as a first measure approximately 1,000 vacancies in the North will be filled. This will be as Development Officers and in the teacher cadre. The graduates are mostly Arts graduates. Some training will have to be given for them to be able to perform their duties and this will be undertaken as well. They will be trained in the appropriate subjects. Similar measures will also be taken in the East. So, I just wanted to briefly make these comments in the House on behalf of the Prime Minister. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, may I be permitted to make an observation? ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Absolutely. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) True enough the war that lasted for 30 years had been the cause of a serious imbalance in the matter of employment. But now it is eight years since the war came to an end. The present Government has been in office for the past two years and some of these graduates have been unemployed for five to eight years.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) And there are vacancies. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I think it is a very serious situation because they, being young people, are unemployed and they have to continue to suffer. If the issue is not addressed in some meaningful way there can be a great deal of frustration and there can be other consequences. I would appeal to the Hon. Minister to convey this to the Prime Minister and to the Government that while we appreciate that 1,000 people are to be employed immediately in the Northern Province - and you have talked about the East - at least, a similar number must be immediately employed in the East as well. In fact, my information is that 1,700 persons are to be recruited as teachers in the Eastern Province and that has been approved by the Department of Management Services. Also, there has been financial provision made for that. So, all these things must happen.

There are vacancies in the Public Service also and those vacancies must be identified. Those positions, if vacant, must be filled. We would urge the Government to take this mater very seriously because we are concerned with the temperament that is prevailing amongst our youth. They feel that no one is bothered about them. That is not good; that is not good for the country. Sir, we would firmly urge the Government to take very early action in regard to this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You said that 1,000 persons will be recruited in a short period of time. Is it in the North alone? ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Yes, only in the North and similar measures are to be taken in the East. I do not know the exact numbers in the East. But, the Opposition Leaders comments are well taken. This was also discussed when the Prime Minister was there. We have to look beyond the employment of the graduates as well. There are many other youth who are unemployed. A serious amount of investment will have to go for private investment. Business ventures will have to start in the North and the East. Tourism is one such area that can take off quickly. The Government has its eyes out there and we really want to do that. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran. Before that, the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will take the Chair.

The number of vacancies that have been identified, that can be filled by persons who are qualified to do those jobs, is said to be 1,000 in the North and a similar number in the East as a first step. Is it not possible for the Government

to say by when will that be done? I am asking this for the reason, as you know, that both in the North and the East, these graduates have been staging demonstrations on the roads. If we can possibly give them a date by which that first step could be taken, that will be some solace to them. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Ashu Marasinghe) I think the Hon. State Minister will talk about that. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Niroshan Perera - State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) The Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Management will speak at the end of the Debate and he will spell out all the solutions and how many vacancies have been filled. He will answer that question. But, before that, I will speak in general about the unemployment situation in the country.
