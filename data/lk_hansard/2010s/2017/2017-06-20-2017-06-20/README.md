. [4.51p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Presiding Member, as you may be aware, Sri Lanka is now facing many challenges of economic growth. Sri Lankas economy has been experiencing a lower growth averaging around 4.4 per cent during the past four years. An external environment characterized by sluggish growth amidst slow international trade coupled with unfortunate and unfavourable domestic conditions such as drought and floods reduced the momentum of its growth. The expansion in GDP has primarily been due to the growth in non-tradable activities while the contribution from exports to GDP growth has been insignificant. A policy framework which included an overvalued exchange rate that was often uncompetitive with para-tariffs that increase effective protection contributed to a strong anti-export bias in the economy. Persistent fiscal deficits, high Government debt levels and external current account deficits have resulted in poor investor confidence and low levels of Foreign Direct

1607 1608

2017 20

Investments and private investments. In addition, the structural rigidities in the labour market have also hindered growth in our economy.

Realizing these challenges of growth and the need for macroeconomic stability, our Government, in the recent past, has forged ahead with reforms to the macroeconomic policy. Sri Lankas macroeconomic policy strategy rests on three pillars. The first pillar is the fiscal policy reform. Through this, we expect higher government revenues, rationalization of expenditure, lowering the budget deficit, reforms to State-owned enterprises and stronger public financial management. This is now being undertaken by the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media. The second pillar is the monetary policy reform, which is being undertaken by the Central Bank with the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. Here, a lower inflation will be a high priority and we are looking at a market-based, flexible exchange rate policy that will maintain competiveness. The third pillar is the trade and investment policy reform, which is being undertaken by our Ministry. It is our objective to enhance exports from the current US Dollars 11 billion to US Dollars 20 billion in 2020, increase Foreign Direct Investments and further liberalization of the trade regime.

A buoyant export performance is imperative for sustaining the growth momentum of the economy. Sri Lankas share of the global exports has reduced from 0.09 per cent in 2000 to 0.06 per cent in 2016. Exports as a share of the GDP have declined from 33.3 per cent in 2000 to 12.7 per cent in 2016. Given the size and purchasing power of our domestic market, an export-led strategy is absolutely essential for achieving the targets set for growth in the countrys medium-term trajectory.

Our export structure is largely dependent on a few export products such as apparel, tea and rubber-based products while traditional markets such as Europe and the United States account for about two-thirds of our total exports. This situation is certainly not good enough. The diversification and enhancement of export earnings is essential to arrest the declining trend seen in exports. Export diversification entails enhancing the sophistication of products with more value addition and the use of new technology while penetrating into new markets and harnessing the full potential of preferential trade agreements.

Sri Lanka needs to re-launch the manufacturing sector as an engine of growth to promote growth and employment generation. A comprehensive integrated industrial strategy is needed taking into account trade, fiscal and labour market policies. Para- tariffs imposed for revenue purposes increase the cost of imports which may be used as inputs in the production of exports. Therefore, these exports can be uncompetitive in the international markets. We need to establish cluster- based industrial zones and this is already being addressed by the Board of Investment. We need to establish Technology Business Incubators to promote start-ups. These Technology

Business Incubators - TBIs - provide a host of services such as business planning and training, technical assistance, information dissemination on product ideas and technologies, finances, common facilities such as labs and computers and workspace for a limited period.

We also have to increase the value addition through proper application of R and D - Research and Development. We need to use high-tech methods such as Nanotechnology to increase the value addition or commodity exports through research institutions such as SLINTEC and it is also important for us to build a brand for Sri Lankan products. In this regard, the Export Development Board in collaboration with the International Trade Centre has formulated a new export strategy and their idea is to have 2,000 new exporters by 2020. This project was launched in Jaffna and we are hopeful that every industry in Sri Lanka will be an exporter.

We also need to negotiate bilateral agreements with China, India, Singapore and with the UK after they leave the European Union. While doing this, we must also target key industries to benefit from the GSP Plus restoration which we recently received and at the same time, we are aware that some of these industries will be affected and as such, we need to implement a trade adjustment package to improve competitiveness of domestic industries and retrain labour. We may have to look at helping these industries, bringing in new machinery and new technology so that they can also compete in the world market. At the same time, we need legislative protection for domestic industries and, in the very near future we will bring in the anti-dumping bill to safeguard the Sri Lankan industries from cheap imports. I think this will be brought in by the Ministry of Industries and Commerce in the next few weeks. We also introduce a new trade policy and this has been discussed with all the stakeholders, the professional associations, the trade chambers, the private sector and within a short period, the new policy will be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers and once it is approved, it will be tabled in Parliament.

I think we also have to look at the service sector. We have got to improve the Sri Lankan service exports in the fields of the KPOs - Knowledge Process Outsourcing- and the BPOs - Business Process Outsourcing - so that we can bring in more revenue to the country. We also got to move up the ICT value chain to supply global businesses with solutions. These are the areas that we can compete with the rest of the world and as mentioned by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, it is absolutely important for us to attract more FDIs and to do so, it is important to create an environment conducive for FDIs, focused on improving the investment climates by addressing bureaucratic constraints, establishing and maintaining consistent policies, improving trade logistics such as warehousing, access to ports and airports and customs clearing. We have also set up a taskforce to undertake this project and it will be launched towards the end of this

1609 1610

month. While doing so, we have also got to address the labour shortage and skills mismatch in the domestic labour market. We have got to develop more technical and vocational training in programmes while encouraging more students at GCE O/L and GCE A/L to enroll in these programmes by offering students some kind of allowance.

We must also look at improving the female labour force participation in our industries. Finally, Sir, we have to look at labour reforms. We have got to relax the rigidities in the labour market to facilitate the private sector. We have to look at permitting part-time work and introduce flexible working hours. Sir, the Government is fully aware of what has to be done. As mentioned by the Hon. Amunugama, we can only increase our economic growth and accelerate it through enhancing our exports and through FDIs as they will not only bring in the funding, but they will also bring in the know-how.

Thank you very much.
