I consider it, Sir, a great privilege that as the Leader of the Opposition, I have, with the Hon. Prime Minister, been able to move this Motion commemorating todays Sitting of Parliament as the Seventieth Anniversary of its first meeting. The first meeting of Sri Lankas independent Parliament was on the 14th of October, 1947 at Independence Square in Colombo, when the Duke of Gloucester acting on behalf of the Kingdom and the Government of the United Kingdom, the last of our colonial rulers granted Sri Lanka, then known as "Ceylon", our Independence, thus liberating us from foreign rule.

We had been under foreign rule for more than 400 years - 443 years to be exact. You would permit me, Mr. Speaker, to recall that as a young boy, I was personally present at Independence Square when Sri Lanka was granted Independence and that I watched that event with great pride. Our first Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake received that instrument of Independence on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka. We were then a united people. All the people of Sri Lanka, irrespective of ethnic or religious differences, wanted independence from foreign rule. In fact, the Jaffna Youth League voicing the sentiments of the Tamil people were not happy with the Dominion Status. They wanted Purna Swaraj, meaning absolute Independence.

We have, in the past 70 years, preserved democratic governance through electoral processes, though one must admit not completely without blemish. The truth must be acknowledged that electoral processes alone cannot ensure democratic governance. Recognition and respect for pluralism are fundamental in the achievement of genuine democracy. Incipient steps towards respect and recognition of pluralism by agreement between much-respected leaders of this country were unfortunately not implemented. Constitutions that were claimed to be autochthonous were no more than self-serving and did not, in any way, served the needs of a pluralistic society. On the contrary, they entrenched majoritarianism.

We have had insurrections and long periods of armed conflict from which the whole country and all its people have suffered greatly. The worst victims have been the Tamil people who have long struggled for the preservation of their identity and dignity. Issues that were the cause of the armed conflict remain and need to be resolved. We have, Sir, all of us, learnt many lessons from the most harmful situations that have prevailed in our country.

It would be a tragedy if in the name of patriotism - more exactly "pseudo-patriotism" - anyone seeks to prolong these harmful situations. It must be conceded that despite shortcomings, the country is more normal and peaceful now than it has been in the past. The country is now engaged in several processes to create for the country a future devoid of conflict and violence where issues are resolved through discussion and debate and on the basis of substantial national consensus. This would mean that all the Sri Lankan people, irrespective of their ethnic or religious differences in a united, undivided, indivisible Sri

Lanka, look upon Sri Lanka as their own country and willingly become an integral part of the Sri Lankan nation with a Sri Lankan identity. It is that Mr. Speaker, which will fulfil our wish for prosperity, development and further strengthening of democratic traditions, principles and the rule of law in Sri Lanka as stated in the Motion moved by the Hon. Prime Minister and seconded by me.

Today, we are attempting to move towards being a united people in a united, undivided and indivisible country. I do not think there can be any disagreement on that. If we want our wish for Sri Lanka to succeed, we need to unitedly work towards achievement of that goal.

Thank you, Sir. [2.57 p.m.] ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella - Minister of Higher Education and Highways and Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon. Speaker, today is a very historic day as we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka. During this period, a very large number of distinguished Members of Parliament have served the nation. I think it is our duty now on this solemn occasion to remember those who served from 1947 up to now and even those who served from the days of the State Council in 1833 - 116 years of legislative process.

Hon. Speaker, during this period, our country has had many upheavals. We have had two youth insurrections, a failed coup d'tat, and a 30-year old civil war. Despite all this, Parliamentary democracy has survived in Sri Lanka. So, this is a tribute to all those Members of Parliament who served far back as 1833.

Briefly I will mention, Sir, the steps taken by this Parliament, in which you are the Hon.Speaker, to strengthen Parliament.

His Excellency the President was elected in 2015. For the first time in the history, the President gave up his powers to Parliament. It has not happened anywhere in the world where a person elected President has given up his powers to Parliament. Actually he gave more. He gave a lot more than what is stated in the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. But the Supreme Court said, If you want to give up those powers, you have to have a referendum. Otherwise he was gladly willing and very keen to give more powers to Parliament. So, the aim of the Prime Minister and His Excellency the President is to strengthen Parliament. We must strengthen Parliament, Sir. That is our aim. The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution brought Independent Commissions. The

861 862

[ ]

2017 03

Hon.Speaker presides over the Constitutional Council that appoints Independent Commissions and consequently the Parliament becomes strengthened.

Then, the Hon. Prime Minister brought in the Sectoral Oversight Committees. Sir, when we were in the Opposition, we were barely counsulted by Parliament for the day-to-day running of Parliament. We were there, but we did not have a say. But the Hon. Prime Minister, Sir, have brought the Sectoral Oversight Committees, where not only the Government but even the Opposition Members take part. Out of the 17 Sectoral Oversight Committees, we have given 9 to the Opposition where Opposition Members are chairing and taking decisions on behalf of the Government.

Then, we have brought the Right to Information Act, a long felt need. Sir, when you were a Member of Parliament in the Opposition, you brought in this Bill and you may recall the reception it got during that period. So, it is our duty to strengthen Parliament and to see that all Members of Parliament take part in the process of governance. We have governed only for two years. In the coming years, the Hon. Prime Minister will be chairing the Steering Committee of Parliament to adopt a new Constitution. I hope this will be a dream come true because we have framed two Constitutions since Independence. When those Constitutions were framed, some parties boycotted; the Tamil Parties boycotted - Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaikes Constitution and Mr. J.R. Jayewardenes Constitution. For the first time in the history of Sri Lankan Parliament, all parties in Parliament are in the Steering Committee. There have been 75 to 80 sittings of the Steering Committee. I must say all Members of Parliament have become moderate. They have shed their extremist views in order to come to a settlement. Sir, everyone knows that when we gained Independence we were next to Japan. Other countries wanted to emulate us. We were called Switzerland of the East. But, where are those countries now and where are we today?

So, let us all resolve on this historic occasion to shed party differences and to make this country a united Sri Lanka where all communities can live in peace and harmony.

Finally, I wish to thank the Speakers of the SAARC countries who have come here today. I wish them a very pleasant stay in Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

[3.27 p.m.] ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Speaker, while we celebrate on this solemn occasion 70 years of our Parliamentary history, it is opportune for us to look squarely at our profound failure to forge an overarching national ethos of democratic debate and also to reflect with some degree of disappointment at the gradual decline of the quality of debate in this House.

The First Parliament disenfranchised a segment of people who voted at the elections that elected it. That was the thin end of the wedge that over the years developed into a process resulting in a terrible conflict that lasted three decades. Emerging from the conflict we ultimately defeated a virulent secessionist movement, but totally and abjectly failed up to now to restore the kinships and fraternal relations among our diverse people. There emerged a triumphalist mindset that enveloped this Parliament as well. The Parliamentary majority jettisoned the essential Parliamentary feature of accommodating dissent. Alternative points of view could not be presented at times. What was more pathetic was that alternative views were considered rebellious, anti-national and unpatriotic. Mr. Speaker, Mark Twain once said that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. The tone and tenor of debate acquired an intensity that was harsh and

869 870

[ ]

2017 03

hysterical and far removed from the harmony expected in a deliberative forum such as ours.

Sir, today, we are on the threshold of a process of constitutional reforms to avoid the pitfalls of the past. There is now before us a debate on the relative merits and faults of Presidential and Parliamentary forms of governance. Our Leaders, His Excellency the President as well as the Hon. Prime Minister alluded to the impending reforms that we propose to introduce. Whatever form we adopt must ensure transparency, acceptability and high quality of legislative output and executive excellence. What we should do is to arrive at a trade-off between the two systems with an institutional structure that is resilient in ensuring the interests of the people notwithstanding the politics of expediency that is inherent in competitive party politics.

The first General Elections, Mr. Speaker, in 1947 that returned the First Parliament of independent Sri Lanka had 361 candidates of whom 181 were independents.

The UNP fielded 98 candidates, but succeeded only in gaining 42 Seats. We must realize that these results indicated accurately the composition of the wider electorate and its diversity in terms of ethnic and socio-political interests. Falling short of a clear majority, the United National Party then, under the visionary leadership of the Hon. D.S. Senanayake, formed a Government with the All Ceylon Tamil Congress.

Then, immediately thereafter in 1948 when the new Government moved to disenfranchise the plantation workers of Indian origin, that created a deep fissure in Tamil politics with the late Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam forming the Federal Party. Rest is history and we have witnessed how those fault lines were created, I must say not so much by the fact that the plantation workers were Tamils, but because they constituted an organized trade union movement that supported the Left parties in the first elections.

Those historical aberrations were corrected after decades of struggle and conflict. What it tells us is that a move to preserve the interests of the propertied classes who frowned on organized labour as a threat to their economic interests, later acquired an ethno-religious character that undermined the ethnic and religious harmony that existed for centuries in this country. We must move away from repeating mistake after mistake, which would warrant correction and would subject communities to further distress when their voices are not heard or further suppressed.

Sir, we are also discussing electoral reforms. When discussing electoral reforms, whatever reforms we bring in must be based on the principles of equity and fairness. We are looking at a mixed model of elections. We have witnessed in the past few weeks heated debate within the Well of this House, outside this House and within the Committee chaired by the Hon. Prime Minister guiding the constitutional process- the Steering Committee. There are accusations from outside that there is a collateral purpose in bringing new legislation. We had to reflect on

all these allegations and also ensure that the Provincial Councils Elections that have been denied to certain provinces would not be unnecessarily and unduly delayed. It is our responsibility to ensure that we have periodic elections, that we test the will of the people and be courageous enough to face the verdict of the people.

With those comments, Sir, may I also finally say that this House has succeeded in bringing groundbreaking legislation during this Session: the Right to Information Act as well as some other legislations which are on the pipeline. I came directly from a Cabinet Subcommittee that is examining the National Audit Bill, which is one of those other important pieces of legislation that we have pledged to introduce in this House. Therefore, Sir, much awaits us in this august Assembly before we complete our term.

Let me take this opportunity to wish all those who have come to witness this solemn occasion, all the very best and also let us extend our hands of friendship to those deprived communities outside that we will ensure these democratic traditions that have been enshrined through the valued traditions in this House will be properly safeguarded for posterity and forever.

Thank you.
