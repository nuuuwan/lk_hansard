Sir, when you were a Member of Parliament in the Opposition, you brought in this Bill and you may recall the reception it got during that period. So, it is our duty to strengthen Parliament and to see that all Members of Parliament take part in the process of governance. We have governed only for two years. In the coming years, the Hon. Prime Minister will be chairing the Steering Committee of Parliament to adopt a new Constitution. I hope this will be a dream come true because we have framed two Constitutions since Independence. When those Constitutions were framed, some parties boycotted; the Tamil Parties boycotted - Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaikes Constitution and Mr. J.R. Jayewardenes Constitution. For the first time in the history of Sri Lankan Parliament, all parties in Parliament are in the Steering Committee. There have been 75 to 80 sittings of the Steering Committee. I must say all Members of Parliament have become moderate. They have shed their extremist views in order to come to a settlement. Sir, everyone knows that when we gained Independence we were next to Japan. Other countries wanted to emulate us. We were called Switzerland of the East. But, where are those countries now and where are we today?",
