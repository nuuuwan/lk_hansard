( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . [.. 12.24] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.

, . , , , .

So, I am indeed very happy that the Hon. Asoka Priyantha brought in this Private Members Motion.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, as a Member representing the Puttalam District, I would like to say that we have set an example for the whole nation because communities belonging to various religions live together peacefully in the Puttalam District without any problem. There were a lot of problems to minority communities right around the country. But I am happy to say that none of such problems have arisen in our district, because the religious leaders and political leaders of all communities there get together and guide the people. This, I am sure, is an example to the rest of the country.

573 574

I would like to mention that famous places of worship are situated in Puttalam. The famous Thalawila Catholic Church and Pallekandal Catholic Church are situated in Puttalam. I think, these two churches are the biggest churches after the Madu Church. The famous Udappuwa Temple and the Munneswaram Temple of the Hindus' are also situated in our district. Most of the Buddhists do not know about the famous rock temple in Anamaduwa which has been completely carved out of rocks. However, a large number of devotees visit there. We also have a famous mosque in Puttalam.

Why I am saying these things is to tell you how we all are united religious wise. I would like to mention this fact since the Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka is also present here. He too knows that. Whatever problem occurred in other parts of Sri Lanka in the last two months, none of such incidents occurred in Puttalam. That is because we work together and live in unity. We have a religious leaders committee consisting of clergies from all religions in our area. Therefore, if any problem crops up, they are there to help us and guide us. I think this type of practice can be carried out in other districts too.

As the Hon. Hector Appuhamy told, Prince Vijaya landed in our area. That is the place known as "Thammannawa" which is located in the Vilpattu area. Therefore, the communities in Sri Lanka descended from our area. Kuveni also lived in our area. In addition to that, I would like to say that Ibn Battuta, the famous traveler who came to Sri Lanka, also landed in Puttalam. So, the Muslim community also descended from our area.

In addition, I must say that except tea and rubber, all other crops are found in Puttalam. Business wise, agricultural wise or fisheries wise, we all work together. As you know even electricity is generated from the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. So, it is in this kind of an area that we live and it is this kind of support that we give to the rest of the country.

As you know, there is a famous Muslim girls' school called "Fathima Girls School" in Puttalam. When I was in the Provincial Council, we started Sinhala medium education in Tamil medium schools. In other parts of the country, they do not have Sinhala medium education in Tamil medium schools and Tamil medium education in Sinhala medium schools. Therefore, setting an example, we started Sinhala medium education in Tamil medium Muslim schools. I am really happy, today, that school has Sinhala medium up to GCE A/L and last year, three Tamil-speaking Muslim girls who studied in Sinhala medium have entered the university. Sir, all these problems begin because of lack of communication. The Tamil and the Muslim children who are studying in Tamil medium do not converse in Sinhala and the Sinhala medium students do not converse in Tamil. So, this is the main problem.

I am happy to say that it has changed a lot. Most of the Tamil and the Muslim students in Puttalam are studying

in Sinhala and the Sinhala students are also studying in Tamil. So, if we can extend what we are doing in the Puttalam District to other districts, I am sure, these unwanted, unnecessary problems created by a few people - he maybe a Sinhalese, a Tamil or a Muslim - can be brought to an end and a better understanding can be created among all communities. So, we will get together, improve and increase the unity of this country in the future.

Therefore, once again, I thank the Hon. Member - he is a young Member - who brought in this Motion. As a Member of Parliament from Puttalam District, I am sure that what we are doing will be carried on and no problem will never ever crop up in Puttalam. I also hope this will be extend to the other districts too.

Thank you very much. , . . Question put, and agreed to.
