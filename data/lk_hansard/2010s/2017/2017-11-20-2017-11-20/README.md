[11.18a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Chairman, I am going to speak on a matter on which I have spoken before. That is the question of the number of persons who are being held in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Law - Tamil political prisoners. Some of them have been convicted, some of

them have not been charged and some of them have been charged and their cases are pending. I have discussed this matter, Sir, with His Excellency the President. I have also discussed this matter with the Hon. Prime Minister and we have always found that their positions have been quite reasonable when we discussed this issue with them. We now have a new Minister of Justice and we are looking forward to being able to resolve this matter in a reasonable manner with the new Minister of Justice. I am not blaming the former Minister of Justice. He did not disagree with us, but there was no action being taken by him; things have continued in the same way and nothing else happened. Sir, there are two main fundamental issues that one has to consider when dealing with this question. One is that those are persons who have committed certain crimes for political reasons. They are not persons who have committed crimes for personal benefit or against society, in that sense of the word. These crimes have been committed for political reasons. That is indisputable. In regard to crimes committed for political reasons, political decisions have been made that those persons can be pardoned and can be released. That has happened in the past in this country. I have said that before a number of times in Parliament. In the insurrection in 1971 and subsequently, during the insurrection in 1987, 1988 and 1989, a large number of persons who committed crimes for political reasons were granted an amnesty, a pardon and they were released Sir, I have posed this question before and I want to pose it again: why can the same thing not be done now in regard to these persons? If you feel that a person has committed a crime, not for a political reason, but for a personal reason or for some other reason, I would not press you. But, if you are in agreement that these persons have committed these crimes for political reasons, then they must be viewed in the same way in which such cases were viewed earlier in 1971, 1987, 1988 and 1989. Sir, the second matter that I want to emphasize is that all these persons have been taken into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Law. Your Government has conceded and accepted that the Prevention of Terrorism Law is an obnoxious law and that you will repeal it. You have made such commitments to the United Nations Human Rights Council, not once, several times and you are, in fact, engaged in a process of drafting a new law and repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Law. That is because the manner of arrest, the manner of investigations, extracting confessions, basing prosecutions entirely on extracted confessions, the manner of prosecution, the nature of the evidence and the manner of judicial finding under the Prevention of Terrorism Law are very different from the rules of justice that prevail when proceedings are conducted under the normal laws of the country.

477 478

When you yourself admit that the law is obnoxious, the law must be repealed and you are taking steps to repeal the law, my question is, how do you justify keeping persons in custody under that law, at whatever stage their case may be? So, that is an additional factor which I submit in the strong reason for these matters to be considered separately. His Excellency the President pardoned the person who tried to assassinate him. Why? Because the President was convinced that that man tried to assassinate him for a political reason, not for a personal reason. If a person who tried to assassinate the President can be granted a pardon, why can other prisoners not be granted pardon for crimes which are much lesser in seriousness than that particular crime? These are matters, Sir, that need to be addressed; these are matters which you need to think about. Very unfortunately, the former Minister of Justice had not paid his attention, in my view, adequately to this matter. I would earnestly make a request to the new Minister. Hon. Minister, after you come back from Korea - I know you are going to Korea with His Excellency the President - and at the convenience of the Hon. Prime Minister, kindly summon a meeting of the Attorney-General, the officials of the Ministry of Law and Order and other persons who should be summoned and we will discuss this matter and try to work out some arrangement because there are a number of demonstrations and fasts that are taking place, both in the North and the East on behalf of these prisoners. Sir, I have got here with me a letter sent to me by the students of the University of Jaffna, asking me to come to Jaffna to meet with them, to explain to me their position. I am unable to go to Jaffna because I have other commitments in Colombo, which are more important. But, I understand the feelings of those students. They are wondering why these persons have been held in custody when other persons who were charged with political crimes earlier on have been released. So, Sir, I think this matter should come to an end. I was here listening to my honourable Colleague from Mannar when he talked about the three cases that have been transferred to Anuradhapura from Vavuniya. I took that matter up in Parliament by way of an Adjournment Motion some time ago and you were not in the country at that point of time. There was a commitment that when you retuned, there would be a meeting and this matter would be sorted out. But, that matter has not yet been sorted out. I know that there are persons in this country who are trying to promote communal tensions by raising issues on all these matters to prevent the right thing being done. There are persons who will even say that if these prisoners are released, the country will be divided; there are persons who will say such absurd things. But, we

cannot be intimidated and threatened by these people for all time. At some point of time, you must do the right thing. Your Government has been in office for almost three years and these matters have been pending; these issues have been pending for three years. Sir, I want to appeal to the Hon. Minister, kindly, after you return from abroad, summon a meeting. We will consult the Hon. Prime Minister; we will consult His Excellency the President and we will consult the Attorney-General; you will be present and we will come to a decision in regard to some of these matters. I do not think, Sir, these matters should be allowed to drag on indefinitely because that is not good for the country; that is not good for reconciliation and that is not good for harmony. These young people must not feel that they are being treated differently. After all, in this country, the armed conflict has come to an end. The LTTE is no more. We do not want the LTTE to return. We do not want violence. We want a resolution of the conflict within the framework of a united, undivided, perpetually indivisible Sri Lanka. That is something we publicly state. So, why do we not try to make harmony with people? Why do we not try to reconcile our differences in a way in which these differences are normally resolved? I would like to appeal both the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister who were present in Parliament when we had the Adjournment Debate to kindly address this question seriously. And Hon. Minister, I would be grateful if on your return, you will convene a meeting where we can discuss this matter and arrive at some decisions.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . . , [ ] .

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, you have 20 minutes.

[11.55a.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Chairman, first of all we must thank the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, for presenting a very progressive forward-looking Budget which has given a clear message. An outward-oriented economy is the path towards prosperity of our people. Sri Lanka from the times of the ancient kings has always benefited from an open and liberal global trading regime. So, any reversal of that will definitely hurt us as we have seen during the previous periods from 1970 to 77 and during the last regime. Our Government is now firmly focused on making the country more open to the world and become an attractive place to do business. I remember as a young professional in 1977 when I heard about the kind of new economic reforms and the opening up of the economy I was excited and encouraged to become an entrepreneur. That is the kind of spirit that would be kindled in many young people having heard the direction announced in the Budget 2018 Speech. The focus of our Government has shifted from a growth model that was heavily dependent on public infrastructure spending to a growth driven more by private enterprises, exports and Foreign Direct Investment. Yes, some jobs do get created by Government infrastructure projects, but that is neither sustainable nor sufficient mainly for two reasons. Firstly, our debt burden is too high to keep trying to drive the economy with Government spending. We need the private sector to grow in this economy. When I mean the private sector, I am talking about every single entrepreneur and enterprise and not just the larger companies. According to the economic census, 99 per cent of establishments in this country are micro, small and medium enterprises. Our economy is full of enterprising people, enterprising Sri Lankans and we must ensure that we create the best possible environment for them to have, for them to thrive, not only for those who are entrepreneurs today but those who are aspiring to become entrepreneurs tomorrow and in the future. Secondly, our domestic market is too small to keep trying to drive the economy with inward-looking policies. We have to trade with the world; we have to export to the world and we have to welcome the world to our shores. That is why our Ministry has taken concrete steps to strengthen this aspect of the economy through a series of initiatives and programmes focusing on exports, FDIs, ease of doing business, trade agreements and bilateral economic cooperation.

A new trade policy was approved by the Cabinet in July 2017 to stimulate growth and job creation by improving the ability of firms to export and to compete for the domestic market through a modern, liberal, simple, transparent and creditable trade regime. The NTP that we launched addresses four key elements: competitiveness through domestic policy reforms; market access and trade facilitation; macro-economic balance, policy and institutional coherence and helping the adjustment of enterprises and workers. Hon. Chairman, the most significant trade policy measures we are undertaking is the negotiation of bilateral partnership agreements. The FTA in goods with India is being deepened and it is being broadened to include services, investment, technology and training. We have to recognize that India is expected to be the fastest-growing economy in the world in the coming years with a middle-class consumer base that will be 10 to 15 times our own domestic market. Currently, six-rounds of negotiations of ETCA have been successfully concluded and the seventh round is scheduled to be held in December. Our key objective of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement with India is to resolve the implementation issues of the existing FTA. During the ETCA negotiations, India has agreed to implement an early harvest the day ETCA comes into force to address outstanding non-tariff barriers in the Indian market as well as many of the existing procedural barriers and delays in Indian ports of entry. This will particularly benefit exports of perishable goods such as fruits, vegetables, fish and so on. Moreover, Sri Lanka is negotiating the removal of quotas on apparel, pepper and vanaspati. An important new measure will be the establishment of the structural grievance redressal mechanism to resolve problems faced by Sri Lankan exporters in a firm and time-bound manner. A very clear decision has been made not to include solely the Mode 4 base movement of independent professionals under this Agreement. It will not be opened up. Meanwhile, the China-Sri Lanka FTA will generate nearly 700 million dollars of trade. The apparel sector alone is set to gain US Dollars 400 million in new trade. To date 6 rounds of negotiations have concluded and the agreement contains nine chapters. During these six rounds, a substantial progress has been made. We are also nearing completion of negotiations on the FTA with Singapore, having completed seven rounds of negotiations. We have particularly focused on encouraging Singaporean investments into Sri Lanka. The agreement is expected to be signed in January, 2018. Hon. Chairman, in addition, GSP Plus had been restored providing preferential market access for 6,000 plus items. If things proceed according to plan it is

487 488

possible the narrative will be, Sri Lanka has preferential access to a market of over 3 billion, China, EU, India, Pakistan, and Singapore". In a world where over 190 countries are competing for FDI this preferential market access can be a unique differentiator. Hon. Chairman, as you know Sri Lanka ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement earlier this year. As a key component of this effective national coordination a National Trade Facilitation Committee has been established to drive the implementation of Sri Lankas TFA commitments. On trade facilitation, a single electronic window is established to be in operation in the Customs Department shortly. These measures are intended to reduce the transaction cost of the cross-border movement of goods thereby enhancing the trade competitiveness of the economy. All these measures are intended to improve the investment climate and trading environment for both domestic and foreign investors. We are aware of the possible trade disruptions that can occur during the transition period. An Anti-dumping and Countervailing Measures Bill and a Safeguard Measures Bill are being presented to Parliament soon. The Bills are ready and I think this can be debated and approved in December or January. This will protect domestic business from unfair competition. A trade adjustment package is developed to improve the resilience of the local businesses exposed to increased competition as a result of trade liberalization. Support for local industries is to upgrade machinery and introduce new technology and to provide retraining for workers. Foreign Direct Investments into Sri Lanka has been performing poorly but with efforts that our Ministry is taking this has begun to turn round. At the Board of Investment, we now have leading private sector personalities, specialists leading investment promotion and appraisals to ensure we get the best of investors to our country that we facilitate them well and tell the other investors about the opportunities here. The approvals and facilitation process for foreign investors is being completely streamlined with decisions being taken quicker more transparently than ever before. The one-stop shop mechanism is being set up to address regulatory inefficiencies and inter-agency coordination. An organization structure of the OSS and a web solution for OSS approval process has been developed. The BOI has revised its goals and targets in its new Corporate Plan 2017 to 2020 with a view to playing a key role in contributing to the sustainable development of the country driven by FDI. This new Corporate Plan presents a bold and a new strategic approach to targeting and securing significantly higher values of high quality FDI. To complement this, a Single Window Investment Appraisal Committee was established to facilitate

granting of approvals within the shortest possible time. An investment facilitation committee is also in place to fast- track approvals of other line agencies. The flagship investment that we brought in 2017 is the new Logistic and Industrial Zone at Hambantota with an initial FDI flow of US Dollars 1.12 billion. A further UD Dollars 500 million is expected within the next two to three years. The Zone is being developed with Chinese investment and we expect a lot of investors, not only from Chinese companies but from many other Asian countries, would be interested in this. The next will be the Industrial Zones in Milleniya, Mawathagama, Bingiriya and Weligama. The Industrial Park at Milleniya will be an investment from the Rojana Industries of Thailand who is operating seven industrial zones in Thailand mainly with the Japanese investors. The new Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017 provides a predictability of incentives for new investment and introduces a new incentive regime with effect from 01st April, 2018 which is based on enhanced capital or investment allowances. Mr. Chairman, our Ministry is committed to leading the effort in improving the ease of doing business for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and foreign investors. With technical assistance from the World Bank, we developed a roadmap for Investment Climate Reforms which was launched in July, this year. In the last three months alone, eight teams of Government officials representing public service delivery agencies have been working on eight high priority ease of doing business sub-indicators: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering a property, getting credit, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and protecting minority interests. Under the eight priority sub-indicators, 15 specific measures to be taken and the timeframes, responsible agencies and outcomes have been identified and the work is progressing accordingly. Outcomes for mid-2018 include providing a one-day service for company registration to reduce the time taken to register a company from the current nine days to one day, introducing a streamlined online system to reduce the number of days for construction permit issuance from current 115 days to 60 days and introducing a searchable e-Land Registry to enable property registration in five days with two steps rather than the current 51 days with nine steps. The Blueprint of the long-awaited National Single Window will be completed by June, 2018 paving the way to establish a system that integrates more than 20 agencies dealing with various clearances and approvals in trading across borders. Our Ministry is continuously monitoring the reform process towards achieving the objective set out by the Hon. Prime Minister in moving up in the DBI ranking to be within the top twenty economies by 2020.

These are some of the examples or just some of many outgoing measures the Government is taking to improve the business climate in Sri Lanka for domestic enterprises as well as for foreign investors through legal regulatory and procedural improvements. While this is an ongoing process and benefits will take time to materialize, the positive results are already being seen. An internal report suggests FDI this year will be about 80 per cent more than the last year. We expect FDIs over US Dollars 1 billion - about US Dollars 1.2 billion - this year and in the next year, I believe, it will go up to about US Dollars 2.5 billion. With regard to innovation and diversification, Mr. Chairman, we have identified that Sri Lanka needs to diversify its economy and produce as well as export a range of new and innovative products and services. With technical input from the Harvard Universitys Centre for International Development, the teams comprising officials from the BOI, the EDB and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority have been working over the last year to improve our economic diversification targeting foreign investors and identifying new export and investment sectors. This is being directly handled by the State Minister of International Trade, Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe. We are also close to finalizing a new National Exports Strategy - NES - with a focus on competitiveness and innovation. The aim is to grow exports from the current US Dollars 10 billion or 11 billion to 20 billion over the next five years in sectors ranging from high value and high quality food and beverages to leisure boats, IT services and electronic components. The NES will be presented to Cabinet within the next two months. What was unique and valuable about this exercise is the close collaboration of the private sector. Every single section of the NES was developed through a participatory approach with over 450 industry leaders, SMEs and public sector officials being consulted. Another valuable part of this is the strong focus on actions. Actions Plans have been developed for each sector and each trade support functions. We want to make sure that the implementation begins from January itself. I am happy to announce that several proposals made through the NES process haven been included in the Budget by the Hon. Minister of Finance. We also recognize the need to create an eco-system that promotes innovative thinking and creates new products and services. We have embarked on producing a new framework for this including innovation and entrepreneurship strategy with the technical input of the World Bank and co-leadership of the private sector. This will be implemented jointly with the Ministry of the Science, Technology and Research and Ministry of

Industry and Commerce. The strategy focuses on upgrading quality and technology of export-oriented SMEs, create the conditions for start-ups to emerge and reorient and upgrade R & D institutions that matter for export growth. Mr. Chairman, with Sri Lanka gaining the respect and recognition of international community once more, we have been able to forge several Economic Cooperation Agreements with key countries. These will help improve our trade performance, attract more and better FDIs and create good job opportunities for our people. We entered into a Roadmap for further investment promotions between Japan and Sri Lanka and it is a result of the Sri Lanka-Japan Economic Cooperation Policy Dialogue following the visit of the Hon. Prime Minister to Japan in October, 2015. A joint working group has been established to take this work forward and two high-level meetings were held this year. We are embarking on a similar programme with Korea for both investment promotion as well as transfer of technology and know-how. The Economic Cooperation Agreement is due to be signed at the end of this month during the visit of His Excellency the President to Korea. During the recent visit of the Australian Prime Minister, we entered into a Cooperation Programme with Australia focused on trade and investment promotion. We have relaunched the EU-Sri Lanka Investor Dialogue in 2017 and up to now three rounds of dialogues have been held this year to resolve trade and investment related problems and grow the bilateral economic cooperation. These leverages nicely on the regaining GSP Plus in May was a great achievement of the Government and it was only possible because of the respect of the international community that the President and the Prime Minister have regained for Sri Lanka. Mr. Chairman, the people of this country have already seen the benefits of regaining GSP Plus. Apparel exports to EU in the first nine months of this year have increased US Dollars 1.67 billion. In the pre-GSP Plus period, apparels were growing at just 2 per cent, but in the few months of regaining GSP Plus, it has surged by 11.3 per cent. Fisheries exports are up by 40 per cent compared to the same period last year. The GSP Plus scheme is giving our exporters a renewed opportunity to succeed in the EU market in sectors like fresh and processed vegetables and fruits, coconut products, seafood, ceramics, footwear and of course, apparels. It is also promoting backward integration resulting in the setting up of new industries creating new employment opportunities for the youth of our country.

With regard to the year ahead, Sir, our Ministry will focus on expanding our trade and investments even further by bringing in good investors to Sri Lanka, who will create good, high-value job opportunities and help Sri Lanka plug into global value chains. We will focus very strongly on operationalizing new investment zones in Hambantota, Milleniya, Weligama, Bingiriya and so on and attracting investors into them. We will also focus strongly on implementing the National Export Strategy, which will diversify the export base to boost competitiveness among our exporters and win new consumers in new markets. Specifically, our Ministry welcomes the Budget Proposal to launch an Export Market Access Programme that will be implemented through the Export Development Board and the new IT initiative to take this imaging sector to new heights. Through strategic economic cooperation agreements with new countries, we will invite more partners to help Sri Lanka achieve its goals of prosperity and economic transformation. Through improvements in ease of doing business as well as new initiatives to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, we will create a new culture of enterprise in Sri Lanka. To that end, the proposals on Enterprise Sri Lanka announced by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media are extremely valuable and I look forward to working together to support these efforts and achieve the Vision 2025 of this Government. May I also invite, Sir, the Hon. Members of the Opposition to work together with us, leaving aside petty political differences to ensure that our young people have a great future. Thank you very much.
