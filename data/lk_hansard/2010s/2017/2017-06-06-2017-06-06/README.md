COLLAPSE OF GOLD AND SILVER CRAFTS INDUSTRY:

asked the Minister of Industry and Commerce:

(a) Will he admit that-

(i) a large number of persons are engaged in gold and silver crafts industry in Sri Lanka; (ii) this industry is collapsing due to escalation of prices of gold and silver and other reasons; and (iii) those engaged in the industry face the risk of losing their livelihoods?

(b) Will he inform this House-

(i) the number of persons engaged in the above-mentioned industry; (ii) whether the Government has acted to grant concessions enabling them to develop new industries; and (iii) if so, what those concessions are?

(c) Will he also inform this House-

(i) whether the Government will take measures to control gold and silver prices; and (ii) if so, what those measures are?

(d) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen) Hon. Speaker, the answer is as follows:

(a) (i) Yes.

(ii) No.

The gold and silver crafts industry is gaining its place as one of the main sectors in the economy of Sri Lanka and with the development in the tourism sector in particular, a favourable market is in the making for the creations of this industry.

Even though the prices of gold and silver which are the main inputs of this industry have been variable in the world market, in comparison to the past five years the current market prices show a welcome decline.

Therefore, it is obvious that the industry has actually not collapsed but shows an upward trend as a result of the decreasing tendency of the prices of gold and silver in the world

1073 1074

2017 06

market and the flourishing market opportunities that have been created with development in the tourism industry in Sri Lanka.

(iii) No.

On the premises described in (ii) above, it can be pointed out that there is no risk whatsoever of losing employment of those who are engaged in the industry and opportunities are in the offing to create more and more jobs.

(b) (i) I am unable to say because this industry does not totally come under the purview of our Ministry. However, 1308 number of persons engaged in gold and silver industry are registered with the National Crafts Council, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.

(ii) Yes.

(iii) The National Crafts Council is in the process of implementing a special programme under the Raw Material Management Programme to provide the craftsmen engaged in the silver crafts industry with required raw material, silver at a concessionary price.

The National Crafts Council has taken action in the year 2013 and 2014 to develop Neelawala village in the Kandy District where it is believed that gold and silver crafts industry had first originated at a cost of Rs. 4.0 million with a view to uplift the living standards of the craftsmen of that village and plans are underway to develop other identified crafts villages.

Creating opportunities for the craftsmen to participate in trade fairs and exhibitions organized locally and internationally in countries such as India, China, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Japan is the way to widen the market for their products. The National Crafts Council is also implementing programmes in association with the National Design Centre to promote special creations with innovative designs to be on par with the demands in the modern markets.

About 300 craftsmen engaged in goldsmithy in the Batticaloa District have benefited in the year 2016 under the Enterprise Village and Women Entrepreneurship Development programme which has been implemented since year 2014 and which provides the goldsmiths with the necessary skills, technical knowledge and machinery.

(c) (i) The Government does not control the prices

of gold and silver. (ii) Does not arise. (d) Prices in the domestic market are determined based on the world market prices. At present the Government has no intention of controlling the prices of gold and silver. ( ) (The Hon. Buddhika Pathirana) . . . . ?

" Sri Lanka is a co-sponsor of the United Nations Human Rights Councils resolution of 23 March 2017, promoting, reconciliation, accountability and Human Right in Sri Lanka - A/HRC/34/L.1.

This resolution requires that Sri Lanka implement fully the measures identified by the UNHRC in its Resolution 30/1. It further requires the office of the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights to continue assess progress on the implementation of its recommendations.

These recommendations are contained in the Report of the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Right on Sri Lanka of 10 February 2017 (A/HRC/34/20) . This Report contains criticism of the Government of Sri Lanka, as being incompetent, lacking in transparency, and hypocritical. It contains criticism of the Judiciary of Sri Lanka, as of being ethnically prejudiced. It continues to recommend the establishment of a hybrid court, including foreign judges, defense lawyers, prosecutors and investigators, despite such a court being in violation of the Constitution of this country.

It refers to Sinhalese Areas and Tamil Areas, thereby causing false ethnic divisions in this country. The Government has failed properly to place the real facts before the UN Human Rights Council. It has failed to counter the High Commissioners criticism of the Government and of the judiciary, or to counter its attempts to divide the country along communalist lines.

By co-sponsoring this Resolution, the Government has endorsed the adverse report of the High Commissioner, and has bound itself to strengthening the role of the Office of the High Commissioner and other mandate holders outside Sri Lanka. It has agreed to the establishment of an unconstitutional hybrid court which the Hon. Prime Minister has assured this House would not be established which was re-affirmed by His Excellency the President. It has failed adequately to defend the war heroes who safeguarded the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the unitary state of this country and the safety of its people by defeating the separatist terrorists.

It is resolved that the biased report of the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka of 10th February, 2017 be repudiated, and that the United Nations Human Rights Councils biased resolution of 23rd March, 2017 on Sri Lanka also be repudiated, and that positive action be taken to defend the war heroes and the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unitary state, and the Constitution of this country and the safety of its people".

Shivshankar Menon, the former Indian Foreign Minister has published a book, Choices: Inside the Making of India's Foreign Policy. In that book, so many chapters refer to terrorism in Sri Lanka - why the LTTE had to be defeated and why the LTTE had to be defeated in that manner. In a detailed report, Shivshankar Menon exposes the reason why India also supported in defeating the LTTE terrorists.

This gives a detailed description about terrorist units and how other terrorist organizations were wiped out by the LTTE to become the only deadly terrorist organization to fight for a separate State. That is why Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by the LTTE.

Now, all these facts contribute to the gravity of the issue that we are facing. .

would correct me if I am wrong - that was an unprecedented act. No nation in this world has co-sponsored a resolution against that very country. Therefore, this is unprecedented, unusual and the results are devastating. Sir, why do we call it a "treacherous act"? It has clearly undermined our sovereignty; it has clearly damaged the reputation of our war heroes and they have been labelled as criminals because of this Resolution. There were so many Resolutions and there could be many more, but this Resolution is very important to us because we have co-sponsored it.

Now, let us go through this Resolution. Sir, I draw your attention to Operative Paragraph 6 of the Resolution, which states, "Welcomes the governments recognition that accountability is essential to uphold the rule of law and build confidence in the people of all communities of Sri Lanka in the justice system,. and goes on, stating at one point, .and affirms that a credible justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for integrity and impartiality; and further affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators.

[2.44 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance and Mass Media) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, at the very beginning, let me say that the Motion moved by my good Friend, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, is fundamentally flawed, misguided in its assertions, and is clearly motivated to show division in our Motherland and aimed at returning our country to the status of a "pariah state" on the world stage that they reduced us to during their tenure in office from 2005 - 2014.

This Motion, in fact this new Motion - this is not the same Motion filed some weeks before - was filed just days after the announcement that Sri Lanka will have the honour of being the Vice President of the next Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September this year. The Hon. Member asserts that by co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution 30/1 of 1st October, 2015 and Resolution 34/1 of 23rd March, 2017, the Government of National Unity has undermined Sri Lankas sovereignty and has for all intents and purposes endorsed all the Recommendations in the latest Report of the UN Office of the Higher Commissioner for Human Rights which was released on the 10th of February this year. In fact, Sir, the Government has done no such thing. . . . By co-sponsoring these two Resolutions under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in fact, Sri Lanka reasserted its sovereignty after many years.

In fact, there is nothing in the Resolution to say that we are accepting the Recommendations in the Report by the High Commissioners Office. Please, I beg the Hon. Members to stop lying like this. Maybe the Hon. Gammanpila, of course, with his tribal mentality - I do not blame him if he does not understand the nuances of this Resolution. You all can read, you will have the ability to read every single word in that Resolution. All of you, hopefully, are literate. Just read the Report and read the Resolutions and see for yourselves whether the Recommendations are included in the Resolution. In fact, Sri Lanka had 48 countries standing up on behalf of us. On the 23rd of March this year, they stood with Sri Lanka; they stood with Sri Lankas Resolution on the 23rd and that is something we all need to be proud of, because 48 countries means one quarter of the Globe.

41 - - ; ; . . . . - [ ] . ? "The Governments constructive approach to the implementation of Resolution 30/1 shows the countys readiness to continue discussing the accumulated problems and ways to resolve them including through the international technical assistance."

In fact, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament for Kurunegala District and his band of

1093 1094

2017 06

advisers, is doing this merely for the sake of strengthening their grip on power. We remember how they dragged this country down eroding our sovereignty. In fact, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I would say that it was President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his band of advisers - who today speak of sovereignty - are the ones who compromised sovereignty by allowing the first- ever international investigation on Sri Lanka to be declared by the OHCHR through UNHRC Resolution 25/1.

The National Unity Government turned this tide back and brought all actions, all investigations, all mechanisms to the local realm. There are no more international actions. All decisions of all mechanisms, the designs, the composition and everything else will be in our hands and in our hands alone and we did this as a nation that is responsible for its own actions. We fought a war and now we will also foster peace. We will conduct our own investigations; we will heal our own people; we will create a united Sri Lanka where all can live together and prosper as equals without fear.

In fact, the group that calls itself the Joint Opposition seems to be completely disconnected and unaware of the current developments in the globalized world that we live in and the advisers who think that the world is a place where countries can shut themselves off from the rest of the world and live in isolation have come up with arguments regarding the countries which have constitutionally entrenched sovereignty. Defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country is essential to the foreign policy of any nation, I agree. However, no country in todays world can take cover strictly behind the Westphalian Concept of absolute sovereignty. The Westphalian Concept may have been good for the early 20th Century, 19th Century and 18th Century onwards but, today, it is no longer valid in the modern world. If nothing else, we must awaken to the reality that the imperatives of globalization and interdependence, connectivity and technological advancements have cast the concept of sovereignty in an entirely different light, because sovereignty, as we know, today carries with it the greater responsibility which involves duties towards ones own citizens.

. "Sovereignty" . . .

" . " . "sovereignty" . . .

When a government fails to discharge such duties, external intervention of an unwelcome nature is difficult to prevent. . .

Having successfully achieved the complex diplomatic task of preventing external intervention under the UN Security Council during the conflict in 2009, which I think was a good thing, the Government at the time, regrettably failed to pursue the path of domestic peacebuilding. By refusing to address issues of concern locally, the Government alienated the communities within the country and also alienated Sri Lankas international partners. This resulted in our nation becoming the subject of successive Resolutions in Geneva in 2009, 2012 and 2014. Resolutions . .

However, the two Resolutions which we introduced during our time put Sri Lanka and not any international body firmly incharge of all elements of our reconciliation process. 2015 . . .

[3.47 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Presiding Member, this Resolution has been moved by the Joint Opposition.

The objective of the Resolution is the attempted repudiation of the Report of the Office of the United

1109 1110

[ ]

2017 06

Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and also the Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council.

Unfortunately, I do not think such steps are within the competence of this honourable House and I might, perhaps, safely say that it is not the will of the present House. I might say very clearly that the Sri Lankan State is bound by the Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council and that it is the bounden duty of the Sri Lankan State to implement that Resolution. We should really work towards how that can be achieved without any harm being done to this country. That should be our objective.

I do not want to approach this matter in a spirit of confrontation. I want to approach it from the perspective of what would be in the best interests of the country and all its people while ensuring truth and justice.

The causes and events that led to this situation, to this Resolution being adopted, occurred during the tenure of the former Government. The present Government took over when conclusions, decisions, had been arrived at by the UN Human Rights Council. Not having been able to contain the situation despite being given every opportunity from 2012, the former Government could not have contained the situation when decisions had been arrived at in 2015 by the UN Human Rights Council.

The former Government was given every opportunity to implement its own LLRC -Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission- recommendations and conduct its own domestic investigations in 2012, 2013 and up to 2014. It was the policy of confrontation and refusal to participate that led to the Resolution adopted in 2015. This is undeniable and the former Government must accept responsibility for that situation.

This Resolution is frequently referred to as a Resolution against Sri Lanka. I do not agree with that view. It is a Resolution dealing with violations of human rights laws and humanitarian laws committed by both parties to the conflict, the State and the armed rebel group, the LTTE. It is not a Resolution against Sri Lanka. It is a Resolution pertaining to certain acts, not all acts, committed by the two parties to the conflict.

One must not forget that this whole process commenced when the then President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, gave a commitment to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, on the 26th of May 2009 when the Secretary-General visited Sri Lanka, to the effect that His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President, and the Sri Lankan Government would address the question of accountability. That was a commitment very clearly made by the then President to the Secretary-General of the UN when the Secretary-General came here. His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa undoubtedly knew what he was doing because he himself had gone to Geneva in the late 1980s - in 1988 and 1989 - to seek the intervention of the UN Human Rights body when there were grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws in the South of this

country, when Sinhala civilian youth and Sinhala people were being slaughtered in their thousands, indeed tens of thousands, at that point of time. The only difference is that what happened in 2008-2009 happened in the North.

Nobody is complaining on behalf of the armed combatants. His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa did not complain on behalf of armed combatants when he went to Geneva in 1988 and 1989. He only complained about what happened to civilians. The UN Human Rights Council is also dealing with what happened to civilians. In fact, simultaneously investigations have been conducted against the armed combatants about their own violations of human rights laws and humanitarian laws also against civilians. This culture of impunity should not continue. It should come to an end.

What happened to unarmed civilians in violation of human rights and humanitarian laws must not be confused with legitimate actions taken by the State against armed combatants carrying on an armed struggle against the State. The distinction between these two situations is clearly defined in humanitarian laws and human rights laws, and the standards of judgement pertaining to the applicability of the said two laws are clearly recognized internationally. I found my Friends, in the course of the speeches they made earlier the day, referring to war heroes. I do not think all war heroes were engaged in committing violations of international humanitarian laws and human rights laws but some of them undoubtedly committed crimes against both those laws.

Can the cases pertaining to journalist, Lasantha Wickrematunge, cartoonist, Prageeth Eknaligoda, five students murdered in Trincomalee when they were standing on the beachfront or the 17 aid workers killed in Muttur be swept under the carpet merely because the persons who are accused of those crimes are members of the armed forces; so called war heroes? If those crimes cannot be swept under the carpet merely for the reason that those acts were committed by war heroes, how can violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law which are crimes against humanity committed in 2008-2009 be swept under the carpet? This was impunity at its zenith.

Sir, no one should be allowed to confuse between the execution of legitimate duties by a government and the wanton killing of unarmed civilians in furtherance of the political agendas of persons holding high office. Unless this culture is brought to an end, it will continue and that must not be allowed. What happened in the South in 1988 - 1989 and in the North in 2008 - 2009, are crimes against humanity. No country, Sir, can continuously disregard such crimes.

As a result of its short-sighted policies and not being inclusive in exercising powers of governance and not being inclusive in sharing sovereignty that is vested in all the people of this country, our country has faced catastrophic situations. We need to retrieve ourselves

1111 1112

from this dire situation. Full and expeditious implementation of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution will be the first step in that direction. Engaging in devious tactics to delay or deny the process will - I respectfully submit - be positively harmful to the future of this country.

Thank you, Sir.

[4.02 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, we are discussing, today, the Resolution passed in the Geneva Sessions on the 24th of September, 2015, which was co-sponsored by our Government. As we know, this is the fourth Human Rights Council Resolution that was passed since the year 2012. We also have had, before this, Resolutions on the 22nd of March, 2012; then again, on the 21st of March, 2013 and on the 27th of March, 2014. You would notice that all these Resolutions bear the same title "Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka".

Significantly, if you take the individual elements of the Resolution, you would note that the exhortation of the Council has been on reconciliation and accountability. In fact, the fact that we co-sponsored the Resolution in 2015, represents our voluntary commitment not only to the international community, but also to our people of our determination to confront the past, end any kind of impunity, achieve reconciliation and rebuild an inclusive society in which rule of law and democracy flourishes with no discrimination on the grounds of parochial and sectarian distinctions. Non-inclusive institutions, Sir, will only take us back to the corrosive decades of impunity which we so earnestly seek to prevent.

Sir, one year and nine months have passed since the adoption of the Resolution 30/1. It is timely to take stock of our progress in implementing our commitments to identify challenges and constraints and to think up strategies for moving forward. We should solicit the continued support of the international community through the Human Rights Council to march forward on our onward journey.

The Council has certainly set the stage for us when the international community came together in 2015 to co-sponsor a Resolution which requires reciprocity on our part.

We all recall that not a long time ago when the internecine war ended in 2009, upon the conclusion of the visit of the UN Secretary-General, we pledged in a joint communique - this was a joint communique issued by the then President and the then UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. - that there would be some kind of an accountability mechanism. All these four Resolutions that were passed in Geneva have pivoted their pith and substance on the mechanism that was hinted in that communique.

Sir, long before the last Resolution was passed in September 2015, we recall the mechanisms we proceeded to establish: one - the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission; two - the Maxwell Paranagama Commission that sat right throughout the length and breadth of the country and its recommendations on missing persons. In addition to that, our voluntary pledge at the Universal Periodic Review to craft a National Action Plan on Promotion and Protection of Human Rights resulted in a number of consultations with several stakeholders which finally led to an Action Plan being presented in Geneva. We need to bear in mind that the Action Plan for 2017 to 2021 needs to be worked out while we proceed to overhaul human rights in an expanded chapter in the proposed new Constitution.

I cannot but resist the observation that from a human rights perspective, the constitutional reform process presents us an important opportunity to rectify structural deficiencies and establish a more comprehensive Bill of Rights, stronger institutional checks and balances, enhanced constitutional review, improved guarantees for the independence of the judiciary and accountability of our international human rights obligations. These are all parts we need to include in our new Constitution which we seek to enact very soon.

As for our treaty obligations, our obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture have already been considered in the Human Rights Council; our obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women are being considered. We also need to very carefully study the concluding observations issued by the respective committees at the end of these sessions and it bears recalling that non-implementation of the observations of these committees cumulatively add up to our woes at the international forum.

We would bear in mind that it is not only the Human Rights Council that watches over us, but also treaty bodies like the Human Rights Committee, the Committee Against Torture and the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. We need to come together in a spirit of togetherness to rectify this sorry state of affairs and mould it, so that we will be able to be responsible and accountable international citizens and we will redeem the lost image of this country in the international stage when it comes to matters of Human Rights.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Sir. I must also refer to just one more point regarding the issue of some xenophobic forces which had taken root, particularly after the victory of the war, and this country has once again plunged into a hate culture. A culture of hate speech seems to have engulfed this nation and we seem to be once again pussyfooting in dealing with the offenders when it comes to hate speech. Today, I see the Virakesari newspaper headlines talking about three organizations warning the Government not to take offenders into custody. They have gone to that extent of trying to protect people engaging in hate speech.

If you would observe, Hon. Presiding Member, the issue relating to religious intolerance was introduced quite late - after 2012, after the incidents of religious hatred began to spread all over the country. In one year alone, there were almost 313 incidents; that was in the year 2013 - 2014. Therefore, the proposed Resolution had to include issues relating to religious intolerance and once again we are faced with the same issues coming back to haunt us.

Yesterday, a shop belonging to a Muslim in Wijerama Junction had been set on fire. Funnily enough, I am told that some lame excuses are being given, saying that the owner of the shop had tended to set fire to his shop in order to claim insurance, whereas the footage from the closed-circuit television cameras that have been fixed in a close by shop shows a person coming on a pushbike getting off, going and setting fire and running away from the place. There had been some eyewitnesses who have seen the incident. With all that, law enforcement authorities are still unable to bring culprits to the book. Almost 16 incidents have taken place since 15th of April and all of us, Ministers and Members in the Government, have made pleas to the law enforcement authorities and the police, but all that have fallen on deaf ears. Therefore, it is important that the Government implements the law to the letter.

Thank you. [.. 4.14]

[4.48 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for this opportunity to speak at this Adjournment Debate.

As I sat listening to speeches on both sides of the House, I thought the Debate was reaching heights of absurdity and hypocrisy. There has been a murder in broad daylight. Some people have informed the police of this murder. But the issue seems to be: Who informed the police? Why did you inform the police? That is what is being debated in this House today, not that there has been a murder. "Why did you go and tell the police?" One is pointing the finger at the other. "You are the one who told the police." And from the other side another one

is pointing the finger at this side and saying, "No! No! You are the one who told the police." That is the sad state

of affairs that this country has come to. No one is worried about the fact that there has been a murder.

That is the gist of the Debate between the so-called Joint Opposition and the Government today. The Government is bending backwards trying to say, "We are not going to allow anybody to be punished." The Joint Opposition says, "You are trying to punish." Nobody is talking about the crime. No one is talking about the victims. No one is talking about what is right and what is wrong. Both are competing with each other, trying to excel each other in claiming that they are better at covering up. One says, "We covered up well. You have now revealed it." And the Government says, "No! No! You are the one who exposed it. Now we are covering up." Shameless conduct both by the movers of the Resolution and those who are replying on behalf of the Government! Why cannot you face reality? Why can you not be truthful? Why can you not act with honour and tell the people of this country the reality. Why do you have to beat around the bush? That is why I call it hypocrisy.

There were references made to 1988/89 period, a comparison between that and 2008/09 period. Why do we even have to go there? Is not a wrong a wrong to whoever it happens? Have we descended to a point when the Representatives of the Tamil people have to ask the question If it happens to Sinhala youth, you will do and if it happens to Tamil youth, you will not? Do we even have to raise that as a question in this House?

Hon. Minister Rauff Hakeem praised the virtues of this UN Resolution but it was he, in 2012, who went to Geneva and campaigned against the first Resolution. And as I say so Hon. Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe smiles. He led the delegation fighting hard against these Resolutions, but failed, failed miserably, to prevent those Resolutions. Why? Because you were wrong; because you allowed these things to happen; you did not take responsibility and act as a responsible Government and when you were asked, you gave assurances.

I am glad that the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa read in Sinhala that undertaking, the Joint Communique that was signed by the then President Rajapaksa in Kandy in May, 2009 with the Secretary-General of the UN when the Government said, "We will inquire into those when we appoint the LLRC."

The first two Resolutions in 2012 and 2013, as the Hon. Minister knows very well, only asked the Sri Lankan Government to hold internal investigations. That was all it asked, according to the undertaking given in that Joint Communique. And it asked the Sri Lankan Government to implement the recommendations of its own Commission - the LLRC. We did not have faith in that Commission, but even that Commission made constructive recommendations. Even that was not implemented. Then, what did the international community do? They did not interfere; they did not say,

1129 1130

[ ]

2017 06

You must do what we tell you to do. They only said, Do what you have said you will do." "Do what your own Commission has recommended that you must do. But if you fail in that, certainly there will be repercussions." Those who scream about international interventions must know that it was during that time that Dr. Palitha Kohona was appointed head of an investigative team by the UN to look into a bombing of an aid flotilla against Israel. We participated in investigations against other sovereign countries as a responsible member of the United Nations. We are members of the United Nations and we are proud of it. Why are we members of the United Nations if we cannot abide by the basic Charter of the United Nations? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. What is good for Israel is good for us. So, it is that, that will remain on the international agenda until it is accomplished.

I am glad, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs - the present Minister of Finance and Mass Media - very clearly set that out, about sovereignty; about what sovereignty means today. Sovereignty is not something that is given to a ruler of a country to do as he pleases with his subjects. We are no longer subjects; we are citizenry. We are citizens in whom sovereignty rests. Sovereignty is no longer with the rulers. It is with the people and that is why if the people are mistreated, you cannot take cover behind sovereignty. That is a false cover. That will never protect you and that is why questions can be asked and are being asked. That is why this Government took the proper step of co-sponsoring HRC 30/1 and HRC 34/1 Resolutions, because that is the only proper course available. But our complaint is against this Government as well. You co-sponsor a Resolution and you drag your feet implementing it. You have all kinds of excuses not to implement it. You do not say you will not implement it, but you will not do it either. Even in taking action, there is blatant discrimination. We commend you for taking action in the case of Prageeth Eknaligoda; in the case of Lasantha Wickramatunga, but there was a course of Tamil journalists who were killed. Why has the Government not moved one finger in respect of one of those assassinations? Why? Are Tamil journalists any less citizens of this country than Sinhala journalists? Is that your view? You do not have to answer that. It is blatantly obvious what your view is, when you do not do what you are supposed to do; when you do not do the right thing for certain sections of the community, but rush to do other things. Until you change your course, we will have international spotlight on Sri Lanka and - I do not want to beat around the bush - we will ensure that, but that is not what we desire. We do not do that with glee, we do that with a heavy heart. We would like to say that we are equal citizens in this country, that our people are protected by the State as much as any other people in this country are protected. That is what we want. Then only we can be proud. But you are not allowing us to be proud citizens of this country.

So, my urge to the Government, at this time, is that you did the course correction; you turned towards the right direction; you did the right thing by co-sponsoring those two Resolutions, but please do not drag your feet any longer. Be brave and do what is right and nothing will go wrong. Do not be afraid to do the right thing. The previous regime was not afraid to do the wrong thing, but you are afraid to do the right thing, perhaps the presence of many who were in the previous Government being in the present Government too may be a cause for that. But, you cannot be dictated to by those forces. You have come with a fresh mandate; you have come with a very clear directive from all the people of this country and that is what you are expected to do. There were simple things that could have been addressed long ago that afflict our people and this Government is dragging its feet.

The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen was heard to complain bitterly about what is happening now and I have sympathy for what he said. A certain person has informed the Court of Appeal that he is in hospital and the IGP says that he has four units of police looking for him. Can there be any worse joke than that? That person informs court that he is in hospital and the Inspector General of Police with four units of searching policemen cannot find him. Why is that? At the same time, I would also like to say to the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen when he complained about resettlement of protracted Muslim IDPs, we are all for all of those who were removed from the Northern Province coming back. We have said that time and again. Not just the Muslims but the Sinhalese, the Tamils, all must be resettled from where they were moved. If there are protracted IDPs and their issues have not been addressed, all of those issues must be addressed. Protracted IDPs cannot be only Sinhalese and Muslims.

It is a sad fact that a definition was sought to be introduced to the word Protracted IDPs. A Cabinet subcommittee has been appointed and the definition was "Sinhala and Muslims IDPs". How can that be? When that was objected to, the definition has now been suggested "that those who were ousted prior to December 31st, 1990" - that is all right - "by the LTTE". Why only by the LTTE? What about the others? An IDP is an IDP. If he is a protracted IDP, then fix a date. But it cannot be only those who were ousted by a particular movement. A particular movement should not come under that definition.

So, as much as we support the call of the Muslim people, indeed the Sinhala people and the Tamil people to be resettled in their original places, we say that also must be done without discrimination. We stand for a country that is not divided, a country in which all the peoples will be proud of their equal status to live without discrimination or fear, but, until we reach that, you cannot oust the concern of the world on this country.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Minister, may I interrupt you? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes, certainly. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) All these countries including America supported you when you prosecuted the war against the LTTE. You cannot deny that. You made commitments to those countries in regard to what will happen in this country politically once the war came to an end; which commitments you did not keep and that was the primary reason why the international community decided that something needed to be done. It was you who got their support to prosecute the war and defeat the LTTE, but you did not keep to the commitments that you made to the world when you got that support. You cannot deny that.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Well, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, that is exactly what I was saying. I was saying that we did not deliver on what we undertook to implement in 2009 and our foreign policy was implemented in a way that we sent wrong signals. Obviously, we were put in a lot where we did not belong to, and to make matters worse, the President, at that time, went and quoted the likes of

1135 1136

Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein which made matters worse. We sent a signal to all these countries who helped us-

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) With the way you dealt with the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact, with the way you dealt with the Dudley Senanayake -Chelvanayakam Pact, you have become so accustomed to making commitments and not implementing them and you thought that you would repeat those practices with the international community. That is why you have gone wrong and now, the question is whether you implement the present Resolution.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) The Hon. Leader of the Opposition, your main point is taken and I have replied that. Let me continue with my speech. Thank you very much.

[6.22 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, in summing up the Debate on the Adjournment Motion today, I would like to speak on the outcome of the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka on 23rd March, this year. It demonstrates that the international community has come to recognize Sri Lankas march towards peace and progress in the last two-and-a-half

years, as a point of departure from the isolationist trap it was caught in for a decade.

Sir, further, it is vital to note that the consideration of Sri Lankas situation by Human Rights Commissions. It took place under the conditions of the effective outreach and improvement of bilateral relations by Sri Lanka with all its partners, particularly, North America, Europe and other countries and restoration of balance in Sri Lankas foreign policy.

Moreover, with the international realization that recurring conflict are increasing in the world today, Sri Lanka represents a bright spot and promising future due to its geographically strategic position.

The Human Rights Council included that the outcome of the Geneva process is a win-win situation for both people and the Government of Sri Lanka as well as the international community.

The Government of Sri Lanka led by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs and the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance and Mass Media and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, deserves our deepest appreciation for this very positive turn-around in Sri Lankas image and international profile.

The Government of Sri Lanka has been given two years, of which three months have already elapsed, to continue the positive trajectory it has maintained in peace and progress, building further on the momentum gained in our national efforts to achieve genuine, meaningful reconciliation combined with effective realization by all of Right to Justice including access to it.

Sir, it is obvious that there are unnecessary polemics over the nature and dynamics of the judicial mechanism, the establishment of which is referred to in Resolution 30/1, adopted by Human Rights Council in October, 2015. There is still a question as to whether there should be a judicial mechanism in the first place. These have to be reflected upon seriously.

Right to justice and access to justice remain the basic pillars of the concept of Rule of Law. These are fundamental features of modern, forward-looking society built on egalitarian ideals, fundamental freedoms and good governance of democracy. We must ensure the effective exercise and enjoyment of these rights in Sri Lanka through instituting necessary policy and legal frameworks, which are long anticipated for decades.

Any absence of entrenched legal provisions for the effective realization of the right to justice and access to justice applicable at all times - that is, one of universal applications transcending all ethnic, religious, cultural, linguistic and gender-based divides in Sri Lanka, - would

only be suggesting a threatening prospect for Sri Lanka, even though the country may fare better in other areas in the short-term to medium-term. Whether it is political stability or the economic stability, it cannot be efficaciously sustained and promoted anywhere in the world - let alone Sri Lanka - if accessible, qualitative and efficient justice is not ensured, if justice is distorted or if it is denied to a segment of the society however small it is.

While some are interested in a debate over a judicial mechanism, its type, composition, functions, et cetera, it is important to stress that at the heart of the question of effectiveness of justice, which is pivotal to genuine meaningful reconciliation and peace building, remains with accessibility, timeliness and universality and underpinned by independence. All that combines together to give justice, both pursuit and delivery of it as well as its process, the credibility it requires.

Sir, in my view, the Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1 and the one that was adopted in March this year are all about credibility of justice and judicial mechanisms and processes in Sri Lanka. Credibility is a key to good governance, rule of law and peace building and above all, it is a key to build public confidence.

Finally, let me emphasize that there is a major issue of independence and credibility. It also provides all of us - the people of Sri Lanka and indeed official and unofficial bars, law enforcement agencies, especially the police and importantly for Sri Lankas judiciary itself - an opportunity to work cooperatively. If law enforcement agencies cooperate, if judiciary continues upholding independence, integrity and non-partnership ensuring effective delivery without delay or bias, that would take Sri Lanka to a different plateau of national and international respectability.

Regretfully, the ongoing incidents of violence and hatred against minorities in particular are a clear case in point in this regard. There is no point in making a sweeping generalization of such incidents stating as violence of extremists without naming individuals and groups. Such broad categorization only gives confidence to miscreants and nefarious activists that they are neither specifically targeted nor they are above the law. That would only place the outlook of the Government in doubt when the expectation of the people from good governance is not upheld.

Finally, the country cannot afford such an approach at this critical time. Perpetrators, irrespective of their political, religious or social designation, have to be held accountable for and dealt with. The credibility of good governance should be entrenched in practising rule of law, peace building and most importantly to build public confidence which will enhance and project a positive profile internationally.

Thank you.
