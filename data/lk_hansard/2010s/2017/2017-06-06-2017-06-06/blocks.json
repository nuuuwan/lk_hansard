You all can read, you will have the ability to read every single word in that Resolution. All of you, hopefully, are literate. Just read the Report and read the Resolutions and see for yourselves whether the Recommendations are included in the Resolution. In fact, Sri Lanka had 48 countries standing up on behalf of us.

    "text": "In fact, the group that calls itself the Joint Opposition seems to be completely disconnected and unaware of the current developments in the globalized world that we live in and the advisers who think that the world is a place where countries can shut themselves off from the rest of the world and live in isolation have come up with arguments regarding the countries which have constitutionally entrenched sovereignty. Defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country is essential to the foreign policy of any nation, I agree. However, no country in todays world can take cover strictly behind the Westphalian Concept of absolute sovereignty. The Westphalian Concept may have been good for the early 20th Century, 19th Century and 18th Century onwards but, today, it is no longer valid in the modern world. If nothing else, we must awaken to the reality that the imperatives of globalization and interdependence, connectivity and technological advancements have cast the concept of sovereignty in an entirely different light, because sovereignty, as we know, today carries with it the greater responsibility which involves duties towards ones own citizens.",

There had been some eyewitnesses who have seen the incident. With all that, law enforcement authorities are still unable to bring culprits to the book. Almost 16 incidents have taken place since 15th of April and all of us, Ministers and Members in the Government, have made pleas to the law enforcement authorities and the police, but all that have fallen on deaf ears.

No one is talking about the victims. No one is talking about what is right and what is wrong. Both are competing with each other, trying to excel each other in claiming that they are better at covering up. One says, \"We covered up well. You have now revealed it.\" And the Government says, \"No! No! You are the one who exposed it. Now we are covering up.\" Shameless conduct both by the movers of the Resolution and those who are replying on behalf of the Government! Why cannot you face reality? Why can you not be truthful? Why can you not act with honour and tell the people of this country the reality. Why do you have to beat around the bush? That is why I call it hypocrisy.",

Sovereignty is not something that is given to a ruler of a country to do as he pleases with his subjects. We are no longer subjects; we are citizenry. We are citizens in whom sovereignty rests. Sovereignty is no longer with the rulers. It is with the people and that is why if the people are mistreated, you cannot take cover behind sovereignty. That is a false cover. That will never protect you and that is why questions can be asked and are being asked. That is why this Government took the proper step of co-sponsoring HRC 30/1 and HRC 34/1 Resolutions, because that is the only proper course available. But our complaint is against this Government as well. You co-sponsor a Resolution and you drag your feet implementing it. You have all kinds of excuses not to implement it. You do not say you will not implement it, but you will not do it either. Even in taking action, there is blatant discrimination. We commend you for taking action in the case of Prageeth Eknaligoda; in the case of Lasantha Wickramatunga, but there was a course of Tamil journalists who were killed. Why has the Government not moved one finger in respect of one of those assassinations? Why? Are Tamil journalists any less citizens of this country than Sinhala journalists? Is that your view? You do not have to answer that. It is blatantly obvious what your view is, when you do not do what you are supposed to do; when you do not do the right thing for certain sections of the community, but rush to do other things. Until you change your course, we will have international spotlight on Sri Lanka and - I do not want to beat around the bush - we will ensure that, but that is not what we desire. We do not do that with glee, we do that with a heavy heart. We would like to say that we are equal citizens in this country, that our people are protected by the State as much as any other people in this country are protected. That is what we want. Then only we can be proud. But you are not allowing us to be proud citizens of this country.",

The previous regime was not afraid to do the wrong thing, but you are afraid to do the right thing, perhaps the presence of many who were in the previous Government being in the present Government too may be a cause for that. But, you cannot be dictated to by those forces. You have come with a fresh mandate; you have come with a very clear directive from all the people of this country and that is what you are expected to do.

It also provides all of us - the people of Sri Lanka and indeed official and unofficial bars, law enforcement agencies, especially the police and importantly for Sri Lankas judiciary itself - an opportunity to work cooperatively. If law enforcement agencies cooperate, if judiciary continues upholding independence, integrity and non-partnership ensuring effective delivery without delay or bias, that would take Sri Lanka to a different plateau of national and international respectability.",

There is no point in making a sweeping generalization of such incidents stating as violence of extremists without naming individuals and groups.

That would only place the outlook of the Government in doubt when the expectation of the people from good governance is not upheld.",
