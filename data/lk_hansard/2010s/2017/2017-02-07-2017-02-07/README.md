() , ? asked the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs:

(a) Will he inform this House-

(i) the date on which the Poonthottam camp in Vavuniya in which war-displaced persons are housed was opened;

(ii) whether that camp is still being maintained;

(iii) if so, the number of persons residing in that camp at present;

(iv) whether toilet, water and electricity facilities have been provided to it;

(v) whether a proposal for the settlement of these displaced persons permanently in another location has been put forward;

(vi) if so, what it is; and

(vii) since these people are living in that area preserving Sinhala-Tamil harmony while becoming familiar with the lifestyle of Vavuniya for many years, the reason for the inability to construct a housing complex and settle them in the same location ?

(b) If not, why?

.. ( ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Hon. Speaker, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) People who were displaced due to conflict

occurrences during the period after the year 1995 arrived in the Vavuniya District from the Jaffna Peninsula and the Vanni. This camp was established within that period.

(ii) No.

As per the instructions of the Special Task Force for Resettlement in the Northern Province, all administration structures were withdrawn after the year 2011 and provision of dry rations to those people was also discontinued. Therefore, no welfare camp is maintained by the Government.

(iii) When this welfare centre was established,

1,249 families consisting of 4,495 persons resided in that camp and it was fully maintained through Government expenditure. This welfare camp was maintained under the District Secretary of Vavuniya. The number of people in that camp was largely reduced by combining them with various resettlement projects with their consent. After the conclusion of the war in 2009, a large number of people turned back to their own districts through the resettlement activities. However, at present, 97 families consisting of 354 persons who did not give their consent to include themselves in any resettlement scheme are living within the area where that camp was established.

(iv) The wells constructed by the people who

lived in the lands before establishing the welfare centre and the lavatories and wells constructed within the period the welfare centre was in operation are used and maintained by those people.

(v) Yes.

(vi) The Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs has taken action to resettle these people by launching a housing scheme with infrastructure facilities in Sinnadamban Village with an extent of 70 acres and in Parasankulam Village with an extent of 30 acres in the Divisional Secretary's Division of Vavuniya North.

(vii) A lot of displaced people who were affected

by the conflict did not want to continue living in welfare centres because of their personal benefits. Except for 97 families out of the 1,249 families, the others have settled down in their places of origin or in the alternative lands given by the Government and returned to their normal life. The remaining families which did not give their consent to include themselves in any resettlement programme should be brought under a resettlement programme and provided with a land with a house in order to run their life. The welfare camp where they are presently living is 21 acres in extent. Out of that, fifteen and-a-half acres are private land and the balance is State land. In the State land, there are allocated plots for constructing government departments under the Urban Development Plan. Further, the College of Education is also there close to the welfare centre. Therefore, it is not possible to construct houses and do the resettlement of these people in the same place. Hence, houses are being constructed by the Gnanam Foundation as a grant to these people at Sinnadamban and Parasankulam with

729 730

the approval of the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs. Under this resettlement programme, an extent of half an acre which can be used for agricultural purposes and also a house will be provided for one family.

Total number of houses

- Sinnadamban 66

- Parasankulam 31

97

Further, the following infrastructure facilities are provided by the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs.

Supply of purified drinking water - Rs. 7.84 million

Electricity (Solar-powered street lamps) - Rs. 5.1 million

Streets - Rs. 3.5 million

In addition, the Gnanam Foundation has given assurance to provide livelihood assistance to these people.

(b) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) . . 2011 . . . . - - . 2011 ? . .. . . . . . .. ; ; . . . . ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Speaker, I think I made this very clear to the Hon. Member. Originally, there were 1,249 families consisting of 4,495 people. All those people have left the camp and, as I mentioned earlier, only 97 families are still there. So, these 97 families have to be resettled because certain plots of land you are talking about have been taken over by the Urban Development Authority and they are building some government departments there. We have provided land to them.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .. . .

( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) . .. . . . . . . . .. . .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, can you look into that? Of course, Hon. Minister, you did say that some other government offices are coming up there.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Speaker, the fact remains that there is no objection by those families to go and stay in another place. Practically, resettling them in that land cannot be done. As I said earlier, certain plots of that land have now been taken over by the UDA for purposes of constructing certain government departments and providing certain facilities. So, we are unable to give them the same land. Up to now, they have not objected to moving to another place; they are willing to go to another place. So, for them, we have provided houses and all the other infrastructure facilities, and the cost maybe borne by the Ministry. If we do not do that also, we will be criticized. When we do that also, we are being criticized.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) We will consider that, but as I told you earlier, Hon. Member, none of these families have objected to leaving their place of residence and going to another place. That is my argument.

( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) They have objected. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) If they are prepared to go to another place and stay there, that is all.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) So, you can look into that. If anybody has objected, you are prepared to look into that. Is it?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) .

[6.43p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

It is with the formation of the new Government, after the Presidential Election held on the 08th of January, foreigners started coming into this country with more and more investments, because they realized the country was peaceful. Earlier we had only one or two countries supporting us, but after the formation of the new Government under His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, almost 90 per cent of the countries in the world started helping us. That is why His Excellency the President was invited to the G7 Summit in Japan and the Hon. Prime Minister is going round the world getting confidence of all the countries because we are now living in peace.

But, very unfortunately, Sir, to disturb this progress, the Opposition parties have started this rotten striking everywhere inconveniencing the public and it is going beyond the limit now. When foreigners see these things, they will feel that peace is no longer here. Though it is difficult, we have to take a decision on this matter. Sir, when all the medical students and the university students strike, we can imagine that there is a force behind this. In fact, one of the Secretaries told me how strikes create problems. When students are facing difficulties their poor parents also start facing difficulties. The more they strike, the more the time they spend in the universities before leaving as doctors or whoever it is.

Another problem is, when they strike in factories or wherever they work, it is only a small section of the workers who strike and the majority do not want to strike. But, what happens is, that majority is also unable to do their work. If you go to a foreign country you will see that people are working nine to ten hours a day, not five or six hours like in our country. That is how those countries are developing; their work output is more and it is almost double. His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister are also trying to create that type of a situation here. Our country is not a poor country. I always maintain that idea. It is a small country. But, we need to try and come up. The Hon. Prime Minister has a far-reaching vision. All these things are happening to disturb and to create problems.

Hon. Minister, you are a capable Minister. I think there must be some control on this. As the Hon. S.M. Marikkar said, if they want to strike, there should be one or two places designated for that. I know, in London, they have the Hyde Park where people can shout or do anything. Similarly we also must ensure that others are not disturbed by these strike actions and protests. If others want to do their work, let them do it.

Last week, I was trying to get back to Puttalam from here. Four roads were blocked. Just imagine my plight. It took two-and-a-half hours for me to go to Peliyagoda

from Kirulapona. This is the situation. Just imagine the problems created to the ordinary public. Whom do they blackguard finally? " ; ; " . These are the words they use. Hon. Minister, my request is that there must be some decision taken in this regard. We cannot stop them from striking. They have their rights; but they should not disturb the daily activities of this country. They should not disturb the rights of other people. So, some sort of coordination has to be there to ensure that this does not happen again. If we continue like this, I am sure the future will be bleak.

Thank you very much. [.. 6.47] ( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr) Nalinda Jayathissa) 1 78 .. . . . . . . . . . . . . 2015 ? . " ".
