QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I

..

ACTION TAKEN TO REFUTE STATEMENT MADE BY UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AGAINST SRI

LANKA

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , 03(0) , .

I seek answers to my Question from the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. I hope he would give an answer but let me read the Question first.

223 224

[ ]

2017 01

This is my first question. Is the Foreign Minister aware of the statement by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussein, last week?

I would like to quote an article appeared in The Island of 13th September, 2017, captioned, War crimes: Exercise universal jurisdiction on Sri Lanka - UNHRC."

I will not read the whole thing. He says, I quote:

I urge the Government to swiftly operationalize the office of the Missing Persons and to move faster on other essential confidence building measures; such as release of land occupied by the military, and resolving long-pending cases registered under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. I repeat my request for that Act to be replaced with a new law, in line with international human rights standards.

In the North, protests by victims indicate their growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms. I encourage the Government to act on its commitment in Resolution 30/1 to establish transitional justice mechanisms, and to establish a clear timeline and bench marks for the implementation of these and other commitments.

This should not be viewed by the Government as a box-ticking exercise to placate the Council. But as an essential undertaking to address the rights of all its people. The absence of credible action in Sri Lanka to ensure accountability for alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law makes the exercise of universal jurisdiction even more necessary.

Now this is the crux of the issue. This is a statement by the High Commissioner for Human Rights to take the issue to another arena of jurisdiction.

My second question is this. The President, Prime Minister and the Government of Sri Lanka have stated that all issues internationally adverse to Sri Lanka have been overcome. However, the above statement made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussain yet again is a direct interference in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka, which is a Sovereign State. This statement has been made under false and wrong assumptions.

Will the Hon. Minister state to Parliament what actions the Government would take to refute the statement against Sri Lanka?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Will the Hon. Minister reply today? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana -Minister of Development Assignments and Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, I require about three weeks' time to answer this Question.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This is a serious issue.

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Yes, serious questions require serious answers. So, I must prepare the - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This is a very serious situation where the Human Rights Commission is trying to intimidate our Sovereign State.

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) I know. As it is serious, I need about three weeks' time to get it ready.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, try to give the answer as early as possible because there is a seriousness in that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , 03(0) . For a question of national importance, you cannot take three weeks' time to answer. Otherwise, I could have asked it under Oral Questions. This is a very serious situation. This is not about floods or transfer of an individual. This is a threat to our country. I am asking the question from the Hon. Foreign Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) , . There is not going to be an attack or anything like that just because I ask for three weeks' time.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . . .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Anyway Hon. Minister, please try to expedite the reply.

( ) (An Hon. Member) I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Therefore, Sir, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena should be the happiest that I am bringing this Amendment, whereby we are giving effect to the salient features proposed to be brought about by his Report. - [Interruption.]

Also, I would like to bring to your notice the pledge made by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena in his Election Manifesto: "It will guarantee the abolition of the preferential vote system and ensure that every electorate will have a Member of Parliament of its own. The new electoral system will be a combination of the First-Past-the-Post system and the Proportional Representation System of defeated candidates". This country wanted a change, a change from the PR System and the preferential vote.- [Interruption.]

As you know, Sir, the public at large has continuously agitated that they want a change in the electoral system and today, it has come about thanks to His Excellency the President and the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. So, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena should be the happiest that we are bringing about this change.

As regards to women's representation in this country, there has been continuous agitation that unless you come

from a background where you have a political lineage, you do not have the opportunity to get into Parliament. - [Interruption.] Therefore, His Excellency the President thought it just to introduce a system whereby women could enter all organs of government. With regard to the Local Government Elections, we brought in a mechanism where 25 per cent of the Members will be women. With regard to the Provincial Councils also, there is a great need that women participate more. We have a 52 per cent female population in this country. However, there is less than 5 per cent of women in elected bodies. Therefore, this paradigm shift would give women an opportunity to participate more in those bodies. - [Interruption.]

Also, in this country, money plays a pivotal role in elections and we could not get community leaders into Parliament, the Provincial Councils and to Local Government bodies. This paradigm shift has given an opportunity for everybody to come into Parliament. - [Interruption.]

Especially, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena should be the happiest here because we are doing exactly what his Report demanded. And also there has been continuous agitation by the masses that we should change the electoral system. Therefore, we are trying to reach a consensus. Some of the Hon. Members who are opposing this Bill, supported the Ward System with regard to the Local Government Elections when the Local Government Elections Act, No. 22 of 2012 was passed. - [Interruption.] We are trying to introduce a similar system for Provincial Councils, to have a member answerable to his electorate, and also to enhance women participation.

Therefore, Hon. Speaker, I do not see any reason as to why these Members are agitating today. They have no basis. With regard to the allegations that I am trying to bring in Amendments at the Committee Stage, Sir, this Bill deals with Provincial Councils election system and thereby I am entitled, in terms of the Standing Orders, to bring in whatever Amendments during the Committee Stage. Therefore, I respectfully urge all the Hon. Members of this House to support this Bill where the voter gives priority to the person, not to money, and do away with this preferential voting system, which is detrimental to the masses. -[Interruption.]

Finally, Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity and I will answer all queries made by the Hon. Members at the end of the Debate.

[10.53 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We will meet at 12.00.-[Interruption.] You go ahead, Hon. Member.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is an important Bill that introduces a proportion, 30 per cent of women candidates have to be nominated in the nomination paper that is submitted by any political party or by an independent group when they contest the Provincial Council Election. This is a very important issue that we have been talking about. When a Bill is debated in the House, any Member under Standing Orders can move Amendments at the Committee Stage, provided notice is given before 12 noon. In fact, it is not necessary for the Government to do it. I can also move Amendments. Any Member has the right to move Amendments at the Committee Stage, provided notice of those Amendments are given before 12 noon. That is not a matter that can reasonably be taken up before an Oversight Committee.

Nevertheless, we are now discussing an important principle of women's representation and this Bill is very progressive. In that, it suggests not less than 30 per cent for women in the nomination papers. Although you nominate more than 30 per cent on the nomination paper, their representation is not ensured, because it is the way people vote. So 30 per cent on the nomination paper can never ensure even 10 per cent of representation by women. Therefore, I am glad that there is, before the House, notice by the Government of a Committee Stage Amendment which will ensure that at least 25 per cent of women will actually sit in the Provincial Council when that Provincial Council is constituted. The scheme has been developed. As we all know, for the Local Authorities Election Act there are two lists-[Interruption.]

[ .]

[At this stage, some Members of the Opposition walked into the Well of the House and created an uproar.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, you may go ahead. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I was saying that we passed into law an Amendment to the Local Authorities Elections Act just two weeks ago in which there was a scheme that was brought in whereby 10 per cent of womens names are nominated on the list for Wards, and not less than 50 per cent of names of women are nominated on the Proportional Representation list, which will then ensure that at least 25 per cent of women can actually sit in the Council that is constituted. -[Interruption.] I am glad that in the Committee Stage Amendment that is being proposed there is not just a nomination of 30 per cent, but a scheme that will ensure actual representation of women of 25 per cent which is a very progressive move.-[Interruption.]

I want to congratulate the Government for introducing this Amendment which goes beyond and ensures the objective of this Bill to ensure womens representation. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Members of Parliament who are disturbing my speech are obviously against women representation. -[Interruption.] So, this is against more than 50 per cent of the population of this country - more than 51 per cent of the voter population of this country is women. When the Government is bringing in an Amendment that nominates 30 per cent women - [Interruption.] But now, a Committee Stage Amendment will ensure that at least 25 per cent, that is only less than half of the actual voter population, be ensured that they are elected and represented in the Provincial Councils. This is a very progressive move and we must laud the Government for doing that.

In this Committee Stage Amendment, we also find that a consensus that has been reached by all political parties to introduce an electoral system called Mixed Member Proportion, whereby 60 per cent of the Members who are elected are elected from electorates and are able to be held accountable by their local electorates, and then to ensure proper representative democracy, a compensatory PR or 40 per cent, is brought in. So, the Committee Stage Amendment that has been placed before us confirms the number that has already been determined as the number of Members for each Provincial Council. That determination was made as soon as the Provincial Councils were established by the Provincial Councils Elections Act. -[Interruption.]

247 248

2017 01

His Excellency the President, at that time, made the Order with regard to the number of Members of each Provincial Council. Now, this Amendment seeks to take that number and find the 60 per cent and for 60 per cent of that number, the number of electorates are carved out. -[Interruption.] So that is an election promise that was made by His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena who won the Election, and all of those who lost the Election on the 8th of January are standing in the Well of the House preventing the mandate of the people being reached. -[Interruption.] That is a promise that was given - one of the first promises that was given - by the victor at the January 8th Election that he will change the electoral system, so that there will be representatives who are held accountable to constituencies. This is the introduction. In fact, just two weeks ago, an identical Committee Stage Amendment was moved and passed for the Local Authorities Elections Act, and a vote was taken. -[Interruption.] Wards have already been demarcated for Local Authorities. -[Interruption.]

But for the Provincial Councils certainly - [Interruption.] Hon. C.B. Rathnayake is using unparliamentary language and hiding his face away from me. Why is he doing that? If he wants to speak to me directly, he can speak to me. Hon. C.B. Rathnayake is using filth in the Well of Parliament and now he turns his face away.

Sir, I was saying that this is an Amendment that has been accepted by everyone as a scheme of elections. In fact, the Joint Oppositions representatives in the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly have also accepted the Mixed-Member Proportional System with 60 per cent of constituency seats and 40 per cent of compensatory PR seats. Both your representatives in the Steering Committee have accepted this principle.

I must thank the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila for invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in respect of the Twentieth Amendment and arguing that Provincial Councils are sovereign bodies. That has been your counsels argument in the Supreme Court that it is not just only the Parliament, but each Provincial Council is a sovereign body. That has been your counsel's argument. - [Interruption.] No, your counsel has argued that. That has been your position. So, we must thank the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila for arguing that the Provincial Councils are sovereign legislative bodies and I want to place on record our thanks to Hon.Udaya Gammanpila for establishing in the Supreme Court that Provincial Councils are sovereign legislative bodies. - [Interruption.] No, I am not lying. It is there in the Determination of the Supreme Court as your counsel's argument. So, it cannot be a lie. One takes it that your counsel made submissions to the Supreme Court on your instructions that Provincial Councils are sovereign legislative bodies. Therefore, it is your position and we welcome that - [Interruption.]

Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, you were a proponent, one who supported the Thirteenth Amendment and Provincial Councils being set up in this country. This is

an Amendment that enhances - [Interruption.] . - [Interruption.] This is an Amendment that has been widely accepted; this is an Amendment that has been accepted by your own representatives in the Steering Committee. - [Interruption.] Therefore, we believe that this change must take place and the people of this country must be able to have the same system of election for the Parliament, for the Provincial Councils and for Local Authorities. An identical system of election must be brought in. Therefore, there is actually no reason, - [Interruption.] There is no issue. He is talking to you. - [Interruption.] Have a look at my National Identity Card, Hon. Lohan Ratwatte. I was born in Jaffna. - [Interruption.] How do I know? That has to be done by a delimitation commission. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . . . The Hon. Prime Minister is here.

() ( ) ( () - ) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will give you time to raise your point of Order once the Hon. Sumanthirans speech is over. - [Interruption.] So, you will have to wait. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I find in the Committee Stage Amendments, a maximum period of six months has been prescribed for the delimitation exercise. - [Interruption.]

It is there in the Committee Stage Amendment that a maximum period of six months is given for the delimitation exercise to be completed. - [Interruption.] So, the election can be held within a period of six months of the passage of this Bill. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister, do you want to make a statement? Hon. Members, please go back to your Seats. - [Interruption]. . .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, you have asked for a meeting - [Interruption.] Wait till one of the matters is decided.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Members, why do you not go to your Seats? This is Parliament. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker, you have suggested a Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business. We have no objection to it. But, the Attorney-General will not be available till about 12 oclock. So, you can decide as to what we are going to do now. We have two options. One is, we will go on till 11.30 a. m., suspend the Sittings and wait for the Attorney-General to come. - [Interruption.] Wait a minute. Or else, you decide when you want to fix the Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) So, what we can do now is, we will let the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran finish his speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes, let him finish his speech and we can suspend the Sittings after that.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. We will suspend the Sittings once he finishes his speech.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, do you want to raise any issue?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes, Hon. Speaker. What I wanted to say is that the Hon. Sumanthiran is suggesting that the Provincial Councils are sovereign. But, there is nothing like that. How can he say that the Provincial Councils are sovereign?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I was not saying that. I was referring to the Hon. Udaya Gammanpilas position before the Supreme Court.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) How can Hon. Udaya Gammanpila say that? He cannot say that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is recorded in the Determination of the Supreme Court that the Provincial Councils are - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) How can the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila say that the Provincial Councils are sovereign? They are not sovereign.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I was thanking the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila for taking up that position in the Supreme Court.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Udaya Gammanpila cannot take up the position that the Provincial Councils are sovereign.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is his position. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, you finish your speech. Then, we will suspend the Sittings.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir.

251 252

2017 01

Now that we have referred to the Determination of the Supreme Court. - [Interruption.] Let me finish my speech. Sir, since we have referred to the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect to the Twentieth Amendment, I want to bring to the Hon. Speakers notice that it concludes by saying, The majority of this Court is of the view that Clauses 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill are inconsistent with Articles 3, 4, 12(1) and 14(1) of the Constitution. If it is violative of Article 3, then, they have held that the franchise - [Interruption.] The Supreme Court, in response to the Hon. Udaya Gammanpilas petition and Prof. G.L. Peiriss petition, has held that delaying elections to the Provincial Councils will violate the franchise of the people and gone on to say that Article 3 of the Constitution is violated. - [Interruption.] We will take the Kilinochchi water to Jaffna; do not worry about that. Kilinochchi water will be taken to Jaffna. -[Interruption.] The Determination of the Supreme Court says that Article 3 of the Constitution is violated, the franchise of the people is violated and franchise arises from sovereignty; necessarily, it says that the Provincial Councils exercise sovereignty of the people. We welcome that.

But, there are no reasons given in this Determination and I was going to ask the Hon. Speaker that the jurisdiction the Supreme Court exercises in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution very specifically lays down that the Determination of the Supreme Court shall be accompanied by the reasons therefor.

If it is difficult to ascertain the reasons from the Determination that has been sent, we need to inquire from the Supreme Court. This will be effective and your Ruling is that according to the Supreme Court Determination, the passage of this Bill requires approval by people at a referendum. -[Interruption.] Nevertheless, we also need to take serious account of the fact that unless there is reasons given, it will not be possible for Parliament to make necessary adjustments. In Article 123(2)(c), the Constitution very specifically states, I quote:

whether such Bill or any provision thereof requires to be passed by the special majority required under the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 84 and approved by the People at a Referendum by virtue of the provisions of Article 83, and may specify the nature of the amendments which would make the Bill or such provision cease to be inconsistent.

So, it is in the contemplation of the Constitution that the Supreme Court goes into amendments that will take it out of the requirement of a special majority or the requirement of a referendum. The Hon. Attorney-General has placed before court certain suggested amendments to this Bill at the time the Bill was taken up for determination. But, I understand that the Supreme Court has not entertained that when Article 123 expressly confers the Supreme Court a duty to even indicate, by themselves to indicate to Parliament, what changes, what amendments, if any, that will take it out of the requirement of a referendum.

Now, in this Determination, apart from the fact that no reasons are given for their Determination, they have merely stated that two judges hold this view and one does not hold that view, without even identifying who and it

does not say why that one judge has disagreed. We have had Determinations, particularly the Determination on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution when several judges gave their reasons. Four have held one view; other four held another view and the ninth judge held a separate independent view. All of those are rich jurisprudence of this country. But, here in respect of a very serious issue, it is unfortunate that reasons have not been given, and amendments have also not been considered. So, I grant that Parliament cannot interfere with the judicial functions and the functions given to the Supreme Court in respect of Bills and what has been communicated must be honoured, and the Government has taken the step not to proceed with this.

But that places Parliament in a difficult situation, because Parliament has to ascertain, Parliament must know what the objectionable Clause is, -[Interruption.] how it is to be amended and the present Amendment, the Committee Stage Amendment that is before Parliament today, is the exact Committee Stage Amendment that this Parliament passed by a simple majority just two weeks ago in respect of the Local Authorities. Therefore, it is my submission to this House that these Amendments at Committee Stage do not require the attention either of the Oversight Committee or any other approval. But, since the Hon. Prime Minister has now said that there can be a discussion among party leaders with regard to what changes they would desire to these Committee Stage Amendments, we can also participate in that discussion and then proceed with this Bill thereafter.

I thank you. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! The Sitting is suspended till 12.00 p.m. . . 1.30 .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Rauff Hakeem.You have seven minutes.

[2.41p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are having a very heated Debate on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill. In this regard, from yesterday, I have also had my own disagreements on the process itself, regarding which I have made my opinion very clear in the Party Leaders Meeting as to how such elaborate Amendments could be moved in this manner, whereas the prescribed procedure relating to presentation of Bills has not been followed. So, this issue is entirely in the hands of the Hon. Speaker to make a decision. Then, I have had detailed discussions with the Hon. Prime Minister too on the question of the undesirability of the process adopted in bringing such a Bill before the House. I hope that such attempts will never be repeated because this is a matter of concern for all parties. Therefore, as a Party Leader in Government, it is my duty to say that we have our own disagreements about the manner and the process in which this was brought to the House.

However, since the objective of the Government is to fulfil a mandate that they got from the people to introduce a new electoral system, we are prepared to go along with such an attempt, provided that it is equitable and just by everyone in the country, all communities in the country. Now, that is exactly what is deprived when such hurried processes are adopted without due regard to the necessary conventions, the Standing Orders and even the Constitution of this country. We must also remember that, through the Nineteenth Amendment, we did away with the provision that was there to bring in Urgent Bills, whereas there had been previous Governments which introduced their own parochial ideas into Bills. What you required was a Cabinet decision to say a Bill was urgent in the national interest and they would restrict the time period available for public to go before the Supreme Court.

283 284

[ ]

2017 01

The very purpose for which we did away with it was to allow the people to have sufficient time to challenge any substantive Bill before the Supreme Court in the country. So, that is one reason why this Government of Good Governance needs to adhere to the time-honoured processes which have been followed in this House. Therefore, it is important.

And in a sense, it is a matter of regret for me that such a process was not sufficiently followed in this case, because this has a serious impact on minorities in the country. We have had differences in the Steering Committee about the electoral system to Parliament. As a matter of fact, when the Hon. Prime Minister presents the Interim Report of the Steering Committee tomorrow to the Constitutional Assembly, you will observe that we have given an alternate system of election to Parliament apart from the main proposals that are included in the Steering Committee Report. Similarly, in the case of Local Government Elections, again we saw what a right royal mess it was when the delimitation process could not be concluded in time and the Local Government bodies had not functioned for almost two years or more.

( ) (An Hon. Member) For two-and-a-half years. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, for two-and-a-half years. All of us from both sides of the House have to bear responsibility for this folly of preventing the functioning of Local Authorities in this country. Such a fate should not befall again on the Provincial Councils in the country. I am told that the Joint Opposition has been given the assurance by the Hon. Prime Minister that he would complete the process of delimitation within four months and that the elections would be held soon thereafter. That is something regarding which we also would like to urge the Government not to delay these elections and deprive the different provinces of a new administration which they are clamouring for.

Within the limited time available, we have proposed some important Amendments, particularly to the delimitation process involved. A Delimitation Commission needs to be appointed. We have suggested that a Delimitation Commission reflecting the diversity of the country be appointed comprising of eminent persons who would be put in charge of the delimitation process. Having experienced what happened during the Asoka Peiris Delimitation Commissions efforts, which finally became a fait accompli as we say in legal parlance, we were foisted on a set of Wards regarding which we have serious differences of opinion. Therefore, we have asked the Hon. Minister to set up a new appeal mechanism to review again the already gazetted re-demarcation of Wards in the Local Authorities. We do not want a similar situation to arise in the case of delimiting electorates in the new Provincial Councils Elections System. Then, we

also have suggested that the First-Past-the-Post and Promotional Representation ratio be changed from 60:40 to 50:50 in the case of the Provincial Councils. The Hon. Minister has graciously agreed to accept that Amendment to include the ratio of 50:50 as between constituencies and proportional representation in the new system. That would enable, to a great extent, a better and equitable system of elections in the country.

There again, we also envisage that the Delimitation Committees Report needs to be by consensus by all members. That is another safeguard that, we believe, would be ensuring that justice will prevail ultimately because all the eminent members of the Delimitation Committee will have to concur in finally putting out a Report. That Report has to contain reasons and if those reasons are not acceptable to any aggrieved party, they can petition the court in order to alleviate their grievances regarding the Delimitation Committee Report. Then again, we want a second bite of the cherry, as it were. In order to do that, we believe that the Hon. Minister will agree to submit the Delimitation Committee's Report to Parliament and pass it with a special majority so that that will be a further safeguard for the minorities, if they have disagreements regarding the delimitation process. All this stems out of the experience we had recently with the Asoka Peiris Delimitation Committee and these are important Amendments that we have suggested to the Hon. Minister. We hope the Hon. Minister will agree to include those. Provided he takes on board those Amendments, we will be willing to support this Bill.

Thank you.

. [4.17 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all, I must respond to the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, Presidents Counsel and my professional Colleague. My name was repeatedly mentioned in his speech and I am not in a position to reply to all of his allegations within the little time

311 312

[ ]

2017 01

allocated for me. However, I must respond to one particular allegation because it is very crucial in respect of the future of Sri Lanka as well as my political stand.

The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran told this House that my counsel in the petition against the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, Mr. Manohara de Silva, Presidents Counsel, on my instructions, submitted to the Supreme Court that Provincial Councils are legislative sovereign bodies. After his speech, I talked to Mr. Manohara de Silva. First of all, I must say, I never instructed my counsel to say so though he alleged that. Secondly, I talked to my counsel. He vehemently rejected this allegation. In no manner, he has mentioned that and if he did so, he would have been quoted by the Supreme Court in their Determination because that is very significant in that Determination.

In fact, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran referred to page 14 of the judgment or rather the Determination and there is no such reference whatsoever. Let me quote, it says:

Manohara De Silva PC, for the Petitioner in SCSD 21/2017 submitted that Provincial Council enjoy a constitutional status as it is included in Chapter XVII of the Constitution.

Nothing more, nothing less. This statement does not reflect that Provincial Councils are sovereign bodies. So, I am so sad to note that my professional Colleague has attempted to mislead this House and disrepute me as well as my counsel, Mr. Manohara De Silva, Presidents Counsel.

[7.52p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, this is a historic occasion. We have brought about a new electoral system with regard to Provincial Councils which was a long-felt need. Especially, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena has continuously agitated for a change in the electoral system. Hon. Speaker, whilst introducing this system, there are various concerns expressed by various political parties. The Hon. Prime Minister has assured that this Bill will not be moved forward until these concerns are addressed. Therefore, I would like to tell every Member of this House, whether he is from the minority or the majority community, this Government will do justice by all and all would have an electoral system which will satisfy the wants and needs of everybody, including the women in this country.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, I thank all Members of this House for expressing their views and their concerns, and I am sure that this is a historic occasion for all, even though certain Members want to make issues out of this. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardenas Report has been one of the main things that the Parliament has continuously addressed and I am sure with this electoral system we will have a Member answerable to an electorate. We will have women who represent Parliament who need not be from political lineage. Therefore, this paradigm shift will give Banda and Sellasamy, the small man, an opportunity of entering the electoral process of this country.

Hon. Speaker, I thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ( ) ?
