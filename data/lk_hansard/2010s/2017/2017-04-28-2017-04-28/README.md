PUBLIC FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I present the Report of the Committee on Public Finance on Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Bill, Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act, Resolutions under the Customs Ordinance, Order under the Ports and Airports Development Levy Act and Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act which were referred to the said Committee.

1591 1592

2017 2

Might I, Sir, ask you for a moment's indulgence to highlight a very serious issue with regard to three Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act.

The Committee, in its Report, has recommended to Parliament not to approve those Orders made under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act for the reason that a special relief seems to have been given to selected individuals and not to all who might fall into that category of persons who may have open Letters of Credit in their names on or before 26.05.2016. If such relief is to be given for any justifiable reason, it must necessarily be extended to all persons who fall under that category and not to selected individuals. This is a bad precedence and should not be permitted.

The Committee further decided to request the Hon. Minister of Finance to make known to Parliament and to the country the background of each of these individuals since on cursory glance the Committee was able to ascertain that there are relatives, father and son, and several medical professionals in that list. A particular category of persons who have open Letters of Credit seem to have lost out on Duty because the Duty went up for motor vehicles, but only 26 people have been singled out and under a special exemption under the Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act have been granted exemption from that increase. Each person seems to have got a benefit as much as Rs. 4 million when there could have been hundreds who have fallen into this category. How those 26 were chosen and on what basis were those chosen, needs to be made known to the Parliament.

Thank you. . . Ordered to lie upon the Table.

TRAGEDY DUE TO COLLAPSE OF MEETHOTAMULLA

GARBAGE DUMP [9.39 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, we meet today consequent to Parliament being summoned by His Excellency the President to keep Parliament informed of the services described in the schedule to the Proclamation made by His Excellency the President being declared as essential services in the public interest.

1593 1594

Sir, I want to submit a Motion to Parliament to enable the commencement of a Debate on this matter. Now, May I read to the House the Motion which I have submitted.

On 14th April, 2017 when the country was celebrating the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, an enormous tragedy struck several residents of the Meethotamulla area.

A garbage dump, which had developed into a hill, collapsed on several houses. After many days of rescue work, 33 bodies were recovered, while several others could still be buried under the garbage.

This is a grave and an enormous national tragedy, for which all governments both past and present, must take responsibility.

Garbage disposal is a very important matter of governance today and all cities in the world have had to seriously deal with the issue and find suitable solutions.

Sri Lanka has failed to find solutions to this crucial problem which has now resulted in this tragedy.

While partaking in the despair and sorrow of the affected families, I urge the Government to take immediate steps to adequately compensate the victims and relocate the affected people and also as a matter of utmost urgency to come up with solutions to the growing garbage crisis in the country. "

Having read my Motion, Sir, may I have your indulgence to say a few words.

Innocent people have been victims of this callous inaction on the part of authorities. This danger had prevailed for a considerable period of time of which the authorities were aware. However, no action was taken. It would be relevant to ask why no action was taken? This issue had become enmeshed in competitive politics and that truth must be stated.

The culture of politics in this country has become such that unfortunately no issue, however vitally important to the country and its people, can be addressed free of political influence and political meddling. When I refer, Sir, to political influence and political meddling, I refer to the methods and tactics employed by different political parties and political players to acquire and retain power and also to dislodge others legitimately installed in power. The political culture in this country is such that it is the view of such politicians that anything - irrespective of whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, legal or illegal - can be done to promote their political careers and to acquire and retain political power, the power to govern for their own convenience. We are, in fact, Sir, reaching a stage when such politicians are becoming increasingly unwilling or unable to accept and truly respect even the democratic verdicts of the people.

This political culture must change for the better. Those elected by the people are elected to serve the best interests of the country and its people and not to devise ways and means or tactics to subvert that trust placed in them by the people for their own political gains and benefits.

Meethotamulla, Sir, is just the tip of the iceberg. Our country could face many more even greater disasters in several spheres unless there is a radical change in this political culture.

Claims of alleged patriotism can never be a substitute for action that demonstrates a genuine commitment to honestly serve the best interests of the country and its people.

We would urge the Government to do all that it can, to alleviate the pain and suffering of the people in Meethotamulla.

Thank you, Sir. [9.47a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Sir, I second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. Before I say anything further, I am required to divulge the fact that I have, in a professional capacity, appeared as counsel for Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara when he was the Leader of the Opposition of the Colombo Municipal Council with several other Councillors in a Fundamental Rights Application to the Supreme Court in respect of this very subject matter almost ten years ago, when this garbage dump combusted by itself once before. In that matter, the court at that time went into all the surrounding circumstances, even looked at practices in other countries and urged the authorities to invite persons who have the expertise in converting garbage into energy. I distinctly remember one of the possible investors from Russia, presented himself to court one day and told the Supreme Court that he decided to flee this country - get out of this country- as fast as he could because his life had been threatened. Garbage had so much power.

Eventually, the proceedings in that case also had to be terminated because several of my clients could not agree with each other and I was given conflicting instructions with the result, that I had to go before the Supreme Court and say that I could not continue as their counsel because seven different petitioners were giving me seven different instructions on the matter and I withdrew as counsel. Then the matter ended, I think, there.

This is a reflection, as the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said, of the politics of the country and in imagery, very vividly shows what kind of "garbage" the politics of this country has also descended into. It is a shameful thing; it is shameful and I am not pointing fingers at anyone. I beg everyones pardon, if I sound patronizing and accusatory - that is not my intension. I would like to see this as a self-criticism, particularly todays Debate not to slide into that "garbage", if I might use that term again with your permission, Sir, but for it to be a constructive one where all of us take responsibility for this great tragedy, for this shameful episode and discuss it in this highest forum in the country. We must recognize that we have descended to the lowest and see

1595 1596

how we, together, can come out of this and find meaningful solutions.

All the cities in the world have this problem. All developed countries have had to deal with this issue. It is not a new issue; it is not an unresolvable issue. There are many precedents around the world and there are many experts. The problem is that there is also a lot of money in garbage. But, if we cannot resolve this issue as a country together, then I am afraid we will have no hope of any kind of development for ourselves.

It is a sad event and I join the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in extending our condolences to the families who have lost their relatives, others who may have not yet found out what has happened to their relatives, those who have lost property and those who have had to be displaced as a result of this.

I hope the Government will act swiftly in meeting the needs of these people in a very generous manner and ensure that they are given the means to restart lives with dignity.

But, the issue itself is something I suppose, through this days Debate, that must see some light. We must, through todays proceedings, agree on the way forward in dealing with this crisis and I do not want to propose any solutions. I want to end with that tone, hoping that we will have a constructive Debate today.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . The next speaker is the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha. You have 15 minutes.

[11.41a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, firstly I share the grief with the families who were subjected to the incident which happened in Meethotamulla. The Hon. S.M. Marikkar made a very emotional speech about what has not been done and what could have been done. But, today, we should not play a blame game.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! .

, ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. THILANGA SUMATHIPALA] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) We know from the time this incident occurred, politicians from various parties tried to exploit this situation and tried to make the Meethotamulla tragedy

1631 1632

2017 2

their political stage. So, one should refrain from making use of such a tragedy for their political benefit, because instead of addressing the issue and collectively helping the people of Meethotamulla, what we saw was various politicians playing the blame game saying that the people who are involved in collecting garbage are as dirty as garbage.

The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out it is not due to the officials who are running the local body. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena may know how corrupt the local bodies are today - with or without the politicians are running it. So, I do not think it is fair to point the finger to the fact that only because the politicians are running it that this incident occurred, because the Colombo Municipal Council and the Western Provincial Council have to take the responsibility to a great extent with regard to the tragedy.

I would also like to read a letter regarding this. The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka put a Cabinet Paper where he took a decision that Meethotamulla dump should not continue. But, I being the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government had no option; I could not allow the dirt lying on the streets and I was compelled to ask the Cabinet that Meethotamulla dump be continued to be used until another location was found. But, consequent to my taking over, the Cabinet gave me the responsibility to carry out matters in relation to the Meethotamulla dump yard. I summoned the Colombo Municipal Council, not twice but thrice. I knew that there was a dangerous situation and I requested the Colombo Municipal Council to carry out a proper administration with regard to the manner in which the Meethotamulla dump yard was run. I requested that drones be used to see whether there was a danger.

Then, with regard to the collection of garbage, you know that the Colombo Municipal Council has outsourced the collection of garbage to two companies - Carekleen (Pvt.) Limited and Abans Environmental Services (Pvt.) Limited - for a period of four years. I asked the Commissioner of the CMC why they outsourced it for a period of four years. He had no answer. The Carekleen and the Abans use disabled employees who are over 75 years old. I will, with the help of the Cabinet and all quarters, take steps to see that this agreement is amended or to send those two companies away, because the collection of garbage is equally a part of this problem.

I gave a directive that from the 01st of November last year, all local bodies must segregate waste. What happened in Colombo was, the employees of those two companies got an additional bonus by going to households and saying, Do not segregate the waste. Pay us something. So, there is corruption at all quarters with regard to the collection of garbage and whoever is responsible for the Meethotamulla incident should be dealt with criminal liability. That is why His Excellency the President has appointed retired High Court Judge Chandradasa Nanayakkara to go into this incident. I am sure, like in many other issues, we would see large-scale corruption in this too. I agree with the Hon. Dinesh

Gunawardena except on one fact - politicians were equally culpable. Like you said, had 50 members of the local body been there, they would have been more supportive in a situation like this, I agree with you. But, I always keep on telling you that the delay is not mine - .

With regard to the Local Government Elections also, I would like to say that I have already placed all the amendments before the Cabinet. I have done my part with regard to the election so that nobody can point a finger at me.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, when are you going to hold the Local Government Elections?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Member, that responsibility lies with the Election Commission. I have to facilitate the forum for holding the election and I have already done so. The only delay on my part, if at all, was with regard to the amendments. But now, I am happy to inform this House that I have placed all the amendments before the Cabinet and the Cabinet will have to take the responsibility with regard to that. Some Hon. Members in this House had continuously said that I am purposely delaying this election; I have no intention of doing so. I am a democrat as much as the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is, and I see the need for the Local Government Elections.

As regards to the Proclamation by His Excellency the President, the Hon. Dinesh Gunwardena pointed out various issues. Why was this Gazette Notification brought about? We saw certain politicians going and obstructing garbage from being dumped. Garbage is not a local issue. Today, we see religious leaders and politicians trying to take political mileage by saying, . . If there a densely populated area, you cannot dump garbage there. We, as a Government, have to dump garbage somewhere. That is why during the previous regime, there was a proposal to dump garbage in Puttalam. Why was that? Because there is a national need to dump garbage somewhere. However, we see people playing cheap politics.

Sir, then I would also like to quote from the Proclamation made by His Excellency the President in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2016/30 of 25th April, 2017. It states:

WHEREAS an Order under Section 17 of the Public Security Ordinance (Chapter 40) has been made declaring the following services specified in the Schedule hereto to be essential services since it has been decided that the maintenance of such services specified in the said Schedule is essential to the life of the community and is necessary in the public interest, and whereas it is directed that the Parliament be apprised of the said declaration in terms of Section 21(2) of the Public Security Ordinance read with Section 2(3) thereof,

And whereas the Parliament remained adjourned for a period not exceeding ten days on the date the said declaration was issued,"

The Schedule of the Proclamation states, I quote:

"All services, work or labour of any description whatsoever, necessary or required to be done in connection with any undertaking performed or maintained by any local authority or for and on behalf of any such local authority, for the clearance, collection, transportation, temporary storage, processing, separation, treatment, disposal and sale of street refuse, house refuse or other similar matter.

Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, this Gazette Notification is not to muscle anybody in the manner you stated. You said that there are various protests and this Proclamation is used to muscle those protests. But, there is no such intention by this Proclamation. This Proclamation is to see that the collection of garbage is declared an essential service and if anybody interferes with that service, he would be dealt with according to the law. The reason why that was brought about, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, you

may know, was that certain politicians try to go to those areas and stop garbage being dumped there, with the intention of building up their political stature. I know a person of your stature will never do that. But, unfortunately, you see various Members running to where garbage is being dumped and trying to take political mileage from that.

In a recent article I read that there are only two types of people who object to garbage being dumped: one type are the fools and the other are the politicians. Today, the general public have also come to realize that garbage has to be dumped somewhere and I would ask every Hon. Member of Parliament to help us in that exercise. Please, do not look at it locally. Today, you look at the Western world. You see garbage being recycled in major cities and there is no stench. But, unfortunately, here, people look at garbage issue from the point of view of Meethotamulla and the manner in which Meethotamulla garbage dump was administered. So, we have to create an awareness among the people. I have put up a Cabinet Paper, through which I am seeking all media institutions to come on board to create an awareness with regard to garbage, garbage recycling and also to take away the mindset of our people that garbage is a local issue.

Also, we have a problem with regard to the collection of garbage. I am thankful to the Cabinet for they have approved the purchase of 100 compactors. If you take any local body, they are unable to collect garbage because they do not have the necessary machinery. In most local bodies, you see the labourers are also performing the task of the driver or the operator because there is a shortage of such employees. So, I think, today, garbage disposal should be the number one priority for both the Government and the Parliament. We have to collectively work towards solving this problem.

If you look at the history of the Meethotamulla garbage dump site, first, it was a paddy-filed and then they started to dump the garbage of the people of Kolonnawa there. Then, there was a court case against dumping garbage at Bloemendhal. After that, they started dumping garbage in two acres at Meethotamulla and today it has extended to 18 acres. I share the grief of the people of Meethotamulla - I went there once or twice - and I do not think any Government can justify allowing the people of Meethotamulla to live in the state they have been living close to the garbage dumping site. But, unfortunately, continuously the governments have taken the shortcut of not looking at the other options of garbage disposal. There has never been a conscious effort with regard to dealing with garbage disposal.

I thank the Hon. Champika Ranawaka as he has arranged for two companies to come in and in two years time they would be recycling garbage - a genuine effort. There are RFPs called from 100 odd companies under a transparent mechanism. So, for once, something is actually happening. In the past - [Interruption.] I do not want to talk about my Chief Minster. With regard to my Cabinet Colleague, I will talk and deal with him. But with regard to the Chief Minister, I do not wish to say anything except when I am asked a Question in Parliament. Then I will answer.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) He is from the SLFP. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) He is from the SLFP. I am not trying to criticize him. I do not see a need in dealing with his conduct here, except for the fact that when I told to stop taking outside refuse to Meethotamulla, the Secretary of the Kolonnawa Urban Council told me that he has to get the concurrence of the Chief Minister. I have to inform that to this House as well.

The country will know once the Commission sits. I believe that a lot of things will come out. Definitely, somebody is responsible for the loss of lives. It is not an accident. I have been to the Meethotamulla dump site twice or thrice and if the Colombo Municipal Council had told me that there was this imminent danger, I would have agreed with the Hon. Champika Ranawaka and stopped it then and there. I had no option being the Minister of Local Government. The Minister of Megapolis can take a decision and say, Look! Stop it!.But I have a bigger picture to look at. The dumping of garbage is a function of the local body. Unfortunately, in terms of the law, I have a certain mandate over local bodies. Therefore, I have to take the responsibility in asking the Cabinet to permit Meethotamulla to continue. I am sure even the Hon. Champika Ranawaka will agree with me that until you find an alternative, it is not prudent to stop dumping at Meethotamulla.

I am starting a landfill within forty days in Muthurajawela. I will take all precautions to see that it is environmentally friendly. We are trying to start compost plants in the nine Provinces to deal with 450 metric tonnes of garbage. We are working with commitment to solve the garbage issue. I also ask the Hon. Members of the Opposition to look at this as a national issue. We have to work together because when I decide to start a plant or landfill somewhere, anybody could say, "Do not do it."

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena) Hon. Minister, when I was the Chief Minister, I helped the Chairman of Weligama Urban Council to start a garbage recycling project which was functioning very well. Now it has been neglected. There is a big problem. So, it is better if you could look at it and see what you could do about it.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I will definitely do that. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena) Mr. Mohamed who was the Chairman of the Council had been doing a very good job. Now you all have

dissolved the Council and you are not holding elections. There is no administration, nothing is happening. It is collapsing.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Member, we should not make the grief of the people of Meethotamulla a political stage. You mentioned to me that the plant in Weligama has to be looked at. I will come with you, we will go together and see to it. We do not need to take a political approach to this. We will address this issue and solve it. If it was running properly when you were the Chief Minister, and now if it has failed; we should get together and put things right without saying that this is happening because the elections were not held.

, . [ ] , -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, your time is up. Please wind up. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I need a clarification from the Hon. Minister. He said that he has a certain mandate over local bodies. This is an issue that we are debating all the time. Under the Thirteenth Amendment, the Provincial Councils have powers over the local bodies.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You were in charge of this Ministry before. You are fully aware of this.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes.

Now the problem is, the line Ministry trying to meddle with the local bodies, has to be done through the Chief Ministers only. These issues have to be clearly outlined.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Two eminent lawyers are engaged in a legal battle. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Rauff Hakeem is trying to play regional politics in the East.

1637 1638

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I want one more minute. - [Interruption.] Listen! I have always respected - [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Speaker, can I have one more minute?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Rauff Hakeem has a problem.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) He asked a very pertinent question. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) He is one politician who without doing any work for the masses, tries to criticize others and get votes. I am very clear about that. I respect the Thirteenth Amendment. As the line Minister, I am responsible to Parliament for all funds given to local bodies and Provincial Councils. In carrying out my functions, I see that they use money for the best of the people. I have never interfered. My Cabinet Colleague, the Hon Rauff Hakeem has a problem. His Party is diminishing. So, he tries to use at least Parliament to create a momentum for himself.

Thank you. [. . 12.02]

Hemantha Withanage, the Executive Director of the Centre for Environmental Justice, in an article published on the website of the Centre for Environmental Justice on the 14th of January, 2009 says, I quote:

The sanitary fill proposed at the peak of the debate on garbage had to be abandoned due to public protest. The site moved from Ragama to Alupotha in Meepe. It was proposed to have a few central collection centres and bring to the sanitary fill. The scientific and environmental debate on the issues such as best site and best waste management mechanism was transformed into a political

game of certain politicians in the area. The slogan " No to Colombo Garbage" was a creation of this political game. Although it was not the best solution, abandoning of this sanitary landfill was the biggest mistake. I feel ashamed because I was also a part of this debate.

The Hon. Mohamed Navavi, please. You have five minutes.

[5.51p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. First, my condolences and sympathies are with the families who have lost their kith and kin and their family members, in this tragedy.

Sir, I was listening to the speakers of the Opposition who said that all must take the blame. I disagree. I was the Minister of Environment in the North-Western Provincial Council - I can remember it was the third Provincial Council in the country. We had the same problem in Kurunegala, but we sorted it out within two years. In Aruwakkalu - the famous area which we are talking of - we had the same problem. They had removed Limestone and just left the pits. But, we sorted it out; we got it refilled with soil. Like this, whatever problems we had, we were able to solve them under the leadership of the then Chief Minister, the Hon. S. B. Nawinne.

Sir, today, the Hon. Members of the Opposition cannot point fingers at us, because for the last 10-15

1731 1732

[ ( ) ]

2017 2

years, all the Provincial Councils were run by them and ninety per cent of the local government bodies were managed by the present Opposition. So, they should have attended to this problem earlier. Today they say that they started something which we did not follow. But, when you think of the last 10-15 years, I am sure, all the mistakes were done by them. Now only His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister have got the opportunity to attend to them and within the last two years they have started resolving the problem.

I was listening to all the speeches and every other Hon. Member was talking about Aruwakkalu in Puttalam. Sir, just give me a few more minutes. I do not know whether people consider Puttalam as a junkyard. First and foremost, in 1965, they started the Cement Corporation in Puttalam and for 15 - 20 years we were suffering. The dust was swarming around the area and the coconut plantation was severely affected. So, people had to sell their lands. In addition, there were diseases like TB and asthma spreading and unfortunately these were going on for many years. I can remember, during the third Provincial Council Election we promised to attend to this problem. When we won, we fixed electrostatic precipitators and we were be able to arrest the problem. That was the first thing we did.

The famous Holcim Cement Plant is in Puttalam. But, you will not believe that out of 1,229 workers there, only 47 workers are from Puttalam. Today, even a small contract is not given to a person in Puttalam; it is given to outsiders. That is also another junkyard in Puttalam. It was dumped there, but the profit is going to some others.

Then, take the famous coal power plant in Norochcholai. The Sampur people objected the setting up of the coal power plant there and they put a stop to it. We, the Puttalam people, also objected. Despite that it was constructed and today we are suffering. The dust is always swarming around and 16,000 acres of cultivable land have got spoiled. That is what is happening in Puttalam today. There too, over 1,200 people are working, but not even 25 - 50 workers are from Puttalam. When it was constructed, they promised so many things. They said, 50 per cent of the workforce would be from Puttalam; they would pay compensation straightaway and the industries there would get 50 per cent of electricity through that project. But, very unfortunately, not even 25 - 30 people of Puttalam are working there today. Even last month, 40 people were taken, all from outside. So, it is another junkyard.

In addition, the Air Force has taken over 2,000 acres of land in Kalpitiya. I am sure the Hon. Members know about it. There, they practise target shooting there. Because of this, five or six people and so many animals have got killed. We have protested. This is another junkyard.

The moment you start dumping garbage, I am sure the people of Puttalam - whether I support or not - will create a problem. They will protest and there will be many problems.

At the Presidential Election, His Excellency won the Puttalam Electorate by 35,000 votes. That is why we won the District. At the Parliamentary Election, we won it by 28,000 votes. That is why we won the District. The people of Puttalam supported the President; the people of Puttalam supported the Hon. Prime Minister and today they are asking me, "Is this what we get in return?" What am I to say?

Sir, if you compare the cost of transporting garbage from Colombo to Puttalam with the installation of machineries - I will submit the estimates - it will be enormous, it will be ten times more. Therefore, I request the Hon. Prime Minister to take this matter into his hands. What is happening today is, the Provincial Councils are pulling in on direction and the Local Government bodies are pulling in another direction just to create a bad impression on the Government. Therefore, I am sure if the Hon. Prime Minister takes this into his hands - under his Ministry which has all the powers - within six months we can solve this problem.

In the morning, I was listening to the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha. He stated that he has already organized to provide a few machineries, one for each province, to arrest this issue without transporting garbage from one point to another. A Canadian company came to me and I took them there. They said it is a goldmine, because fifty per cent of it can be recycled. What is happening today?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

I took this company there eight months ago; but for months we are still going round and round, meeting this official and that official. At the same time, that company has gone to Bangladesh and opened a factory. Within one month they have started work there. I think, the Hon. Prime Minister should look into this matter and take it into his hands and solve this problem, because we have been suffering for too long.

Sir, roads have not been constructed in Puttalam; employment has not been given to Puttalam people. I request the Hon. Prime Minister to fulfill our needs first. I am the only Member from that area. But unfortunately, I am not in any of the District Committees. My people tell me that roads have not been constructed and employment has not been given to them. Seventeen thousand acres of vegetable land have been neglected today because of the coal power plant. These things must be corrected before you dump garbage there. I do not say, Do not do it. But the people of Puttalam will never allow that. Last month, about 5,000 people protested when they came to know about it. With the expenditure of transporting one trainload there, probably five or six factories can be opened.

1733 1734

Hon. Presiding Member, please give me two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No, I have given you almost nine minutes now. Please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Therefore, I request the Hon. Prime Minister to reconsider and stop this. The people of the Puttalam Electorate which looked after the President and the Hon. Prime Minister are expecting a few things in return. Thank you very much.

[6.10 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, 14th of April, 2017, the day of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, was a dark day in our countrys history. It was the day that the time bomb known as, "The Meethotamulla Garbage Dump" went off,

1737 1738

tragically robbing the lives of at least 33 and injuring and rendering homeless close to one thousand.

However, instead of attempting to justify whose fault it is and what got us here, I would like to address the House on what is most important to do now; where we are going and how we can use this opportunity, as unfortunate as it is, to draw up a holistic and sustainable waste management plan in Sri Lanka. The Government has to pursue a reactive action by way of identifying a few key factors. The key question is, whether we are going to dump waste in new areas in future and recreate the same social and environmental pollution that we have already experienced in Meethotamulla. The strong and decisive stance that we should take as the Members of this Government has to be on sustainable and structured approach towards addressing this problem.

This could be started by way of a three-pronged concurrent approach considering the following factors. Firstly, the Government needs to work out a comprehensive and sustainable National Master Plan for Waste Management. Secondly, while working on such a plan, the Government needs to take steps concurrently to evacuate and relocate the people domiciled in the Meethotamulla area and thereafter create a buffer zone around the area. That zone could further be converted into a controlled dump site, through which a system is developed ensuring that all hazardous and flammable materials are not trapped within as it was done haphazardly in the past. Thirdly, steps must be taken to create a culture of reusing and recycling the waste which would reduce overall waste dumping in the Island.

Sir, in developing this Master Plan, it is important to consider the mistakes of the past. From a technical standpoint, waste management and waste disposal are essentially divided into two subsections; one being incineration and the other being biomethanation. A good majority of technology currently available has been developed recently. In the unique Sri Lankan context, based on the research conducted, I reliably understand that an integrated approach by combining incineration of materials that can be incinerated and biomethanation of organic materials, which could be used for energy generation, is the most effective solution for this, taking into account the cost, environmental factors and external concerns.

Sir, at this point, it is important to note that since the year 2008, more than 130 proposals of solutions have been received by the Government of Sri Lanka and hardly any have taken off. The primary reasoning behind this is; firstly the lack of adequate policy, secondly the non-existence of an agency or department to take on the responsibility and thirdly the low prioritization of this issue in the past.

I propose an immediate reversal of all of these factors by taking into consideration one very important factor that is the underlying basis to ensuring a successful waste solution for Sri Lanka. That is, waste management, the

investment and the technologies that lie within would inevitably have to be sourced internationally through the private sector. However, to this day, if waste management was in fact a priority to this Government or any government that preceded it, is there an investor-friendly climate or policies adopted that would allow for the influx of various solutions? The answer is, No.

Sir, the problem is simple. For example, the foreign entity would invest into technologies applicable to suit our waste management issue in foreign currencies (more than likely the US Dollar) but the counter power purchase agreement that it would sign with the Government of Sri Lanka would be in Sri Lankan Rupees. Further, as there is no Dollar equivalent contract enforced or no policy that promotes it, how does the investor reach financial closure if there are severe currency risks with the Rupee depreciating 3 per cent to 4 per cent annually against the Dollar?

Sir, the solution for this is also simple. If, in fact, this waste management issue is definitely a priority for this Government, then, usher in foreign investments by creating policies to inter into Dollar equivalent contracts, similar to what was entered into with various power generation projects like our diesel power plants.

Given the global effects of climate change, the volatility of the fossil fuel market and the proven renewable sources that Sri Lanka has, why does not the Government give renewable energy the priority it so rightly deserves? Do innocent lives have to be lost in order to reach a consensus on this?

Hon. Presiding Member, taking into account the waste management issue in the Western Province, approximately 1,500 metric tonnes of garbage is generated per day. The conversion of this waste to renewable energy through waste solution projects would directly entail into direct environmental protection. It will bring in Foreign Direct Investments of over US Dollars 200 million and generate direct employment opportunities for over 300 people and indirect employment opportunities for over 2,000 people. This is straightforward.

As politicians, it is our duty to put petty politics and the blame game aside. This is a national issue of high importance. Let us sit and work together. We need to stop talking and start working. We need to start producing results. This cannot go on. Innocent lives cannot be allowed to be lost and our environment should not be made victims because of our mistakes. Let us all get together and fix this right away.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . , 12 .
