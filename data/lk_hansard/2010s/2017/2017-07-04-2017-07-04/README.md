QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I

LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL OF

GARBAGE ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government .

It has become apparent that the collection and disposal of domestic, commercial and industrial waste and garbage is not being carried out to the satisfaction of the people and of Parliament, though the Government has made so many announcements.

Piles of waste and garbage are to be seen rotting by the roadside and being dumped in environmentally sensitive places throughout the country. This, being a major cause for the on-going dengue epidemic, not only affects the environment but also the health of the people. The Colombo Municipal Council and other Local Authorities say that they are promoting the concept of reduce, re-use and recycle, but it is not working.

Hon. Minister, will the Government give attention to the appeal made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith which appears in the first page of The Island of 1st of July, 2017. It states, I quote;

Colombo Bishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday called for an end to dumping garbage in highly populated Delatura, Ja - Ela.

The prelate said human body parts discarded by hospitals were mixed with garbage and they posed a serious health hazard to those living in the area.

Cardinal Ranjith issuing a statement has said: I have been made to understand that the Colombo Municipal Council and some of the Government Agencies responsible in the clearing of garbage collected in the city have started to dump the garbage without any concern for the environmental damage in the Muturajawela area once again.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, all those are not there. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I would like this to be included. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

1. So, will the Government give attention to the appeal by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith - who has revealed that even human body parts that are discarded from hospitals and mortuaries have been taken and dumped in the environmentally sensitive Muturajawela wetland without any study for the suitability of the location for dumping - for an end to the haphazard dumping of waste and the adoption of a long-term solution to this problem in a way that it does not cause destruction to human life and to the environment? Can the Hon. Minister give the details of an alternative programme today?

2. Appeals of Mahanayakes and the Maha Sanga, other religious leaders and public representatives have

65 66

brought the attention of similar situations across the country to the Government. Will the Hon. Minister give an assurance on this matter?

3. Will the Government give attention to the proposal made by the Joint Opposition, after Meetotamulla debacle to formulate a long-term solution to the problem of collecting and disposing of waste and garbage and in the interim to implement and emergency programme including small-scale local waste-recycling projects to deal with the immediate crisis? On the floor of this House, the Hon. Minister knows that I requested him to hold the Local Government Elections and he gazetted it for the 1st of July. Now, he has gazetted again postponing elections for October by another Gazette confusing the whole country and the Commission of Elections.

4. Will the Hon. Minister explain what emergency procedures have been adopted to dispose of waste and garbage safely and whether steps are being taken to incorporate the public and their organizations into the process of transparent and effective planning for the collection and disposal of municipal and Local Government solid waste and garbage? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, the Hon. Minister. ( ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Sir, the Answers are as follows:

(1) I totally deny the statement. The human body parts from hospitals and mortuaries are being incinerated by health authorities by using their own incineration plant at Welisara. My Ministry has taken the following measures for proper waste management in Colombo District:

(A) short-term plans:

(a) Introduce home composting at household level by distributing home composting bins.

(b) Reduce waste by segregation.

(c) Conducting awareness programmes among public about 3R System.

(d) Introduction of Public-Private Partnership projects for recyclable materials between Local Authorities and private sector.

(e) Improvement of waste collection and transportation system by supplying garbage collection and transport vehicles to Local Authorities -100 compactors from local funds and 151 compactors from Korean loans.

(B) Long-term plans:

(a) Setting up of three waste-to-energy plants at Karadiyana, Moratuwa and Muthurajawela for waste generated in Colombo metropolitan area

and Gampaha District with the help of other stakeholder ministries. (b) A sanitary landfill at Aruwakkalu with transfer station and railway connectivity. (c) Installation of two Screw-Type Mechanical Compost Plants at Muthurajawela. (d) Construction of environmentally friendly sanitary landfill at Muthurajawela. (2) Yes. Several integrated plans and strategies at provincial level are being introduced to address this issue around the country. (3) Yes. The Government is working under long-term, medium-term and short-term Waste Management Programme as stated under the Answer 1. (4) (a) As an immediate measure, my Ministry is

carrying out a detailed survey of existing waste dump sites to see the possibility of converting them to environmentally friendly sanitary landfills. (b) To resolve land issues of Local Authorities and

to construct at least two sanitary landfills for every district. (c) Purchase of 100 garbage compactors from Local

Funds and another 151 garbage compactors from Korean soft loan to improve waste transportation facility of Local Authorities. (d) Set up a task force at my Ministry to monitor

waste management activities in Colombo and suburbs. (e) Preparation of waste collection and disposal

master plan for each province being carried out under the supervision of my Ministry with the support of all stakeholder organizations, university staff members, community organizations et cetera and implementation will be commenced accordingly. We also have taken steps to hand over a summary of the report to His Excellency the President on 17th July, 2017.

Sir, I would also like to make a clarification about the Local Government Elections. . . That is the date of commencement of term of office. I originally published a Gazette in April stating that the date of commencement will be the 01st of July, 2017, but we could not hold the elections because all technical amendments have been gazetted and the Bill is still before Parliament. It is up to all of us to collectively get the Bill passed and then, we could hold the Elections. I have, in the new Gazette, stated the date as 01st of October, 2017. But, if the Election is held earlier, I undertake to this House that I will amend the Gazette and will bring forward the date.

( ) (The Hon. Indika Anuruddha Herath) -

ALLEGATIONS LEVELLED AGAINST THE NATIONAL LOTTERIES BOARD: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN

AFFAIRS ( ( - ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, I rise to make this Statement in reply to the charges made by the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, Member of Parliament, regarding the National Lotteries Board. The Hon. Member at a media conference held by the Joint Opposition on the 25th of June, 2017 displayed a piece of paper implying it to be lottery tickets. He stated that these alleged lottery tickets did not contain a draw date, draw number or winning numbers. He also stated that the said lottery was due to be drawn on the 17th of June and had been issued to the market. He alleged that they were faulty tickets. This is a serious allegation.

I made inquiries from the National Lotteries Board and they have denied the allegations made by the Hon. Member. According to their report, what was shown by the Hon. Member at the press conference was an impression of the artwork of the Govi Setha Lottery ticket. Govi Setha Lottery is drawn on five days of the week and printed in five different colours. Any lottery ticket sold in the market must have the variable data such as wining numbers, date, draw number, bar code, QR code, et cetera to be a valid lottery. Finally, special security overlay is printed on the surface.

It is strange that the Hon. Member, while displaying the alleged lottery ticket, told the media that there was no draw date or draw number printed and at the same time stated that it was to be drawn on the 17th. I think it is pertinent to ask the Hon. Member as to how he presumed that it was to be drawn on the 17th. The NLB informs me that no complaints were received from their sales network or customers in this regard. The matter has now been handed over to the CID for further investigation and the NLB will seek legal advice on the future course of action.

. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) . . The position of the Attorney General is that the Bill is consistent with the provisions of the Constitution. . However, in view of the matters raised by the learned President Counsel, the learned Deputy Solicitor-General informed Court that at the Committee Stage, the following Amendments will be made to definitions of internally displaced persons. Committee Stage . Amendments 71 . - Correct, that is what I am saying. We just got it. We are going through it one by one. I am not disputing the timing of it.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) I will clarify it. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Yes, we need a clarification. One thing is, you have mentioned the date as 18th May, 2009. Is it open-ended or what is it? Where is the limit?

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Can I just explain it very briefly? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Yes

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in Clause 8 of the Bill, internally displaced person has been interpreted. It states, I quote:

"internally displaced person" means a citizen of Sri Lanka who was permanently resident in the Northern Province or Eastern Province and who was forced or obliged to leave from his residence at any time prior to May 18, 2009, as a result of any action of terrorist militant or other group, and currently resides in Sri Lanka outside his original place of residence in the Northern Province or Eastern Province or had re-settled in his original place of residence subsequent to the date on which the revision of the register of electors for the year 2012 commenced.

Hon. Rambukwella, I would like to mention that there are no significant changes to that, except that the definition has been more precisely clarified. There are two changes. One is, in Clause 8, under "Interpretation", two Provinces are referred to: Northern Province and the Eastern Province. We are removing that barrier, so that it would apply to the entire country.

There is another limitation. Last three lines of the second paragraph of Clause 8 states:

in his original place of residence subsequent to the date on which the revision of the register of electors for the year 2012 commenced;

We have removed that part. If any citizen who had registered previously, but due to the activities of the militants he had been displaced and not registered after the conclusion of the war in May 2009, now he will get the opportunity to have the registration irrespective of the fact that his name had been entered in the 2012 electors register or not. Those are the two changes. I think with those changes, the right has been made crystal clear; the legal position is clear.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) There are some other Amendments. ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes. That is because in two, three places in the Bill, the Northern and the Eastern Province are repeated. Except for that, there are no significant changes. One thing is, the seven days' period in Clause 3 has been extended to 14 days.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Then, what about the amendment proposed for Clause 8 of the Bill in page 5?

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) It states:

89 90

Sri Lanka and who was forced or obliged to leave from his permanent residence at any time prior to May 18, 2009, as a result of any action of terrorist militant or other group, and continues to permanently reside in Sri Lanka outside his original place of residence;.

That is a further qualification for him to get registered as a voter.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That means, within Sri Lanka? ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes, within Sri Lanka; living in Sri Lanka. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Suppose a person is now living in Chilaw. How do we know whether he is registered now in Chilaw and then also getting registered under this?

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) If he had been registered prior to 2009, the previous register of electors reflects that he had been living there.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) So, you need to raise objections if that happens? ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes, this is really an internal displacement; within the country.

( ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Applying for vote for two places is a criminal offence. He is liable to be punished.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes, he is liable to be punished. Thank you very much.

[4.06 p.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I must state at the outset, Sir, that this law has some positive features. There is an effort to restore the franchise of internally displaced persons by enabling them to be registered consequent to their having not been registered in the districts to which they originally belonged.

There is a particular reference to the Northern and Eastern Provinces which appears to be an acknowledgement of displacement in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in a fairly big scale. While I do concede that it is possible that persons of all communities could have been displaced in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the majority of the persons displaced in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and the internally displaced persons in the said provinces would largely be persons from the Tamil community.

An internally displaced person, Sir, has been defined in the law and I have some disagreement in regard to this definition because what the definition states is, " 'internally displaced person' means a citizen of Sri Lanka who was permanently resident in the Northern Province or Eastern Province and who was forced or obliged to leave from his residence at any time prior to May 18, 2009, as a result of any action of terrorist militant or other group, and currently resides in Sri Lanka outside his original place of residence in the Northern Province or Eastern Province or had re-settled in his original place of residence subsequent to the date on which the revision of the register of electors for the year 2012 commenced."

It seems to suggest that this displacement has occurred as a result of some militant activity which is a recent phenomenon. I do not quite agree with that Sir, because, I want to make a few comments to clarify and place on record the full picture relating to displaced Tamil persons.

Tamil militancy first occurred in Sri Lanka in the late 1970s. The displacement of Tamil people commenced in Sri Lanka well-nigh two decades before that. The first anti-Tamil riots were in 1956 in the Galoya valley followed in 1958 by riots in several parts of the country. Then we had anti-Tamil violence in 1961, on a large scale in 1977, 1981, and thereafter in 1983 which was a major anti-Tamil holocaust and continuously thereafter until 2009. Large numbers of Tamils were not merely internally displaced; they fled abroad. We have personal knowledge of families involved. Tamils were physically attacked on account of political demands made by them

109 110

pertaining to language, land, restructuring of the Constitution to enable sharing powers of governance. As much as 50 per cent of the Sri Lankan Tamil population lives outside the country in different parts of the world. They were displaced people, not internally displaced but displaced and compelled to seek residence in other parts of the world and I may call them Externally Displaced People.

The Tamil people have consequently been politically weakened. This law does not address that issue. That issue needs to be addressed. Whether Sri Lankan citizens living abroad who have not acquired citizenship in another country should not be granted the right to vote - the right to franchise - is a matter that needs to be considered. We would very much like them to come back. It may be, in view of the experiences that they have suffered and gone through, they would like to be assured that they are returning to a country, different to the country from which they fled because a number of these persons fled because they were subjected to physical violence. A large number of them were public servants; persons holding responsible positions in public service. There is a feeling in this country today that the public service in this country has deteriorated. The exodus of Tamil public servants consequent to physical violence has been one of the main reasons for the deterioration that has occurred in the public service.

Well, Sir, as I said before, these people are willing to come back; they are anxious to come back. But the question is, is this country different today or would it be different in the future from what this country was when they fled from the country? That is what they want to be assured about. If there is a new Constitution which accommodates diversity, upholds democracy in the true sense of the word, upholds the rule of law and human rights, upholds equality and justice, nondiscrimination, equal treatment as equal citizens in this country, then, I think, Sir, there is a possibility that at least, some of these persons will return. We have the opportunity to accomplish this task because today many right-thinking persons, both in this Parliament and outside, think that the time has certainly come for us to put the past behind us through a new constitution.

So, Sir, while I welcome this law insofar as the law seeks to redress the difficulties, the denial caused to internally displaced persons and enable them to be registered in the districts to which they belong, the fact remains that this law does not address the issue of persons who have been externally displaced, who have fled the country, who live abroad, who were not citizens of any other country and would like therefore to exercise their franchise in this country and if possible be able to even come back to this country if the country will assure them of a peaceful and nonviolent future.

Thank you, Sir.

[5.50 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. This is a very important Bill, I should say.

During the war, from the Districts of Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu, over 150,000 people were chased out. They had to leave their respective districts within two hours and they all came to Puttalam. After the war, about 60,000 people have returned to their respective districts; started living there and registered as voters of that area. Another 20,000 people have been registered in Puttalam and now they are living in Puttalam as people of Puttalam. Very unfortunately, there are about 40,000 to 50,000 people, who want to go back to their respective districts, still living in Puttalam with all the difficulties. But unfortunately, due to certain problems, their lands have not been handed over to them. The lands which were owned by them were not given back and because of that they cannot go back to their respective districts and resettle. Anticipating that they would be able to go and live in their respective districts in the future, they are still living in Puttalam with all the difficulties. There are about 40,000 of them and they want to go back. They want to register themselves as voters of their respective districts; but unfortunately they have been deprived of that. You would not believe it, but they are unable even to get a letter from the Grama Sevaka because the first question they are asked is, "What is the district you vote from?" So, those are some of the difficulties they are facing.

I know, the present Chairman of the Election Commission knew that we had this problem during the Presidential Election also. Some arrangements were made for those people living in Puttalam to go back to their respective districts and cast their vote. Unfortunately, the then Government - I know that personally - blocked all those people. About 20,000 to 25,000 people were unable to cast their vote because of that. So, my request to the Chairman of the Election Commission is to look into this

141 142

matter and see that some arrangement is made by the Government and the Commission for those 30,000 to 40,000 voters living in Puttalam to go back and vote. They must not be deprived of their voting rights. This is a very important issue which has been going on for years. In the future, we are going to face the Local Government Elections, the Provincial Council Elections and we should not deprive those people of their voting rights. Therefore, I request the Government to humbly look into their problem and see that they are registered in their respective districts as voters and are allowed to cast their vote. The second issue, Sir, is this. I especially would like to speak about my District, Puttalam. Out of the total number of voters, over 10,000 people are working in Europe, America and all over and another 20,000 people are working in the Middle East.

So, 30,000 people are working abroad and we are not fair by them. The amount of foreign exchange that they send to this country is vast. As you know, the foreign exchange sent by the migrant workers, I think, is the third largest income of the country. Unfortunately, these people are unable to cast their vote. When you compare this situation with other countries like America, wherever their people are, they are able to cast their vote in the embassies of the respective countries. Their votes are counted along with the other votes. But here, over lakhs and lakhs of people who are working abroad, sending their income and helping us are being deprived of casting their vote. Therefore, wherever the Sri Lankans are living in large numbers, wherever they are working, arrangements must be made for them to cast their vote. Otherwise, it is unfair. They cannot come back just because of the elections. They cannot get visas. They are helping us by sending valuable foreign exchange. Some arrangements must be made in this regard so that at the next election they would be able to cast their vote. This is a very important matter, because in the future elections more than two hundred thousand people would be deprived of their right to vote.

There is another important point I want to make. If we change the present PR system - it is okay if we do not - but still there are some doubts that the system would be changed. Therefore, I would like to make a valid point. Because of this PR system certain electorates are unable to elect a Member. What happens is, the leaders of both parties in the district who get more preferential votes come to power. In some instances, there are two or three MPs in one electorate and in another electorate there is nobody. Take my electorate as an example. I represent Puttalam Electorate in the Puttalam District. From 1989 up to the year last election was held, we were unable to elect a single Member for our electorate. Even I lost by 500 votes and I have come through the National List. Both sides have been losing by a few thousand votes in every election. Because we were unable to elect an MP, unfortunately my electorate is suffering. This is the position in certain electorates of the country. Therefore, if, - there is a big "if " there - if the PR system is not changed, some arrangements must be made for electorates which do not have elected members.

Therefore, these are the problems that we face. Political rights which we require must be given. There are difficulties, but I am sure with this Bill these things would be addressed. Lakhs and lakhs of people who are living abroad must be allowed to cast their vote. Internally displaced people also must be given that right. My request is, if the PR system is not changed some arrangements must be made for electorates which do not elect MPs.

Thank you.
