Hon. Speaker, as this House is aware, Sri Lanka, since Independence, has been recognized internationally as a respected member of the world community. Sri Lankas leaders, as we know, since Independence, were held in high regard and welcomed warmly in the important capitals of the world. In fact, the doors of the White House - from the White House to the Kremlin in Moscow, to Beijing, to New Delhi, to 10 Downing Street, to the European capitals - were all open to Sri Lankan leaders ever since Independence until 2005. Sri Lanka was looked upon as a consensus builder on the international stage, playing a role at the UN, which was somehow disproportionate to our geographical size, disproportionate to the fact that we are relatively an unimportant little Island.

Sri Lanka has always stood for a rules-based international order focusing on international peace and security. Sri Lankas pioneering role in the negotiations on the Law of the Sea is a very important example of our quest to strengthen the rules-based international order.

Hon. Speaker, Sri Lanka, since time immemorial, from historic times, has engaged with the rest of the world. Our ancestors were not afraid to engage; they were not afraid to trade; they were not afraid to explore. Historical evidence proves that they were well known and whatever name it was called - it was called by different names, "Serendipity" at one point, later "Ceylon" and many other names in between - during those ancient times, our country was indeed well known and written about. It is certainly not by accident that the map of Ptolemy, one of the earliest maps drawn in the first century AD, depicted Sri Lanka much larger than its size.

363 364

2017 05

In the first map, Sri Lanka is much larger simply because the ancient Sri Lanka would have played a much bigger role than its actual size. They considered us a very important country, a very important port, a very important hub in the Indian Ocean.

Mr. Speaker, we all know that during the last decade or so, especially since the election of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka which has moved along with the world community, as I said, for many centuries, went against its traditional position on the world stage which led this country to a form of self-imposed self-isolation.

However, thankfully, after the 8th of January 2015, we have succeeded in turning things around, realigning Sri Lanka once again with its traditional persona of engagement and friendship on the world stage, and rebuilding our relations with the international community for the benefit of all our people.

Hon. Speaker, Sri Lanka is, of course, not a superpower. Our strength does not rely on acquisition and accumulation of military power. Our strength lies in harnessing our human resources; in building a strong democracy that is accountable to our own people; in protecting human rights; in learning from our past and building a strong and inclusive nation where all are equal, where individual rights are protected and where everyones dignity is upheld, so that Sri Lanka can be an example to other nations emerging from conflict. Our strength lies, Hon. Speaker, in strengthening our judiciary and our law and order system and in the network that we form with the international community; the partnerships that we forge with countries both within the region and beyond and the agreements that we conclude and abide by for increased investment, trade and commerce. Our success depends on strengthening these attributes to enhance our nations competitiveness and our soft power, providing our nation and our future generations the durable peace and stability required for the sustained and sustainable progress of all.

As a result of the policy of engagement of the Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the doors of the worlds capitals which were closed to Sri Lanka have once again opened for Sri Lankas leaders and people. Our ports are, again, a friendly harbour for the international navies.

In fact, last month, President Maithripala Sirisena, invited by President Putin himself, paid the first official visit to Russia, in 44 years. In fact, before that, the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe went to Australia earlier this year at the invitation of the Australian Government and this was the first time a Sri Lankan leader has been invited to Australia and given a State welcome since the visit of Sir John Kotelawala in 1954. Likewise, the President was again in Indonesia earlier this year; the first

visit by a visiting Head of State for forty-odd years and we have re-established our ties with many other countries within the last two years.

Even the tri-forces of important and advanced nations in the world are engaging, once again, with our tri-forces. The Members of the European Parliament last week voted 436 to 119 against objecting to Sri Lankas readmission to GSP Plus. The European Union has already - in fact just a few months after this Government came into being- lifted the ban on Sri Lankan fish export, again restoring the livelihood of thousands and thousands of fisher folk living on the coasts of this Island.

The US Millennium Challenge Corporation, again, is engaged with Sri Lanka and named Sri Lanka in December, 2016 as a compact-eligible country. The World Bank and the IMF are now open to lend to Sri Lanka on favourable terms even though Sri Lanka is a middle-income country. Countries are now forthcoming and are engaged in assisting our officials across a wide spectrum of areas on capacity building and sharing knowledge and expertise.

Hon. Speaker, we have before us in this House today for approval, in the context of our international engagement, the Order published under Section 4 of the Diplomatic Privileges Act, No. 9 of 1996. Sri Lanka has been a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations since 1978 which defines the framework for international relations between States and codifies diplomatic immunities and privileges. The provisions underlined in the Vienna Convention were incorporated into domestic law by the enactment of the Diplomatic Privileges Act, No. 9 of 1996 by the late Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar. The privileges and immunities that were requested by international and regional institutions are facilitated by means of the Diplomatic Privileges Act, No. 9 of 1996.

On the 1st of September, 1993, Mr. Speaker, the Government of Sri Lanka had entered into a Status Agreement with the International Water Management Institute - IWMI. In terms of the Agreement, the Institute was entitled to certain privileges and immunities which shall not be less than those granted to the UNDP Office in Colombo. Since then, a number of international and regional organizations were interested in setting up their offices in Colombo.

As stipulated in Section 3, 4 and 5 of this Act, any regional or international organization having its office in Colombo, which has entered into an agreement with the Government, was granted immunities and privileges in terms of Section 5 (1) of the Act, an Order made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to be gazetted and thereafter placed in/ before Parliament for approval.

The following international organizations with which the Government signed agreements were extended

365 366

privileges and immunities by Gazette No. 1005/23 dated 12.12.1997 and the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was obtained prior to signature. The Organizations concerned were:

(1) International Irrigation Management Institute, presently known as the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) - signed on the 1st of September 1983;

(2) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - signed on the 20th of May 1990;

(3) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) - signed on the 1st of October 1987;

(4) Colombo Plan Bureau - signed on 20th February 1996 ;

(5) International Labour Organization (ILO) - signed on 21st March 1988;

(6) International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) - signed on 16th June 1990 and 18th August, 2016.

(7) World Conservation Union(IUCN) - signed on 18.01.1993 and

(8) Commission of the European Communities ( EC) - signed on the 19th of September, 1995. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! .

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. THILANGA SUMATHIPALA] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) However, the Gazette had not been tabled in Parliament following its publication in 1997. Consequently, several cases had been filed in Sri Lankan courts where the legality of immunities and privileges as a result of non-placement of Gazette No.1005/23 of 1997 was taken up among other issues. As there were cases pending before courts, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been unable to table the Gazette in Parliament at that time.

However, there is a Supreme Court Judgment in SC Appeal No. 11/2011 dated 25th March 2014 which pronounced in favour of the International Water Management Institute which was party to the case. This judgment upholds that the immunities and privileges granted to the IWMI become valid when the Order made by the Minister is published in the Gazette, even though it has not been placed before Parliament. From a legal view point, consequent to this judgment, a judicial precedent has been created for cases of similar circumstances in future.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, although the Supreme Court has held that the failure to place the Orders before Parliament does not affect the coming into force of the Order, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is of the firm view that it is necessary to rectify this anomaly in order to avoid any further legal complications which would affect Sri Lankas relations with her international partners and honouring commitment as per international norms and regulations. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sought the advice of the Hon. Attorney-General who advised that it was legally appropriate to re-gazette the Orders and thereafter table them in Parliament.

My Ministry has accordingly taken action to re-gazette the Orders of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, inclusive of the provisions of the Addendum to the Status Agreement of ICRC signed on 18th August, 2016, and the exemptions granted to the Colombo Representative Office and the staff of the Export-Import Bank of Korea in accordance with the Agreement signed on 13th July, 2016. The Orders and additions / modifications were published in Gazette No.1987/23 dated 05.10.2016 which has been placed before this House for approval.

On the 9th of December, 2016, the granting of immunities and privileges was discussed by the Sectoral Oversight Committee of Parliament with specific reference to the International Water Management Institute -IWMI and it was suggested that the IWMI should obtain the approval of the Government for water pricing and increase Sri Lankan participation in the Governing Board to at least one third.

The IWMI is a Member of the CGIAR, Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, an alliance of fifteen international agricultural research centres. The IWMI has submitted a letter to the Parliamentary Sectoral Committee headed by the Hon. Aluvihare confirming that they will not carry out studies in Sri Lanka that involves considerations of water pricing without the concurrence and involvement of the relevant Government agency. They have further stated that their independent Board of Trustees includes one ex-officio member from the host Government of Sri Lanka and that this is consistent with their own Charter and the general practice of other CGIAR Centres around the world.

At a IWMI Board meeting held in April 2017 it was stated that IWMI is open to further nominations to the Board including candidates from Sri Lanka. The process of hiring the Board Members will be a competitive process. The IWMI further asserted that the duties and functions of the Institute in Sri Lanka is in accordance with Articles 6. and 7. of the IWMI Act, No. 50 of 2000.

With regard to the finances, the IWMI maintains their accounts in Sri Lankan banks. The financial statements are audited by external auditors and are available in the public domain. They have made available to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs their Audit Reports of 2014 and 2015 for perusal and I would also like to table* the letter sent by the IWMI to the Secretary of my Ministry confirming that water pricing will not be done without the concurrence and involvement of our Government, for the information of this House.

Sir, taking into consideration what I have explained and the fact that it is the ultimate responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to table the Orders in Parliament, rectifying a long overdue anomaly, approval of this House is sought for the said Orders granting diplomatic privileges and immunities to the following organizations: (1) International Water Management Institute (2) United Nations Development Programme (3) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (4) Colombo Plan Bureau (5) International Labour Organization (6) International Committee of the Red Cross (7) World Conservation Union (8) Commission of the European Communities

(9) Colombo Representative Office of the Korea Export-Import Bank.

Sir, in fact, many of our embassies abroad had become safe houses for criminals who had carried out atrocious activities - killings, kidnappings and other forms of

human rights violations - in this country. They were all rewarded by being given placements in our embassies abroad. So, that is why I can safely say that during the Rajapaksa era, the Sri Lankan embassies abroad had become virtual safe houses for criminals from Sri Lanka. I am sure we will hear some of these details during the course of the day.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay, thank you very much. [12.12 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, my Friend, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs has presented this Motion to bring some of the international organizations having their offices in Sri Lanka under the Diplomatic Privileges Act, one of which is the International Water Management Institute, which has set up its head office not far away from this august Assembly, which has been serving the water sector in this country as well as in the entire world. As a matter of fact, I must appreciate that through this Order being adopted, we will be able to extend the diplomatic privileges and immunities to these important international organizations which have a presence in this country.

Having said that, I want to digress for a moment to deal with an issue of concern to almost all the Sri Lankans, not just the Muslims in this country, relating to our stand towards the cause of Palestine. It is a matter of regret that repeatedly we appear to be taking up a position of ambivalence particularly when Resolutions condemning the actions of Israel in the occupied territories which affect UNESCO preserved heritage sites are moved before the Executive Council of UNESCO.

Last year too, it was reported that Sri Lanka has abstained when a Motion condemning the actions of Israel was brought before the UNESCO. Regarding that matter, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena raised this issue in Parliament on 28th October, 2016 and the Hon. Minister was kind enough to give a detailed reply. I am pleased to quote some portions of that reply which somewhat goes to

pacify the strong supporters of the Palestinian cause in this country. But, nevertheless, I must add some reservations here, because we are somewhat dismayed and disappointed that we are missing the point here. I am in total agreement with the Hon. Minister when he reiterates throughout his reply that the friendship between Palestine and Sri Lanka is as strong as ever. He states, I quote Column 434 of Hansard dated 22nd November, 2016:

"The cause of the Palestinian people and commitment to the Palestinian cause has been a consistent and core feature of Sri Lankas Foreign Policy, maintained by all Governments ...."

- ever since we recognized the State of Palestine way back in 1988.

I am not at cross purposes with the Hon. Minister on that statement. It may be so. But, a few days ago, once again in the UNESCO EXCO, when a Resolution was brought in to condemn Israel for certain actions undertaken in the Old City of Jerusalem, once again we have abstained and through this abstention, we are sending a very wrong message to -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Minister, can I explain? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, please. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I just want to say that you are right that we had abstained when this matter came up. But, again, that was after much consideration, Hon. Minister, because Sri Lanka is also the Chair of the Israeli Practices Committee and - I think even the Palestinians do appreciate the fact - in order to maintain our neutrality and credibility as the Chairman in that respect, we felt that it is best that we abstain. That was the thinking behind that decision, whereas we have always stood for Palestinian rights throughout my period as Foreign Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) So, am I to take it that this is a sentiment that was shared by the Palestinian Delegation in the UNESCO and then -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I know that they greatly appreciate the role we are playing as the Chairperson of the Israeli Practices Committee.

375 376

2017 05

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Definitely. I mean, none of us are disputing the fact that we have been chairing the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories for several years now and when we were present in Geneva, we have seen the praise that countries which are friendly towards Palestines cause heap on Sri Lanka for the excellent work we are doing as the Chair of this particular Committee.

But nevertheless, Hon. Minister, let me tell this House what Mr. Hillel Neuer, the Head of the UN Watch said. He says that additional countries abstaining in the vote had a positive aspect for Israel and also he says that by these abstentions, Palestinians suffered a significant defeat in the international arena. This is the impact. This is how the Israeli lobby is trying to market this issue of our abstaining in these votes in order to continue with their derogatory practices in those occupied territories.

As a matter of fact, I think, the Hon. Minister, last time, in replying to the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena dealt in detail about the wording of the Resolution then and that you felt that the wording should have been much softer and it was too harsh and therefore, it was not promoting a reconciled approach towards the two sides and we should stand towards promoting this time-honoured policy that we have now continued to allow Israel and Palestine to be recognized on the two-State policy.

With all that, let me read a portion of that Motion - the draft decision of the Executive Board of of the UNESCO - which is very, very explicit in its content. It states, I quote:

The Executive Board,

1. Having examined document 201 EX/30,

I am just quoting some portions of this document. It states, I quote:

"7. Regrets the failure of the Israeli occupying authorities to cease the persistent excavations, tunneling, works and projects in East Jerusalem, particularly in and around the Old City of Jerusalem, which are illegal under international law and reiterates its request to Israel, the occupying Power, to prohibit all violations which are not in conformity with the provisions of the relevant UNESCO conventions, resolutions and decisions;

8. Also regrets the Israeli refusal to implement the UNESCO request to the Director-General to appoint a permanent representative to be stationed in East Jerusalem to report on regular basis about all aspects coving the fields of competence of UNESCO in East Jerusalem,.

Again, item 13 states, I quote:

13. Reaffirms that the two concerned sites located in Al-Khalil/Hebron and in Bethlehem are an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territory, and shares conviction affirmed by the international community that the two sites are of religious significance for Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

As a matter of fact, the Hon. Minister last time adverted to this argument also that our policy was to promote the co-existence among these three monotheistic faiths in this Holy Land, therefore, our policy is not to use derogatory language and to use softer language. I beg, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to ask the question whether the language that has been used in the Resolution is in anyway derogatory. I mean, could we call this a derogatory language? Could we call this language being harsh? Certainly not. You cannot, by any means, say that the wordings of this Resolution was not promoting the objectives of the UNESCOs conventions and decisions that have already being adopted by the international community.

Continuous violation by the State of Israel in the occupied territories particularly harming UNESCO conventions gave rise to a Resolution such as this to be brought before UNESCO and our continuous abstention on this issue is emboldening the Jewish State to continuously violate the international norms and best practices when it comes to UNESCO heritage sites. That is why I take strong objections and I want to record my reservations in this case.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I have a very limited time. Hon. Member, you can speak during your time.

Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would request that the Hon. Minister clarifies this and also look at the issue of continuous abstentions in matters such as this, which is allowing the Israeli occupiers to continue their violations, being more embolden, thinking that some of us who have been taking a very resolute position when it comes to the Palestinian cause are somewhat taking a very obnoxious positions in issues such as this. Therefore, this is hurting the sentiments of all those Sri Lankans who have been supporting, across the religious divide, the cause of Palestine. So, I would rather have that on record.

I also need to say a few more things about matters which relate to our international commitment, particularly the commitment through the LLRC Recommendations to Geneva and in our efforts to continue with our reconciliation programme. In this regard, I must thank the Defence Ministry for having taken a decision to vacate from large portions of land in the Mullikulam area in the Musali Divisional Secretary's Division, where the Army has vacated a very large portion of land, which enables

377 378

the local Tamil IDPs to resettle in their original places of habitation. We have seen from television footage as well as from news reports that a large number of people have flocked to the area to go and resettle in those areas since this has enabled these people to go back.

But, in the meantime, similarly, we raised an issue regarding the Silawathurai Navy Camp. I had met His Excellency the President along with the Hon. Sampanthan on another issue and while the President was speaking to us, I mentioned this issue of the Navy having to vacate from the Silawathurai Town which occupies almost in toto; the entire town is occupied by the Navy. So, a few days ago, I think, probably as a result of our having taken it up with the President, it is reported that the Navy is reducing its outer perimeter and has given up small portions of land on both sides of their perimeter fence. I mean, this is hardly inadequate. I would like to table* the relevant document here. There are almost 36 acres of land belonging to various individuals. I have a long list here. I would rather ask the Hon. Deputy Speaker that this be tabled as a portion of my speech here so that this matter can be resolved fully.

These are all private lands for which the legal documents are held by these people and the Navy simply trying to reduce its perimeter on both sides by a few hundred feet is not going to assist these resettling IDPs in any manner. Therefore, it would only be proper that the Navy look at a different location and vacate the entire Silawathurai Town.

Having said that, I must also add here very quickly the attitude of the Forest Officers in some areas. In the area of Akkaraipattu, there is a place called, Pottanai, which is a very divine place for the people in that area and they normally have a feast in a shrine there. This time, when these Muslim devotees went to celebrate and have the feast in that shrine, they had all been blocked by the Forest Officers saying they cannot enter. This is an area where there is a lot of cultivation taking place. During last few years, we have been having some disputes with the Forest Department. But, this has continuously been cultivated by the people of the Akkaraipattu Village and this Pottanai shrine today is out of bounds for these devotees. This is an absurd exercise by the Forest Officers. This is, in fact, hurting the sentiments of Muslims all round.

I must also add here that there is a place called, Ten Houses Village in Palathoppur. There were ten houses built by the then Department of Housing for the people in Palathoppur area and, there again is an Army camp which needs to vacate. This issue has also been brought up with

the Defence authorities and I hope these issues will receive the attention of the authorities in complying with the programme to assist the IDPs to return to their original homestead.

Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you. The Sitting is suspended till 1.30 p.m.

Then, Sir, I would like, at this moment, to quote an extract from the Media Release issued by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on GSP Plus on 3rd May, 2017. It states:

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is encouraged by the prospects of regaining the GSP Plus trade preferences and is hopeful that the final vote at the EU Council of Ministers will be favourable. The granting of GSP Plus to Sri Lanka once again will have a significant positive impact on the countrys exports to the European Union. It comes at a good time for the country as overall exports have been flagging and has affected the countrys external payments position. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce commends the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Commerce, who were instrumental in this victory. The process that led up to this vote was no doubt arduous, but has reiterated the importance of international diplomatic engagement for Sri Lanka.

The regaining of GSP Plus at this time is welcome also because EU economies are showing signs of economic recovery, which would hopefully improve demand condition in key European markets. Apparels, fresh and processed food products, seafood, toys, ceramics and porcelain, are some of the sectors that will benefit from the additional tariff concession under GSP Plus. Given that most orders have already been finalized for the year 2017, the real boost is likely to be seen from 2018. Nevertheless, several Chamber member companies noted that they are already in contact with EU buyers who are keen to place new orders as soon as the GSP Plus is reinstated.

This is the Media Release by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.

It states:

The recommendation for an international investigation is based solely on the recommendation made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in 3 reports filed by her in February 2013, September 2013 and February 2014.

:

The primary and principal basis for the High Commissioners recommendation for an international investigation in her 3 reports takes evidence in the Report of the UN Secretary Generals Panel

409 410

of Experts released in 2011. Using the UNSGs Panel of Experts report to recommend an investigation against Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council is ex facie illegal.

1. The Panel of Expert Report was commissioned by the UNSG for his PERSONAL USE. The report was not commissioned by the UN Members in consultation with Sri Lanka which becomes a violation of a UN Members rights deeming the right of Sri Lanka to participate and provide input to the decisions of the UN when it is affecting Sri Lankas interests.

2. The Panel of Experts Report was never placed officially in the General Assembly, in the Human Rights Council or any other UN body. This denied Sri Lanka the right to respond officially and directly to the report. Sri Lanka was given no right of response which is a basic right under Natural Justice.
