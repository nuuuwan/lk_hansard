She was reported as saying that memorandums of understanding - MoUs - had already been signed with several countries to increase the minimum wage. On 19th February, 2017, \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper reported that, in early February, a circular was issued by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment - SLBFE - to all licensed foreign employment agencies, revising the minimum salary of Sri Lankan migrant workers - US Dollars 350 for unskilled workers and US Dollars 450 for skilled workers per month . This circular had been issued in keeping with a Proposal in the National Budget for 2017.",

Since the circular was issued, the number of Sri Lankans going to the Middle East for work had declined significantly.

Guided by this objective, the parties agreed to initiate discussions on substantive political issues such as, but not limited to: Power-sharing between the centre and the region, as well as within the centre; Geographical region; Human Rights Protection; Political and administrative mechanisms; Public finance; Law and order.",

It states, I quote: Sri Lanka's progress and prosperity are also a source of strength for India. So, Sri Lanka's success is of great significance to India and as a friend, our good wishes, our support and solidarity have always been with Sri Lanka and it will always be there for you. For all of us in our region, our success depends on how we define ourselves as a nation. All of us in this region, indeed every nation of diversity, have dealt with the issues of identities and inclusion, rights and claims, dignity and opportunity for different sections of our societies. We all have seen its diverse expressions. We have faced tragic violence; we have encountered brutal terrorism and we have also seen successful examples of peaceful settlements. Each of us has sought to address these complex issues in our own way. However, we choose to reconcile them. To me, something is obvious: diversity can be a source of strength for nations. When we accommodate the aspirations of all sections of our society, the nation gets the strength of every individual. And, when we empower states, districts and villages, we make our country stronger and stronger. You can call this, my bias. I have been a Chief Minister for 13 years; a Prime Minister, for less than a year! Today, my top priority is to make the States in India stronger. I am a firm believer in cooperative federalism. So, we are devolving more power and more resources to the States and we are making them formal partners in national decision- making processes. Sri Lanka has lived through decades of tragic violence and conflict. You have successfully defeated terrorism and brought the conflict to an end. You now stand at a moment of historic opportunity to win the hearts and heal the wounds across all sections of society. Recent elections in Sri Lanka have reflected the collective voice of the nation: the hope for change, reconciliation and unity. The steps that you have taken in recent times are bold and admirable. They represent a new beginning. I am confident of a future for Sri Lanka defined by unity and integrity, peace and harmony and opportunity and dignity for everyone. I believe in Sri Lankas ability to achieve it. It is rooted in our common civilizational heritage. The path ahead is a choice that Sri Lanka has to make and it is a collective responsibility of all sections of the society and of all political streams in the country. But, I can assure you of this: for India, the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka are paramount. It",

After all when the JVP insurrection took place in the early 1970s that girl, Beatrice Manamperi was raped by some soldiers. Am I right Bimal? They were identified and convicted. That was the right thing to do. So if there are soldiers who have committed such wrongs, they may have to face the consequences. But a soldier who fought the war on behalf of the Government, on behalf of the State was carrying out the instructions of his Government. He was doing nothing more. I do not see how he can be prosecuted.",

    "text": "In order to realize the full promise of all these reforms, we need to work out on our momentum to effect the paradigm transformation we so honestly wish for our people. I cannot but resist the observation that from a human rights perspective the constitutional reform process presents us an important opportunity to rectify structural deficiencies and establish a more comprehensive Bill of Rights, stronger institutional checks and balances, enhanced constitutional review, improved guarantees for independence of the judiciary, accountability of our international human rights obligations. As for our treaty obligations, our obligations under the Convention Against Torture have already been considered in November 2016 and we are also going to bring a bill against enforced or involuntary disappearances. That would be presented maybe in a week or two. So, we must bear in mind that on the question of enforced disappearances when it becomes a penal offence under international obligations, that law can be applied retrospectively. All other penal offences are prospective, but in this case, it is not so. And this is why the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa was so emotionally charged saying that we are on a witch-hunt against intelligence officers. But then, if intelligence officers have stepped out of the law, if they have gone and taken in innocent people and tortured innocent people, and have been cause for disappearances, then it has to be looked into. This is an international obligation. We have signed Conventions where we hold ourselves responsible to the international community and that is what accountability means, and transitional justice mechanisms are necessary for us to bring closure to the misery and trauma that people have suffered in this country.",

We also had the Draft Constitution in August, 2000 which was brought in by Prof. G.L. Peiris, with whom the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was also a Member of that Government and the Cabinet. Also, we had the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on several occasions, expressing his intention to solve the national problem when he said, Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka. The former President again said, People in their own localities must take control of their own destiny. These were also the words of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Any solution must stretch to the maximum possible devolution without sacrificing sovereignty. Unfortunately, what we seem to be reading in the newspapers and other media these days of what the former President has said is in contradiction to some of the things he had said while he held the high office of this country. I am beginning to wonder why he does not come to this august Assembly and contradict his own statements rather than making statements to the media. On the other hand, we might give him the benefit of doubt by saying that, maybe, he has not made these statements to the media and that is why he has not appeared in this House to actually contradict himself or he is actually a confused man, if these statements have actually been made to the media.",

Many former presidential candidates, including former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, President Mahinda Rajapaksa and then, President Maithripala Sirisena, had expressly stated at different points that they would want to abolish the Executive Presidency. But, the two former Presidents had not done that. The present President has made a commitment to go through constitutional reform and also to abolish the Executive Presidency. I must say to his credit that when the Nineteenth Amendment was moved in this House, he willingly gave up or reduced the powers of the Executive Presidency, but there were limits to it.",

I remember as a student in school, when the then Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike wanted to extend the term of Parliament from1975 to 1977, she did it without having a Referendum violating the basic principle that you cannot alter the terms on which you yourselves are elected.

Barring a few discordant noises, which anyway we must expect, most Hon.

And, so they must, because it is this House that passed unanimously the Resolution on the 9th of March 2016. It was passed unanimously. None of the Members who today say that we do not need a new Constitution, that the Government does not have a mandate to draft a new Constitution voted against that Resolution. They had the opportunity. That Resolution very clearly articulates that a Constitutional Assembly is being set up in order to draft a Constitution for Sri Lanka. As the Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development read out, the whole process is clearly laid out including the fact that under Article 74, Article 75, and Article 83 steps should be taken if the Constitutional Assembly approves the draft with a two-",

It does not say Thirteen plus. It says, \"Full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and building upon it so as to achieve meaningful devolution\". \"Full implementation\", that is what it says. He was repeatedly asked by the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman today, \"Are you then agreeing to the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, the first part of the promise?\" He said, \"Subject to two matters to be discussed.\" But that was not the promise. That is not what is in writing. The two External Affairs Ministers, Prof. G. L. Peiris, who has done a somersault yet again, and S. M. Krishna repeatedly used that phrase. Not just by the two External Affairs Ministers but once by former President His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa himself, together with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh used that. There was no reservation that two matters in the Thirteenth Amendment must be subject to discussion. No. It used the words, \"Full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and going beyond to achieve meaningful devolution.\" Why should you achieve meaningful devolution? The implicit in that statement is, you admit that there are several features in the Thirteenth Amendment that are not meaningful, that are a bar to achieving any meaningful devolution.",

We have submitted 14 points which are very clearly uncompromising, which have been placed before the Steering Committee and the country. Our Members have participated in the Subcommittees as well. Their views have not been totally rejected. They have not been accommodated in the Report, which they have stated openly last week in the public. So, participating and being not considered are two different things. I appreciate what the Hon. Member is saying. We, everyone, have tried; we have tried to convince how to protect the unitary State. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank the Hon. Member for clarifying that position. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Now, wind up please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I will wind up with this. Several Subcommittees had Members of the Joint Opposition. The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya spoke here today. He has signed the Report. That Subcommittee was chaired by a Member of the Joint Opposition. There are several others. In certain Committees they did express reservation, I must say that. But, they said that they will forward their own reports. They were invited to the Steering Committee and they said that they would forward reports. Now, there is a 14-point Memoranda that has been submitted. That is true. That must be discussed. There is no way that that can be put aside. The point that I am making is that before that the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella presented a report in which he even suggested the abolition of the Concurrent List, he later withdrew it - they take different positions at different times. But, he did present a report suggesting the abolition of the Concurrent List. Now, all of this must be discussed. The point that we are making is that this is an exercise in which everyone must engage in together and eventually that must be placed before the people.",
