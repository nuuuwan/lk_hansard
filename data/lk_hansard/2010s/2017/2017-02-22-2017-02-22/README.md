QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE INCREASE OF MINIMUM WAGE PAID TO MIGRANT WORKERS ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, this Question is addressed to the Hon. Minister of Foreign Employment.

Sir, on 06th September, 2016, it was reported by the news website LBO that the Minister of Foreign Employment, Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale, had told a meeting that the Foreign Employment Bureau would increase the minimum wage of migrant workers to US Dollars 300 per month from January, 2017. She was reported as saying that memorandums of understanding - MoUs - had already been signed with several countries to increase the minimum wage. On 19th February, 2017, "The Sunday Times" newspaper reported that, in early February, a circular was issued by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment - SLBFE - to all licensed foreign employment agencies, revising the minimum salary of Sri Lankan migrant workers - US Dollars 350 for unskilled workers and US Dollars 450 for skilled workers per month . This circular had been issued in keeping with a Proposal in the National Budget for 2017.

However, it is learnt that Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale is to submit a Cabinet Paper seeking approval to reverse this proposal, showing the possible repercussions to Sri Lankas economy, if it were to be implemented. It appears that the original Budget decision had been taken by the Treasury without consulting the Ministry of Foreign Employment or the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. Since the circular was issued, the number of Sri Lankans going to the Middle East for work had declined significantly. At present, there are about 1.5 million Sri Lankan migrant workers and they contribute over US Dollars 7.2 billion annually to the economy - the biggest contribution by any sector.

(1) Will the Hon. Minister make a clear statement clarifying this, as it made headlines in "The Sunday Times" newspaper, which the Hon. Minister would have seen, and was reported by all other news agencies?

Will she inform the House -

(a) whether she stands by the circular increasing the minimum wage for migrant workers overseas or whether she is canvassing for a reversal of the circular, which was based on a Budget Proposal approved by the House?

1447 1448

[ ]

2017 22

(b) whether there are any immediate steps being taken to protect the rights of migrant workers under the international conventions that we have pledged to uphold?

(2) If not, why?

Thank you. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Hon. Speaker, the Answer to the Question raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is as follows:

(1) Yes.

(a) As per the Budget Proposal for 2017, the minimum salary of Sri Lankan migrant workers is to be increased, up to US Dollars 350 for unskilled workers and US Dollars 450 for skilled workers per month.

Accordingly, Treasury instructions have been received on 20th January, 2017 to implement this Budget Proposal. Hence, a circular has been issued by the Chairman, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment on 27th January, 2017 to all licensed foreign employment agents to implement this Budget Proposal with effect from 01st February, 2017.

However, most of the labour-receiving countries are not ready for this increased minimum wage of migrant workers. Further, there are many countries which send workers on low salaries, for example, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and some African counties. As a result, there is a possibility of losing job opportunities for Sri Lankans and it will, in turn, have an impact on the overall remittances.

Considering the above, I have proposed to the Cabinet of Ministers to grant a grace period of one year for the implementation of the Budget Proposal.

(b) The UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families of 1990 was ratified by Sri Lanka in 1996.

The following measures have been taken to protect the rights of migrant workers and their families:

Empowering of Migrant Workers:

Training plays a vital role on the empowerment of the migrant workers. The duration of training for domestic workers has been increased from 21 days to 40 days since January, 2016. The new training programme empowers migrant workers with adequate knowledge in housekeeping on par with NVQ Level 3 qualification,

language skills, cultural awareness et cetera. Caregiving programmes were introduced to meet the demand in Israel, Cyprus and European and non-European countries.

Orientation Programmes:

Country-specific programmes are being conducted even for males to enable them to work in different environments.

Safe Migration Programme:

An islandwide proramme called Shramika Surekuma to protect migrant workers and their families is being conducted by the Ministry with the assistance of Development Officers and the SLBFE interacts with the programmes in various welfare and counselling programmes and mobile services. Various awareness programmes are conducted with the cooperation of the Swiss Government - Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation - and the ILO at grass-roots level to make prospective migrant workers aware of safe and regular migration.

Promoting Ethical Recruitment:

A Code of Ethical Conduct has been introduced to licensed recruitment agents and awareness programmes have been conducted for the agents who are scattered throughout the Island. A committee on Complaints has also been established to settle disputes among them. The Conciliation Division attends to any complaints made by migrant workers. In addition, an SDC-IOM - Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation-International Organization for Migrants - funded project was started to promote ethical recruitment.

Workers' welfare:

The SLBFE maintains a Workers' Welfare Fund - WWF - to assist migrant workers. The SLBFE assists migrant workers at pre-departure stage, while in service abroad, on return and in reintegration. Children of migrant workers are assisted with scholarships and other educational and non-educational assistance through the WWF.

Migration and Development:

Returnees are considered a pivotal group in development. The Return and Reintegration National Policy has been introduced recently. Several programmes on reintegration are underway with the assistance of the SDC - Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. The cooperation of all stakeholders are expected to implement the reintegraton programme at the national level.

1449 1450

Regional and global Consultations:

Protection of migrants is being discussed at various forums and several measures have been introduced as their outcomes. At the Colombo Process, the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, of which Sri Lanka holds the Chairmanships, and the Global Forum on Migration and Development, the protection of migrants is being discussed. The Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs - introduced by the UN emphasized the importance of protecting migrants. Accordingly, all labour-sending countries including Sri Lanka and labour-receiving countries implement programmes to protect migrants and their families.

2) Does not arise.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Minister, I would like to have a clarification on two matters. The first one is, the Hon. Minister of Finance presented a Budget Proposal to the House for 2017 fixing a minimum wage for the migrant workers. Based on that, you issued a circular. Hon. Minister, by your Statement made just now, did you accept that that circular cannot be implemented and also that the Budget Proposal cannot be implemented for this year? I just want to get a clarification. Your position is that the Budget Proposal cannot be implemented for this year and that the Circular does not stand valid for 2017. Is that correct? - [Interruption.]

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) I have to tell you because - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I understand your stand. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) It was in 2015 that the present Hon. Minister of Finance introduced this minimum wage for migrant workers. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Right.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) It was US Dollars 300. Just after one year, we are a bit reluctant because of low wages - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Repercussions? ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) So, we have submitted a Cabinet Paper for their information and we are just asking for a little time. That is all. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You just stated that you would - ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Keeping up with the Budget Proposal, the Secretary has issued the Circular on the instructions of the Treasury. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, the Budget Proposal in simple language- ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) There are two more Questions to be taken up. So, you will have to - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, this is an important matter. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I understand that. That is why I allowed you. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) These migrant workers contribute over US Dollars 7.4 billion to the economy. The Hon. Minister of Finance proposed something in his Budget for 2017 and the Hon. Minister in her Answer says that it cannot be implemented for 2017 and she is asking for time. Is it okay?

1451 1452

[ ]

2017 22

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is right. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Yes, that is my answer. It is very clear. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That is all I am asking.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) She said she wants time. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That means, the House had approved a proposal, but it had not been implemented. A Budget Proposal concerning the biggest foreign exchange earner of the country has been withdrawn. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) We are not going to withdraw that. We have already- ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You are not going to withdraw it? ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) No, no. I am not going to withdraw it. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I respect the Hon. Fair Minister. But, the Finance Minister has misled the House.

The second issue is in relation to the ILO Conventions. There are some Conventions that have been signed over the last few years, but those have not been implemented. May I request the Hon. Minister to see that the ILO Conventions are implemented. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. Next, the Hon. Douglas Devananda please.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , " " . . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . CURRENT STATUS OF THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS [2.40p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We are starting this Adjournment Debate half-an-hour behind time. Might I suggest that in case Hon. Members want to speak, you might have to sit a little beyond 7.00 p.m. to be able to accommodate the Hon. Members because we are already 35 minutes or 40 minutes behind schedule? I leave that to you, Sir.

I will now read my Adjournment Motion which is as follows:

All people who lived in Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion, or any other difference, whether Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim or Burgher made their fullest contribution to the achievement of independence.

It is almost 70 years since Sri Lanka attained Independence from Colonial Rule.

Ethnic strife had plagued the country from shortly after it attained Independence.

Pacts entered into between Prime Ministers and the Tamil Political Leadership to help resolve such ethnic strife and enable all citizens to live together in peace and amity, with equality and justice were not fulfilled by the ruling elite.

As a result of such ethnic strife and ethnic violence against the Tamil people in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and thereafter, up to 50 per cent of the Sri Lankan Tamil population were compelled to leave their own country largely on grounds of insecurity and take up residence in different countries the world over. Tens of thousands of Tamil families have consequently been divided. It is

1467 1468

[ ]

2017 22

relevant to point out that ethnic violence was unleashed against the Tamil people when they made political demands that would enable them to live as equal citizens in the country.

Recurrence of violence would result in more Tamils fleeing the country.

Ethnic violence against Tamils is an imminent danger unless and until there is a political resolution of the conflict.

An armed conflict emerged. Tamil youth waged a war against the Sri Lankan State for more than 25 years. It is more than seven years since the armed conflict came to an end. During this armed conflict much suffering was endured by all people in all parts of the country. Such armed conflict by Tamil youth emerged only after several decades of ethnic violence against the Tamil people.

The conflict was also internationalized and the issue has been in the international domain. Several Resolutions were adopted at the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Resolution adopted in October 2015 comes up for review in February/March 2017.

Our neighbour and parent country India offered its good offices to resolve the issue which Sri Lanka accepted in 1983. An Indo-Sri Lanka agreement was signed on 29th July 1987 between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and President J. R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka which laid down vital contours for a political resolution.

There were also several domestic efforts to finally resolve the conflict. These efforts were made after the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution as the same was found to be inadequate and unworkable.

During President R. Premadasas term the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee Proposals, during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas term the proposals she made in 1995, 1997 and the proposals tabled as a Bill in Parliament in August 2000, the Oslo Communique and the Tokyo Communique during the Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghes term as Prime Minister and the speech delivered by President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Inaugural Meeting of the All Party Representatives Committee (APRC) and the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee (MEEC) appointed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the reports of the said All Party Representative Committee and the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee, all these processes took the proposals for sharing power much beyond the scope of the Thirteenth Amendment." ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! At this stage, the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will take the Chair. , [ ] . , , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELVAM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You may continue with your speech, Hon. Sampanthan. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

"With the assumption of the office of the new Government, Parliament has constituted itself as a Constitutional Assembly, a Steering Committee comprising of representatives of all political parties in Parliament has been appointed under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Prime Minister, various Subcommittees representing different political parties have been appointed and work is in progress for the evolution of a Constitution to resolve the conflict within a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka with the maximum possible consensus.

The Resolution for the appointment of Constitutional Assembly adopted by Parliament inter-alia states:

Whereas there is broad agreement among the people of Sri Lanka that it is necessary to enact a Constitution for Sri Lanka.

It further states :

(1) This Parliament resolves that :

There shall be a Committee which shall have the powers of the Committee of the whole Parliament consisting of Members of Parliament for the purpose of deliberating and seeking the advice and views of the people on a Constitution for Sri Lanka and

(2) Preparing a draft of a Constitutional Bill for the consideration of Parliament in the exercise of its powers under Article 75 of the Constitution.

It further states

(3) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby further declared that a Constitution Bill shall only be enacted into Law if it is passed in Parliament by a special majority of two thirds of the whole number of the Members of Parliament including those not present and subsequently approved by the people at a Referendum as required by Article 83 of the Constitution.

The current 1978 Constitution did not have such consensus, nor did the 1972 first Republican Constitution, have such consensus. The failure to evolve a Constitution based on such consensus has been the reason for the failure of such Constitutions.

Issues relating to transitional justice in respect of which resolutions have been adopted at the Human Right Council also need to be addressed. These too are issues of urgent public importance in respect of which the country needs to be kept informed. It is estimated that over one hundred and fifty thousand Tamils were killed as a result of the conflict and that recurrence of violence could result in more Tamil people being killed and more Tamil people fleeing the country.

While we on our part will extend the maximum co-operation to the satisfactory conclusion of these processes and to the non-recurrence of violence, it is absolutely essential that these processes be taken forward in a genuine and purposeful manner, so as to ensure permanent peace with justice and equality to all citizens. It is fundamental that all extend their co-operation to enable the successful conclusion of these processes.

I would submit with respect that this is a matter of urgent public importance, and that is the reason for raising this matter today in the House at Adjournment, to enable the whole country to be kept informed of the truth in regard to the processes and everything relating thereto. "

That Sir, is the Motion that I have placed before the House. You will permit me to say a few words in regard to the purpose of this Motion.

Ever since the enactment of the 1978 Constitution there has been a clamour for the enactment of a new Constitution. That is because there was no consensus in

1469 1470

the making of the 1978 Constitution. It was the same with the 1972 First Republican Constitution. There was no consensus in regard to that either. Parties in power which were able to muster the required two-thirds majority framed the Constitution as the party wished. They were not interested in evolving a consensus. The country has become wiser; I hope that political parties have become wiser - I am inclined to think they have. Over a period of time, particularly, after the ethnic holocaust of 1983, there have been efforts at making a new Constitution. Now that this august Assembly has been converted into a Constitutional Assembly and we are engaged in the Constitution-making process, I think it would be relevant and also important to refer to and also place on record some of the features relating to the earlier efforts at Constitution-making.

There have been entirely domestic efforts under different Heads of Government. There have been efforts with international involvement. We accepted the role of international players, our neighbour India, the Co-Chairs, the United Nations, and these features would be extremely important and useful to us in our current Constitution-making process. I think in the interest of the country all these features should be made public. I will not make any reference whatever to any matter relating to the current process. That is a matter that is within the realm of the Steering Committee and the Constitutional Assembly and I will not trespass into that field, because those matters will, in due course, be dealt with in the appropriate place.

Sir, I would first refer to the features in the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact signed in 1957 between Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and the Tamil Leader, Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. It stated under "Joint Statement by the Prime Minister and Representatives of the Federal Party on Regional Councils", I quote:

'(A) Regional areas to be defined in the Bill itself by embodying them in a schedule thereto.

'(B) That the Northern Province is to form one Regional area whilst the Eastern Province is to be divided into two or more regional areas.

'(C) Provision is to be made in the Bill to enable two or more regions to amalgamate even beyond provincial limits; and for one region to divide itself subject to ratification by Parliament. Further provision is to be made in the Bill for two or more regions to collaborate for specific purposes of common interests."

The next point of importance in the Pact, under "Colonisation Schemes", states, I quote:

" '(F) It was agreed that in the matter of colonization schemes the powers of the Regional Councils shall include the power to select allottees to whom lands within their area of authority shall be alienated and also power to select personnel to be employed for work on such schemes. The position regarding the area at present administered by the Gal Oya Board in this matter requires consideration."

That is the area, Sir, that is now comprised of the Ampara Electorate in the Ampara District.

The next document I want to refer to, Sir, is the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact signed between Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and the Tamil Leader, Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam in 1965. Under that, in the case of colonization, the District Councils would see that landless people in the district get priority over others. The second preference would be Tamil-speaking people of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. Finally, even in considering deserving cases from outside of the North-East, Tamils would get priority over others. Those were the three provisions that would guide the alienation of State land in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. This was the recognition of the territorial identity of the Tamil-speaking people of the Island.

The next document of importance, Sir, is the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 29th July, 1987 signed between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and President J.R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka. The important features of the Agreement are as follows, I quote:

"1.1 desiring to preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka;

1.2 acknowledging that Sri Lanka is a 'multi-ethnic and a multi-lingual plural society' consisting, inter alia,of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims (Moors) and Burghers;

1.3 recognizing that each ethnic group has a distinct cultural and linguistic identity which has to be carefully nurtured;

1.4 also recognizing that the Northern and the Eastern Provinces have been areas of historical habitation of Sri Lankan Tamil-speaking peoples, who have at all times hitherto lived together in this territory with other ethnic groups;

1.5 conscious of the necessity of strengthening the forces contributing to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka, and preserving its character as a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious plural society in which all citizens can live in equality, safety and harmony, and prosper and fulfil their aspirations;

Sir, it further went on to state, I quote:

2.2 During the period, which shall be considered an interim period (i.e. from the date of the elections to the Provincial Council, as specified in para 2.8 to the date of the referendum as specified in para 2.3), the Northern and Eastern Provinces as now constituted, will form one administrative unit, having one elected Provincial Council. Such a unit will have one Governor, one Chief Minister and one Board of Ministers.

So, under the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, Sir, there was provision made for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces to be amalgamated as one unit of devolution with one Governor, one Chief Minister and one Board of Ministers. That was done and that merger was maintained for 18 years. Budgetary provision was made in every Budget for the merged North-Eastern Unit until a recent Judgment of the Supreme Court, which claimed that there was a procedural flaw in regard to the matter of merger, and the merger was consequently suspended.

Sir, the next document of importance that I would like to place before you is the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee Proposals during the time of His Excellency R. Premadasa as President. The Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe was a leading Hon. Member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, but President Premadasa made him Chairman of that Select Committee. His Select Committee recommended, I quote:

1471 1472

[ ]

2017 22

1. That there be two units, one for the North and one for the East.

2. That devolution of power be on the lines of the Indian Constitution.

3. That the Concurrent List in the current Constitution (introduced by the Thirteenth Amendment) be reduced substantially or done away with completely. The majority agreed with the idea that more powers should be devolved to the provinces. "

It also stated, I quote:

The majority, consisting of representatives from the SLFP, the UNP, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL), the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) and two independent Tamil and Muslim Members of Parliament.

So, Sir, that was the view of the majority of the Members who were in the Parliamentary Select Committee and there was consensus around those proposals. They went on to further recommend, Sir, that there should be an Apex Council and proposed as follows:

1. There will be two separate Provincial Councils for the North and East.

2. Each Provincial Council will have an Executive Minister who will also head the Board of Ministers.

3. There will be a Regional Council for the entire North-East region and the Regional Council shall be constituted by the two elected Provincial Councils.

4. When the two Provincial Councils meet together on matters pertaining to the entire region they shall constitute themselves as the Regional Council.

5. The Regional Council will be headed by a Chief Minister for the entire region and the two Executive Ministers will each year function alternatively as Chief Minister.

6. When the two Provincial Boards of Ministers meet on matters pertaining to the entire region they shall be known as the Regional Board of Ministers.

7. There will be a Regional List and a Provincial List and legislative functions may be exercised by the Regional Council for the region with respect to those functions in the Regional List.

8. The Provincial List will contain matters such as land, finance, law and order and the Regional List will apply to matters such as planning and economic development.

9. There will be a single Governor for the region and the rights of minorities will be guaranteed by the constitution.

10. Where legislation is passed by the Regional Council it shall not have a bearing on the Provinces till it is approved by the relevant Provincial Council.

So, you will see Sir, that what the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee recommended was an Apex Council comprising of the Northern and Eastern Provinces to be in a position to deal with certain matters that were of great concern to both the North and the East.

The next important step was the proposals of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 1995, 1997 and the draft Constitution Bill that was presented to Parliament in August 2000. The Bill was presented to Parliament by the former Minister of Justice, Constitutional Affairs, Ethnic Affairs and National Integration and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning. I have got a copy of the Bill in my hand and this learned gentleman who presented the Bill to Parliament was no other than Prof. G. L. Peiris. He presented, as the Minister

of Constitutional Affairs in the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Government, this set of proposals to Parliament as being the proposals of his Government. He had them approved in Cabinet. Both our present President, President Maithripala Sirisena and our former President, President Mahinda Rajapaksa approved the Bill in Cabinet. The Bill was brought to Parliament with the approval of both of them. They both were Ministers in the Cabinet of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. No one said anything to the contrary when the Bill was brought to Parliament. It is well known that the 2000 proposals were a very progressive step in the Constitution-making exercise and I think anyone engaged in the current process should be educated in regard to what this contained. The proposals were drafted primarily by Prof. G. L. Peiris who was the Minister for Constitutional Affairs and by the late Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, also a constitutional expert in his own right who had assisted in drafting many constitutions the world over in many countries that recently became independent.

I, Sir, as a Member of Parliament used to be in constant touch with him at that point of time. So, they were the two persons who mainly drafted the Bill. Very unfortunately, a consensus that had emerged between the two main parties in regard to that Bill was finally lost as a result of some bickering. Whatever Prof. G.L. Peiris may be saying now, he must accept that it was a Bill presented by him to Parliament on behalf of the Government of which he was the Minister of Constitutional Affairs and that this Bill indicates that this country had been willing to take this process forward in a meaningful way.

The next document Sir, I want to refer to is the Oslo Communique issued at the third session of Peace Talks held from 2nd to 5th December 2002 where again Prof. G.L. Peiris was the chief delegate on behalf of his Government. I would like to quote what the Oslo Communiqu contains: Responding to a proposal by the leadership of the LTTE, the parties agreed to explore a solution founded on the principle of internal self-determination in areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people, based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka. The parties acknowledged that the solution had to be acceptable to all communities. Guided by this objective, the parties agreed to initiate discussions on substantive political issues such as, but not limited to: Power-sharing between the centre and the region, as well as within the centre; Geographical region; Human Rights Protection; Political and administrative mechanisms; Public finance; Law and order.

So, there was an agreement in terms of which the parties, based upon the principle of internal self-determination, agreed to explore a federal solution in the areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-peaking people within the framework of a united, undivided Sri Lanka.

Now Sir, Prof. G.L. Peiris addressed a press conference. I am quoting Sir, from the transcript of the press conference held at the conclusion of the third session of the first round of Peace Talks held in Oslo which Prof. Peiris addressed. What did he say? I quote from this press conference because I want this country to know what Prof. Peiris said in Oslo compared to what he

1473 1474

is saying now. He said Sir, and I quote from the transcript of the press conference.

The LTTE is no longer insisting on a separate State but is looking at a different concept in earnest and that is internal self-determination. And he went on to explain what he meant. This was power sharing, extensive power sharing within the framework of one country. No question of secession, no question of separation but power sharing within the framework of one country.

That was the point of departure. They are now talking of power sharing within one country. So, Prof. Peiris was completely supportive of the Oslo Communiqu. In the press conference he addressed, he stated that the LTTE had changed their position from separation to power sharing within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka. That is what we want. That is what we are asking now. What we are asking now is for extensive power sharing within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka to ensure that Sri Lanka is undivided and indivisible - indivisible in perpetuity. You can have whatever you want in the Constitution. So, that was Prof. Peiris, Sir, at his press conference in Oslo after being a party to the Oslo Communiqu. What credence can be attached, Sir, to what Prof. Peiris now says, in the context of his being the author of the 2000 August Proposals which he himself tabled in Parliament on behalf of his government and in the context of his position at Oslo and what he stated in the press conference. What credence can be attached to what Prof. Peiris has to say now and he is saying a lot of things; he is saying many things.

Now, Sir, from Prof. Peiris, I will move on to President Mahinda Rajapaksa. President Mahinda Rajapaksa also has said very interesting things when he was President and I think the country needs to know about it. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sir, addressed the inaugural Meeting of the All Party Representative Committee and the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee he appointed after he became President on the 11th of July 2006. He made a very important speech to these two bodies; the APRC and the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee which comprised of twelve Sinhalese, four Tamils and one Muslim. There were 17 Members on the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee comprising of twelve Sinhalese, four Tamils and one Muslim. He addressed that Committee and this is what he said:

I am quoting, Sir, from what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said to that body comprising of All Party Representative Committee and the Mutli Ethnic Experts Committee. Addressing the gathering, under the caption Unity, Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty, this is what President Rajapaksa said:

The unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country must be preserved. This cannot be open to bargain. Our approach has been widely endorsed by the international community, notably India and the Co-chairs have clearly stated and have clearly ruled out any form of division of this country. Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka

What he laid emphasis on was, a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka and he said: Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka. Each party represented here has its own solutions to the national question. We will discuss and synthesize these different approaches and develop our own Sri Lankan model. We must explore past attempts from the Bandaranaike - Chelvanayakam Pact onwards. We must draw appropriate lessons from the experience of other countries.

Look at the constitutions of the other countries. He further stated, I quote: I will not impose a solution on the country. But, you will through your developments, through your deliberations provide a solution to the national question.

His speech next dealt with the point relating to Devolution for the People by the People and this is what he said:

People in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time. In addition, it is axiomatic that devolution also needs to address issues relating to identity as well as security and socio-economic advancement without over-reliance on the Centre. In this regard, it is also important to address the question of regional minorities.

So, this is what he said. The people must take charge of their destiny in the areas in which they live. They must be able to address the issues relating to their identity, in regard to their security, in regard to the socio-economic advancement. What more would you want?

Sir, then, I quote from the third point he addressed under the heading, Some Concluding Thoughts:

Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution.....

These are President Mahinda Rajapaksas own words. I further quote: Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution without sacrificing the sovereignty of the country. Given the ground situation, given the background to the conflict, it therefore behoves on particularly the majority community to be proactive in striving for peace and there must be a demonstration of a well-stretched hand of accommodation.

He wanted the majority community to stretch out their hands and accommodate the minorities. That is what he said. I further quote: Any solution must therefore address these expectations as well. The role of the All Party Representative Committee, as well as the Panel of Experts is to fashion creative options and satisfy the minimum expectations that I had enumerated earlier as well as provide a comprehensive approach to the resolution of the national question.

He wanted the APRC and the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee to provide for maximum possible devolution. This is President Mahinda Rajapaksas own speech. I

1475 1476

would have very much wished his being here, but unfortunately he is not here and none of the Joint Opposition Members are here; they, probably, do not want to listen to these things being said and they must have known that these things will be said. So, Sir, that was the President Mahinda Rajapaksas position. Can anything be clearer, Sir? Can anything be more lucid than what the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said in regard to what a new Constitution should have? A solution based on what he has said would be the end of the matter.

The former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also came to an agreement with the Secretary-General of the UN, when the Secretary-General of the UN came to Sri Lanka on the 23rd of May, 2009, just after the war came to an end. A few days thereafter, they had a discussion. After that discussion, they issued a joint statement. I am now reading from the Joint Statement. I quote:

President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General agreed that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socio-economic development. President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

That was his position Sir, in the Joint Statement he made with the Secretary-General on the 23rd of May, 2009.

The international community has also been involved, Sir, and they have also been making several statements which I would like to place before the House because it is important that the House is aware of the role played by the international community.

India has played a crucial role, Sir. India has been in touch with the Government, particularly with the Rajapaksa Government. I am now going to quote from statements made by the international community, particularly India and the Co-Chairs during the President Rajapaksas regime in regard to what should be the basis of a political solution. I will deal, Sir, particularly with the period when President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the President.

In November, 2006 Sir, Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon arrived in Sri Lanka and met with President Rajapaksa. He told President Mahinda Rajapaksa, India looks forward to an early 'comprehensive political settlement' of the ethnic issue. It must take into account the aspirations of all sections, including the Tamils. At that meeting, President Rajapaksa gave details of the work being done by the All Party Conference and the Multi-Ethnic Committee of Experts to provide a framework for the resolution of the ethnic problem. President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave Mr. Menon a Report in regard to the work of the APRC and the Multi-Ethnic Committee of Experts. I have already referred to the APRC and the Multi-Ethnic Committee of

Experts, Sir. Their Reports are in the public domain; their Reports are available and their Reports are very much in tune with what the ex-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said in her Constitutional Proposals in August, 2000. So, that was President Rajapaksas position to Mr. Shivshankar Menon. Mr. Basil Rajapaksa went to India in October, 2008. After the talks with the Indian Government, there was a statement issued.

He said, I quote:

Both sides discussed the need to move towards a peacefully negotiated political settlement in the island including the North. Both sides agreed that terrorism should be countered with resolve. The Indian side called for implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and greater devolution of powers to the provinces. Mr. Basil Rajapaksa emphasized that the President of Sri Lanka and his Government were firmly committed to a political process that should lead to a sustainable solution.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sir, in November 2008, having met the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, told the Rajya Sabha that he had a meeting with President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the bulk of the meeting was focused on the plight of Sri Lankan Tamil people. I am quoting what the Dr. Manmohan Singh said:

We are deeply concerned. I explained to him (Rajapaksa) that we have legitimate concern about the welfare of Sri Lankan Tamils. It has a bearing on Sri Lankas relations with India.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also informed President Rajapaksa that Colombo has to create conditions for meeting legitimate political aspirations of the Tamils under the devolution package. That was a statement made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, after he had a discussion with President Rajapaksa.

Then again, Sir, Prof. G.L. Peiris, in his capacity as the Minister of External Affairs, went to India in May, 2011. He was in India from 15th to 17th of May, 2011 and there was a statement made. I quote:

Both sides agreed that the end of armed conflict in Sri Lanka created a historic opportunity to address all outstanding issues in a spirit of understanding and mutual accommodation imbued with political vision to work towards genuine national reconciliation.

In this context, the External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties.

A devolution package building upon the 13th Amendment would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation.

That was the statement of Prof. G.L. Peiris when he went to India.

Then, Sir, in June 2011, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh again referred to this matter. There was a question

1477 1478

and answer session and he was asked a question in regard to Indias neighbours and this is what he said. I quote:

You have a situation in Sri Lanka. The decimation of the LTTE was something which is good. But the Tamil problem does not disappear, with the defeat of the LTTE. The Tamil population has legitimate grievances. They feel they are reduced to second-class citizens. And our emphasis has been to persuade the Sri Lankan Government that we must move towards a new system of institutional reforms, where the Tamil people will have a feeling that they are equal citizens of Sri Lanka, and they can lead a life of dignity and self-respect. It is not easy. Within Sri Lankas population, there are hotheads. The Sinhala-chauvinism is a reality. But we have to find a difficult balance because what happens in Sri Lanka has a domestic dimension .....

That was Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement in June 2011.

Sir, Foreign Minister of India, S.M. Krishna said in the Lok Sabha in a Suo Motu Statement on 4th August 2011, I quote : The Government has also articulated its position that the end of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka created a historic opportunity to address all outstanding issues relating to minority communities in Sri Lanka including Tamils. The Joint Press Release of May 17, 2011 states that all such outstanding issues had to be settled in a spirit of understanding and mutual accommodation imbued with political vision to work towards genuine national reconciliation. The External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties and that a devolution package building upon the 13th Amendment, would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation. The Prime Minister observed recently that the Tamil population in Sri Lanka had legitimate grievances and our emphasis had been to persuade the Sri Lankan Government that we must move towards a new system of institutional reforms where the Tamil people will have a feeling that they are equal citizens of Sri Lanka and they can lead a life of dignity and self-respect. That is our outlook towards this issue. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sampanthan, you have five more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) My party has got time, Sir. I will take time of my party Members. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I want to place some of these things on record, Sir because some of these things are not known. I want this matter be on record.

Then, Sir, there was a statement made by a spokesman on behalf of India after the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission was released and that statement was made on 25th December, 2011. This is what he said, I quote: In this context, we have been assured by the Government of Sri Lanka on several occasions in the past, of its commitment towards pursuit of a political process, through a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil National Alliance leading to the full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, and to go beyond so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers and genuine national reconciliation. We hope that the Government of Sri Lanka recognizing the critical importance of this issue acts decisively and with vision in this regard. We will remain engaged with them through this process and offer our support in the spirit of partnership.

Thereafter, Sir, the Foreign Minister of India was in Sri Lanka. There was a statement made by him in the presence of the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka. The Foreign Minister was here from the 16th to 19th January 2012 and what he said was this. I quote:

The Government of Sri Lanka has on many occasions conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based upon the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution and building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers. We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process. We believe that continuation of the dialogue between the Government and the TNA would pave the way for a political settlement including under the rubric of the Parliamentary Select Committee.

Then again, Sir, The Hindu of the 20th March of 2012 reported what the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh said in the Lok Sabha, I quote:

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced on Monday that India was inclined to vote in favour of a resolution on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka at the ongoing 19th session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.

He further went on to say: That, we hope, will advance our objective, namely the achievement of the future for the Tamil community in Sri Lanka that is marked by equality, dignity, justice and self-respect.

So, the hope of the Indian Prime Minister was that India's support for the Resolution would result in the achievement of its objective that India had towards achieving an equal status for the Tamil people in Sri Lanka while persuading the Sri Lankan Government to do the right thing.

Sir, an article that appeared in The New Sunday Express of 24th June, 2012 has stated, I quote:

The Prime Minister once again underlined the great importance we attach in India to the ability of the Tamil people to lead a life of dignity and as equal citizens of that country, Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai told reporters at Rio de Janeiro.

1479 1480

[ ]

2017 22

So, this is the position. Sir, in regard to the Indian initiative, I would now deal with what National Security Adviser, Shivshankar Menon said in his final visit to Sri Lanka. This article appeared in The Hindu on 30th June, 2012. I quote:

The hopes of Tamils could only be accommodated through a political process. This was an internal political process. We have to also look at that. It is a process that has ramifications for all of us. And it is not something that started yesterday or today or a few years ago.

It started 60 years ago, and India knows about it. The article further states, I quote: I have told you what we would like: a united Sri Lanka, within which all communities feel they are in control of their own destiny, and they are satisfied.

I desire, Sir, to place these matters on record because, I think, the country should know that we have gone through a long process even with our neighbhour India playing a vital role over several years to resolve this issue and that we have not yet reached our goal, which has been "finding an acceptable political solution within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka". India has firmly reiterated her commitment to the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka, but with the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution of power to enable the people of the North and the East, the Tamil speaking people to live with dignity and self-respect and be in a position to control their own destiny in regard to matters of vital concern to them in the area in which they live.

I move on to, Sir, what the Co-chairs had to say. Co-chairs also played an important role in Sri Lanka. The Co-chairs comprised of the European Union, Norway, Japan and the United States. This is what the Co-chairs had said on the 30th of May 2006. Sir, I quote from what the Co-chairs had said about the political settlement and about Sri Lanka:

It must show that it is ready to make the dramatic political changes to bring about a new system of governance which will enhance the rights of all Sri Lankans, including the Muslims. The international community will support such steps: failure to take such steps will diminish international support.

The Co-chairs went on to say, I quote:

The Tamil and Muslim peoples of Sri Lanka have justified and substantial grievances that have not yet been adequately addressed.

That is what they said. Now, I quote from what the US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Mr. Richard A. Boucher, said on the 01st of June, 2006 during one of his visits to Sri Lanka:

"We also think the government should provide a positive vision to Tamils and Muslims of a future Sri Lanka where their legitimate grievances are addressed and their security assured. President Rajapaksa has spoken of "maximum devolution." Previous negotiations have agreed on "internal selfdetermination" within a federal framework. However the

idea is expressed, it could offer hope to many in the North and East that they will have control over their own lives and destinies within a single nation of Sri Lanka.

The Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Boucher, went on to say, I quote: "Although we reject the methods that the Tamil Tigers have used, there are legitimate issues that are raised by the Tamil community and they have a very legitimate desire, as anybody would, to be able to control their own lives, to rule their own destinies and to govern themselves in their homeland, in the areas theyve traditionally inhabited.

That is what the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Boucher said. So, you have India on the one hand and the the Co-chairs on the other hand - European Union, Norway, Japan, US. US itself coming up with these things. Sir, this is why I say that these are matters not manufactured by someones imagination; these are grievances which the Tamil people have gone through and entertained for a long time.

Before I finish up this point, I would like to read what Prime Minister Narendra Modi said when he addressed this House on 13th of March 2015. I quote the Hansard of 13th March 2015. It states, I quote: Sri Lanka's progress and prosperity are also a source of strength for India. So, Sri Lanka's success is of great significance to India and as a friend, our good wishes, our support and solidarity have always been with Sri Lanka and it will always be there for you. For all of us in our region, our success depends on how we define ourselves as a nation. All of us in this region, indeed every nation of diversity, have dealt with the issues of identities and inclusion, rights and claims, dignity and opportunity for different sections of our societies. We all have seen its diverse expressions. We have faced tragic violence; we have encountered brutal terrorism and we have also seen successful examples of peaceful settlements. Each of us has sought to address these complex issues in our own way. However, we choose to reconcile them. To me, something is obvious: diversity can be a source of strength for nations. When we accommodate the aspirations of all sections of our society, the nation gets the strength of every individual. And, when we empower states, districts and villages, we make our country stronger and stronger. You can call this, my bias. I have been a Chief Minister for 13 years; a Prime Minister, for less than a year! Today, my top priority is to make the States in India stronger. I am a firm believer in cooperative federalism. So, we are devolving more power and more resources to the States and we are making them formal partners in national decision- making processes. Sri Lanka has lived through decades of tragic violence and conflict. You have successfully defeated terrorism and brought the conflict to an end. You now stand at a moment of historic opportunity to win the hearts and heal the wounds across all sections of society. Recent elections in Sri Lanka have reflected the collective voice of the nation: the hope for change, reconciliation and unity. The steps that you have taken in recent times are bold and admirable. They represent a new beginning. I am confident of a future for Sri Lanka defined by unity and integrity, peace and harmony and opportunity and dignity for everyone. I believe in Sri Lankas ability to achieve it. It is rooted in our common civilizational heritage. The path ahead is a choice that Sri Lanka has to make and it is a collective responsibility of all sections of the society and of all political streams in the country. But, I can assure you of this: for India, the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka are paramount. It

1481 1482

is rooted in our interest. It stems from our own fundamental beliefs in this principle.

What more do you want? The Prime Minister of India comes to Sri Lanka and he addresses our Parliament and this is what he says on this question of a political solution. So, before I conclude I would like to read from the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council recently. It welcomes the commitments of the Government of Sri Lanka to the devolution of political authority and paragraph 16 of the Resolution adopted in October, 2015 states, I quote:

16. Welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to a political settlement by taking the necessary constitutional measures, encourages the Governments efforts to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population;.

It welcomes your commitment to take the necessary Constitutional measures to a political settlement by taking steps for the devolution of political authority which is integral to reconciliation and full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population.

They go on to encourage you to ensure that for the present, in the immediate context, all the provincial councils are able to operate effectively in accordance with the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. So, you have made a commitment to the UN Human Rights Council that you will take the necessary constitutional measures to meaningfully devolve political authority to regions and to other people.

Sir, I quoted from; what had been said by India in regard to Sri Lankas political problems, the reaction of the Sri Lankan Government to what India has stated, what the Co-Chairs have stated, what the US has stated and what has been stated at the UN. I put on record all these matters for the reason that we are currently engaged in a Constitutional process and I want everyone to know that this is not something which started yesterday or day before, but that this is something which started 70 years ago, shortly after the country attained independence. These statements indicate the concerns of the international community.

The new Government has taken some initial steps. There are different expectations after this Government came into power. Those steps need to be continued in a genuine and purposeful manner. We need to have the cooperation of everyone to make this effort successful.

I do not think Sir, the national question can remain unresolved any longer. I do not think it will be good for this country. In the context of the matter having been internationalized and different statements having been made by different people, I do not think we can go into a situation where there can be recurrence of violence, more Tamils being killed and more Tamils fleeing the country. It is not going to be acceptable to anyone. We are

prepared to resolve the matter within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka on the basis of our self-respect and dignity being restored, on the basis of our being able to determine our destiny in the territory in which we have lived. We, therefore, call upon the Government to bear this fact in mind. Ever since the country attained independence, consequent to the violence unleashed against the Tamil people around 1,500,000 Tamils have fled this country and at least, 150,000 Tamils have been killed. Of course, soldiers have died, our combatants have died and other civilians have died. We accept all that. That is because there was violence. That is because there was an armed conflict and there was an armed conflict for the reason that the matter was not politically resolved. If the matter had been politically resolved, there would have been no armed conflict.

Therefore Sir, in the context of all these matters, I think

we should resolve to put an end to this matter.

I was going to speak at length in regard to the implementation of the Resolution of the Human Rights Council, but I do not think I will do that because I do not have enough time and I have already taken a fair amount of time.

But, I will say a few things on the question of lands, on the question of missing persons, on the question of prisoners, on the question of truth and reconciliation, on the question of reparation, on the question of the Office of Missing Persons and on the question of non-recurrence.

These are fundamental elements in the transitional justice process which needs to be addressed, which have to be addressed. Our people are disappointed. Let me be frank. Our people had the expectation that they would be treated differently by this Government and not be ill-treated in the same way that the former Government ill-treated them. But the people have begun to raise the question as to whether this Government is dealing with them any differently from the previous Government.

It is true that you have released some lands both in the North and the East but much more needs to be done. The Armed Forces do not seem to be prepared to release lands. That is a fact that we have to face.

I got a fax in the morning today. People are protesting at Keppapilavu and Pilakudiyiruppu. Even today they are fasting with their wives and children because they want to get back their land, land that they owned. We want some commitment from you. This must be resolved.

The Army thinks, well these lands were held by the LTTE and the Tamil people did not protest against it at that point of time and why are they protesting now. You cannot say that. You are not the LTTE. The LTTE were young armed rebels. They came and occupied our land.

1483 1484

We had no choice but to hand it over to them. But you are a civilized Government. You are a democratic Government. You are a Government with an international status. You have got to safeguard your international status. You cannot behave in the same way in which the LTTE behaved. They probably think, why should we return lands to Tamil civilians because Tamil civilians want to convict us of war crimes.

Let me say this very frankly. We do not think that every soldier is a war criminal. There may have been certain methods adopted in the prosecution of the war which may have been in violation of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Persons responsible for such conduct would be at a different level, would be at a command level and not at the level of the ordinary soldier. There may have been soldiers who had committed individual crimes like murder, like rape. If they can be identified and if they can be prosecuted, they must be identified and prosecuted. After all when the JVP insurrection took place in the early 1970s that girl, Beatrice Manamperi was raped by some soldiers. Am I right Bimal? They were identified and convicted. That was the right thing to do. So if there are soldiers who have committed such wrongs, they may have to face the consequences. But a soldier who fought the war on behalf of the Government, on behalf of the State was carrying out the instructions of his Government. He was doing nothing more. I do not see how he can be prosecuted.

This bad blood between the soldiers and the Tamil population must come to an end. There was a time when Tamils could not be recruited to the Sri Lankan armed forces. There was a time when they could not expect the Government to do that but now things are changing. Your armed forces must acquire a different complexion. They cannot be entirely and exclusively or even preponderantly Sinhala only. They must have Tamils. They must have Muslims. Sir Kandiah Vaithyanathan was the first Permanent Secretary of Defence and Foreign Affairs when Hon. D. S. Senanayake was Prime Minister. He was an excellent civil servant. Anton Muttukumaru was the Commander of the Army. Rajan Kadirgamar was a Commander of the Navy.

They were excellent officials who did an excellent job of work. So, this bad blood between the Tamil people and the Sri Lankan soldiers, Sri Lankan Armed Forces must come to an end. We are now moving into a different era. We must have more Muslims in the Armed Forces, we must have more Tamils in the Armed Forces and we must be able to look upon our Armed Forces with pride.

Now look. On the question of missing persons, there were a large number of missing soldiers. But, we do not see their families protesting that their husbands or sons are missing. You have probably resolved that. You have talked to them. There has been some reparation, some solace, some conciliation and they have accepted their destiny and there is calm. That is not available to our people. Our people must feel that the Government has in some way responded to this question, that there is an inquiry, a decision has been taken, the truth has been

ascertained, and there has been some reparation, some reconciliation, some solace. There must be such processes which give the people a feeling of some satisfaction, may not be complete satisfaction, some satisfaction, but that is not there. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) The Government is very insensitive on the question of land. Lands must be returned to the people. You are cultivating my land with fruits, vegetables, and crops and selling them in the market at competitive prices. How can this go on? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I feel very strongly for the people who were demonstrating. We have only refrained from participating in some demonstrations for the reason- ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, your time is over. Please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) .

I am not participating in these demonstrations because I feel that we must not play into the hands of others who want to disturb the whole process. We want the country to be stable; we want the country to be calm. But, our people are complaining; our people are suffering. My Friend Mr. Sumanthiran has been accused of being traitorous by some Tamil Leaders who have been resoundingly rejected at the last Parliamentary Elections, some persons whose party polled around 15,000 votes. Mr. Sumanthiran got four times that number of votes in Jaffna. I have got the particulars with me. That whole party did not poll 15,000 votes. Mr. Sumanthiran polled four times that vote by himself - preference votes. Today, he is being called a traitor because he is working with the Government. We look upon Mr. Sumanthiran as a very useful Member of Parliament performing valuable service on behalf of the people, and we want that to be recognized. But, he is being attacked. He is being attacked because these persons who were resoundingly rejected by the people in 2015 are using your failure to do what you must do by the people as the ground for attacking people like Mr. Sumanthiran and me and others too, even Mr. Senathirajah.

1485 1486

This cannot continue. This must come to an end. Your Government must realize it; your President must realize it; your Prime Minister must realize it. We are getting bitter ourselves. Let me tell you very frankly, I am extremely unhappy about the way the Government is treating our people on the question of land. Our land must be returned to them. That is our right; that is our birth right. You cannot hold back from doing that. That must be done.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committee, I do not want to be reminded again that I have finished my time. We want the allegations that have been levelled in regard to Mr. Sumanthiran, that there has been an attempt on his life, to be properly investigated. We want everyone who is guilty to be brought before the court.

There has been a report filed by the police in the Kilinochchi Magistrate's Court where they have definitely stated that there was an attempt at assassination of Mr. Sumanthiran. That is a matter of record, nobody can deny that. Some people are calling him "Drohi. It is a very unbecoming word. It is a word that is inciting violence. Why are you calling him "Drohi? Is it because he is working on our Constitutional Proposals along with me and others? Tamil people are not protesting in support of you. Tamil people are protesting on account of wrongs being done to them by the Sri Lankan Government. They want that to stop. These jokers who could not even win one seat, could not come even close to one seat. They came long after us; we polled 200,000 votes, they polled 15,000 votes. They came after the EPDP; they came after the UNP and they came after the UPFA. They were totally rejected by the Tamil people. Today, they say, they have become saviours. Why? Because they are standing in front with the Tamil people, when the Tamil people are protesting against wrongs being committed by the Sri Lankan Government. So, you are promoting extremism in our ranks. You are promoting fellows who have been rejected by the people. Kindly, do not do this. On the question of missing persons, on the question of land, on the question of detainees, on the question of reparation and reconciliation, you must move, you must act and what needs to be done must be done.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. The Adjournment Motion to be seconded by the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Sithadthan, are you only seconding the Motion and sitting? ( ) (The Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan) Yes. I would like to second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Opposition Leader. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, since the TNA has proposed the Debate, rightfully they are fully entitled to take some extra time. But the thing is, there are many TNA speakers and then some of our time also could be eaten up. So, I think they may have to sacrifice some of their time so that we will be able to use our time. Otherwise, we will have to extend the time beyond 7.00 oclock. The House is somewhat depleted but this is an important Debate. So, time management aspect, I think we need to - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We can go on till 7.30 p.m. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Does the House agree? ( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. You have 15 minutes. [4.13 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) I was told that I have 20 minutes.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, first of all, I would like thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for this timely Adjournment Debate. In fact, at a critical time in our history as Sri Lanka prepares to celebrate its 70th

1487 1488

[ ]

2017 22

Anniversary of Independence in 11th months time, the Hon. Sampanthan has raised issues on which the very future of this country depends. I have spoken many times, Sir, in this very House about the hopes that the world held for our country at the time of Independence in 1948.

As Lee Kuan Yew in his memoirs, "From Third World to First" wrote, I quote:

"Ceylon was Britains model Commonwealth country. It had been carefully prepared for independence. After the War, it was a good middle-sized country with fewer than 10 million people. It had a relatively good standard of education, in fact, with two universities of very high quality, a civil service largely of locals, and experience in representative government starting with city council elections in the 1930s.

When Ceylon gained independence in 1948, it was the classic model of gradual evolution to independence.

Alas, it did not work out. During my visits over the years, I watched a promising country go to waste.

It is sad that the country whose ancient name Serendib has given the English language the word Serendipity is now the epitome of conflict, pain, sorrow and hopelessness.

This was Mr. Lee Kuan Yews writing about our beautiful Island in his memoirs.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, after that lost opportunity at Independence, and many lost opportunities as the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan pointed out thereafter - after two youth insurrections in the South and a war which continued for 26-long years in the North - Sri Lanka again got a new lease of life, I believe, on the 8th of January, 2015 and we had a renewed lease of hope as a country.

For the first time in our nations modern history, we had a President elected with the participation of people of all religions, all ethnic groups, and all walks of life in our country. In fact, we know that the people in the North came out in record numbers in most places as high as 85 to 90 per cent turnout and they voted for President Maithripala Sirisena. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) That is the highest ever in the history of the country. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The highest ever - as the Hon. Leader of the Opposition says - in the history of this country to vote for President Maithripala Sirisena and it was the same in other parts of the country. In fact, people from Point Pedro to Point Dondra in my electorate in Matara, all gave President Maithripala Sirisena a mandate with historic numbers which renewed hope for Sri Lanka as it walks towards its seventieth birthday. In fact, it gave a mandate:

- to carry our nations children and future generations forward to lasting peace;

- for a durable political settlement;

- for a nation where everyone is equal irrespective of their race, gender, caste, beliefs, and language;

- where individual rights, civil liberties, are promoted and protected;

- where the dignity of all is upheld;

- where freedom and justice will reign;

- where conflict is firmly behind us as a thing of the past, confined to the pages of history that tell the story of our nations troubled past which led us to finally forge unity and guide our nation towards a prosperous and peaceful future;

- for a nation where unity in diversity, which is the driving force, and a firm Sri Lankan identity which becomes our strength;

- where non-recurrence of conflict is a norm;

- for a nation that is a beacon of democracy;

- for us to set an example to others in the region and beyond of post-conflict peace-building, reconciliation and economic development; and

- a nation that works meaningfully and constructively in partnership with other nations and international organizations to serve the world community and uphold international systems and procedures.

Sir, with this vision, from January, 2015, we have worked together to make the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution a reality. Together, we enacted legislation to make the Right to Information a reality. Together, we enacted legislation to establish a Permanent Office that would undertake a humanitarian mission of finding the citizens of our country who are still missing today. Together, we reached out to the world beyond our shores that we had antagonized for several years, and renewed our nations friendships and partnerships with the international community; and they all readily responded to our call.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned that a Resolution was adopted unanimously by this House to appoint the Constitutional Assembly to prepare a draft Constitution Bill for the consideration of Parliament in the exercise of its powers under Article 75 of the Constitution. It was declared in that Resolution that the Constitution Bill shall only be enacted into law if it is passed in Parliament by a special majority of two-thirds of the whole number of Members of Parliament including those not present, and subsequently approved by the people at a Referendum as required by Article 83 of the Constitution.

Therefore, Sir, this is a historic opportunity, as pointed out not only by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, but by His Excellency the President himself who tabled that Resolution at a special Sitting of this House on the first year of his Presidency, on the 08th of January last year. No other Constitution-making process in 1972 or in 1978 has had this consensual approach.

1489 1490

Moreover, our nation has today reached a point of maturity having been through conflict, and witnessed the suffering and the agony that this nation has gone through since Independence. Let us now say, enough is enough once and for all.

We must stand up to do justice to those who lost their lives, and for those who are yet unborn. We, the fortunate few who have been witness to the agony of our nation, yet survived to tell the story, must now rise up, not just to tell the story, but to write the new chapter of our nations future journey.

It is up to us in this House to seize this moment and have the courage to persevere and see this Constitution-making process succeed in this House and then take it to the people of our country in whom sovereignty is vested. The people of our country spoke clearly at two elections in 2015 - the Presidential Election in January and the Parliamentary Election in August. They have indicated in unmistakable terms that they want durable peace, reconciliation and non-recurrence of conflict - a durable political solution.

In fact, we have a golden opportunity that this country has never had before, because for the first time in our history we have a National Unity Government where the arch-rivals in the political system of the last sixty-odd years are now working together and what is even more important is that we have a very moderate Tamil Opposition Leader and an Opposition who is committed to a settlement within a united and undivided Sri Lanka. What is even more important is the statement which has been made by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition earlier when he said that he will not accept any solution which has not got the consent of the Sinhala majority in the South. I think this is the most potent argument for a referendum ever made by any Tamil leader in this country and we have to grab this opportunity with both hands instead of trying to sabotage this process for short-term political gain.

In fact, this is an obligation that this House owes to the people of our country. Wherever we may sit in this House, whatever party we may belong to, we all represent the sovereignty - that is the people of this country - and it is our responsibility, to see this process to an end. It is our responsibility to do justice by them.

What better gift can we bestow the people of our beloved motherland at its 70th Anniversary of Independence next year than a solution to the problem that has traumatized this nation for much of its years as an independent nation.

Our country that stood on the cusp of economic development and social progress at the time we gained Independence in 1948, and failed, will not be able to get back on the track of economic and social development and achieve the magnitude of progress that the people justly deserve if we do not find a durable solution to our problems through a new Constitution. It is the Constitution that defines a nation. It is the Constitution that guarantees, among other things, certain rights to

minorities, which no other document can do and the moment has arrived now. We should not have a situation, after coming so far in this process, since January last year, of marching into our 70th year of Independence next year, without taking everyone forward on our nations future journey as equal citizens of one Sri Lankan family walking side by side.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, as politicians of different parties, we will have plenty to fight about and argue about in a democratic way, later. But let us, for this one important task, set aside all other issues and unite. This is the one issue that we must all lift out of the arena of politics because we cannot afford to leave this issue unresolved. It is one that is too dangerous to leave unresolved because the whole future of our country - our youth and generations yet unborn - depends on this. I, therefore, earnestly urge this House not to let this historic moment slip by and I totally agree with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, if we allow this moment to slip by, we will only embolden the forces of extremism which are again trying to raise their ugly heads on both sides of the divide.

Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition spoke of international dimensions and the UN Human Rights Council Resolutions including the one adopted in October, 2015. Some who are enemies of this nations progress for whatever rhyme or reason, drive fear into peoples minds about the Resolution and concepts of transitional justice. Let me assure this House and the people of this country that we will never embark on a path that will once again plunge this nation into chaos or pain. Transitional justice, is a term which simply means a series of measures that are taken after a traumatic conflict to ensure that peace and stability will last, that the rule of law will prevail and that a cycle of violence will not be repeated. To those who allege that we are copying others or doing what others in other countries tell us or the UN tell us, I want to clarify that this is not so. Moreover, Sir, there is no set formula of exactly how to do this. There is no cookie-cutter model. Measures taken must reflect the specific national context, human rights principles and should be led and owned by national actors to ensure success and this, Sir, is exactly what we are doing.

In fact, I again would like to repeat that this process was undertaken because we believe that this is what Sri Lanka needs in order to move forward. Sri Lanka, as a nation, must come to terms with the tragedies of our past, if we are to move forward together united in its diversity and that is why as the President himself said, in his address to the nation last year, "We undertook this process not because of international pressure but because we feel that we owe it to the people of our country."

Societies that have experienced an armed conflict must take steps to examine the past, pursue accountability, provide a way for the well-being of survivors and take institutional measures to prevent non-recurrence. Societies that avoid looking into the past fail to build sustainable peace. Traumatic memories do not simply go away. Grievances can go on for generations and even centuries becoming entrenched in cultural and historical accounts and risking new cycles of violence.

1491 1492

2017 22

This is what we must all resolve to prevent by taking the necessary steps - not ad hoc measures as in the past - for reparations, for truth seeking, searching for the missing, having judicial inquiries aimed at restoring the rule of law and individualized responsibility so that the honour and reputation of institutions such as the armed forces are preserved.

It is to the people of this country that we are answerable and it is to them that we are responsible and not to the international community.

As you would recall, Sir, point 93 of the 100-Day Work Programme of President Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential Election of 2015 states, I quote:

Since Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome Statute regarding international jurisdiction with regard to war crimes, ensuring justice with regard to such matters will be the business of national independent judicial mechanisms.

It is with that Manifesto in hand that I went to Geneva in March, 2015 in order to request that they stop the international inquiry which was initiated during the last Government and allow us time to present our own time map, our own timeframe or our own timeline, a roadmap for transitional justice in our country and I am glad to say that the international community accepted our request and now we are in the process of meeting our commitments to the people of this country.

Sir, what we did was to take ownership of our responsibilities and obligations towards the people of our country to uphold their rights, return their land, resettle the displaced, strengthen democracy and democratic institutions, repeal discriminatory laws, restore justice and ensure non-recurrence of conflict. These are some of the basic elements contained in Resolution 30/1. It is entirely a State-driven process, where we take charge and fulfil our obligations towards our own people to ensure justice, restore and uphold rights, strengthen institutions and take steps that are necessary to ensure equitable economic development and progress for all.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, on the 07th of January this year, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for the Bill to give effect to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The Bill has since been gazetted in all three languages and we hope that it will be brought before this House for consideration at an early date, hopefully, sometime in late April.

The amended policy and legal framework relating to the proposed Counter Terrorism Act, which would replace the PTA, was referred by the Cabinet of Ministers, also in January, to the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs. Once the Sectoral Oversight Committee considers the framework, drafting of the new legislation will be commenced and will also be then presented to Parliament.

Sir, the multiple tasks constituting the transformative agenda that the Government has undertaken on the reconciliation, development and institution building fronts

are not easy ones. It requires the efforts of all citizens - public and private sector alike; it requires the commitment of all and it requires the dedication of all. It is also not an easy and straight path but one that zigs and zags, and requires tremendous effort and dedication to stay the course. In fact, as I have said before at Chatham House in Geneva recently, although there are shortcomings and certain delays, the Government is committed to meeting its commitments as far as transitional justice is concerned and there will be no U-turns. Of course, there could be detours, but the destination remains the same.

Of course, for the victims, the displaced, the vulnerable - every minute and every second counts - we have done much during the last two years. Yet, there is much left to do and yet, we cannot ever say that we have done enough in this important journey. This requires constant striving to move each step forward and constant striving to ensure that what we have gained is protected and preserved.

In fact, I would like, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committee, to table* a document titled, "Festina Lente - Advancing Human Rights, Accountability, Reconciliation and Good Governance in Sri Lanka" from January, 2015 up to February of this year. I think, considering many of the roadblocks we have been having as a government, what we have achieved in this short period, I really feel, is remarkable. A lot more to be done. This document named, "Festina Lente," in Latin, which means, "make haste slowly." We are making haste but we have to do it slowly and gradually; but our commitment remains.

Sir, I would also like to request that, if possible, all these achievements contained in this document to be included as it is in Hansard.*

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. The twenty minutes allocated to you is over. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I will finish very quickly.

I am also tabling** two more documents. One, of course, is a document which has been given to me by the Ministry of Defence with land release details in the Northern and the Eastern provinces. For example, the army has released 2,473 acres of private land to civilians since October 2015 and I have been told that they are still

1493 1494

** . * * . * * Placed in the Library.

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

holding 4,162.93 acres. The Hon. Prime Minister and I know, the President himself has requested the army to give a timeline on when all these lands could be released. There is a breakdown of the lands which have so far been released and also the lands which need to be released, not only in the Northern Province but also in the Eastern Province separately. It also looks that land is held by the army, navy and the air force.

The other one, of course, there are also details that I have got from the Attorney-Generals Department about cases pertaining to the detainees as at 20th February, 2017. The total number of files are 12 and the total number of suspects are 59 and 41 had been enlarged on bail. Out of the 12 cases pending, four are under preparation to be indicted and another four are awaiting recommendations for discharge.

More importantly, Sir, the journey we began with the passage of the Resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly in April last year must be pursued, I agree, with greater vigour. As I mentioned earlier, we should not walk into our 70th year of Independence with unresolved issues that would cripple our nations forward march towards prosperity as it has done over the last 70 years. So the time is ripe. The time is very opportune. This kind of conjunction could never happen again in our life time. That is why I ask all Members here, let us fight about all other issues but when it comes to the issue of uniting our country, let us all unite and join hands to build a new Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) , - ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, the point of Order is about the change in the pattern. If the Opposition starts, next turn goes to the UNP and then to the UPFA. That has been the pattern of this House.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, towards the end of this month, we will have regular sittings of the Human Rights Council in Geneva and it is also an event that will conclude in late March, where the progress that we have made on our undertakings as per the Resolutions that have been passed and particularly co-sponsored by us is to come up. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition has brought this Adjournment Motion to look at specifically the issues confronting the nation in these important times and to make sure that we do not lose sight of our commitments solemnly given to the international community.

The month of March is also important in another aspect, where Article 50 of Brexit is also to be implemented severing the British nation from the European Community. The Geneva Sessions, once again, take place in the shadow of Resolution 30/1, which was co-sponsored by us, Sri Lanka and adopted on the 24th of September, 2015. As we know quite famously, this was the fourth Human Rights Council Resolution passed on us since the year 2012. Progressively, we have had a few amendments being brought in by the proposers of the Resolution, the United States, being strongly supported by the European Union and many other member States.

We recall Resolutions 19/2 of 22nd March, 2012; 22/1 of 21st March, 2013 and 25/1 of 27th March 2014. All these Resolutions were passed in March, except the last one, which was passed in September 2015. That is why I began by saying that March has its significance and it is pertinent to observe that we dedicate this Debate to mull over the September 2015 Resolution and its aftermaths.

You would notice that all these Resolutions bear the same title, Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. Significantly, if you take the individual elements of the Resolution, you would note that the exhortation of the Council has been on reconciliation and accountability. In fact, the fact that we co-sponsor the Resolution in 2015, represents our voluntary commitment not only to the international community but also to our people, of our determination to confront the past, end any kind of impunity, achieve reconciliation and build an inclusive society in which rule of law and democracy flourish with no discrimination on the grounds of parochial and sectarian distinctions. Non-inclusive institutions will only take us back to the corrosive decades of impunity which we so earnestly seek to prevent.

Hon. Presiding Member, one year and five months have passed since the adoption of Resolution 30/1. It is timely to take stock of our progress in implementing our commitments to identify challenges and constraints and to think up strategies for moving forward and we should solicit the continued support of the international community via the Human Rights Council to march forward on our onward journey.

The Council certainly set the stage for us when the international community came together in 2015 to co-sponsor a Resolution which requires reciprocity on our part. We all recall that not long time ago, when the internecine war had ended in 2009, to be precise, upon the conclusion of the visit of the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, we pledged in a Joint Communique'. The Joint Communique' issued by the then President Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and UN Secretary-General of the day, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, stated that there would be some kind of an accountability mechanism. All these four Resolutions that were passed in Geneva have pivoted their pith and substance on the mechanism that was hinted in that Communique'.

Sir, long before the last Resolution was passed in September, 2015, we recall the mechanisms we proceeded to establish. One is, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and its good recommendations. Then, the Maxwell Paranagama Commission that sat right throughout the length and breadth of the country and its recommendations on missing persons. Our voluntary pledge at the universal periodic review to craft a National Action Plan on Promotion and Protection of Human Rights resulted in a number of consultations with several stakeholders which finally led to an Action Plan being presented in Geneva. But we need to bear in mind that the Action Plan for 2017 to 2021 needs to be worked out while we proceed to overhaul human rights in an expanded Chapter in the

1563 1564

[ ]

2017 22

proposed new Constitution. The passage of the consensual resolution is a stark reminder that our efforts at reconciliation, accountability mechanisms and human rights efforts at reconciliation are laudable, but we as constituent Member of the National Unity Government- ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Your time is over, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Give me just a minute, Hon. Presiding Member.

In order to realize the full promise of all these reforms, we need to work out on our momentum to effect the paradigm transformation we so honestly wish for our people. I cannot but resist the observation that from a human rights perspective the constitutional reform process presents us an important opportunity to rectify structural deficiencies and establish a more comprehensive Bill of Rights, stronger institutional checks and balances, enhanced constitutional review, improved guarantees for independence of the judiciary, accountability of our international human rights obligations. As for our treaty obligations, our obligations under the Convention Against Torture have already been considered in November 2016 and we are also going to bring a bill against enforced or involuntary disappearances. That would be presented maybe in a week or two. So, we must bear in mind that on the question of enforced disappearances when it becomes a penal offence under international obligations, that law can be applied retrospectively. All other penal offences are prospective, but in this case, it is not so. And this is why the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa was so emotionally charged saying that we are on a witch-hunt against intelligence officers. But then, if intelligence officers have stepped out of the law, if they have gone and taken in innocent people and tortured innocent people, and have been cause for disappearances, then it has to be looked into. This is an international obligation. We have signed Conventions where we hold ourselves responsible to the international community and that is what accountability means, and transitional justice mechanisms are necessary for us to bring closure to the misery and trauma that people have suffered in this country.

With those comments Sir, I conclude and thank you for giving me this opportunity.

Thank you.

Keheliya Rambukwella) I take your word, but it is the public opinion; public perception. The document that was displayed much prior to the election by the Hon. Tissa Attanayake - who is being charged now - states that the Hon. R. Sampanthan would be made the Leader of the Opposition. That was much prior to the election. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) That document has no basis at all. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is okay. -[Interruption.] Let us say it is a forged document. But it is happening at the ground level. The Hon. Sampanthan got only 4.1 per cent votes out of the total number of votes from the entire Island and that was concentrated to the North; but he was made the Leader of the Opposition. So that was one of the things.

Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Mr. Presiding Member, after the UNP and the UPFA, both of which are in the coalition Government, we are the Party with the next largest number of seats. I am here as the Leader of the Opposition because we have the largest number of seats in Parliament after the UNP and the UPFA which are in an alliance. The fact that you are on this side does not mean a thing. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Leave the SLFP, then you will have the opportunity to become a part of the Opposition. We invite you to leave the SLFP. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Deputy Minister, we have given that in writing. In fact, today, we had a meeting with the Hon. Speaker. We said, let us accept the consequences; do not think of the legal issues; we are prepared to face the legal issues. We have told the Hon. Speaker over and over again and we did not adhere to the three-line whip instruction that was given during both Budgets. But nobody took action. Thereby we presume that they have accepted us as a group in the Opposition.

Then, I must also mention that the Hon. Amirthalingam was made the Leader of the Opposition under the first-past-the-post system. They had 14 or 15 seats, yes, fair enough. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Eighteen seats. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Yes, eighteen seats, fair enough. That is understood but under the PR system, we go on the basis of the percentages. That is how the Parliament is selected.

[6.47 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development) Mr. Presiding Member, I am privileged to join this very timely Debate on the Adjournment Motion that has been brought in by the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. This Motion states that "it is absolutely essential that these processes be taken forward in a genuine and purposeful manner". It is talking of the process of creating a new Sri Lanka through a new Constitution.

As we look at the history of our country, at post-Independence, we see that there have been several understandings between the leaders of our country; we had the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact and the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact. Then, we had the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee Proposals that were brought in under President R. Premadasa. We also had the Draft Constitution in August, 2000 which was brought in by Prof. G.L. Peiris, with whom the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was also a Member of that Government and the Cabinet. Also, we had the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on several occasions, expressing his intention to solve the national problem when he said, Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka. The former President again said, People in their own localities must take control of their own destiny. These were also the words of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Any solution must stretch to the maximum possible devolution without sacrificing sovereignty. Unfortunately, what we seem to be reading in the newspapers and other media these days of what the former President has said is in contradiction to some of the things he had said while he held the high office of this country. I am beginning to wonder why he does not come to this august Assembly and contradict his own statements rather than making statements to the media. On the other hand, we might give him the benefit of doubt by saying that, maybe, he has not made these statements to the media and that is why he has not appeared in this House to actually contradict himself or he is actually a confused man, if these statements have actually been made to the media.

Hon. Members of Parliament, I think we have had a new dawn and a new day. On 08th of January, 2015, the people of this country gave President Maithripala Sirisena a mandate. It was a broad mandate. A vital part of that mandate was to create a united Sri Lanka. We have a mandate to reform the Constitution; we have a mandate to abolish the Executive Presidency. Many former presidential candidates, including former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, President Mahinda Rajapaksa and then, President Maithripala Sirisena, had expressly stated at different points that they would want to abolish the Executive Presidency. But, the two former Presidents had not done that. The present President has made a commitment to go through constitutional reform and also to abolish the Executive Presidency. I must say to his credit that when the Nineteenth Amendment was moved in this House, he willingly gave up or reduced the powers of the Executive Presidency, but there were limits to it.

That is why this Parliament resolved or adopted a Resolution converting Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly. The reasons why this was done were that then, the whole of Parliament would be involved in the process of deliberating on what the Constitution should be and also to seek the advice and the views of the people of this country. That, I must add, has been done through a Steering Committee that has been appointed. It was to prepare a Draft Constitution Bill for the consideration of the Constitutional Assembly. That is where we are; we are in that process. Several Subcommittees were appointed and their Reports have been received. The Steering Committee has considered those Committee Reports and all those Reports are to be debated now in the Constitutional Assembly.

Then, the Resolution further stated that that Draft Constitutional Bill must be passed in Parliament by a special majority of two-thirds of the whole number of Hon. Members of Parliament and subsequently, approved by the people at a Referendum required under Article 83 of the present Constitution. So, the process is clear; that is the policy of our Government. Sometimes, we hear different voices and therefore, I want to thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for bringing this Motion in a very timely manner so that this could be clearly clarified.

Why do we need a new Constitution? We need a new Constitution because we saw at the Debate on the Nineteenth Amendment that there were limits to what could be done in amending the existing Constitution. If you were to abolish the Executive Presidency or change the form of the Constitution, then the people definitely need to be consulted. I remember as a student in school, when the then Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike wanted to extend the term of Parliament from1975 to 1977, she did it without having a Referendum violating the basic principle that you cannot alter the terms on which you yourselves are elected. Even people's representatives cannot alter the basic terms on which they have been sent to Parliament by the people. Therefore, it is essential that the people are consulted because that is the basic law.

We have had two Republican Constitutions. The First Republican Constitution was in 1972, in the constitutional-making process of which all political parties did not participate and which got approved by a majority vote led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. In 1978, we had the Second Republican Constitution, which was again approved by a majority vote led by the then Government of the United National Party. But in bringing both these Constitutions, the people were not consulted. This debate is happening nearly 40 years or four decades after the approval of the Second Republican Constitution and therefore, when the relevant Resolution for this process was passed by Parliament, it was deliberated, clearly thought through that whatever Constitution that the Constitutional Assembly comes up with must be brought into operation with the approval of the people so that all the people of this country have a say in their new Constitution.

I do not think like other Hon. Members of Parliament in the Opposition, who expressed the idea today that we are, somehow or other, trying to rush through this process. But, we are not trying to rush through this process. It has been just over two years since our President has come into office and our new Government is nearly one and a half years old. Therefore, this process is not being rushed at all and that impression should not be created. We have consulted the people; we are going through an open process and we are finally going to consult the people in approving the Constitution so that every person in this country, wherever they may live, may feel, "I have participated in the process".

Sir, I will conclude very quickly. But, if I might also say one more thing, in this process of reconciliation, our Government had brought to Parliament and passed the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill, and it is a law today being certified by the Hon. Speaker. It will soon be gazetted and will become operative. Also, Parliament has just approved the criminalization of enforced disappearances. That must go to the Cabinet and then, it must be presented to Parliament. Our Government has also put forward a draft legislation on counter-terrorism. I know that there has been much debate on that and it has not met the requirements of everybody who has examined that draft. But, it has been referred to the relevant Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee, will subsequently be sent to the Cabinet and then come before Parliament for debate and for approval.

We have also been engaged in confidence-building measures. We have released lands to the war-affected people. I am aware that, as I speak, we have issues in Keppapulavu in the Mullaitivu District, where lands should have been released by the end of January, but which have not yet been released. It is receiving the attention of our Government. We know that there are concerns that people have been tortured. But, in the last few days, we had seen the arrests of those who may have been responsible for journalist Keith Noyahrs torture, which is a good sign that our Government is open in acting on these issues. Yes, things could have moved

faster and those have not moved faster, but certainly those are moving in the right direction.

We need the support of everybody in this country to take this country forward. We also need the support of the international community and want them to understand that we are coming out of a military-conflict situation and that we need time as we move ahead with the process of reconciliation and building one country with diverse people.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Abdullah Mahrooff. You have got only four minutes. [.. 6.59]

I am glad to be speaking on this Adjournment Motion proposed by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

I am glad that many of the sentiments expressed during this Debate by both sides of the House have been very constructive and very positive. Barring a few discordant noises, which anyway we must expect, most Hon. Members in this House today have affirmed the process that is ongoing, the process to draft and make a new Constitution for this country. And, so they must, because it is this House that passed unanimously the Resolution on the 9th of March 2016. It was passed unanimously. None of the Members who today say that we do not need a new Constitution, that the Government does not have a mandate to draft a new Constitution voted against that Resolution. They had the opportunity. That Resolution very clearly articulates that a Constitutional Assembly is being set up in order to draft a Constitution for Sri Lanka. As the Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development read out, the whole process is clearly laid out including the fact that under Article 74, Article 75, and Article 83 steps should be taken if the Constitutional Assembly approves the draft with a two-

thirds majority. Then, it will go to the Cabinet of Ministers so that they gazette it and certify it as a Bill that is intended to be passed with a two-thirds majority in this House and then be approved by the people at a Referendum under Article 83. All of those are laid out in detail.

Those who say, "We have 51 Members and we are opposed to a new Constitution" agreed with that Resolution. How then can they now say these things? But, they do. Some of them do, as did the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella when he talked about Thirteen plus. He forgot that that promise about Thirteen plus is actually in writing in several places. It does not say Thirteen plus. It says, "Full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and building upon it so as to achieve meaningful devolution". "Full implementation", that is what it says. He was repeatedly asked by the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman today, "Are you then agreeing to the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, the first part of the promise?" He said, "Subject to two matters to be discussed." But that was not the promise. That is not what is in writing. The two External Affairs Ministers, Prof. G. L. Peiris, who has done a somersault yet again, and S. M. Krishna repeatedly used that phrase. Not just by the two External Affairs Ministers but once by former President His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa himself, together with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh used that. There was no reservation that two matters in the Thirteenth Amendment must be subject to discussion. No. It used the words, "Full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and going beyond to achieve meaningful devolution." Why should you achieve meaningful devolution? The implicit in that statement is, you admit that there are several features in the Thirteenth Amendment that are not meaningful, that are a bar to achieving any meaningful devolution.

So, this is a promise, a repeated promise; it was breached no doubt, but that was a promise given. When the House has passed a Resolution, 51 Members who claim to be somewhat different, have a very strange name for themselves, nevertheless claiming to be very different, opposed to the drafting of a new Constitution, not only they did not oppose that Resolution, but they participated in that process right along. I am glad that the Hon Dinesh Gunawardena is here, a Member of the Steering Committee which met for the 50th time yesterday. He is one of those who has attended the Steering Committee meetings without fail, perhaps he may have missed it once or twice, but for most number of meetings he has attended and participated in this process very diligently and very conscientiously. The other Member, the Hon. Prasanna Ranatunga even participated as a Member of a three-member Ad hoc Committee and presented a report. They participated in this whole process. Participate in the passage of a Resolution that is so clear; thereafter, participate in Subcommittees and in the Steering Committee and in the Ad hoc Committees and thereafter - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Mr. Presiding Member -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Member, you can speak after me, if you will. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I would like to reply because you referred to me. Sorry to disturb you. We have participated on behalf of the Joint Opposition of 51 Members. We have submitted 14 points which are very clearly uncompromising, which have been placed before the Steering Committee and the country. Our Members have participated in the Subcommittees as well. Their views have not been totally rejected. They have not been accommodated in the Report, which they have stated openly last week in the public. So, participating and being not considered are two different things. I appreciate what the Hon. Member is saying. We, everyone, have tried; we have tried to convince how to protect the unitary State. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank the Hon. Member for clarifying that position. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Now, wind up please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I will wind up with this. Several Subcommittees had Members of the Joint Opposition. The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya spoke here today. He has signed the Report. That Subcommittee was chaired by a Member of the Joint Opposition. There are several others. In certain Committees they did express reservation, I must say that. But, they said that they will forward their own reports. They were invited to the Steering Committee and they said that they would forward reports. Now, there is a 14-point Memoranda that has been submitted. That is true. That must be discussed. There is no way that that can be put aside. The point that I am making is that before that the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella presented a report in which he even suggested the abolition of the Concurrent List, he later withdrew it - they take different positions at different times. But, he did present a report suggesting the abolition of the Concurrent List. Now, all of this must be discussed. The point that we are making is that this is an exercise in which everyone must engage in together and eventually that must be placed before the people.

Therefore, I earnestly appeal to all concerned to fully participate in this transparent process and achieve meaningful reconciliation through the enactment of a new Constitution for this country.

Thank you.
