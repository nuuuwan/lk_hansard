[1.01 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, since my time is limited, I will try to restrict my speech to discuss the Central Highway in particular.

As you all know, Kandy is the second largest city in our country. It is a historic city. . Therefore, we believe that it is absolutely essential to have connectivity and easy access to the city of Kandy in particular. As you all know, most of the tourists who come to Sri Lanka are very keen on travelling up to Kandy and the Central Region. However, right now, it takes about four to four-and-a-half hours for people to travel from Kandy to Colombo or from Colombo to Kandy. This means an enormous waste of

1221 1222

time, waste of energy and waste of money. Therefore, I am of the view that the sooner we complete the Central Highway, the better it is for our country.

We also know that once the expressways are completed, there will be substantial economic development in that region of our country. Not only Kandy, but also cities like Matale, Kegalle, Nuwara Eliya, Nawalapitiya and so on will greatly benefit with the construction of the Central Expressway. The living standards of our people can be improved and economic activities including industrial zones and export development zones can be created in those regions. We can see for ourselves the development of the South after the construction of the Southern Expressway which has resulted in cities like Hikkaduwa, Bentota, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Weligama being developed rapidly. Now, with the extension of the Southern Expressway up to Hambantota, we can already see the development activities in the towns like Tangalle and Hambantota. With the extension of the Expressway to Hambantota, there will be connectivity between the Port of Hambantota and Colombo and it will make it easier for us to attract investors to the industrial estates of Hambantota as well.

As far as the construction cost of the Central Expressway is concerned, let me tell you that there have been some agreement by the previous regime to give Section 1 to the Chinese contractors and that has been awarded in June 2016. The difference in the engineer's estimate and the contract amount is 22.5 per cent. As far as the second stage is concerned, which for the first time in Sri Lanka was awarded to Sri Lankan contractors by our Government, the difference between the engineer's estimate and the contract value was 8.04 per cent. As far as the Section 3 is concerned, which is now about to be awarded to a Japanese contractor, the difference between the engineer's estimate and the contract value is only 9.23 per cent. So, for the Sri Lankan contractors, the difference is 8 per cent and for the Japanese contractor, the difference is only 9.23 per cent. This shows that our Government has looked at all the issues, including the cost and I think the Ministry has taken all these things into account and had done well in concluding this price.

At the same time, there were some allegations about the interest rates. It is true that it is coming from a private bank. This is the first time that a private bank in Japan is coming forward to fund an infrastructure project of this nature. The effective interest rate for Section 3 of the Central Expressway is only 2.04 per cent. This compares very favourably even with the Export-Import Banks concessionary finance that had been given before. Right now, it is around 2 to 2.25 per cent. Therefore, the ability to get this funding at 2.04 per cent is extremely creditable.

Some people have also been trying to compare the cost of Central Expressway with that of the Southern Expressway. This is a very unfair and very incorrect comparison. As the Minister Hon. Lakshman Kiriella mentioned before, there is not even one viaduct from

Colombo to Matara whereas 25-30 per cent of the Central Expressway from Colombo to Kandy will be covered by viaducts. So, naturally, the construction cost will be higher. Of course, we can compare that cost with that of the Outer Circular Highway which is of a similar construction. The entire cost of the Outer Circular Highway comes to Rs. 4.84 billion per kilometre. That includes the first phase which was awarded sometime back in 2008 or 2009. Then, the second phase was awarded in 2012 by the previous regime and the third phase was given on the 01st of January, 2016. So, the total cost of the Outer Circular Highway comes to Rs. 4.84 billion per kilometre in comparison with the cost of the Central Highway is only Rs. 3.94 billion per kilometre which is even less than the cost of the Outer Circular Highway. So, Sir, as I said, most of these allegations are incorrect.

At the same time, we must also take into account that the new expressways that have been constructed are wider. The Kottawa-Matara Expressway has a width of 20.2 metres whereas the new expressways which are now being constructed have a width of about 24.4 metres.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, what I would like is, for everyone to get together and help us to complete this Expressway to the Central Region, which will bring economic development to that Region.

Thank you.

[6.08p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. Sir, I rise today to discuss a pivotal factor relevant to our countrys infrastructure and economy. We have seen, as Sri Lanka embraces its new-found economic upheaval, it is undoubtedly evident that the development of requisite infrastructure sets the stage for not only the effective transfusion of commerce, but also providing equal opportunities to those in far-flung areas of the country to enhance their livelihood. Sir, what is also worth mentioning is the inevitable opportunities to reconcile our differences with our fellow brothers and sisters of various backgrounds, faiths and ethnicities which make up our social fabric through the utilization of this infrastructure.

In the matter of expressways, we have witnessed the microeconomic benefits that our citizens have gained through the opening of the Airport and the Southern Expressway. However, it is worth mentioning that priority was not given to develop the Central Expressway due to politically biased reasons. No one in this House can refute the absolute necessity of the Central Expressway, and its underlying long-term economic benefits to the country. Being a Representative of the Eastern Province, I can speak for hours about the multitude of benefits of having an expressway that at least comes halfway, would do for the development and economic upheaval of my area. However, it is also absolutely necessary to mention that a high level of prudence is exercised in its procurement, construction and delivery to ensure that it is for the benefit of the country at large. Therefore, I must take this opportunity to commend the decisions and measures undertaken by the present Government to uphold these requisite principles especially that of Minister, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella whose purview this falls under. According to the Auditor-Generals Reports of 2015, 2016 and 2017, it was noted that we, the people, had overpaid for the construction of the Southern Expressway which is comparatively less commuted when compared to the volume of traffic traversing on Colombo - Kandy Road.

Today, various accusations are rife in speculating that there is foul play in the procurement and construction of the Central Expressway by this Government. According to our Hon. Prime Minister, this is basically an attempt by a private media channel to discredit the present Good Governance, which has taken up the challenge of fulfilling the long-felt need of constructing the Central Expressway. One of the election pledges of this Government was to construct the Colombo - Kandy Expressway. The Cabinet approval was obtained to go ahead with the lowest costs and cut down expenses from Rs. 159 billion to Rs. 134 billion, thus saving Rs. 25 billion. Although the negative fabricated mudslinging by the private media channels mislead the general public, the Government is fully committed in fulfilling such vital requirements for the infrastructure of the country, in a transparent manner.

Moreover, the Colombo - Kandy Expressway is not just for a single purpose, but it is a part of the integrated development of the City of Kandy at large. It has to be mentioned here that according to the plan to improve the Kandy City and the holistic tourism development plan, after relocating the prisoners at Bogambara, the building is to be refurbished with its architectural grandeur to establish a tourism centre. Then, improving the agricultural technology and establishing a communication technology park are all in the pipeline.

For such business and commerce development, Japan has identified Kandy as an ideal location. Thus the critical need to establish an expressway could not be emphasized any better. Further, as the Central Expressway is planned to traverse through major towns such as Kururnegala and Dambulla, this would undoubtedly lead towards greater economic upheavals and urban regeneration plans for those areas as well.

1327 1328

[ . . ]

2017 29

Unlike the other expressways constructed in our country so far, which were all constructed on flat land and elevated by earth filling instead of erecting concrete columns, the Central Expressway construction involves a far more complex engineering than any other expressway in Sri Lanka. There are three tunnels and 14 bridges to be constructed at higher elevation raised on concrete columns, which is planned with effort to preserve the existing environment and its beauty without having to alter or mar its natural geological features.

On March 27th 2015, the Japanese Ambassador in Sri Lanka mentioned that Japan has the technology and expertise in complex constructions such as that of the Central Expressway and engaging a technologically advanced construction company of Japan for such projects would be apt. He even expressed that the Japanese Government would be willing to extend assistance in this regard.

If one peruses the options being offered by the Government of Japan to the Government of Sri Lanka, you cannot refute the underlying opportunities that it holds for our country. Further, I reliably understand that the Indian Minister of Highways is due to visit Sri Lanka in the near future on a goodwill mission, and that they would come forward to enhance the potential of North and East resources in a way of assisting in the development of infrastructure. So this is where His Excellency the President himself recently announced that all arrangements are being made to provide an expressway to the East as well. Having got the opportunity, I humbly ask the Hon. Minister to propose an expressway to the East.

Therefore, having got the blessings of His Excellency the President and Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Lakshman Kiriellla, Minister of Highways and Higher Education, with his experience and exposure and certainly with his vision will move forward in this mission to accomplish his goal despite the mudslinging from any quarters and forge ahead to complete the Central Expressway, followed suit with highways to the East and North, which will bring in the real integration by connecting the North, South and East with the Central Province and accomplish economic and social developments of our country.

[6.49p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. I am very happy indeed to take part in this Debate especially because the Hon. Minister of Higher Education and Highways - I must really thank him - is one of the Ministers who have given a big amount of funds to all the Members of Parliament. I thank you again, Hon. Minister.

Sir, this Motion was moved by the JVP and I am shocked that the Hon. Members of the JVP are not present in the House. Yesterday, I saw that there was a meeting in Chilaw where all the JVP Members were taking part. In the morning, they came here, criticized the Government and the Hon. Minister and by 2.30 p.m., they were in Chilaw. As the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman said, hereafter, if they put forward a Motion, they must be here. Otherwise, it is useless. Tomorrow morning, the newspapers will report what they spoke in Parliament, but these things will never come out.

From morning, I have been listening to the speeches and came to know that the Hon. Minister, the Chairman and other officials have already saved Rs. 12 billion by introducing a new competitor to the proposed Central Expressway Project. When you look at the Southern Expressway completed by the earlier Government, for the section from Kottawa to Dodangoda, the original engineers' estimate had gone up by 113 per cent at its completion. Then, for the section from Dodangoda to Kurundugahahetekma, the original estimate had gone up by 210 per cent and for the section from Kurundugahahetekma to Pinnaduwa, it had gone up by 79 per cent. But, I am made to understand that for Section 1 of the Central Expressway, the original estimate has gone up only by 22 per cent. So, under the earlier Government, when expressways were constructed, the estimated cost had gone up by 100 per cent or 200 per cent at completion. However, with the prices of goods going up, our Hon. Minister and his officials have brought down the

cost of the Central Expressway. But the Opposition, for the sake of opposing, is creating all these problems.

I was the Provincial Transport and Highways Minister. So, I know that this particular expressway is going to benefit not only the people of Kandy, but also the whole country. People who come from Jaffna, Anuradhapura, through Dambulla, Kurunegala, Warakapola and finally to Colombo, use the Colombo-Kandy Road. Then, people coming from Nuwara Eliya, Kandy through Warakapola to Colombo, also use that road. So, you can just imagine the amount of traffic flowing on the Colombo-Kandy Road. I can remember, when we were in the Provincial Council, we were able to construct the Anuradhapura-Puttalam-Colombo Road to reduce the traffic congestion, but sometimes, it takes more than three hours to come to Colombo because all the traffic moves on the Colombo-Kandy Road. Therefore, by constructing this expressway, the Hon. Minister is going to serve not only the people of Kandy or Nuwara Eliya, but also help bringing down the traffic congestion.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, give me two more minutes, please. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No, I can give you only a minute. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Because of this expressway, the prices of lands have gone up, a lot of hotels have come up and little by little, the areas are developing. All the tourists who come to visit Kandy and Nuwara Eliya will definitely be benefited. Therefore, we all are with you, Hon. Minister. You can proceed. We need not worry about the way roads are being constructed and the work being done.

The Hon. Member from the TULF, who is present here, spoke about the Mannar-Puttalam Road in the morning. I must tell you, Hon. Minister, if we can construct the Mannar-Puttalam Road, the distance that people travelling from Jaffna across the Sangupiddy Bridge will be cut down by 120 kilometres. So, please take this into consideration. We must construct the road from Mannar to Puttalam. I remember, once the Hon. Prime Minister said, "The day that Jaffna people can reach Colombo within three to four hours, the problems will be solved." So, this is the best proposition. As the Hon. Member from the TULF mentioned in the morning, this is a must. I know that the road will go through the Wilpattu Sanctuary. But, there are so many sanctuaries

1343 1344

[ ]

2017 29

through which roads have been constructed and people are travelling. Therefore, please consider this proposal. If you can do this in the future, Hon. Minister, it will be of great service to the people.

Hon. Minister, as you are serving the people and the nation, we are and we will be with you in the future. We also thank you for giving all the assistance in improving our roads.

Thank you.
