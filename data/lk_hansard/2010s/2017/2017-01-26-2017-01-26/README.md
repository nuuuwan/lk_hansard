The strain created by Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever this year was much virulent than what the doctors had seen in the previous years. So, it was a virulent strain caused by Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. In the last year and the year before, we did not see that much of strain created by Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever because the strain was less virulent. But, this time, it is very strong. A lot of people develop Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. So, we have to be very concerned about this situation, unless otherwise, we will lose a lot of lives. Also, patients may take a lot of working days to recover from Dengue and it will make a significant cost to the Sri Lankan health sector. , .

Sir, the Joint Statement on SAITM Medical Degree prepared by Deans of State Medical Faculties states, I quote:

The above sequence of events makes it clear that there were many irregularities, if not outright deception of the public, in the manner in which the SAITM medical degree programme was established.

There has been no Gazette notification that the conditions stipulated by the Specified Authority in Gazette no. 1721/19 of 2011.08.30 have been fulfilled.

As of now, SAITM has not obtained the compliance certification (required under the above rule) from the specified professional body, which is the SLMC in the case of degrees in Medicine.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, I think you know that it is a donation by the Indian Government. The problem is that they have provided money for the construction but not for equipment. So, to purchase equipment they themselves have to go through the tender procedure. It is a lengthy process in India. That is why I have asked them to have a soft opening and continue the work until the equipment

comes. When they send us equipment from India, we will open it. Thereafter, the hospital can fully function. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Thilakarajah, one day I will come to Nuwara Eliya with all my officials and we will meet all doctors in estate hospitals and superintendents of all the estates. We will discuss with them what they want and then we will allocate money accordingly. Also, we can look into what more we can do to reduce malnutrition through the Nutrition Programme. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Thank you, Hon. Minister for the response. I have one more question. Hon. Minister, the hospital situated in Glencairn Dickoya comes under the Central Provincial Council. Central Provincial Council has already passed a Resolution that they cannot run the hospital because of the cost. So, my question is, whether it is going to be taken over by your Ministry or else it is going to be again and again - () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) There are so many requests for take over. Gampaha Hospital, Negombo Hospital, Mahiyangana Hospital, Matale Hospital, they all make such requests. If I go on taking over these hospitals, then there will be no devolution of power. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) I understand, Hon. Minister. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) I have four pieces of a bomb in my body for fighting for devolution. I have my principles. I do not like to take over any hospital, but I will give any amount of money. Even last year I spent Rs.5 billion out of my Central Government allocation for the Provincial Councils. Ask them to send in their requests to us because I will be meeting all the Provincial Ministers tomorrow at 10 oclock. Ask the PD or the Secretary to come prepared with all those requests. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Thank you, Hon. Minister. I discussed this matter with the Chief Minister of the Central Province, Hon. Sarath Ekanayake and he told me that if you give them enough money, they can run the hospital without any

problem. So, thank you very much for promising to give enough money to run this hospital. I hope that it will be opened in the near future. There is one other request to be made, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is running out. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) I will take only two more minutes, Mr. Presiding Member.

[4.56 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this most important Medical (Amendment) Bill, which deals especially with the dental area. As the Hon. Minister is aware, we have to concentrate not only on the adults, but also on the school children. I am very happy, indeed, that the Hon. Minister has brought in this Bill. There are so many sections that come under his Ministry which he has been improving, through which people get far-reaching benefits. I am sure that not only the adults of this country, but even the school children and most importantly, the poor children, will benefit by this.

I must really thank the Hon. Minister because for the last one year or so whatever allocations made by his Ministry have been reaching almost all the remote hospitals around the country. Normally what happens is, funds reach only the important cities while the other cities and towns get neglected. I have already spoken to the Hon. Minister and he has promised to visit my area, Puttalam, one day. Even though he has still not visited us, whatever we are to receive, in all aspects, we have been receiving. So, on behalf of the people of Puttalam, Hon. Minister, I must really thank you.

Hon. Minister, there is another matter which I would like to mention. It is about the iodine requirement in individuals. There is a section which deals with this under your Ministry. As a salt producer having a salt manufacturing company in Puttalam, I would like to mention that manufacturing of proper iodized salt should be regularized. Hon. Minister, elimination of IDD comes under your Ministry. The required content of iodine can be given to individuals through salt.

There are big companies in Hambantota, Palaviya and Puttalam which manufacture salt according to the rules and regulations of the Ministry. We have been supplying properly washed, properly iodized salt to the market. Unfortunately, there are people who do not produce proper salt. Due to these products, properly iodized salt does not reach the people because the price is entirely different. It is necessary that the PHIs keep on inspecting salt production. Unfortunately, this is not done properly. Therefore, I kindly urge you to look into this and do the needful. If not, the people who produce the iodized salt will not survive in this trade. You are giving us all the assistance: Ministries are helping us; you are giving us machineries; PHIs visit us. But, unfortunately, when the low standard salt goes to the market, we will lose the

market due to the price factor, and your target is not met. For the last four to five years, even though I was not in Parliament, I have been raising this matter. But it has not been solved up to date. In fact, I can give you more details on this so that you can take necessary steps and ensure that properly iodized salt reaches the people.

Sir, the kidney problem is raising its head in our area. In Kalpitiya, about 16,000 acres of land is cultivated using chemicals. So, we have the kidney problems in Puttlam. I must thank you, Hon. Minister, that you have already given a dialysis machine to the Nikaweratiya Hospital and now we are able to send our patients there. Since chemicals are used in Kalpitiya on a large scale, it will be better if we can have a few more dialysis machines, because the number of kidney patients in Puttalam is increasing. So, I hope you will consider this matter and help us in future.

There is another important point I want to bring to your notice, Hon. Minister. When I visited the Lanka Hospitals some time back, I understood that at least 50 to 75 Maldivians come weekly from the Maldives for medical treatment and that each person brings at least US Dollars 2,000. When I had a discussion with them, I understood that they were not satisfied at all. They said that prices are high; everything is so expensive. We should not lose them. They can go to India, but they prefer to come to Sri Lanka because it is easy for them and they know the ins and outs of Sri Lanka. So, I think we should not lose this market because we lose foreign exchange also. I think I informed you of this earlier too. You have already taken some control over the private hospitals. I hope you will consider this and bring this also under control.

Further, Hon. Minister, I must thank you, because you are making arrangements to upgrade the Kalpitiya Hospital, which caters almost to 40,000 - 50,000 people. In fact, I have informed you that in the Puttalam Hospital, only 50 per cent of the cadre requirement of doctors, nurses and minor staff is available. This is what happens there. I must say that you have been appointing nurses properly. Unfortunately, they serve only for a short period in our area - it is a difficult area - and somehow go to Kurunegala. When I was the Health Minister of the Provincial Council also I faced this problem. Today also, we are facing this problem. The other problem that we are facing is the lack of minor staff in all the hospitals in the Puttalam District. What happens is, people from the Kurunegala District are posted to the Puttalam District and somehow they go back within a few months.

I do not know how they are doing it. Sometimes minor staff is not available there in the hospitals even to transfer patients in the night. Therefore, please make arrangements to see that minor staff is appointed from that particular district. It has not been done properly. We know that. I remember that this has been going on for a long period. Now, the present situation is, the Provincial Council has recruited about 200 persons and we have refused to appoint them to Puttalam. So, they are idling in Kurunegala. Therefore, the good decisions that you have taken are nullified because of problems like this.

The other factor is, as you are aware, only 50 per cent of doctors are available in the hospitals in Puttalam. Sometimes the OPD goes on till 2 oclock or 3 oclock in the afternoon and the patients have to wait for a long time due to lack of doctors and MLTs. These are the problems that are there. I must really thank you for making arrangements for urine and blood tests to be done at the hospitals. This is a very good move because what has been happening was that every medical test was sent to private laboratories. It does not happen today. The patients had to go out for every medical test. Even though free medication is given by the Health Ministry, people had to spend a lot of money in getting those medical tests done. I must thank you for bringing that situation under control so that it helps to serve the people better. I am really happy about all those measures taken to assist the people in the rural areas. I specially thank you for making arrangements to build dental units for schools. Two new blocks for the dental units of two schools in my area will be built, by which the students will be benefited.

I would say that the correct person has come to the correct Ministry and as a result the Ministry is doing really well. As promised, I am also expecting a date from you to visit the Puttalam Base Hospital to resolve whatever problems that are there.

Thank you, Sir. [.. 5.06] () (, ) ( ( ) - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne - Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine) , () , . . . . . . . .
