( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. E. Saravanapavan. You have 22 minutes.

[3.05p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, let me welcome the 2018 Budget and congratulate the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance for his Blue - Green Budget : Enterprise Sri Lanka. There are several positive aspects that need acknowledgement.

In the war-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces, development is entirely dependent on rural development. There are millions of rural people suffering in silence as their challenges and issues have not been recognized and addressed so far. Their potential to contribute to national development is not being tapped.

One of the key functions mentioned in the Budget Estimates under the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs is, Development of regional and rural development policies and strategies. We believe that the scope of this Ministry is too narrow. We need to look up to several Ministries to come up with a cohesive plan in an outcome-focussed manner for us even to start a post-war socio-economic recovery. Just throwing money and expecting things to happen is not the answer. You need powers and budget to coordinate everything that is required to realize a cohesive rural economic plan. The only Department that comes under this Ministry is the Department of Animal Production and Health.

Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs must attempt to understand the ground situation first and come up with policies and solutions that reflect and address the realities

2273 2274

[

2017 29

of the war-affected provinces. There have never been an assessment or research even to understand and contextualize the needs of these provinces. Unfortunately, it is continuing to be the Colombo-centric policy of one-size-fits-all. These can only be addressed by the civil society, private sector and the Government jointly operating as partners.

Despite the enthusiasm of the North-East to participate in national development and contribute to its progress in a positive and productive manner, there were continuing frustration because we were not heard, understood or taken seriously. There is a vast difference between the Colombo and the North-East realities. National development is not just economic development. It encompasses social, political, environmental, cultural and even moral aspects. Serving more of the same and expecting the answers to be different and then go on blaming the victims will, in no way, help reconciliation.

We are also pleased that a Department will be formed to monitor the progress of budgetary measures and implement them. The Northern and Eastern Provinces with their limited human capacity should not be left to fight multiple Ministries which are disjoined with conflicting rules, regulations, procedures, statutes that are at the mercy of the public servants interpretations for successful implementation. We appeal for the budget implementation office also to address grievances in the implementation.

We understand that the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs, as it stands now, has only a limited scope. However, what we need is a solution to our problems, and we do not expect to work through various other Ministries and Ministers to achieve a cohesive plan for post-war recovery. There is no proper understanding about the requirements of the war-affected provinces and to make an understanding among people who need to work in this regard is an uphill task. It is disheartening to see that the majority of the political leaders take various positions to dash the last hope for a negotiated settlement. Let us resolve this peacefully without letting every Tom, Dick and Harry tell you what you should do.

The majority in the North-East Provinces are living below the poverty line. They carry a heavy burden of physical, psychological and social stigma and scars of the 30 years of war. These communities need to be restored, they must get back on their feet. People who do not live in peace cannot live in peace with others. People who are starving and struggling with their day-to-day living will not live in peace with others.

We need to have rural economic policies that address the real needs of our Provinces and not standard stock national uniform reactions and a few isolated projects. We applaud the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance, for recognizing the sustainable livelihood which will be one of the fundamental requirements to achieve peace and reconciliation. We have seen that the Minister is attempting to have a social market economic framework that has the potential for economic justice. We hope this message will go to all political leaders in the

Government and they will not jeopardize the credibility of this noble attempt.

There is no reason to allow these provinces to continue to languish at the expense of our own countrys growth, international reputation, peace and reconciliation. As a national priority, immediate and focused attention is required to assess the lack of real achievement in the North and East in terms of the Millennium Development Goals. Empowerment of rural communities and creating an enabling environment are fundamental for the current stage of development for sustainable socio-economic development in the North-East. These communities must have their own conductive regulatory framework which would enable them to address the key sectorial issues, rural economic infrastructures and access to local resources. Most of the national policy framework requires regional reorientation.

Strengthening of rural institutions, infrastructure development, small enterprise development and small scale sundry services development, development of women empowerment and rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-combatants by civil authorities are all pressing needs of our rural communities. We require tailor-made strategies and programmes to empower our community. We can get experiences from other conflict-emerging countries that adequate space should be created for the affected people to participate in the decision-making process, otherwise the conflict is bound to recur in a different form in the society.

We wish to express our goodwill and willingness to take positive and productive steps to the initiatives presented in the "Enterprise Sri Lanka" 2018 Budget. Vulnerable war-affected people with their psycho-social impacts are willing to utilize every means available to them. The large sums of money that poured into the province from the Diaspora, international community and the Government of Sri Lanka for the post-war recovery were sucked out from the province by these financial institutions and the retailers. The authorities who do the centralized planning did not have any empathy for the ground reality to develop post-war recovery strategies, programmes, projects and that had less than optimum results. We now have commentators who find fault with the victims.

Development must correspond to the stage of economic and social maturity for it to directly benefit the people and for it to be effective as they require certain capacity to absorb by participating in it. Therefore, we need a robust rural economic plan that reflects this reality.

"Blue Economy" was the principal livelihood of the people of the North and the East Provinces, but now that part of the ocean has been decimated. Ocean bed which opens for the Northern and Eastern Provinces is vast and it has enormous economic potential. However, outdated regulations, discrimination, quotas and processes which involves several Ministries hinder the potential for productivity, and the traditional fishing community is looking for sustainable livelihood. Lack of modern

2275 2276

technology and infrastructure, which was due to the war, has lagged these people behind and there are no cohesive policies or processes that target to explore their potentials for growth.

At the turn of this century, world leaders and the international community adopted the UN Millennium Development Goals uniting a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty by 2015. With regard to poverty alleviation, Sri Lankas achievements are noteworthy. Sri Lanka was able to achieve the MDG targets of reducing poverty rates seven years before 2015 deadline. However, despite this strong achievement, disparities in the war-affected provinces were continued and highest priority is needed to eradicate poverty and uplift their living conditions. There is no reason to allow these provinces to continue to languish at the expense of our own countrys growth, international reputation, peace and reconciliation.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! . ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to reply the Hon. Velu Kumar. Hon. Member, I understand that you

are speaking on behalf of the workers. I think this Government has taken extra steps to look after the plantation workers. You must understand that when we took over the Government, Rs. 2,875 million was outstanding of EPF. We have now reduced it to Rs. 1,400 million. We have settled over 50 per cent of that. From last year, institutions like SPC, JEDB and Elkaduwa Plantations Limited have been paying monthly EPF and ETF payments. So, now there is nothing outstanding. We have also increased wages of labourers. We are giving seven perches of land to the workers. In addition to that, we are willing to give another one acre per worker under the outgrower system. So, we are doing our job.

[6.13p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member for giving me this opportunity. Firstly, I must thank the Hon. Minister, Kabir Hashim, for improving the plantation sector which comes under his Ministry. When I went through the records, I found out that the JEDB and the SLSPC have completely paid the dues. Statutory payments had also been paid after the Hon. Ministers taking over the Ministry. So, now the statutory payments have been paid completely. I would like to thank him especially because the JEDB has started fertilizing all their lands. Therefore, in future the trees will grow faster and there will be better yields.

The only issue is that we have a small problem regarding the coconut industry, but that has arisen not because of the fault of this Government. It has arisen due to the negligence of the previous Government. Because of the negligence of the previous Government, coconut cultivation was not developed so that the production went down. I have already spoken to the Hon. Minister in this regard. So, now they will make arrangements to improve the situation within a short period and thereby the coconut yield in the Chilaw Plantations Limited and the Kurunegala Plantation Limited will improve and the coconut crisis will end soon.

Moving on to the Vote of my Leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheens Ministry, I would like to say this. In the morning I was listening to the Hon. Member, Charles Nirmalanathans speech. He was talking about Lanka Sathosa Limited. Hon. Member, I would like to tell you that before the Hon. Minister took over this Ministry, there were only 150 Sathosa outlets, but he has been able to increase it up to 370 outlets by now and his target is to increase the number of outlets up to 500. Also, we are proud to say that all items in Sathosa outlets are sold at a very low price. I would like to say that its revenue for this year is Rs. 50 billion. Therefore, I would like to remind the Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan that after the Hon. Ministers taking over this Ministry, the revenue has gone up and more than 150 new outlets have come up.

Similarly, I would now like to talk about Manthai Salts Limited, which also comes under the purview of the Hon. Minister. Before the Hon. Minister took over the Ministry, the production was only 4,000 metric tons per year. But now it has gone up to 6,000 metric tons to 8,000 metric tons and they are now earning over Rs.100 million.

I would also like to talk about the Elephant Pass Saltern, which has now started production after 26 years. So, this year they have produced 12,000 metric tons in an area of 350 acres. Mantai Salt Limited also hope to increase their production so that we will be able to stop the importation of salt, which is 40 per cent, by the year 2020. Mind you, Mantai Salt Limited is producing the best quality salt today. So, all these things are being done by this Ministry.

Also I am happy to note that the Hon. Minister also stated that he had taken steps to develop lands belong to the Cement Corporation in Mannar, Puttalam, Colpetty and KKS.

I would also like to mention to the Hon. Minister that over 5,000 acres of land, which comes under the Cement Corporation, are being neglected. I have already told the Hon. Minister to improve the quality of these lands, so that we would be able to get a profit especially from Puttalam. Further, I would like to mention about the Elephant Pass Saltern. The Hon. Charles Nirmalanadan also mentioned this in the morning. I think the Hon. Sritharan had visited that Saltern and another Member who spoke in the morning mentioned that there are a lot of employment opportunities and different communities are being employed there. I would like to say that all the communities of that area are employed in the Elephant Pass Saltern. Those people are happily employed there and there is an improvement in the saltern industry.

Also, Sir, the Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan referred to the import of liquor by the State Trading Corporation. After his statement, I checked it up with the Minister and the Chairman of the State Trading Corporation. But, what he said was wrong because the State Trading Corporation does not import liquor. Before the Hon. Minister took over this Ministry, the profit of the State Trading Corporation was Rs. 9 million. But from 2015 to 2016, the profit has gone up to Rs. 25 million, from 2016 to 2017, it has gone up to Rs. 60 million and the Hon. Minister hopes to increase it up to Rs. 90 million by next year.

I would also like to mention about the mega showroom. The previous government spent Rs. 200 million to start a mega showroom which was a failure. But, under this Government, the Hon. Minister made arrangements to start it. They spent Rs. 100 million, and hope to start it by next January, Inshallah!. All these things have been done within the period of these two years. Therefore, I am very thankful to both the Ministers and I especially would like to refer to the other Ministries which are also going into the villages to help the people. So far only a small amount of funds have been allocated to my Electorate and I hope the Hon. Minister and the

2333 2334

[ ..

2017 29

Deputy Minister, Hon. Ameer Ali, will consider our area and help our farmers in the future. We all belong to the same Party. So, I am sure he will help us - he has promised to help us - in the future. The other two Ministries are also working well as this Ministry. So, I hope they too will also help us in the future.

Thank you.

[6.59p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Chairman, I wish to thank you for allocating me time to elaborate on the performance of my Ministry today. As the Minister of Industry and Commerce, I welcome constructive criticisms and suggestions made by the Hon. Members regarding my Ministrys activities.

Sir, I shall summarize the performance of major sectors such as SMEs, business, co-operative and internal trade which come under my Ministry. I am pleased to say that to reduce duplication and to promote a uniform approach, we have clustered several institutions for the development of SMEs. The Industrial Development Board - IDB, the National Enterprise Development Authority - NEDA, the National Design Centre - NDC and the National Crafts Council - NCC - will work in co-ordination to promote entrepreneurship and SMEs in Sri Lanka. The NEDA has launched the National SME Policy, the first in Sri Lanka, this year. Since market

linkages are important for SMEs, NEDA conducted training programmes for more than 4,351 entrepreneurs. The National Design Centre also trained more than 500 designers at international level. The National Crafts Council now supports 25,877 craftsmen in the island, and also held the "Shilpa Abhimani" Presidential Awards ceremony with a representative of the World Crafts Council for the first time. The Industrial Development Board - IDB - is training nearly 10,000 SME industrialists in all electorates in the Island which also adds to youth employment vision, and Rs. 500 million has been allocated in 2017 for that purpose.

Sir, as the Hon. Srineshan mentioned, there are not many industries in the North and the East, especially SMEs. So, my Ministrys latest mini apparel industry initiative focuses on addressing this. Fifty per cent of 150 factories will be located in the North and the East. Most importantly, I am pleased to say that through the SMILE III loan scheme, we have distributed Rs. 11.5 billion for SMEs and this is one of the largest SME credit schemes in Sri Lanka.

In respect of transforming the state-owned enterprises to profitable institutions, there are many state-owned enterprises under my Ministry that were not performing well at the time I took over. But, with the introduction of new management skills and procedures, we have developed those institutions, such as the Lanka Sugar Company Limited, the Mantai Salt Limited, Laksala and the State Trading Corporation to greater levels. The Lanka Sugar Company Limited is expected to report a profit of Rs. 1.1 billion this year. It paid Rs. 2.88 billion to sugarcane farmers this year, supporting the regional economy.

The State Trading Corporation has reported Rs. 1.59 billion sales from April to September this year. Now, it has become a profit-making institution. Laksala has reported Rs. 513 million revenue till August. For the first time in the history, they have paid Income Tax also. Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Limited has reported an income of Rs. 32 million. Mantai Salt Limited has reported Rs. 52.6 million sales revenue this year. The Registrar of Companies which comes under my Ministry is now open on all seven days of the week to register companies. In 2017, it has registered 132,861 companies reporting an income of Rs. 481 million. The Measurement Units, Standard and Services Department has done 497 registrations this year.

Hon. Chairman, as far as the cooperative sector is concerned, the cooperative policy finalized in consultation with all the Provincial Co-operative Ministers was submitted to the Cabinet. The CWE has helped to stop shortages of rice and other essential items and thereby prevented price increase. The Consumer Affairs Authority has increased their raids - some of which were highly reported in the media - paid attention to 1,587 complaints and collected Rs. 64 million.

Sir, when we took over Lanka Sathosa, there were only 300 sales outlets and now it has been increased up to 400. We are targeting to increase it up to 500 by 2018.
