We are of the view that, if the words and recognized by the Council are deleted from Schedule A which relate to Chartered Engineer, Associate Engineer, Affiliate Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Diplomate and Engineering Technician (i), it would cease the inconsistency with the Constitution.

They have said that this is inconsistent with the Constitution. So, you will have to delete this portion, Hon. Leader of the House. It had not been deleted and amendments have been proposed.

[11.32 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to speak on these Regulations. I am very happy that the Hon. Minister has brought in these Regulations.

1655 1656

This issue is not limited to lands in a particular area, but it is an issue that affects almost all the lands in the country. As you know land valuations have been almost the same for so many years. Therefore, I am very happy that you are going to increase the valuation, so that as mentioned, not only the value of lands set aside for big projects but even small lands with a few perches or acres in extent would go up. This has not been done for a very long time. Therefore, we must be thankful to the Hon. Minister for doing this.

Further, I would like to mention that there are problems with regard to certain areas, especially in my Electorate. For example, in the Wanathawilluwa AGA Division in the Puttalam District - the Hon. Minister visited that area with me - there are hundreds of acres which had been cultivated before the LTTE came in. As you know, that area was affected by the LTTE problem. The LTTE came in and attacked the Eluvakulama Village and the villagers had to flee. So, there are over 600 to 700 acres of land which were used for paddy cultivation before the war. But after the war, very unfortunately, when the people went back there to cultivate the lands, they found that those lands had been taken over by the Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife. Now, the people are unable to go back there. They hold "Jayaboomi" deeds for those lands and all the deeds are there. But, unfortunately, those poor villagers cannot go back. So, I want the Hon. Minister - in fact, I will also be writing to him about this - to go into this matter and take steps to hand over whichever lands those people have been cultivating earlier on.

I must be really thankful to those villagers who had not budged an inch from that village, which had been attacked by the LTTE five times. Because of that, the Puttalam City was safe. They stood up against the LTTE for years and you are aware of that. But, very unfortunately - once again I am repeating - those lands have been taken over by the Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife and these poor villagers are unable to go back to the lands.

In addition to that, the Cement Corporation is holding 5,000 acres of those lands. But, they are digging limestone only in 45 to 50 acres of land there and it may take another 100 acres to complete it. Therefore, they should release whichever lands that do not contain the required raw materials. Even the LRC is unable to go to those lands. This is the problem that we face in that area.

Then, with regard to the Kalpitiya AGA Division, there are so many government lands occupied by private people. The AGA, along with his officers, is doing his level best to take back those lands because in Puttalam, we are unable to take over at least 15 acres to start some development work. Therefore, Hon. Minister, please be good enough to resolve the land issue in those two AGA Divisions by deploying your officers and getting those lands released. You have been to that area. You know about Kalpitiya, I need not to tell you. There, more than 400 to 500 acres are being held by individuals.

In old Eluwankulama, an area in Wanathawilluwa AGA Division, there are two places called Raalmaduwa and Thawasamaduwa, where 500 acres belong to the people. Now, those lands have been taken over by the Forest Department and they are not releasing those. You can send your officers there. There is proof to say that they have cultivated those 500 acres earlier. The lands are earmarked, even tanks are there; everything is done. So, you have to consider these facts also. In fact, as I told you, we are unable to take the LRC land back.

Then, there is the Musali AGA Division in Mannar District, where there are thousands of acres bordering Wilpattu. I would like to remind you that those poor people left their lands because of the LTTE problem. They were chased out by the LTTE. They left their lands with just Rs. 2,000 and they had to leave within two hours. Why did they leave? They did not want to separate this country. They did not listen to the LTTE. They did not want to separate the country; they wanted to live with us.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you have two minutes more. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Okay, Sir.

Therefore, please be good enough to look into this issue in Musali AGA Division. Please make arrangements to give those lands back to these people.

Thank you. [.. 77.38]

Sir, as an engineer and as a Sri Lankan, I praise the initiative to establish the Engineering Council. The Bill presented was to enhance the status of our engineers. It was challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court determined that certain parts of the Bill were against Article 121(1) of the Constitution. It also said that the inconsistencies will cease if certain Clauses are amended, and directions were given to this effect. More importantly, we believe that the amendments directed by the Supreme Court are relevant and they would end the inconsistencies within the engineering profession. Today's Amendments cater to the requirements asked by the Supreme Court and the engineers are relieved. There is no doubt that this step is essential, since it enhances the overall status of Sri Lanka's engineering profession to better levels.

More importantly, I thank all the engineers who worked hard to set up this Council and finalize the related issues and the Minister, the Hon. Champika Ranawaka for taking this initiative. I also thank the Minister, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and his Deputy, the Hon. Ajith Perera who worked hard to bring in this Bill.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan, please. You have eight minutes.
