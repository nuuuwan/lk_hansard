( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I have the highest respect for you. I appreciate the reference you made in regard to the HSBC. But, Hon. Minister, at that particular time when it was established, what amount of character assasination was made against us? I know it was not people like you. Only those who do work get this type of attack. I appreciate your taking up that point, because today, you have 3,800 job opportunities created there and another 2,000 more want BPO jobs.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

I have no hesitation in complimenting you on that, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know that and I want to reciprocate in the same way. What I am saying is, your Colleagues do not see the wood for the trees.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I do not want to be petty about this. I have paid you a compliment and said that it is a very, very good step. And, you also have to concede that whatever has been started was carried on. We have given further facilities, we have made access roads, we want to proceed on those lines. . . . , BPO operation . . . , , , . . , . , .

I know. It has turned into a loss making enterprise. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Now, we have a new administration. We are looking into that aspect. It is a joint enterprise. So, we want to put in more money and develop that. I am talking about the whole telecom sector.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

That is due to the inefficiency of the management. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If there are problems, we have to look into those problems. But, you have to admit that the success of the telecommunication sector is entirely due to us.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Will it be liberalized? ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

No. What nonsense! Do not talk nonsense. Hon. Member, you are my good Friend. Do not distort facts. You never liberalized it under late Hon. D. B. Wijetunga's administration. Everyday he was signing letters saying, Please provide a telephone connection to so-and-so; please provide a telephone line to Udunuwara; please give a telephone line to Galagedera. That is how it was during your time. You have to admit that.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa - Minister of Environment)

Priority connection letters. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Yes, priority connection letters.

I was the Secretary and there was a whole queue waiting to get a letter from the Minister to get access to a telephone connection. Those are the facts. So, we have emerged from that situation and you have to accept it. . You agree on it. ( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera also did a yeoman service to the telecommunication sector.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) He was a Minister in our Government at that time. So, what is wrong with that? He was the Deputy Minister and it was a Cabinet decision. . . ? . . Then, Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, can you take the credit personally for everything that was done by the Government? The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe had nothing to do with it; whatever you did, your Leader had nothing to do with it. Only the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya did all those things for the UNP. So, do not come up with those rubbishy arguments. This is ridiculous. - [Interruption.] No, it was during the time of a particular government. You cannot single out individuals. That is the whole trouble with the UNP. Everything is personalized.

The matter I raised was that the Sri Lanka Telecom was a profitable institution earlier. But, today it is not so.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. That is not so. Then, we cannot bring this up today. . . , , , . . . . , ?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

The Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan. - [Pause.]. Not here. Then, the next Speaker is, Hon. R. Yogarajan. [.. 11.46] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this is my first speech in the Seventh Parliament. I wish to first thank the leader of the United National Party, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, for appointing me to this Parliament to represent the people of Indian origin through the UNP. I decided to leave the Ceylon Workers Congress in November to join the UNP during the Presidential Election. This decision was taken by me after 20 years of association with the Ceylon Workers Congress because I believed that the CWC hanging on to this Government was not going to help the people of Indian origin. Sir, I thought so because I felt that this Government was not concerned about the welfare or the development of the people in the plantation sector in this country. This view of mine has been vindicated when the Government was formed this time after the General Election. This Government has done away with the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure which was the only Ministry that existed to serve the people in the plantations; to provide them with the basic facilities. This Ministry was created by the former President, Her Excellency Chandrika Kumaratunga and was given to my late leader, the Hon. Savumiamoorthy Thondaman who was able to serve these people very effectively. But, today this Government has done away with this Ministry and abandoned the development of the people of Indian origin in this country. In the Debate today, we are discussing the levy of just over Rs. 10 on every foreign call that is terminated in Sri Lanka legally. My Colleagues who spoke before me have been stating how these calls are illegally terminated in this

country and how people have been exploiting this to make money for themselves. Today, the telecommunication field and the telephone system have developed so much that it is said that 17 million telephone connections have been given. But, all 17 million may not be active today, because telecommunication companies are basing their figures on the numbers that have been given. But, there are many numbers which have become dormant today because some of the telecommunication customers have shifted service providers. However, telecommunication has developed immensely in this country not only because it was privatized and there was a lot of competition in 1995, but also because of the technical developments that have taken place in this field. Today, we are discussing about a levy on phone calls being terminated in this country. But, there are very many other means of communicating with VOIP, that is, Voice Over Internet Protocol coming in. There are many operators who are communicating today through means other than telephones. Calls are taken to telephones through internet. There are many such providers of service such as Google Talk, Skype, Delta 3, Net 2 phone, Yahoo Messenger and MSN Messenger. Today, these services are provided to the ordinary man who does not have a computer, through communication centres and they obtain very cheap phone calls to their kith and kin or business colleagues abroad. However, IDD call charges to the Middle East, where our labour is earning foreign exchange for this country, are very high. In fact, last years balance of payment deficit was fully wiped out only with what was earned by the workers who toil in the Middle East. But, international call charges to the Middle East are the highest and that is because of the same reason: in the Middle East, they charge very high termination charges. Similarly, this nine or ten rupee levy on every minute makes it more expensive for our workers in the Middle East to call Sri Lanka. Former Deputy Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Media, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, gave a lot of details about the development in the telecommunication sector and boasted about the success of the public-private partnership of the SLT. But, the SLT is today running at a loss. The SLT was running at a profit in those days when we had the SLT as the only provider of telecommunication services. They had a monopoly on telephones in this country and at that time, we had to go behind the Minister in charge of telecommunications asking for priority connections. We also had to pay monies to different people to get our telephone connections. The SLT continued to have a monopoly on international telephone calls and they were running at a profit until they had that monopoly. Today, they are unable to compete with the private sector. So, I do not know whether the public-private partnership has really succeeded or has failed.

2010 10 375 376

The mobile phone charges have been dropping everyday. As the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara said, the development in technology has made it cheaper and cheaper to provide these services and the competition between the operators has also contributed to the reduction in charges. Though the charges are reducing, the Government is increasing the taxes on mobile and stationary telephones. Every call is being charged a 25 per cent tax, as the Hon. Vijitha Herath pointed out, and as he said, the charge called the Environment Conservation Levy is a farce. It was stated in this House and I read in the newspapers that that levy would be charged because the disposal of mobile phones and their batteries would cause environmental pollution and that the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources would set up a system for the disposal of those telephones and batteries, so that environment pollution would not take place. However, this ended up as a revenue measure and not as a measure to serve the environment. But, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources collected large levies and taxes, and the former Minister used to boast that the Ministry had become a self-sustaining Ministry without providing any services in the environmental field. This, as the Hon. Vijitha Herath pointed out earlier, -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please, wind up. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I was given 10 minutes. But, I have - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, but you have finished your 10 minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan)

Anyway, as the last speaker, probably I would - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

You have taken 11 minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I further wish to state a few things about roaming charges. Roaming charges are exorbitant. The telecom companies are fleecing the customers on roaming charges.

Finally, I have another idea that I wish to put forward. With the liberalization of telecommunications, the cost of telecommunication facilities has come down. Do you not think that we should also liberalize water supply and electricity and let competition come into the field so that charges on electricity and water supply also would drop in this country? Thank you. [. . 11.57]

20.4. 20. 16. , . , . , . Mr. Presiding Member, it is very important, if we are to ensure that malnutrition is permanently eradicated from our society, that we adopt a multi-sectoral, integrated approach. The Ministries of Health, Co-operatives and Internal Trade, Agriculture, Economic Development, Finance and Planning, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and others have to adopt an integrated approach towards that with the President of the country; he being the champion and being at the highest level of the political hierarchy of Sri Lanka. He should champion a national nutrition strategy to ensure that malnutrition is completely and permanently eradicated from our society. . , , , , . There has to be a continuous and persistent monitoring process from the village, local, district and provincial levels up to the central level. , ; ; . .

Sir, I quote:

I can assure you that there is nothing that we would like more than to feel that Sinhalese, Tamils and all people in this country should form one people. I would like all people to have that in mind. There is no question of one community being inferior or superior to any other community. All people have got equal rights and we all form one people in this Island.

I now wish to move to the topic at hand. I wish to start off by congratulating the Hon. Minister of Health. No sooner did he assume office, he set out his priorities. I think the Hon. Minister was the first to admit that there in fact was a shortage of medicine, which did not occur only under this Government; from time to time we have had shortages of medicine and those shortages were rectified with medicine being immediately imported. The Hon. Minister in this connection has done precisely that. It seems absurd that we are debating this issue today because there was a shortage of medicine which has now been rectified. The Hon. Minister has set about in rectifying that situation and it has now been rectified. It is ironical that very flimsy evidence is adduced to say that so many people are dying purely based on newspaper articles and hearsay. It is amusing that certain senior Members of this House expect certain health officials to be sacked; some of them to be convicted for corruption, without any proof being produced before this House, but merely on newspaper articles which we have all read. In this connection I would like to say that the Ministry of Health and the new Minister have done much to steer this country in the right direction. Let us take for instance, the recent flood that caused havoc in many parts of this country including the Gampaha District, which I represent. You will recall Mr. Presiding Member, that sanitary food and water were made available to those people very fast by the relevant Ministry and the other institutions and ministries of this Government. It is usual that after a flood, waterborne diseases spread: cholera, dysentery typhoid and so on. However, such waterborne diseases did not spread and epidemic conditions did not take place after the flood which took place a few weeks ago. Why was this? It was largely due to the fact that the Ministry of Health and the other relevant ministries took immediate steps, issued public health warnings and went to those communities with sanitary food and water. I must also state that there was a raging war in this country and soon after the war, we found many internally displaced people and thousands living in temporary shelters. There was no vast epidemic where people died of unsanitary conditions. I think this was partly due to the efficiency of the Ministry of Health which nobody gives them credit for and I think one should give credit where credit is due. The recent rains will also naturally bring about an increase in mosquito-borne diseases, because we know with rains mosquito larva increase and mosquitoes increase and thereby mosquito-borne diseases increase. However what is encouraging is, the new Minister of

Health has not only assumed office, but he has also begun his anti-dengue crusade; he had begun this last week and this is before the disease reaches epidemic levels. But, what is ironical here is that certain Members seem to be talking about dengue as if it started during our Government, during the last few years which is absurd. However, I would take on the constructive suggestion made by certain Opposition Members, like the Hon. Sajith Premadasa referring to malnutrition. In this context, the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle put the picture in the right context and said, malnutrition has gone down over the years and continues to. In comparison with the rest of the subcontinent, Sri Lankas percentage and levels of malnutrition seem very good. But, this is no reason to be complacent. I think we should do everything in our power to ensure that malnutrition is eradicated. In this context, I would just like to make a suggestion that we commence at grass-roots levels with cottage industries. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I am sorry to intervene in your maiden attempt, but I think you have to now kindly wind up.

( ) (The Hon.Vasantha Senanayake) Okay, Sir. Introduction of dairy products like milk, eggs and even mushrooms, which have a very high content in proteins, iron and vitamins, is one way in which we can bring about nutrition to the grass-roots level.

I wish to thank the House for giving me this opportunity. ( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) , . . . . , -- . . .
