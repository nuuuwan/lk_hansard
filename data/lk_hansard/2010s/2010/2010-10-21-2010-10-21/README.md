Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak a few words on the four Orders brought in under the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Act. The late Hon. V. Kumaraswamy, former MP for Chavakachcheri, in the early 1950s said that he would take Mahaweli water to the

Northern Province. Now, it has become almost a reality. The Hon. P. Dayaratna was in Jaffna and he knows the condition of the people there. They do not have a pot of water in their houses. They have to go two or three miles away to bring some water to drink. There was a suggestion made to take water from the Iranamadu Camp to Jaffna. That is impossible because the water in the Iranamadu Camp is sufficient only for the Kilinochchi people. We want to give water to the Jaffna people, to the Northern Province. Please see that the Mahaweli water is directed to Jaffna as well. I kindly request the Hon. Minister - ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Member, now we have got the World Bank funding for the feasibility study of the NCP Canal. Through the NCP Canal, taking the excess water from Malwathu Oya to the North will be a priority in my Ministry. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. That is all I have to say. Once again, I would request the Minister to make this a reality. [. . 2.36]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I just want to say a few things in regard to these Orders that have been brought in by the Hon. Minister to Parliament, seeking to declare certain areas described in the Schedule as Special Areas. I observe from a description of the areas that some of these areas are in the North-East, particularly in the North. I am happy that the Hon. Minister is here.

The accelerated Mahaweli programme started around 1977, when the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake was the Minister for Mahaweli Development. There were a

number of schemes implemented in different parts of the country, and substantial extents of land were developed and given to landless peasants in those areas. We all know that. We also know that in most of these schemes, the majority of the land extent was given to persons of one community, because they were the persons who were living in those areas. In some instances, as much as 98, 99 or 100 per cent - exceeding 95 per cent - were given to persons of one community, the majority community, because they were the persons living in the areas in which development took place.

Now, it would appear that there is a proposal to give irrigation facilities to lands in the North-East, particularly in some parts of the North. I would therefore impress upon the Hon. Minister that when land alienation takes place in these parts, you must try to ensure that persons who have not got lands thus far, who are landless people and who live in the areas which are being developed, are given land and that in the allocation of land it is so done as not to radically change the demographic composition of those areas. That is fundamental; that is necessary in the interest of peace, in the interest of goodwill and in the interest of reconciliation, which now everybody talks about.

You must also bear in mind that in substantial extents of area developed under the Mahaweli, thus far land has been given to persons of the majority community. I do not complain about that because that development took place in the areas where they lived. But, persons of the minority communities have not got land in those areas. That factor must also be borne in mind when alienation of land is done under the areas, which are now to be designated as Special Areas.

I thought it is necessary to state this matter on the Floor of the House, because I think the Hon. Minister should be made aware of this and he must bear this matter in mind if ever you start alienation of land in these areas consequent to irrigation facilities being made available.

Thank you, Sir. [. . 3.41]
