asked the Minister of Disaster Management:

(a) Will he state- (i) the number of people affected due to the torrential rains that occurred during the period from 17th to 24th May, 2010, throughout the country ; and (ii) the names of the districts that the affected people belong to? (b) Will he inform this House- (i) the measures that had been taken by the Ministry of Disaster Management on prevention of such flood situations et cetera prior to his appointment as the Minister; and (ii) the preventive measures to be implemented in the future to prevent rain flooding in the aforesaid areas? (c) Will he also state- (i) the amount of money spent on the affected people; (ii) the cost per person; (iii) the purposes which money was spent for; and (iv) the amount of money allocated to the Ministry this year for relief work? (c) If not, why?

... ( )

( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Disaster Management) Hon. Member, as it is a detailed Answer, with your permission, may I table it? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Sir, I table* the Answer. * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) 148,718 families.

629,347 people.

(ii) District No. of affected People 1. Colombo 167,820 2. Gampaha 208,716 3. Kalutara 88,687 4. Galle 114,385 5. Puttalam 8,658

6. Ratnapura 14,052 7. Matara 26,028 8. Kurunegala 1,001

Total 629,347

(b) (i) Details are given in Annex 01.

(ii) Details are given in Annex 02.

(c) (i) District Released allocation (Rs.)

1. Colombo 22,000,000 2. Gampaha 12,400,000 3. Kalutara 18,664,876 4. Ratnapura 2,500,000 5. Matara 5,860,000

6. Galle 25,000,000

7. Puttalam 1,000,000

8. Kurunegala 1,249,244

Total 88,674,120

(ii) Approximately Rs. 140.90. But as relief is provided to a family unit and releasing allocations has not been completed yet, the calculated expense per person is not accurate.

(iii) * To provided cooked meals and dry rations.

* To provide assistances for fully damaged and partially damaged houses.

* To provide assistances for crop damages which are not covered by any insurance scheme.

* To provide funeral expenses for the people who died from a disaster.

(iv) Rs. 245.5 million.

(d) Does not arise.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I would appreciate if you could answer part (c) of the Question?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) In the Colombo District - 22,000,000; Gampaha District - 12,400,000; Kalutara District - 18,664,876; Ratnapura District - 2,500,000; Matara District - 5,860,000; Galle District - 25,000,000; Puttalam District - 1,000,000 and Kurunegala District - 1,249,244, totalling up to 88,674,120.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, what is the cost per person?

697 698

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) The cost per person, of course, cannot be worked out properly, but it costs us Rs. 140.90 for a family. It is very difficult to work it out per individual. It will take some time if I try to do that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) May I ask the first supplementary question, Hon. Minister? I know it is difficult to answer, but we have to ask the question. You mentioned that 629,347 people have been displaced due to the rain and Rs. 88 million has been allocated for all the districts. So, in effect, for five or six days of torrential rain, you spent only Rs. 80 a person.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Approximately Rs. 140 per family.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, Rs. 140 for a family. So each family has maybe three or four persons. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Maybe two or three, but we do not know exactly and there were a number of other institutions that supplied the food. Now, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa was able to get some dry rations from the WFP. Like that, there were institutions that came forward and gave us assistance. This is the amount of money that the Ministry has spent. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I know that you are a practical politician. I am sure you will understand the ludicrousness of the answer. You mentioned that 629,347 people were displaced and you have spent Rs. 88 million on them. You say that it costs Rs.140 per family, and if there had been four days of floods, each day you have spent only Rs. 10 per person. How can they afford to live with this amount?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) You work it out and see. It is not the cost per person. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I got the answer before you tabled it and that is why I am asking supplementary questions.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) That is not so. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not want to put you into trouble, but I only want to show you that this is the absurdity of the allocation that was made for the people who have been devastated by rain. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) We had allocated Rs. 248 million. We have allocated the money. But, we have spent only Rs. 88 million. The requirement was that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You and I know how much has been given to the Colombo District. I know that it is not your problem. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Okay, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My next question, Hon. Minister, is this. You would know that with the slightest rain, floods are a recurring detriment in the Colombo District. What is the permanent solution to overcome this?

699 700

2010 05

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) We have a plan. We are cleaning up all the canals. Even this morning, the Bloemendhal Road Canal was cleaned up. Most of the canals have already been cleaned up and we want to see that they are maintained properly in order drain out the rain water and any other waste water. So, in future, I think there will be less floods in the Colombo District as well as the other districts. There is a JICA project in the Kalutara District as well as the Gampaha District. So, with those projects working out, within the next two years this problem of floods will be solved. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .
