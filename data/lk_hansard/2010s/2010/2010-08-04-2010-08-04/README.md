( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, this is a very timely piece of legislation, the object of which is to reduce the laws delays. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental problems in the country with regard to the administration of justice is the long delay that occurs in dispensing justice. The introduction of this legislation is one of several measures which the Government is taking in order to address this problem. In 2006, the Provincial High Courts were vested with appellate civil jurisdiction. At that time there was a backlog of more than 5,000 cases. Then, Mr. Speaker, in 2007, action was taken to increase the number of High Court Judges from 40 to 60. Today, we find that even that number is insufficient and the purpose of the present legislation is to increase the number of High Court Judges, as the Hon. Minister of Justice explained, from 60

to 75. I think some other measures are necessary in order to achieve this objective and I am aware that the Minister of Justice is giving his attention to further reforms in this field. One of the desirable reforms would be to put in place certain pre-trial procedures in order to identify the essential issues to cut down drastically the time that is spent in court addressing these matters. That method has been very successful in other countries and I think Sri Lanka, at this stage of our development, can benefit very substantially from the introduction of properly-structured pre-trial procedures and I am very happy that the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne is giving priority to formulating a systematic policy in this regard.

There is one other matter, Mr. Speaker, which I would like to refer to. Perhaps more than 50 per cent of the Judges serving the Republic today have been my students when I was a Professor of Law. I would like to say that the vast majority of these persons are men and women of the highest integrity who, according to their conscience, are trying to do a difficult job. It is a matter for deep regret that in the recent past there have been vitriolic attacks on Judges on the Floor of Parliament. I think this is profoundly unsatisfactory, Mr. Speaker, for several reasons. The first reason is that these are people who do not have the right of reply here. Their reputations are tarnished beyond repair. This involves a large measure of personal hardship and injustice. But, apart from that, apart from the anguish that is sustained by individuals, this has a far wider dimension which affects the vital interest of Sri Lanka at this time. If we denigrate our judiciary, if we attack our judiciary, if we lower the judiciary of this country in the esteem of Sri Lankas people, then, that is a course of action which has very significant international repercussions. Those persons who are trying to do harm to this country will then use that situation in order to argue that international tribunals should step in because our own judiciary is inadequate and it is corrupt. All the allegations that have been made here will only strengthen the hands of those forces who wish to do this country very serious harm at this time. So, Mr. Speaker, particularly because of my background as a teacher of law - I have taught judges when they were reading for the Degree of Bachelor of Laws. I have also taught many of them when they were candidates for the Master of Laws Degree and Judges of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Court of Appeal including the Chief Justice have been my students - I think it is my duty as their teacher, not so much as a Cabinet Minister, to say that irresponsible and vicious attacks on the judiciary apart from being harsh and unjust with regard to the individuals concerned, would also inflict a very substantial measure of damage on the reputation of this country, which will serve the interests of none other than the people who wish us ill; who want to attack this country; who want to strengthen forces that are opposed to the well-being of this country and that is a course of action which Members of Parliament, whatever party they may belong to, should in my respectful submission, desist from. So, I would like to make that point with emphasis, Mr. Speaker.

531 532

I would also like to deal with some other issues which are of very considerable public importance at this moment and they warrant the attention of this august Assembly. It is a matter for deep regret and these are issues that straddle boundaries between political parties. They impinge vitally on the national interest. Today, languishing in our prisons, in remand custody, are a very large number of people who have lost their freedom for no other reason than their poverty. They have been condemned to pay fines. They do not have the financial resources to pay those fines, and the reason why they are deprived of their freedom is that they do not have the money to pay fines. Even in my time as Minister of Justice, I found the situation deplorable. Today, it is much worse. I think there must be an attempt to formulate certain criteria with regard to sentencing. In any case, I think it is very unsatisfactory to put a person in remand jail only because he cannot pay a fine.These are -[Interruption.] Yes, I think suitable measures have to be found to deal with the situation. I am not talking of a few people. I am talking of a very large number who are clogging up the prisons. This goes - [Interruption.] Yes, exactly and this is contrary to all the principles of sentencing policy. It is contrary to basic principles underpinning the administration of criminal justice. It criminalizes people. They are brought into close association with hardened criminals and what is most important is the social repercussions on the family. It is not so much the individual but the family that is punished. The family is deprived of resources for their mere subsistence. The wife suffers; the children suffer and the social consequences are horrendous. So, this is a matter that calls for urgent attention and I would strongly urge that all of us together, irrespective of party differences, should address this as a national issue and find pragmatic solutions to alleviate the hardship of persons who have lost their freedom simply because they do not have the money to pay the fines.

It is also necessary, Mr. Speaker, to address specific issues connected with children who find themselves as witnesses, as plaintiffs or as defendants in criminal proceedings. Particularly given the culture of Sri Lanka, the harm that befalls them may last throughout their lives. It is therefore necessary, as in some other countries, to find other ways of dealing with these situations without bringing them to court, without subjecting them to cross-examination, special procedures which respect the privacy of the child, procedures which give priority to protecting the reputation, the good name of the child in order to make sure that the future of that child is not jeopardized in any manner whatsoever.

Then, Mr. Speaker, some other matters are worth thinking about. One of these is the frequent complaint that there are too many acquittals in our country. It is sometimes suggested that it is difficult to control the spread of crime because it is only in a very small number

of instances that persons who are indicted for serious crimes are actually found guilty and the argument is that the number of acquittals is unacceptably high. During the long period when I served as a Member of the Law Commission of Sri Lanka, it was more than 10 years when I was Professor of Law of the University of Colombo, at that time Mr. Speaker, I made sustained efforts to bring about certain changes in the Law of Evidence.

I think most people would agree that there is no logical reason to exclude confessions which are true and which are voluntary, simply because those confessions were made to a police officer. If a man commits a crime and of his own accord, without any duress, without any pressure or inducement, he confesses that crime to a police officer, or while he is in police custody, is there any logical reason at all why that confession should not be admitted as evidence against him? Unfortunately, the law of Sri Lanka in this regard has not changed since 1898. The Evidence Ordinance was enacted in 1898. The Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code also belong to the Nineteenth Century. Sri Lankan society has changed fundamentally since then. But, in keeping with those changes we have failed to make corresponding modifications of the Criminal Law and the Law of Evidence. In 1898, societys attitude to a police officer was basically different from what it is today. The assumption then was that a police officer would induce terror in the mind of the suspect and there is reason to believe that any confession that is made to a police officer is involuntary. But, in other jurisdictions like England and the United States, the criterion that is used is a criterion of truth and spontaneity. If a confession is voluntary, it does not matter whom the confession is made to. It can be made to a family member, it can be made to a priest, it can be made to a friend or to a police officer, it makes no difference at all; the criterion is whether the confession was true. Why are we shutting out valuable evidence which can bring about convictions of people who are guilty, people who are a danger to society? Therefore, our law is tarnished by archaic principles, principles which are no longer consistent with the conditions of contemporary society. I think therefore, these matters have to be elevated above the level of party strife and we have to take a long hard look at the nature of the laws that govern us.

We have to do that and at the same time we have to increase a number of judges. We have also to provide judges with opportunities for continuing training, especially in new fields like intellectual property, commercial law, land use and utilization, sentencing policy. In countries of the West, even judges of the highest courts have the advantage of these programmes of training from time to time. I think today it is a dire need in Sri Lanka. Our judges are basically very competent. There is no doubt about it. I think our judges, I say without fear of contradiction, Mr. Speaker, again as a teacher of these judges, that they can hold their own

533 534

[ () . . ]

2010 04

with their brethren in any part of the world. They lack nothing in terms of intellectual sensitivity and perception. But, we have to equip them, we have to put at their disposal, the resources and the facilities that would enable them to discharge their responsibilities with total acceptance to the community. That is why I am myself particularly perturbed about the tenor, and the substance of some of the attacks which have been made on the Floor of this House against judges who have no right of defence. And, it is precisely those attacks that are exploited with ulterior motives by those who wish to argue that the Sri Lankan judiciary is not working. There is a lacuna; that vacuum has to be filled by the intervention of foreign tribunals. It is a dangerous path to follow and it is fraught with great danger to the independence, the good name, the integrity of the Republic of Sri Lanka. So, my plea to you, Mr. Speaker, and through you to the Members of this House is that we must today take an objective and dispassionate view of the manner in which the criminal justice system is working: what are its good points, what are the deficiencies and shortcomings and what are the practical measures that are opportune today to deal with those issues and to get the country the benefit of the criminal justice system.

With those words, Mr. Speaker, I would commend this legislation as exceedingly opportune and beneficial. I would like to congratulate my Friend, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne, Minister of Justice and I would encourage him to go further along this road and to consider other reforms on the lines which I have indicated. I thank you, Mr. Speaker.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Then, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. .

, [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. PIYANKARA JAYARATNE] took the Chair. [. . 2.24] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am glad to participate in this Debate on the Amendment to the Judicature Act, to increase the maximum number of High Court Judges from 60 to 75.

There is no doubt that we need more judges. The Hon. Minister of Justice made a very valid point that in order to dispose of the large number of cases that are pending in courts, we need more judges. However, I would like to raise the issue as to how fast this backlog has been thus far cleared after the increase of the number from 40 to 60. It goes without saying that a mere increase in the number of judges would not help the administration or the due administration of justice. We need more than that.

I am glad the Hon. Minister of External Affairs repeatedly took ownership for the competence of our judges, that many of them have been his students. He also made a plea that the judges of our country be not subject to unreasonable attacks. As one who walks the corridors of Hulftsdorp everyday, I would have been the first to raise that concern and defend the integrity of the judiciary. Unfortunately though I am not in a position to do that and it is a sad fact that I am unable to do that, I would have very much liked to raise that cry myself and plead not to subject the judges to ridicule or comment adversely on their conduct. Persons earn respect by their conduct; it cannot just be artificially conferred on them. The society judges the character, the impartiality and the integrity of our judges by the way they go about their business, the way they act, hear cases and so on. So, if there is a belief today that one does not get justice in the courts, I am afraid our judges also have to share the due blame for that. The delay is not only in the original courts. In the original courts, particularly in civil litigation, the Hon. Minister for Justice was right in pointing out, there are long delays. Those delays have continued to be and despite well-meaning efforts by various sectors, including the Law Commission, over several years, have not abated. So, one must look a little deeper and find out what really causes these delays. I agree with the Hon. Minister of External Affairs that continuous training of judges without sounding patronizing is a sine qua non, and that must happen.

But, it also has something else to be addressed. On the 5th of May, in this House, I raised an issue with regard to particular proceedings that are pending in the Supreme Court now for over a year: an application that was filed on behalf of the internally displaced persons who were confined forcibly to the camps in Cheddikulam without any authority of the law. No remand order or even detention orders were made under the Emergency Regulations and about 49,000 of them still remain in those camps. The point I made in the month of May is that on an application before the Supreme Court ordinarily for leave to proceed, an order is either granted or refused on the same day. But, here is a case where for over a year now, no order has been made; no date has been given. What is the cause for the laws delays there? It has nothing to do with lack of judges, nothing even to do with the competence of the judges. We are talking about the Supreme Court here. It has got something to do with something else and I think all of us will be better off if we identify that "something else".

535 536

The increase in the number of High Court Judges is welcome, as I said at the outset. But, I want to make a plea to the Hon. Minister of Justice, that when more judges are appointed, that care is taken to appoint judges who are proficient in Tamil because right now, High Court Judges who are not proficient in Tamil have been sent to areas to hear the first civil appeal and all the cases are getting delayed there, not for lack of Judges. A judge is there, but he cannot read or understand the brief that comes before him. I am not saying that you must send Tamil judges to Tamil areas. No. Send judges who are proficient in Tamil to Tamil areas and judges who are proficient in the Sinhala language, to areas where the original court work and the records are maintained in the Sinhala language so that at least the salutary provision that we now have, that the first appeal is heard and determined in the province itself, can take place without undue delay. By the time it comes for a second appeal to the Supreme Court, perhaps translations will become necessary. Translations are very costly; a medium-sized appeal brief will cost about Rs. 75,000 to be translated.

So, the whole object of devolving judicial power, of enabling the provincial High Court to hear civil appeals in the first instance, is lost if the judge concerned is not competent in the language in which the court records are kept in that district or province. So, with the increase of the number of judges from 60 to 75, I hope more judges who are proficient in the Tamil language will be appointed. I say that because when we raised this matter with His Excellency the President, the response was that there are not enough Tamil-speaking judges to be appointed to these areas. So, now with the cadre being increased, certainly there is provision for the appointment of judges who can function in the Tamil language We have had many eminent Sinhalese gentlemen who were conversant in Tamil and have functioned as judges in those areas and it will be a good gesture if a Sinhala judge who is proficient in Tamil is sent to those areas. So, I make that point all over again that in the areas where a particular language is declared to be the language of court, please appoint High Court Judges particularly because they exercise original criminal jurisdiction as well as the first civil appellate jurisdiction, so that the work of the courts can go on without any undue delay.

I want to wind up also stating about the sad spectacle we saw in this House when the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was on his feet, and when he raised the issue about persons taking the law into their own hands functioning like judges, dishing out sentences like binding people to trees, there was a howl of protest from the Government Benches. All this time I thought it was only one or two individuals who behaved in this manner, who thought this was the way to go; perhaps they know no better. But, to find the entire Government Bench agreeing with this kind of lawlessness, unlawful activity, was very discouraging. This is not a matter that one can laugh

about. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs also pleaded that our judges are competent, our system of justice is fine, there need not be foreign interference and so on. But, if one looks at how these things happen in our country, if one were to just read the newspapers of today, would any person from any civilized jurisdiction be satisfied that the administration of justice is being done properly in this country?

Thank you very much.

[. . 4.36] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, justice delayed is justice denied! Today, in accordance with this axiom, the Minister of Justice, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne, has done a very meritorious act in this House.

Not for decades but for centuries, people have paid scant regard to the dispensation of justice. The long delays in courts put the clients into grave hardships. People have to travel from the Eastern Province, the Northern Province, - from all over the island - to Colombo seeking justice spending large sums of money, which they can ill-afford.

I now remember two great names, one was Justice Alhaj M.M. Abdul Cader of Jaffna fame and Justice A.M. Ameen. The Secretary-General may know them well since he himself had been on the Bench and is now serving this House well. Justice Abdul Cader, Sir, at certain circumstances, fell into trouble when he was on the Bench in Matara. The lawyers there almost waged war against him because he was so quick in entering judgments. They complained that they were not afforded sufficient time to even prepare their briefs. The same thing was true of Justice A.M. Ameen of Ahadiya fame. There are judges of this high calibre from all communities, Tamil, Sinhala, Muslim and even from the Malay and Burgher communities. Sir, successive governments have failed to bring legislations to help litigants. The Hon. Athauda Seneviratne has done a great service by bringing in this praiseworthy legislation. He seeks to establish 63 High Courts throughout the Island.

Now, there is another aspect of judiciary in this country. I refer to the Quazi Courts. I would dwell much on this subject.

Sir, the Holy Quran is a book of justice. The Hadees or the Teachings of the Holy Prophet is also part of Islamic law and jurisprudence. Then, there is a unique process of justice prevalent in Sri Lanka. This must be remembered, Sir. I remember even the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena once pointed out in this House, that the laws of the Holy Quran and Sunnah have been incorporated into the law of the land. Legislations have been enacted from time to time for this. That is why I say

579 580

that our country is unique in this respect. In certain other countries, Islamic Laws exist separately from the established law of the land.

The Marriage and Divorce (Muslim) Act was passed in Parliament in 1951 but was implemented with effect from 1954. It is common ground that a set of laws and procedures codified in this Act which was enacted 59 years ago need certain modifications, in keeping with the changes in social and economic conditions, which the Muslim community has experienced since the latter half of the 20th Century, while of course, keeping in mind that the Shariah Laws are based on the Holy Quran, as I said before, the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammed Sallallahu Alaihiwasallam, the consensus of his companions and analogical decisions of the jurists.

Then, Sir, it is recorded in history that despite severe religious persecutions during the period of the Portuguese and the Dutch suzerainty over the Maritime Provinces of Sri Lanka, people were being converted from one religion to another - proselytization - Muslims never gave up their religion. They fled to the hill country. What did the Sinhala kings do? They embraced the Muslims, gave them land and other giftts necessary for them to live harmoniously and peacefully with the large majority of the Sinhala community in this country. This is a fact that must be told to the whole world. It must be reminded and re-reminded that we are part and parcel of this country. We lived amicably and peacefully with the rest of the people, even in places like the Eastern Province and the Northern Province.

It is recorded in history, as I told you, that during the period of the Dutch and the Portuguese suzerainty over the Maritime Provinces of Sri Lanka, the Muslims continued to enjoy the freedom to follow the uncodified customary laws, and for this purpose the religious schools, more fully described as "Madrasas", had been of great assistance. These Madrasas have been given another connotation in the modern world by the Western Powers. They call the Madrasas, the dens of terrorists. Definitely, it is not so. Madrasas are places of teaching

religious laws. , Madrasas . Only religious laws are taught there. Even I had been to a Madrasa. Sir, those days, when we were small, we were sent to a Lebbe in a Madrasa to study the Holy Quran : ", , , " -( ). Lebbe Ummas - lady teachers taught in these places. I was taught by a Malay Lebbe Umma - lady teacher. They were not qualified Moulavis, but they taught the basic Principles of Islam and the Holy Quran to children.

Then, here is a great lady, Dr. Lorna Devarja, who, in her book, The Muslims of Sri Lanka - One Thousand Years of Ethnic Harmony 900-1915 in paragraph 3 of

page 35 though gives credence to this state of affairs, goes on to stress that due to harassment at the hands of the uncompromising Portuguese and the Dutch - they were the people who harassed the Muslims. Even today, the Western Power is doing this to us. That is what we call, Western conspiracy which harms all the ethnic groups and even the elected Government of this country - the guidance from these Madrasas started dwindling and there was no proper implementation of Shariah Laws prior to 1770.

Since even the Muslim lawyers possessed very scant knowledge of the principles of Muslim Law regarding succession et cetera and obtaining opinions of experts also proved unreliable, in 1912 the Supreme Court decided to consult standard textbooks on questions of law when the code was silent. Writing in the Ceylon Law Recorder 1919, Justice M.T. Akbar, one of the eminent Sri Lankans who even helped Lord Soulbury to find a picturesque place to build the Peradeniya University - even a Hall has been named in his honour in the Peradeniya Campus - however characterized it as a calamity from the point of view of the development of Muslim Law in Ceylon.

Then, Sir, the Government for fear of criticism of interfering with the Muslim laws -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have one more minute.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I have 10 minutes.

Sir, I would like to table* a document titled "History of Muslim Personal Law Reforms of Sri Lanka" by Alhaj S.M.A. Jabbar, ex-Chairman of the Quazi Board of Review.

From time to time, there have been clarifications and modifications in the Islamic law and in the dispensation of justice as far as the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act of 1951,the Quazi Court and Wakf Boards are concerned. Also, I have a book here with me, Sir. I must mention about it. Yesterday, I met the Special Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council, Mr. Omar Kamil. He handed over the Al-Ameen Law Report to me. In it, it is very clearly mentioned that Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act, No. 51 of 1956 has been included in this codification. It is very helpful and is of assistance to the busy practitioners, judges, mosques

trustees and administrators to keep abreast of the amendments that have from time to time been made to this Act since its enactment, says Mr. Saleem Marsoof, Supreme Court Judge and a very enlightened Jurist in this country, who is also a Presidents Counsel.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please wind up, Hon. Member.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That Report was written, I must say, by Mr. M.H. Gouzul Ameen. It is very well codified. What I would request from the Hon. Minister at this moment is that the Quazi Courts - since they are now judicial appointments - be upgraded; their status be raised up. They must be given proper clerical assistance like any other judges in any court in this country. Sometimes, they function in garages and places like that. It is not in keeping with the status of the law and the dignity of their office. Therefore, I would also very seriously urge the Hon. Minister to look into this aspect and help to uplift the Quazi Courts, so that the Quazis will also be on par with the officers who are dispensing justice in this country. Thank you, Sir.

, . .Question put, and agreed to. , ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M AZWER took the Chair.

[. . 5.06] ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Mr. Presiding Member, this is a very important amendment to the Judicature Act. Perhaps all of you may be aware, prior to 2007 people from all over the country had to come to Colombo to an Appellate Court. This Government, as a government that has understood the grievances of the poor litigants living in far away places, decided to bring in an amendment and start civil appellate courts. Civil Appellate Courts were set up in 2008. You may be aware that final orders given to cases by District Courts as far back as in 1994 were pending determination in the Court of Appeal. But, with this amendment, those cases that were filed in the Court of Appeal were transferred from the Court of Appeal to the relevant provincial civil appellate courts. As a result, tenant cultivators and various people who had land problems who suffered due to inordinate delay in determinations, are now in a position to obtain relief. In 2008, the number of High Court Judges was increased from 40 to 60 and by this amendment that number will be go up to 75. I must

say that this will not only benefit litigants but also our judicial system and the profession. But, of course in implementing this amendment merely by increasing the number of judges to 75, we cannot deliver the expectations of the litigants and the general public of this country. This is only a single step of a long and massive process of the Government to set up provincial civil appellate courts and other institutes.

We have to think of the recruitment of mudliyars, other staff and also setting up of buildings. It is indeed a costly affair. Also, I must say that there are other practical difficulties that the profession and the system are faced with due to decentralization. The Hon. Minister has already drawn his attention to most of these problems. On days when these matters were heard by the Court of Appeal, the most important cases were recorded and reported. But now, since these cases are heard in the respective areas, there may be some inconsistency in the judgments given by the various civil appellate courts. That, on the one hand, helps advancement of law. But, practically to-date, there is no system to report these cases for the benefit of the litigants to get the benefit of such decisions given by various appellate court judges. Therefore, I propose that a system be introduced to report these judgments and communicate to the members of the profession and to the general public. This Government has not only considered the aspirations and expectations of the general public and the litigants. Now the war has come to an end. Sri Lanka is one of the safest countries to invest. Sri Lanka is now one of the safest countries for tourists. For investments to come into the country, we are ready with labour, unskilled and skilled. We are ready to provide electricity; we are ready to provide water and other facilities. Ample land is available. We have won investor confidence. But, at the same time we must think of a proper, effective legal framework and a system.

Now, the Government is contemplating. We are in the process of amending our laws in order to suit development of commerce and industry. As at now, jurisdiction of Intellectual Property Act is restricted to Colombo. The jurisdiction of Companies Act is restricted to the Colombo Commercial High Court and the jurisdiction of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act is restricted to the Colombo High Court No. 1 and arbitration enforcement can only be exercised by the Colombo High Court No. 1.

As you may all know, Hambantota Port is almost complete and 60 per cent of construction of Oluvil Port has also been completed. The Galle Port expansion is taking place. It is the right time now to decentralize admiralty jurisdiction in order to facilitate investors and industry. The Commercial High Court should also go to the villages and to the provinces to promote industry and commerce. We have now given thought and in time to come, these also will be implemented by this Government.

Simplification of procedures is a must. Long years back, during the kings time, we had a system of legal administration. During that time, cases were heard and the decisions were given the same day. We had our own way; we had our own system. But unfortunately, since we decided to follow the Roman-Dutch Law, English Law and various other laws that are practised elsewhere in the world, laws delays started. Unfortunately, during the past so many years, when amending laws, we have always reprinted in verbatim various pieces of laws followed by various other countries. It is now the right time for us to make use of Sri Lankan legal expertise when amending Sri Lankan law.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, it is the right time to wind up also.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Yes. I will wind up within a few minutes.

Today, so many Members of the Opposition were criticizing the judiciary and the Attorney-Generals Department. As a former member of the Attorney-Generals Department, I must say this. The Hon. Member was referring to the Attorney-General giving instructions to withhold inquiry. Hon. Member, it is part of the Attorney-Generals role to advise police in any criminal matter when IB extracts are referred to the Attorney-General. Hon. Presiding Member, the process has to stay till the Attorney-Generals opinion is given; advice is given. So, these are simple things and anyone aggrieved can make representations to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General being a quasi-judicial officer, is vested with these powers.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) I appeal to the Members of the Opposition to speak responsibly. If there is an instance where you are not satisfied of a judgment, criticize that judgment constructively. Do not attack or sling mud against judges. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to second the Adjournment Motion, which is on a very important subject. Many of the Government servants are eagerly waiting until these anomalies are eradicated.

I would also like to point out that the 20 per cent bonus interest that was promised to the senior citizens as an election pledge just before the Presidential Election; that senior citizens over 60 years would have a 20 per cent bonus on their interest, was paid for six months and from the 1st of July, it has been suspended. There are many pensioners who withdrew their monies from different institutions in which they had deposited money and brought that to the banks with the expectation of getting this 20 per cent bonus interest. But today, they are crying that they have been misled. The election promise which was given by the President has been violated. This is a very serious situation, Sir. They are making representations to us asking us to urge the Government to continue this bonus scheme from August.

... ( )

( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs) May I reply if the Hon. Member permits me? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) This bonus interest that was given for nearly one year - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) For six months. It started in January. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) It will be continued. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Are you giving an assurance?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Yes. There had not been an official announcement.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I do not know. But, it was paid and then stopped. It was stated in your policy report.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) There was a press report which stated that it will be stopped. But, the Government does not want to stop it; it will continue.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The news report I saw was that the President had told the Central Bank to submit a report with regard to the payment of this interest. Nowhere did it say that the it is going to be resumed, unless the Hon. Minister is giving an assurance. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The Government is goint to continue with that concept.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is a promise given by you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) I must tell you that the Government has not taken a decision to stop it.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Then, are you paying it for July?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) We are considering continuing it.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is the point. - [Interruption.] Please give an assurance in this House because the pensioners are eagerly waiting to get this additional income, despite the anomalies that are existing in the pension scheme.

The second matter I want to point out is with regard to the Golden Key depositors money. Most of these pensioners who got their commuted pension went and dumped the money in the Golden Key. There was a

615 616

Supreme Court decision that the assets of Golden Key should be liquidated and the depositors' money should be settled. Under phase I, they have paid one Rupees one lakh each. Now, nearly 20 months have lapsed since the collapse of that institution; but only 100,000 has been paid to them. The question is that - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) It is completely irrelevant. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no, these are pensioners monies. So, do not say it is irrelevent. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) You cannot canvass it here. This is completely irrelevant. This is a matter that is completely outside the purview of it. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) If you analyse the depositors, the majority of them are pensioners. Since the Adjournment Motion concerns pensioners, I am mentioning it and you may take it into consideration. Now, 20 months have lapsed but they have not been paid off. There is no attempt being made to liquidate the assets.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The fact is, people have gone and deposited their money with a private individual.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only half a minute more. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) That is a transaction between the depositor and the banker.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, I agree.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) You have to accept it. [Interruption.] The Government has nothing to do with that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no. There is a responsibility by the Central Bank to ensure that these institutions pay out the money of the depositors. There is a Supreme Court decision - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is running out. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, I know. These are the two matters that I would like to raise. Please resume the 20 per cent bonus interest, on one side, and make sure that the Golden Key depositors get their money by liquidating their assets, on the other.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Dilan Perera please. You have 10 minutes.
