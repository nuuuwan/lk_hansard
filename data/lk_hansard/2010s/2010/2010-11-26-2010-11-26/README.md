, . , . . The Government wants the private sector to transfer the gratuity payment of the employees to the Central Bank to set up an Employees' Pension Fund. Sir, they say companies will go bankrupt by this move. . . . . The gratuity is only a provision in the books. . . Companies have not put aside money for gratuity to transfer them to the Central Bank. . . . The Board of Management of the Fund should comprise unions of the private sector. , . The Central Bank and the Governors are already being accused of mismanaging the EPF and ETF.

The public has no confidence that the Government could manage their gratuity contributions. . The Government should refrain from taking over gratuity contributions from the private sector and it should let the private sector to manage their employees gratuity. . Also, the Government should not burden the poor workers by taking away 2 per cent from their salaries to set up an Employees' Pension Fund. . The Government has not provided any relief to them. By now, they should have come up with the Emoyees Insurance Scheme. . Also, no relief has been provided to the thousands of garment workers who lose their jobs. The workings of this Fund should be tabled in Parliament. . . . .

. . . . . , . , . . . . Sir, before I conclude my speech, I would like to quote the opening lines from the famous novel, A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. [ ] , . In a sense, these opening lines create a sense of sweeping possibilities to our nation in the present scenario and in the background of the Budget. Sir, I quote:

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times........."

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) , . English literature . I quote :

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of

wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief,

it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter

of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the

other way ......."

To hell. So, Mr. Speaker, this sums up the gloomy and the grim situation in our country. ? The poor and the downtrodden are having the worst of times whilst the favorites and the psychopaths of the Government are having the best of times. . , .It is the season of Light for psychopaths of this regime whilst it is the season of Darkness for the downtrodden. The rich and the psychopaths are going direct to the heaven. While Mervyn Silva will go to heaven, the poor and the downtrodden are all going direct the other way, to hell. Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) , . .

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the UPFA has traditionally been a centre-left party. It is an alliance of leftist parties including the SLFP, MEP, LSSP, the Communist Party and so on. Its policies have been traditionally influenced by socialist ideology. But, after listening to President Mahinda Rajapaksas Budget Speech the other day, it has left me to question whether the UPFA has distanced itself from its traditional leftist principles and is now embracing capitalism.

I say this because it is evident that this Budget has catered more towards the Colombo businessmen than the ordinary citizens of Sri Lanka. It is ironic and somewhat hypocritical that this Government, which is quick to brand us, the UNPers as has themselves forgotten and has drafted this Budget just to please the Colombo 7 businessmen.

Some economic experts have gone on to say that this Budget is more a UNP Budget than a UPFA Budget. I beg to differ. If this Budget were to be a UNP Budget, it would have been far more precise, detailed and professionally presented and most importantly, it would not have forgotten the needs of the common man.

809 810

But, if what these experts are saying is true, then I must presume that the UNP crossovers have more influence over the President than the SLFP stalwarts who are in this Parliament. Not only are these crossovers enjoying extra perks and incentives but most importantly, they all have the ear of the President.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, in the past few days, my Colleague, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe and I have been attending various seminars and discussions on this Budget. In all fairness, I must say that those who represented the private sector were ecstatic about this Budget; they laud the Government for bringing forward an investor-driven Budget; they acclaimed the Government for presenting a development Budget and they praised the Government for producing a private sector Budget. But, once the lectures, the discussions and the praising were over, these very individuals, were to say in private, that though the Government had good intentions, they are skeptical whether the Government can deliver what they have promised in this Budget.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, one would then ask, how can we attract foreign investors to this country if our private sector has no confidence in this Government? President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his speech has proposed to cancel the BOI approvals granted before the 30th of June, this year. This proposal, I would say, is unfair to investors who had their proposals approved and will also send a negative signal to prospective foreign investors. If we are to attract foreign investments to this country, we have to make sure that the business environment in Sri Lanka is conducive to a potential investor.

Another factor that needs to change is the foreign policy of this Government. No longer can we afford to antagonize the West. In the past, we saw demonstrations outside embassies where protestors urged by Government Ministers, burned effigies of Western leaders and their country flags. We saw a Minister engaged in a fast unto death in front of the UN Office. We saw European diplomats refused entry to this country. We need to rebuild these bridges that have been burnt in the past. We cannot only look towards the East for foreign investments, but also towards the West.

The losing of the GSP concession has indeed affected our garment industry. Hundreds of garment factories in the industrial zones have shut their operations in Sri Lanka. Some have taken their factories to neighbouring India, Bangladesh and Vietnam. As a result, thousands of garment employees have been made redundant. Nowhere in the Budget Speech has the President given any thought to these unemployed garment workers.

The ailing garment industry has also been affected by the strengthening of the rupee. Garment exporters are finding it hard to sell their products in the international

market. The proposal to increase the electricity tariff by 8 per cent will also have an adverse effect on not only the garment industry but other manufacturing industries in Sri Lanka.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is unclear how this Government is to achieve its revenue of Rs. 986 billion by the next year as predicted in the Budget. While I commend this Government for bringing down the taxes and thereby giving some relief to the middle and the upper middle classes, I presume the Government will also lose a considerable amount of revenue by doing so.

Is the Government not taking a risk by expecting foreign investment to boost its revenues? What if the envisaged investment does not materialize? What then? Are we to borrow more from commercial loans and increase the already rising debt in this country?

I am sorry to say that the Presidents speech creates more questions in the minds of the people than giving answers to the problems of the people. For example, it is still unclear whether the Employees Pension Fund that the President proposed is to run parallel to the Employees' Provident Fund or whether the EPF is to be incorporated into the Employees Pension Fund? The President has proposed three forms of pension funds; one for employees, one for the migrant workers and the third, for the elderly and informal sector.

While I commend the Presidents proposal to set up such a pension fund, one must ask whether these funds will also be used as a source for borrowing by the Government in the near future. It is widely speculated among the business community that the Government has mismanaged the funds from the EPF. If so, I do hope that these pension funds will not suffer the same fate.

All in all, while the corporate sector is relatively happy with this Budget, the ordinary man feels let down. The Government servants who were promised a pay hike of Rs. 2,500 have had their hopes dashed by this Budget. Instead of a wage increase, they have been given a Cost of Living Allowance of Rs. 600. But then, the Government has increased the electricity tariffs by 8 per cent and what the Government giveth, the Government taketh away because this Rs. 600 will eventually go to pay their electricity bills.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, can I raise a point to cross your entries? The President while delivering the Budget Speech has very clearly stated on page 96, under paragraph No. 54, I quote:

We are grateful for the assistance extended by the Prime Minister of India to build 50,000 houses. The Government has also mobilized funding through donor agencies, friendly countries and its own budgetary resources to rehabilitate further 80,000 houses.

Therefore, I wish to state to you very categorically that all the preliminary work that has to be done to go into the construction phase has been concluded. I am saying this with a lot of responsibility. The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa has also gone there and you will see that within the next 20 days, construction of a thousand houses in one go will commence and we will conclude a total of about 150,000 houses.

( () - , ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa - Deputy Minister of Water Supply and Drainage) Hon. Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the people of Hambantota, we offer our sincerest and best felicitations on His Excellencys assumption of office as President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for his Second Term.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa is the "Peoples President"; a man for rights; a champion of the rural masses; a beacon of light; a great leader of par excellence who freed the country from the shackles of war and made the people of Sri Lanka breathe the air of freedom. His vision, farsightedness and forwardness through the programmes envisaged in the Mahinda Chintana - 2005

859 860

2010 26

are bearing fruit and the people of Sri Lanka are able to enjoy them freely and without any obstacles. All his promises are being kept.

Sri Lanka is today emerging as an economic power in South Asia through the multifaceted development programmes initiated by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Presidents focus has now shifted from the battlefield to the farm. The theme today is to win the war against poverty by economic development not only in urban areas but in all the 16,000 villages scattered over the country where 80 per cent of our people live. These villages had been neglected from the time of colonial rule. The rural people must receive their due share of prosperity with the development of the country. This is the solemn thinking of His Excellency the President. No other leader, so far, has brought development strategies and programmes equitably to all parts of the country be it North, South, West or East. In his mission there is no room for communal hatred, communal disharmony or differences of caste, creed, race or religion. Not only has he preached these principles but he is practising them. His aim is to make Sri Lanka the "Wonder of Asia" by making it the hub of development in all areas.

This is the First Budget after His Excellency the President assumed office for a Second Term on 19th November. This is really a Peoples Budget. It has been prepared taking into consideration the views of the public, trade chambers, Members of Parliament and progress review meetings of all nine provinces. It reflects the peoples wishes and aims. It is not a Budget thrust upon the people but made of their aspirations. The main objectives are reducing poverty, inflation and unemployment. The Budget Proposals mainly focuses on reducing the cost of living, improving and enhancing the Public and private infrastructure development through partnership and providing relief to the people.

The Budget Proposals aim to develop the country as a whole with the accent on rural development and not only of development in the urban sector. The Government has ensured that people in every village have access to electricity, road linkages, safe drinking water, telecommunication facilities, market places and townships. Towards this end, the Government had been able to complete 72,105 small projects at a cost of Rs. 27,888 million during the period 2006 to 2010. Up to now, about 11.9 million people have been benefited by these projects.

The country is unified. There is no room for separation. Today, we have stability. People have the utmost faith in His Excellency the President and have given him the mandate to develop the country. The UPFA Government has now a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Through these empowerments, the President is able to go forward with development goals.

Some of the key indicators show that Sri Lanka is progressing rapidly and will be the leading nation in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The poverty rate has been reduced. The per capita income has risen. The GDP growth rate is 7.6 per cent. Unemployment has dropped to 5.5 per cent. Access to electricity in the rural sector had increased to 83.2 per cent in 2009 and it has reached the estate sector. Access to safe drinking water has increased countrywide. School attendance by children of rural and urban areas has now reached almost 100 per cent while in estate areas, it is 97.4 per cent.

Sir, you would, I am sure, recall the sad stories of the rural farmers who were unable to sell their paddy at reasonable prices and were being exploited by the middleman. They could not get Rs. 10 for a kilo of paddy. But, this Government has ensured the purchase price of paddy in the range of Rs. 24 to 28 per kilo. Not only the paddy farmers, but also farmers of other crops such as maize, onions, potatoes and soya beans are able to get higher prices. I wish to mention here that many of the farmers of the Hambantota District are direct beneficiaries of these price increases.

Higher fertilizer prices had been a major obstacle for paddy production. This too was overcome by the Government offering fertilizer at Rs. 350 per 50-kilo bag to paddy farmers. Dairy farmers were only able to sell a litre of fresh milk at Rs. 18. But, now they are able to get Rs. 44 for a litre of milk. The growers of major crops such as tea, rubber, coconut and spices too get higher prices for their products.

There was speculation and anxiety about the resettlement of the IDPs in the North. In fact, it became the subject for discussion by the UN, international agencies, regional powers and NGOs apart from pressure extended by local political parties. It was a great surprise that the UPFA Government was able to resettle about 260,000 people within a period of two and a half years and only 15,000 now remain to be resettled. This is remarkable. The credit goes to President Mahinda Rajapaksa not only for ending the war, but also for implementing humanitarian projects and programmes simultaneously, which has brought back vast farmlands into production. The Government has implemented a US Dollar 2 billion reconstruction programme in the North, which is expected to be completed by 2012.

People will acknowledge and accept that the country has progressed economically only if they enjoy a share of its development. Hitherto there was no one single ministry which was directly responsible for economic development. It was President Mahinda Rajapaksa who created the Ministry of Economic Development to achieve progress through coordinated policies and programmes. These in turn, have paved the way for

861 862

targeted economic development goals. At this juncture, I am happy to say that this Ministry headed by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa has ensured that every institution achieve its target as scheduled. We are happy to note that tourism has boomed by 36 per cent during the last 10 months, and it is expected that Sri Lanka will receive six lakhs of tourists by the end of this year. Tourist zones are being carved out in the North, the East and the North Western Provinces to promote tourism. Both local and foreign investors are offered incentives and concessions. Infrastructure development in these regions will be implemented through Uthuru Wasanthaya, Nagenahira Navodaya and other programmes.

Education is necessary for our children. The Presidents goal is to create a knowledge-based society. Rs. 54 billion has been voted in this Budget for education and health. This shows the Governments commitment to enhance educational facilities and create a healthy society.

The Budget also proposes development of our universities with a massive vote of Rs. 3,000 million from 2011. A survey of development activities since 2006 reveals that infrastructure development has been at the top in irrigation, power supply, fisheries, roads, tourism, ports and aviation and the housing sectors. The Uma Oya, Moragahakanda and Deduru Oya Irrigation Projects are some of the key projects that can irrigate over 80,000 hectares. The people of Hambantota, Badulla and Moneragala will be benefited greatly by the Uma Oya Irrigation Project. The Magampura Port commissioned by His Excellency is another bold initiative of this Government. This will create 25,000 job opportunities. The unemployed youth in the area will be greatly benefited. It is also proposed to create industrial zones around this harbour on 20,000 hectares of land which will enable the people in the area to earn a better income. The Ruhunupura Water Supply Development Project will benefit 75,000 people in the Hambantota District. Other water supply schemes including Hambantota, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Mutur will benefit another 220,000 households.

Another area which has received the special attention of His Excellency the President is the plantation industry. The Budgetary proposals include several incentives to tea, rubber and coconut industries to improve production and expand cultivation. It is significant to note a subsidy of Rs. 50,000 per hectare has been announced for the tea smallholders to encourage replanting and new planting.

Along with the development proposals, the Budget has also offered several benefits to low-income families. Women and children will be greatly benefited from the expanded Thriposha Programme which will reach deserving mothers. The monthly allowances granted to

the elderly, the handicapped, the victims of terrorism and the vulnerable in society will be enhanced. Disabled children and the other worthy citizens in Samurdhi will get increased the monthly allowances.

Sir, before I conclude, I wish to mention that the proposal to introduce an Employees Pension Fund to provide post-retirement pensions to employees in the private and corporate sector is a welcome move, which will greatly benefit the working class. His Excellency the President who was a former Minister of Labour has clearly understood the hardships and concerns of Public servants. The proposal to grant a 5 per cent increase as a non-pensionable allowance to all Public servants and the security forces is very much appreciated. Pensioners too will receive an increased Cost-of-Living Allowance. This illustrates the commitment of His Excellency the President towards the working class. As His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa embarks on a new era of leadership, let us all join together with our beloved Leader to make Sri Lanka the Wonder of Asia.

Thank you.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is with great pleasure that I participate in the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget 2011 presented by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa as the First Budget of his Second Term. It is also the maiden speech that I am making after having joined this administration, particularly in the aftermath of the support that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress' Parliamentary Group gave for the Eighteenth Amendment, which for all purposes, further strengthened this administration and which was acknowledged by His Excellency the President himself.

One of the remarkable features of His Excellencys public posture is that he is open and transparent about his political programmes. In his speech to the nation, which was made after having taken Oaths for the Second Term, he very categorically thanked the nation and reasoned out the background for bringing in the Eighteenth Amendment, where he referred to the inevitable instability that would result in the Second Term of a President, however strong that mandate may be, simply because of the reason that convulsions do occur within political parties when there is a tussle for succession. We, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, did ponder and reflect upon this predicament and we have taken a very pragmatic decision to support his administration in the national interest, which concluded a very difficult military expedition and which for all purposes, was looked upon very pessimistically by many, including

ourselves on the other side. I must be very frank and open about my convictions as a politician.

If we are to speak about President Mahinda Rajapaksas resolve and his deep commitment, he was somebody who pursued his development programmes despite the fact that he had to prosecute a very difficult war against one of the most ruthless terrorist outfits in the world. The manner in which the war was pursued, there were many brickbats that were thrown at his administration. It is still in the process of overcoming them. But, today we have to look at things much more pragmatically; we have to look at this issue with an eye on serious reconciliation.

I was listening to one of the TNA Members who was speaking a while ago and he was full of acrimony. He was questioning the justification of certain programmes that are being implemented in the North and the East. This Government is trying to develop this country as a hub in five different areas : an aviation hub, a shipping hub, a hub for energy, a knowledge hub and a hub for commercial activity. There again, we see that the massive infrastructure projects that this Government initiated while pursuing the war, are due to come to conclusion within this year or during the course of next year. The Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, the Upper Kotmale Hydro Power Project, the Hambantota Port Development Project, the Southern Highway Project, the Uma-Oya Project, all of which would be, to a certain extent, going towards enhancing our capability in becoming the hub in the region, where the other small-time countries like Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and Dubai were far behind us 30 to 40 years ago.

Today, we are in a very important geo-political strategic location. Though there are difficulties, look at the manner in which this administration is juggling its foreign policy. We see the Foreign Minister of India currently in this country and in a few days' time, the President of Pakistan is to make a visit. The Chinese Deputy Prime Minister was one of the honoured guests during the inauguration of the Second Term of his Excellency the President, all of which indicate the keen interest the geo-political rivals are showing in our tiny nation. But, it is not an easy thing to chart your international politics cautiously and carefully among various contending forces. We must say that in charting that course, His Excellency the President has been engaging in a very tricky three-piece act and I must say he has succeeded in doing that. His suave political moves, not only locally but also internationally, we must accept, will stand in good stead in attracting that necessary Foreign Direct Investment to this country. Though there is a lot of criticism that a substantial amount of FDI has not come into the country. The forward-looking macroeconomic policies of this administration laid out in this Budget, which will be further expanded in the coming years, would certainly

869 870

enhance the capacity of this administration to bring in the necessary amount of Foreign Direct Investment and boost the forward-looking economic prospects of this country. We are also conscious of the fact that it is not only the infrastructure projects that would bring in lasting contentment and reconciliation in this country but we need to pursue the effort of reconciliation with zeal and commitment. We have to be sensitive to the concerns of the minorities. I, who represent an important segment in this country with eight Members of Parliament, a party which has a predominant mandate from the Muslims of this country, am very keen that we also make the integration process in the post-conflict era, a very balanced and equitable one. But, that again is not a very easy process. His Excellency the President in his inaugural speech, which was made after he took Oaths for the Second Term, made a few commitments, which being translated into action, I am sure, would go a long way in healing the wounds inflicted on some communities. In some of the minority Members on the other side, we still do not see the integrity of the argument. But, yet I am sure, with the co-operation and the necessary dedication, all of us can achieve the necessary objectives to chart a different course to achieve national unity and promote a culture of politics, which would be devoid of acrimony, which would not be bent on any other remorseful objects, but aim at building a united nation. In that, I am sure the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress in taking this decision, we have very carefully looked at the need to play a pragmatic role and also have a serious introspection about our own ideology in working with an administration which pursues a programme of actions which is aimed at post-conflict development and reconciliation. I am sure His Excellency the President and his administration would pay heed to the concerns that would be raised by us, and I am sure we have the independence to talk about the grievances of our community, as well as of all the rest who feel marginalized. It would be natural that in an accelerated development drive, there would be many issues that come up, which will threaten to disturb that harmony that everybody hopes would be built in this post-conflict era.

I do not want to speak too much on this occasion. There are matters that I must deal with during the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of my Ministry. But, particularly, just this matter alone I will advert to. His Excellency the President, in this Budget has allocated a very handsome sum of Rs. 400 million simply for the purpose of implementing a programme to prevent the prolonging legal disputes and to resolve them expeditiously. There is a large backlog of cases which is estimated to be in the range of 650,000. In clustering that programme, the subheading that has been given for that is Consumer Safety Network. I think it is a very appropriate title within which this issue has been brought in. In fact, this is one of the first projects that we would very eagerly implement in order to get rid of the laws

delays by providing the necessary comfort to the litigants in trying to have their disputes resolved expeditiously through our court system. There are many other matters - [Interruption.] Yes, Sir, definitely. We are looking at various reforms. In fact, I will deal with it during the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of my Ministry.

Having said that Mr. Presiding Member, I must once again say that it is with a deep sense of introspection that we have joined this administration in the hope that the programme of reconciliation and nation building will take place in an atmosphere of harmony and friendship, which everybody is praying for.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Minister. . 20 .

First of all, I would like to say a few words in English because I want to respond to certain statements made by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran yesterday, in this House. He said that the Government's top priority was for resettlement but it is not reflected in the Budget. He was speaking in English and there were foreign dignitaries in the Gallery and thereby he was transmitting his message to the entire world. But, I must tell that the Government in this Budget has set apart Rs. 5 billion for the resettlement in the Northern area and also Rs. 1 billion for resettlement in the Eastern area. Also, as far as the regional developments are concerned, a sum of Rs. 50 billion for Uthuru Wasanthaya and a sum of Rs. 26 billion for Negenahira Udanaya have been set apart, when compared to Wayamba and Rajarata, where they have set apart only Rs. 18 billion and Rs. 17 billion respectively.

He also cited another example and stated that in Kilinochchi, some persons have been deprived of lighting lamps for a Hindu festival. Here, I think he was implying religious discrimination against the Hindus. But, I must remind him that for the last three and a half decades, even when the war was at peak, when the Sinhalese could not go beyond Vavuniya or beyond Anuradhapura, there were Tamil Hindus here who were pulling the vel carts for the last three and a half decades without any interruption. So, this religious discrimination is false propaganda made up by people like the Hon. Member.

He also said that there are forced settlements by the Government in the Jaffna Peninsula and the Government is artificially creating some changes in the demography. But, that is also not true because whoever is going to settle down in Jaffna are the people who have roots there. There were Tamils, there were Sinhalese, there were Muslims in the Jaffna Peninsula and whoever now goes there are the people who have some roots there.

Also, I must tell him that when you take into consideration the 1981 and 2001 census, there has been a 40 per cent increase in the Tamil population in Colombo. Therefore, what happened to the demography in that

case? So, I think people like the Hon. Sumanthiran should have their facts corrected and refrain from making these types of false statements to the world community.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, Erskine May, in his famous book, "Parliamentary Practice and Procedure" has stated that the conduct and behaviour of the Members should be regulated by the Chair. Now, Sir, there has been a breach of order in this House. That must be brought to your notice and you have to inform that to the Hon. Speaker. Sir, Standing Order No. 77(1) states, I quote:

"Any member ............ who has committed any breach of order not specified in these Orders may be proceeded against in any way Parliament thinks fit............".

I do not want to proceed any further. Now, Sir, the breach of order committed by the Member who just spoke was, he brought an alien item into this House. This is a very bad precedent. If other Members also try to do this, you will not have an orderliness in this House. Therefore, Sir, that product must be confiscated. According to the Standing Orders, his bringing in an alien item into the House is a breach of order. Breach of order is specified very clearly in the Standing Orders and it has been stated over and over again by Erskine May. The product must be confiscated and the conduct of the Member must be brought to the notice of the Hon. Speaker.

937 938

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I heard you, Hon. Member. I have taken that into consideration and the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara has handed it over to the Secretary-General. Therefore, it does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Thank you very much Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . [ ]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, since there is a breach of order, that product must be confiscated.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We have warned him and taken over the telephone. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Action must be taken against him.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We will do that, if he repeats. This is the first time.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That must be recorded, Sir.
