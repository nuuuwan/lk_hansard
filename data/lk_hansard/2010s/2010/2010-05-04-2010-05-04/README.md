ENGLISH TEXT OF THE SPEECH Mr. Speaker, as the 14th Prime Minister to take office after the Independence gained by liberating Sri Lanka from the imperialist rule and as the first Prime Minister to be appointed by His Excellency the President, subsequent to the first election held after making the country that was engulfed by brutal terrorism for three decades an independent, free and unitary one; expressing my respectful thanks to His Excellency, I rise here on the Floor of this House before these Hon. Members of Parliament with great humbleness mingled with a deep sense of respect.

First, I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude again to His Excellency the President, the former Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, Voters of Kandy District and the Hon. Members of the Government and the Opposition of this House and through them to the Sri Lankan people for entrusting me with this huge responsibility, placing great faith in me. I will endeavour to fulfill the responsibility entrusted upon me to the best of my ability in keeping with Mahinda Chintana constantly keeping in mind the noble objectives and worthy examples left by the great leaders who were bestowed upon this country and especially of the late Prime Minister, Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. I honestly look forward to your generous co-operation, guidance and goodwill in that respect. I beg you to join me in fulfilling those duties and responsibilities. I, who have signed as the 13th member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that was founded in September 1951, reached this office along a long and arduous path trekked with the common masses. With the strength of character that has been tempered by victory and defeat, good times and bad, and bouquets and brick-bracks that were endowed upon me from time to time, I am committed to make Sri Lanka The Wonder of Asia again, with an immense wealth of political experience gained during a period of sixty years which is over three-fourths of my age. Even though I volunteered to give up several opportunities that came my way to contest at general elections, to pave way for others, in 1970 on the earnest requests of able politicians such as Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Hon. T. B. Ilangaratne and Hon. T.B. Tennakoon, I contested Gampola Electorate and emerged victorious. On that day - on 22nd June 1970 - making my maiden speech in Parliament, I stated, I have come from Gampola Kingdom which was also called Gangasiripura, a very ancient kingdom and sheltered heroic individuals and artistes who acted to secure a place of honour for the Sinhalese language, culture and civilization. The majority of the people in the Gampola Electorate that I represent are farmers, others are labourers. I, an ordinary person, could get elected as the Member representing that electorate. I am glad that I, an ordinary man, have got this opportunity to participate in this Debate in this august Assembly. I find great pleasure in the fact that those few words stand valid even for today. In our country, we live in a society, which consists of people who speak different languages and practise different religions. All of us are human beings. My ambition is to protect that humanity. My effort is to ensure peoples unity and honour while recognizing races, religions and languages as they are and respecting them. The Ambuluwawa bio-diversity and religious centre created by me can be cited as a fine example for that.

[ . . ]

2010 04 21 22

There, we have provided opportunity for those of all races and religions to function with equal dignity and recognition. Therefore, let us join hands to live in unity, preserving the unitary state the country has come to enjoy and to work as one to regain the prosperity and take our nation and posterity towards the bountiful future envisioned by Mahinda Chintana. This country of ours is a great holy land. We have been blessed by nature. We have fertile land adorned by majestic forests and scenic beauty where rains come on time. Specially, this country can boast of various climatic conditions. We do not experience violent storms, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. As a result of the courage and fearlessness of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa whom we have been fortunate to be gifted with, brutal terrorism that was a curse upon the country has been eliminated and he did so with the noble determination that was voiced by Hon. John F. Kennedy once, We will shoulder any burden; we will go through any amount of suffering; we will help any friend; we will challenge any foe. The only challenge before us now is to build a prosperous country rich in everything required for sustenance and free of scarcity like The Granary of the East of ancient times. All plans required for that have been put forth clearly through Mahinda Chintana. We have to implement those plans without delay and the necessary financial provisions will be made by the coming budget. His Excellency the President is determined to make our country The Pearl of the Asian Continent again. As an initial step required for that, developing Sri Lanka as a five-fold global centre of naval, air, commercial and trade activities and knowledge has already been commenced. Policies and strategies are being formulated to re-establish our civility, hospitality and discipline that were praised by the foreigner Robert Knox about four hundred years back. Our civilization that was founded based on irrigation culture, possessed the highest technology in the world with respect to irrigation works. The concept of farmer being fit for even kingship once mud is washed off him came from this country. The sole requirement of our farmer community is water. It is with great pleasure that I inform you that we have realized the future value of the water resource and taken measures to nurture and provide it to the farmer community. We have also initiated work on creating a Sri Lanka which conserves flora and fauna with the Ambuluwawa bio-diversity centre that I created as the base, and we intend to base our society on our heritage, the tank and the paddy field. Steps have been taken to strengthen the

efforts to provide western and indigenous medical care to the Sri Lankan community equally to make them entitled to health, the greatest wealth of all as preached by Lord Buddha. It is the bounden duty of us, the Members of Parliament, to take action to protect the political freedom of our people, our most valuable resource, bring about economic strength and social progress, treat all communities such as Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher and Malay equally and respect the views of the public. I wish to tell you that I will be fully committed to do so. Party politics is essential for democracy. I consider that it is very important for groups and individuals who are not party to the government to give the guidance necessary for the peoples well-being by putting forth intelligent, rational and constructive criticism and views with relevance to matters moved by the Government. I also wish to remind you that it is the responsibility of all Members of the Government and the Opposition to conduct themselves in such a manner that the honour of Parliament, the supreme body that governs the country, is protected. We are very glad that a large number of young neophyte Members of Parliament have been elected. Undoubtedly, all of them will receive the blessings of Mr. Speaker in putting parliamentary traditions into practice. I wish a happy and prosperous future for all of you and the people of Sri Lanka.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I take this opportunity to thank you for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Speaker and also extend my sincere New Year greetings to the Members of this House. As far as the Prime Minister is concerned, he is a long-standing and experienced politician and he has never practised racial politics. I also wish to mention an important matter in this House before I speak on the state of Emergency. Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence has made a statement recently that the Tamil National Alliance should be banned and this was subsequently endorsed by the Secretary, Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The Defence Secretary, according to the statement published recently in "The Island" newspaper, has also spoken about security of this House. He is a senior Public Servant and he is not expected to make such political statements. I do not know whether the Establishments Code has recently been amended to enable senior Public Servants to dabble in politics. I want the Hon. Prime Minister to take note of this. The Tamil National Alliance, consisting of 14 Members of Parliament, represent the will and voice of the Tamil people in the North and the East and we vehemently oppose the extension of the state of Emergency for another one month. The state of Emergency can be declared only when there is an emergency situation prevailing in the country. As such, declaration of a state of Emergency is not necessary now. Special laws, namely, Prevention of Terrorism Act and Emergency Regulations, give wide powers to the security forces and as a result human rights violations have been committed. There are illegal arrests, abductions for ransom, robberies and extra judicial killings in Jaffna. A series of kidnappings, murders and rapes in Jaffna have sparked fears among residents that an organized group could be behind these incidents. According to the police, there have been at least two killings, one rape and two attempted kidnappings over the past month. In early March, 2010, an O/L student, Kapilanath was abducted and brutally killed at Chavakachcheri after his parents refused to pay a ransom of Rs. 300 million.

This week, a gang abducted two people from Gurunagar namely, B. Maheshwaran, a motorcar mechanic and S. Mahendran, an electronic engineer, demanding Rupees five million and Rupees two million respectively from the relatives. The police with the assistance of the relatives were able to track down three suspects and the victims in an abandoned Government building close to Jaffna town. Earlier this month, an internally displaced teenage girl was gang-raped while on her way to visit relatives at Manipay. At Kondavil on Friday, two men on a motorcycle attempted to grab a teenage girl, but were forced to flee after villagers intervened. Police said that they were investigating to find out whether former militants were behind these incidents. Further, one T. Ajith Kumar, aged 13, at Manipay Camp was abducted in a black van when he was playing outside the camp and when he raised cries, he was released. On the 2nd of May, 2010, one Sivalingam Satheeshan, aged 26, of Thunpalai near Nelliyadi was shot dead by two persons who came on a motorbicycle. Extrajudicial killings and abductions have become very common in Jaffna. I would like to mention that what we have in Jaffna now is an army rule and not a civil administration. These crimes are taking place only under the Emergency rule. Then, the abduction and arrest of Stephan Sunderaraj. He was a Programme Manager of the Centre for Human Rights Development. He was abducted by some unknown gunmen in army uniform in Colombo on 07th May, 2009. He was released on the same day by the Magistrate, Fort under case No. MC B 330/09. In the evening, when he was travelling with his family in a car, it was followed up to the Kollupitiya Police Station by two persons on a motorbicycle. Thereafter, at about 6.00 p.m. when they were approaching the Town Hall Junction, just passed the Buddhist Ladies College, the persons travelling on the motorbicycle blocked their way and simultaneously a white van approached close to them. Then, four to five persons allegedly in army uniform opened the vehicle by force in which the above person was travelling and took him away in that vehicle. His present whereabouts are still not known. It is apt to mention here that soon after the abduction, the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Palitha Kohona, at a meeting with the US Embassy and European Union officials confirmed that it was an arrest and not an abduction. Further, he said that the above person was in State custody. His present whereabouts are not known and his parents want to find out where this person is being kept. The powers given to the security forces by these special laws, namely the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Regulations, are being misused by the police and the army. These special laws help the police

2010 04 41 42

and the security forces to make money. For instance, one Gnanasunderam Jeyasunderam, aged 52, a Sri Lankan married to an Irish national, holding an Irish passport, a father of three children and a director of a company known as Multi Lami Pack (Polythene) on Galle Road, Panadura was taken into custody when he came to Sri Lanka on the 04th of September, 2007 at the Katunayake Airport by the police officers attached to the Terrorist Investigation Division, Colombo and he is still being detained under police custody. Another director of that company is a Sinhalese. We were told that he was kept on a detention order issued by the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order under the Emergency Regulations for a period of one year and two months from the date of his arrest. Thereafter, he has been detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. This person, who is a foreigner, has been detained and incarcerated in a police station for the last two years and seven months. He has not yet been produced before the Magistrate, Colombo and sent to fiscal custody. Is this not a flagrant violation of his fundamental rights? This has been made possible by the so-called Emergency Regulations. In this connection, I wish to mention that this matter was referred to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Committee after getting the necessary information and response from the Government, an opinion has been expressed that this is an illegal arrest and he should be released. I filed a Fundamental Rights Application in the Supreme Court and it is still pending. The Amnesty International has on several occasions requested the Government to remove the Emergency rules and get rid of the draconian Emergency laws which have allowed widespread human rights abuses to continue for decades. The Amnesty International has now called on the Sri Lankan Government to lift the state of Emergency that has been in force almost continuously since 1971 and to abolish the Prevention of Terrorism Act and other associated security laws and regulations. It has also called on the new Parliament to replace the draconian set of regulations with human rights-friendly laws. Madhu Malhotra, Amnesty International's Deputy Director of the Asia-Pacific Programme said, "The Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Public Security Ordinance and other emergency provisions in Sri Lanka enable the security forces to systematically violate human rights. The Amnesty International has further requested the release of people detained under the Emergency laws. This country has been continuously under the Emergency rule from 1971 except for a short period when late President Premadasa allowed the Emergency Regulations to lapse. Insurgents were given amnesty and released in 1981. After the Indo-Lanka Accord, Tamil prisoners were given amnesty and released. In the same manner, I request the Government and the Hon. Prime Minister to show goodwill and release all the Tamil prisoners who are in custody now by giving them

amnesty. Out of 300,000 persons who were herded together behind barbed wire fence, I understand 10,000 have been selected and are being detained in an undisclosed destination. I want those persons also to be released. The last Parliamentary Election was held under Emergency rule and it was not held in a free and fair manner in some areas. What happened in Nawalapitiya? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Hon. Member, you have two minutes more. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy)

In 39 polling stations, the agents of the opposition party were not allowed to go and the police were also there. They did not prevent them being chased out and a re-poll was ordered. Even in the Northern Province, only the candidates contesting under the "Betel" symbol were allowed to go and canvass in the islands and others were not allowed to go there. Even on the election day, the SPOs were not allowed to check the identity cards of the voters. As these draconian Emergency laws are used only against the Tamil-speaking people, I earnestly request every Tamil-speaking Member of Parliament, both from the Opposition and the Government, to vote against the extension of the state of Emergency. I also want the Opposition parties to vote against the extension of the state of Emergency. Thank you.

[ () . . ]

. , . , . . . . . . , . . , ; . , . , . , . . , . , . , . . , , . , , . , , . Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, if we consider what are the regulations that we are now dispensing with, I think any objective person will agree that that covers a very significant segment of the total purview of the Emergency Regulations. We are today in a position to dispense with the majority, the vast majority of Emergency Regulations which have been in force in this country for an unbroken period spanning four years and eight months. Today the ground situation has changed. But, we cannot go from hundred to zero; we cannot go from one end of the spectrum to the other. That would be a course of action that would smack of irresponsibility. We also have to do the right thing at the right time. Had we taken this step one year ago, the danger, the risk that would have been generated by that course of action would be unacceptable. But, today we are in a situation to consider objectively and dispassionately the ground

situation in the country, to weigh in the balance the competing claims of security and liberty. After all, Mr. Deputy Chairman, that has been a dilemma which has characterized human history from the earliest times up to the present day. Whether we speak of Attic, Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages or some of the most difficult problems that have arisen in the contemporary world, the right equilibrium, the balance that has to be struck between these competing elements of public policy is a vital matter which has underpinned the Governments approach in making this decision. I would like to explain to you what are the matters in respect of which we think that the Emergency Regulations can be wholly dispensed with without any detriment to vital security interests of the nation. Mr. Deputy Chairman, take for example, curfew. Curfew restricts liberty, freedom in many ways. Of course, it was necessary at that time. Nobody in this House, I venture to suggest, will argue that the military action against the LTTE could have been successful without these Emergency Regulations. They served the purpose at that time. They were absolutely essential. Without these regulations in this form, we could not have brought the security operations against the LTTE to a positive and successful conclusion. But, now that has been accomplished and that has transformed the situation with regard to security. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Our complaint was regarding the excesses in the operation of the Emergency Regulations in that period.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

I think my Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga will agree, once he listens to me, that once we take away all these regulations which we think are no longer necessary, that danger is minimized to a very substantial extent. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman, the provisions regarding curfew are being removed; they will no longer be operative in this country. We do not believe that there is a need to continue with those particular regulations. Then, the Emergency Regulations which have been enforced ever since the tragic assassination of my predecessor, the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, those regulations also dealt with control of propaganda supportive of the terrorists cause, of course, it was necessary at that time. We could not allow the terrorist cause to be propagated freely and without restraint in this country. Therefore, to deal with that situation at that time we needed stringent Emergency Regulations and those were brought into force. There were Emergency Regulations connected with maps, photographs, false statements and subversive literature. They were absolutely necessary at that time. But, today we have made a very careful study of the situation and we think

2010 04 45 46

that the provisions contained in Chapter 6 of the Penal Code at this moment would be sufficient to deal with the situation without having recourse to the Emergency Regulations which dealt with subversive literature and the spread of terrorist propaganda. Equally, some of the Emergency Regulations, which this House has been extending from month to month for a period of almost five years dealt with, among other matters, printing or publishing certain types of documents; that is no longer necessary. We think that that can be dealt with under, perhaps, Section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. I would also like to tell this House that while taking away these Emergency Regulations, we are not adding anything to the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Some people thought that what we take away here will be added to the Prevention of Terrorism Act. We are not doing that. This is an exercise that is being undertaken in a spirit of sincerity and we are dispensing with the entirety of the Emergency Regulations which we believe are redundant or superfluous having regard to the current situation in the Island. There were also Emergency Regulations that dealt with communication or spread of rumours or false statements. We think that that is no longer necessary. The situation in the country is settled. We do not want those. There may be problems that arise from time to time but those are not of a great magnitude and having regard to the kinds of situations that may arise, we think that those can be adequately dealt with in terms of Section 98 of the Police Ordinance. Sir, the Emergency Regulations contained sometimes very drastic provisions which were necessary at that time with regard to the prohibition of processions and meetings. There was a danger at that time that the terrorist cause would be nurtured and reinforced by processions, meetings and other activities of that nature. Again, we think that substantial relaxation of those clusters of Emergency Regulations can now be contemplated without any detriment to crucial security interests of Sri Lanka. We are therefore recommending to this august Assembly, the repeal of those Emergency Regulations. We are not asking that those be continued, and if there are residual problems, the Government is confident that those problems can be dealt with in terms of the Police Ordinance. The Emergency Regulations, as they were applied up to now, also required householders, the chief occupant of a house, to provide lists of inmates. There were complaints about this. It was seemed to be humiliating. Again, it was a temporary necessity, a regrettable necessity, at that time. That is no longer required. So, we are dispensing with that and we will not now under present conditions that prevail in this country, impose on householders any imperative obligation to provide lists of inmates to the security authorities of the country. It is no longer necessary; we are doing away with that. I think

all Hon. Members of the House, I am sure the Chief Opposition Whip too would agree, there had to be provisions in the Emergency Regulations to deal with intimidation and death threats at that time. There were death threats issued to many people and there was no distinction with regard to party or political affiliations. Many people were coerced; they were intimidated by death threats. It was therefore the sacred duty of the government of the land to have effective legislation imposed to deal with that situation. After all, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the bounden duty of a government in power is to protect life and limb. That is a sacrosanct obligation of the State and we complied with that obligation at that time. That does not mean that these regulations must be applied in perpetuity and that is why with the very substantial improvement in the security situation which we witnessed in all parts of Sri Lanka today, we are confident that these regulations can now be removed without any harm being inflicted on the citizens of this land. We are therefore - [Interruption.] I will come to that. Give me one minute. We are, therefore taking away these provisions and we believe that the provisions contained in the Penal Code of Sri Lanka embodying the substantive criminal laws of the Republic would be sufficient to deal with residual problems that may arise from time to time. Then, also the Emergency Regulations contained substantial powers to interfere with private property; powers which could be exercised in respect of buildings or of premises. The Emergency Regulations conferred authority on the State to take possession of buildings and premises used in connection with offences which was absolutely necessary at that time. We could not have dealt with the terrorist threat and could not have been rid of the terrorist menace if we did not have these provisions at that time. But again, with the sea change that has occurred in Sri Lanka, these are not necessary and we are therefore doing away with these provisions. Restriction of entry into places or premises without permission, again does not have to be dealt with under the purview of the Emergency Regulations at this time. ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti)

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this is a matter of national interest and I would like to be allowed to carry on. This is a matter of vital national interest; the interests of this nation are very much involved in this matter. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, there are also Emergency Regulations which have been enforced with regard to investigations. Now those special provisions with regard to investigations are no longer necessary and we are doing away with those regulations. There were also special regulations connected with the admissibility of evidence - evidence not admissible in normal circumstances - which have to be received as judicial evidence for purposes connected with national security during that period. Those provisions with regard to the law of evidence are not necessary and we are removing those provisions. There were also provisions which conferred upon the armed forces exemption from ordinary laws. Again at that time there was no argument, it was necessary. Without that kind of exemption the armed forces would not have been able to function effectively and that means the military action could not have been brought to a positive conclusion. So those provisions

51 52

[ . . ]

were necessary at that time but, with the return of normalcy to the country, we do not think that those exemptions need to be conferred any longer on the armed forces and we are now taking actions to remove those exemptions. For example, the armed forces were exempted from provisions of the Motor Traffic Act that is no longer necessary. However, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Does it mean that the armed forces have no right to check the vehicles?

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

No, for certain purposes connected with national security they will continue to have that right. For example - [Interruption.] No, no but that is necessary. With regard to the prohibited zones and the high security zones which still exist, we want to scale them down, but they are still there. There is a need for them. The Hon. Prime Minister gave you a great deal of material which can convince any reasonable person that those provisions are necessary for the time being. We do not propose to carry on with those forever. We will dispense with them as soon as possible, but the Hon. Prime Minister brought to the notice of the House certain circumstances which make it necessary to continue with a residue - a minimum residue - of those provisions for the time being. I think the Chief Opposition Whip will agree with me that preventing and prohibiting of specified terrorist activities in some parts of the country restricting the procurement of certain items, proscription of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam and also proscription of the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization called TRO, continue to be necessary. As the Hon. Prime Minister pointed out, there is a vicious campaign being carried on against this country in the capitals of the world and in multilateral institutions. One of the principal functions in the Ministry of External Affairs which is a new situation which has arisen, will be to combat that hostile and dangerous propaganda to the best of our ability and that is an exercise that requires your co-operation as well. It is a national endeavour. It is not a partisan political endeavour. I mean, you know very well the elections that are taking place or the so-called elections in different parts of the world to form a provisional government; those are matters that strike at the very heart of the well-being of this nation. They cut across all political boundaries and affiliations. I, therefore, appeal to all of you in a spirit of sincerity to join hands with the Government at least for the purpose of effectively combating that kind of propaganda. That requires a certain legal infrastructure.

That legal infrastructure cannot be immediately dismantled. I assure you that we have done our very best; we have gone through these Regulations one by one; we have considered the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, the Bail Act, the Penal Code, a whole host of legislation to seek - [Interruption.] That is not connected immediately with this. - [Interruption.] One more, please. Let me finish with this.

We have made an honest effort to evaluate the entire range of Emergency Regulations in order to see what we can dispense with. We cannot sweep it away wholesale as the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya urged us to do because that will be a dereliction of national duty on the part of a government. That would be a dangerous thing to do. We are not prepared to do that. There has to be a balanced approach to this. We have to reconcile these competing interests and that is why the regulations are being presented to this House in this amended form.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

What about the Hon. Sarath Fonseka? Now, you have eradicated terrorism. What about the problem he is facing? Why do you not start with him? We are talking of a victim because of him. Why are you silent on him? [Interruption.] Tissainayagam is being released. Why not the Hon. Sarath Fonseka? We need an answer. [Interruption.]

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would also like to tell you that for certain purposes it is also necessary for the time being, for a short period, for police powers to be exercised by the armed forces. This is required because otherwise ongoing investigations will discover secreted LTTE arms, caches and other material which have been handled by military intelligence as opposed to the police force, will otherwise be jeopardized.

I would also like to tell this House, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that some of the provisions that have been retained, that is being done in order to enable people who have been taken into custody, investigations which have been commenced under the Emergency Regulations at the time when they were necessary; we have to allow those investigations to continue. We cannot bring them to a grinding halt. That will not be consistent with the countrys national interest. So, there are saving provisions to save the legality and the continuity of investigations which have been commenced under the Emergency Regulations at a time when those regulations were in force and when they were absolutely necessary in the national interest. So that is being done.

There are a number of journalists in this country who have gone abroad on the fear of false arrests and remand. Now, will you give an assurance that they could come back and that you will not touch them; that the Government will not take them into custody? - [Interruption.] . . [ ] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Hon. Minister, you may continue, please. You have only two more minutes. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I will finish very soon. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On the same basis, can you please tell me what is happening to KP? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I ask you to bear with me for a few more minutes. If I overrun my time the Government will make necessary arrangements, Sir. I wish to say that there are very positive developments taking place in respect of the economy at this time. You can all see the exponential growth of tourism in this country. Foreign investment is flowing in. The travel advisories are being revised every week in a manner that is positive to Sri Lanka. The changes that we are now making with regard to the Emergency Regulations will buttress those positive developments and the Sri Lankan economy will be the beneficiary of those initiatives, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

Now, in addition to the measures that we are taking in order to relax the Emergency Regulations, there are two other things that we are doing. One is, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are taking action to establish a Reconciliation Commission. That has been a feature of many post-conflict societies. In South Africa, after the very painful period that that country went through and which is documented very sensitively by Nelson Mandela in his inspiring autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom - South Africa went through that pain and that anguish and when it was all over, they appointed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission which was intended to enable all the people who had suffered to put behind them that pain and that anguish, to pick up the pieces and to get on with life. Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel laureate, played a key role with regard to that exercise. Sri Lanka also needs healing rapprochement at this time, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. So, as part of that healing exercise, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has decided to set up a Reconciliation Commission which will enable measures to be taken to mitigate the pain and to enable the country to pick itself up and face the future with confidence. With regard to the announcement which I made yesterday, when I assumed duties as the Minister of External Affairs, His Excellency the President decided yesterday coinciding with the World Press Freedom Day to grant a pardon to Mr. Tissainayagam. Of course, there are certain procedural steps to be taken, because Mr. Tissainayagam has lodged an appeal. He has to withdraw that appeal. The Attorney-General of Sri Lanka has been instructed to co-operate with him in that exercise and as soon as that procedural step is taken, His Excellency will use his prerogative powers under the Constitution of Sri Lanka to confer a pardon on Mr. Tissainayagam. The President is the only person who has the legal capability to do that. It is an exercise of prerogative power and His Excellency decided yesterday, on a day that is of momentous significance to journalists all over the world, to take that step. So, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, these are all steps cumulatively which project a certain image of Sri Lanka to the world at large. It is a country that is coming back to normal after a period of great turbulence. It is a country that has the resources and the inherent strength to face the future with fortitude. We are already in touch with countries that have dealings with us and those countries are greatly enthused. They find what is happening in this country very positive. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we have every confidence that we are taking the right steps at the right time, taking fully into account the interests of this nation. So, it is in that spirit that I ask all Members of this House, whatever party they may belong to, to co-operate with the Government in taking these initiatives forward for the well-being of the nation as a whole. Thank you, Sir.

. , , . . , , . . . . , , . . . , . . , . . . , . ; . . . . . . . . , , , . . . , . . . . , , . . . Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the existing security situation in the country is quite normal. There is no threat to peoples lives; there is no threat to the countrys security; there is no threat to the sovereignty of the country; there is no threat to the defence of the country. Many things that happened during the war are not happening now. I think there is no war situation now. There is no law and order situation. So, we should be able to govern this country without the Emergency and that is what people are expecting from us. There have

been no terrorist activities for the last one year. Although there were a couple of people arrested, the country has been free of terrorism from 19th May last year; no terrorist activity has taken place. At least for the last six months, no worthwhile terrorists have been even arrested. So, I think the normal law should exist in the country. Even the PTA is still in existence. We should be able to manage the affairs in the country without the Emergency. There are a lot of youths, over 11,000 youths, under custody. Justice has not been done to them. Their cases have been idling without any effective, constructive action being taken to do them justice. So, the Government must ensure that action is expedited. There is uncertainty about the future of the youths. The Government must take proper action to finalize their cases. If there are offenders, take action against them, send the innocent people free, do the rehabilitation and finish it off. Emergency powers are being misused in the country at the moment. There are abuses and excesses. Emergency powers are being used to control political opponents; emergency powers are being used to intimidate and keep people silent; emergency powers are being used to silence and intimidate the media. Even during election time and after election time, over 50 of my supporters were arrested and they were put in jail without any substantial or valid reasons. One by one they were released. Still there are people, well-to-do and respectable people, kept in jail without any charges being framed against them. See the outcome of the Emergency. It is a very good example of the Emergency being used unethically, of the abuse of power. Even I am being held under the same circumstances, but the law will speak in future. The people of this country will come to know the truth. The truth will prevail; justice will be done one day. Because of the abuses, everyone in the country is intimidated. Even those who are seated in front of us, I do not believe are enjoying proper democracy. They are also restricted; their speeches are restricted; their thinking is restricted; their expression is restricted. But, that is not what we want to see under the normal law and order of the country. The principles of democracy and human rights are violated. People have no freedom. People are frightened. Some people are leaving the country. Even some of those who were active during the last elections have run out of the country because the situation does not warrant them to live in this country anymore. In a country where there is no justice, additional powers such as the Emergency will only be used against the people. The people will be the targets; the people will be vulnerable to the abuses of the Emergency. Even the military at the moment is being intimidated. There were a large number of senior officers in the military who were sacked out of the army without giving any reasons, without giving them a chance even to question why they were being sent out. There were over five generals, a number of brigadiers and so many other

59 60

[ ]

officers who were sent out overnight. Their families do not know what happened to them. Some of those officers had not spoken to me even a word from the time I left the army and their families were victimized. Their children are victimized. They cannot find jobs. Some of them have already left the country. Those who are enjoying what happened, those who think the right thing was done, most probably lack human qualities and do not have feelings and respect for human life. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Hon. Mervyn Silva, please sit down. ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka)

[Interruption.] Although we won the war, we have failed to ensure that justice is done to the people who had suffered during the war; we have failed to ensure communal harmony; we have failed to eliminate the mistrust between the communities; we have failed to give confidence to the communities in this country. There should be sincere and genuine action taken to rectify this situation. This is what the people are expecting in the country now, irrespective of where they come from, irrespective of which part of the country they come from, irrespective of the languages they speak; they are all expecting justice to be done to everybody in the country. Emergency Regulations will not be able to do it, only the normal law and order can do that. - - . , . . , , , . . . , . . . . . ; . [ ] . , . . . ; . [ ] , ,- [ ] , . .

The feelings are reciprocal. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We have been witnessing your antics on both sides and hopefully, you would rather be better seated there than in the Chamber when all of us address. Having said that, Sir -

( ) (The Presiding Member)

Is that a reference to the conduct of the Chair? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

You are somebody who is well versed with the hallowed traditions of this House and I would always bow my head to the Chair at any time. I would give you a different type of respect when you are there, but it would not be the same courtesy when you are across the isle. Having said that, Sir, may I, at the outset, thank the voters of the Kandy District who, for the third time after a lapse of six years when I had gone to serve the people in the Digamadulla District, elected me overwhelmingly to this House when I returned this time once again to serve them in particular. I take this opportunity also to thank all voters all over the Island who voted for our candidates who contested through the United National Party list. As a matter of fact, eight Members of Parliament belonging

2010 04 101 102

to my party - six, directly elected and two, on the National List - have come to Parliament to carry on the mission that my late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, started way back in 1989 and you would recall that you were also a Member of the House then though you were quite critical of my late leader. Yet, we learnt from the type of friendly banter that we exchanged from both sides.

( ) (The Presiding Member) He took it up very well. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Having said that, I think it is more important, ironic and tragic to listen to the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle, whose late husband Jeyaraj was a rare, talented Parliamentarian who adorned this House. He is no more and the manner in which he was taken away from us was so gory and unforgettable. But then, history is behind us and we have learnt many things. Jeyaraj, though he was a very combative, vociferous and articulate Member in this House, when it came to negotiations and discussions, was a very moderate and considerate political leader. I think when we look at how the war has taken a toll on us, the terrible effects terror had on the entire Sri Lankan society, it is time that we put things behind us and look to the future. Today we heard the young Hon. Namal Rajapaksa speaking about his own vision as a young Hon. Member in this House. Let us look at some of the things that are happening today. In fact, when the Hon. Prime Minister was speaking about the Emergency Regulations being gradually withdrawn, I raised the question as to why he is not detailing the specific regulations that he is withdrawing. Well, they wanted me to look at the Gazette notification. But, if all of you have a glance at the Gazette notification, you would see that none of the regulations which are mentioned there make any sense to us, unless the Government takes pain to explain to us as to what impact and effect that would have in restoring normalcy in this country. Take for instance, one single incident that has happened a few days ago. Pavement hawkers have been summarily chased out from the streets of Colombo. We have seen praise being showered on the Secretary of Defence and the authorities who took this decision. Even people like the Hon. Alavi Moulana, a very senior politician, the Hon. Governor of the Western Province, has been ridiculed by some of the newspapers for having stood up for the poor pavement hawkers. People forget the real plight of these poor vendors who have been earning their livelihood day by day. Some newspapers have written copious volumes of editorials on this issue. I saw one newspaper even calling almost all the pavement hawkers as virtual thugs, underworld elements and drug

peddlers. The truth is far from it. In fact, some of those poor vendors were at the mercy of the underworld. It was the underworld, the drug peddlers and the thugs who took ransom - kappam - from these poor pavement vendors. Let us not forget the fact that the Colombo Municipal Council is responsible for some of these antisocial elements to have taken control of the Colombo streets. As a matter of fact, some of the underworld elements were even controlling the Colombo Municipal Council recently and these elements, I am sure the Government is aware of. Who gave patronage to these elements? What happened during the last Provincial Council Elections? Some of the political parties could not enter places like Maligawatte. There were underworld elements who were inside the prison who were allowed to come out. There were underworld elements who had gone abroad who were brought back. Some of us, political leaders, could not even walk into places like Maligawatte. You do not have to ask anybody else, you ask the Hon. Fowzie. His own son, who was a candidate in that election, could not enter Maligawatte. That was the situation that prevailed during that Provincial Council Election. Subsequently, we saw the same underworld elements were done to death or chased away from the country. Well and good! They were used for elections and chased away. Now, the poor pavement hawkers have been summarily dealt with. Even today, a national newspaper, the Daily Mirror, has published an editorial in a much more subdued tone. At least that newspaper has asked that some justice be done to these pavement hawkers. What is happening is that most of these pavement hawkers today cannot pay the school fees of their children. They are in abject poverty. They earn a few thousand rupees daily and pay several thousands monthly as ransom to some of these thugs. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) That is being sorted out. I was one of the aggrieved persons in this regard. So I took it up with His Excellency the President and the matter is being sorted out. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Thank you, very much.

The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara was somebody who stood firm in the Colombo Municipal Council against these underworld elements. These underworld elements, who were controlling the Colombo Municipal Council, were responsible for most of these things that took place. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena who is here and was in charge of the Urban Development Authority earlier, is quite aware of what happened. Similarly, it happened a few months ago at Glennie Street. Bulldozers came and they wanted to break down all the houses of poor shanty dwellers and chase them

103 104

[ ]

away, apparently on orders from the top, from the Defence Ministry. Some of us, the Opposition politicians, rushed there and we had to then rush to court and get a Stay Order to prevent those shanty dwellers being thrown onto the streets. Today what is going to happen to the livelihood of these people? Even if you are going to give compensation, the compensation will go to the underworld because they are the fellows who are controlling these poor people. None of those poor payment hawkers who were peddling their goods in those streets is going to get any compensation. Those people will not be able to claim anything because there is nothing for them to claim since the ownership is with these very unruly elements who are drug peddlers and underworld gangs who control them. Therefore, I think the Government will have to re-look at this situation and I thank the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara for having said that he has intervened on behalf of these poor, hapless, innocent payment hawkers who had to face a sudden eviction without any notice whatsoever. This is in violation of all the norms of justice and today that is why we insisted that the Emergency Regulations, if they are being wound down, if they are being gradually withdrawn, at least tell us as to what impact and effect that would have on restoring normalcy in this country. The Prime Minister said that they will try to remove a few roadblocks, a few checkpoints. That perhaps may have started, but then, much more needs to be done to restore normalcy in this country. In the meantime, what happens when you restore normalcy? There are certain elements who are now going to bring in other issues to prevent normalcy being restored. Take for instance, the opening of the Marichchi Kaddi Road from Puttlam, through Marichchi Kaddi to Mannar. The people of Silavatthurai and Musali regions, who were going through several years of turmoil and trouble, who were forcibly evicted by the LTTE, began to return to their places and cultivate their lands. They began to go to sea to engage in fishing. Today they are faced with a new problem. Certain environmental organizations have ganged up together and filed a case in the Supreme Court - I am told that this is to be taken up on the 7th - saying that that road must be closed. There are certain vested interests trying to prevent normalcy being restored. These people, having being evicted by the LTTE 20 years ago, have now returned to their areas and started their livelihood. They have been given a few tin sheets to put up a few huts. The Government has not done much to rehabilitate or resettle them. But, they have gathered whatever they could, gone there and have started to resettle. But, certain environmental organizations have ganged up together and are crying foul saying that this road is going through the Wilpattu Sanctuary, and therefore serious damage is being done to the environment. Of course, all of us want the environment to be protected. But, then what happens to the livelihood of the people who are returning to these areas and are settling down?

As a matter of fact, I am told that there are other vested interests behind this. People who have gone back to their original lands find that some other elements have come and fenced those lands. These are valuable lands which can be fenced and used for tourism purposes and for various other lucrative business ventures. It has happened. In the Nilaweli and Irakkakandi areas, we find large tracks of land have been taken away to establish a saltern. Almost 1,500 acres have been fenced. The poor people who were engaged in lagoon prawn fishing in that area have been deprived of their livelihood. But, was there an Environmental Impact Assessment done on that Project? I do not think there was an EIA done on that Project. But, then for this road, they ask for an EIA. Why are these double standards adopted? Why are the authorities looking at these issues in this fashion? Let us have a uniformed and a reasonable solution to some of these long-standing issues of these returning refugees. Let me also refer to the conduct of some of the police officers. We saw what happened in Nawalapitiya. There was an inquiry held by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party leadership. His Excellency the President initiated an inquiry and everything has ended hunky-dory. Everybody has been declared as having a clean sheet and nobody is to be blamed. But, we, the Opposition Parliamentarians who had to face that election as candidates, witnessed what happened in Nawalapitiya. In fact, I mentioned this on the 06th of April when Parliament was re-summoned to extend the state of Emergency. I specifically referred to the conduct of the Nawalapitiya OIC, a gentleman called Udaya Wickremasekera. He was not the officer-in-charge, he was a candidate himself. That is the way he behaved. He chased all of us out of the area. He would not allow anybody to enter. He said that that area belongs to one person and one person only. This particular police officer was removed by orders from the top and within 24 hours he was reinstated. But, luckily the election was re-held and the senior police officers who were sent there were very duty-conscious and they were given specific instructions by His Excellency that no incident should happen that would result in the Election Commissioner postponing polls once again which would have prevented this House from sitting. But, then if that same officer-in-charge is going to continue in that police station, what justice could we expect? Absolute cronyism! He had virtually been behaving as if he himself is the candidate. I am sure most of those Hon. Members who may be sworn in tomorrow morning as Ministers after all this long delay, would bear testimony to what I am saying, as to what happened. Well, I hope, things would be better at least in the future. We do not want an eyewash inquiry and for them to say, Everything is hunky-dory. We have disciplined our people. Well, discipline, they must if we are going to have a society which would feel that they have their freedom to choose their Members as they wish. Well, this Government has returned with a near two-thirds majority. But, every time when a party gained a two-thirds in the House, they tended to change the

2010 04 105 106

Constitution. In 1970, in 1977, both Governments, first time after the post-Independent history, when they had a two-thirds majority, tended to have their own brand of a Constitution and we have to endure the ill-effects of the 1978 Constitution for so many years. Now, this Government says - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sri Lanka became a Republic in 1972. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

In 1972, Sri Lanka became a Republic and that was the only salvation for all of us. We were taken away from the bondage of our colonial masters. We were never to bow down to the Queen anymore. So, that was the only salvation for all of us but then see the violent history that we have had ever since then. The worst violence that was ever seen in any part of the world was seen in our country. Well, we have brought the terror to an end by military means but then with that do we again go back to the same old chapter of re-enacting a Constitution which would suit only our party and our party alone? Surely not! But, I see His Excellency the President, on his visit to Bhutan, has met with other leaders, particularly the Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and assured that there would be serious discussions that would begin with all parties, including the minority parties, to have an honourable solution embodied in the Constitution. Well, there was some reference to a Senate being created. I must say an Upper Chamber for the sake of an Upper Chamber would be just a cosmetic exercise if that Upper Chamber does not have teeth or at least the ability to veto legislation. I am sure those who were contemplating changes will not allow an Upper Chamber to have such sweeping powers, if at all, they may be able to delay legislation. Well, what is the composition of this Upper House and the Lower House and how is the new electoral system going to be designed and how will it ensure reasonable minority representation in both the Lower House and the Upper House? These are the contingent issues that have to be resolved by discussion. We had a long-drawn APRC process in which the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, despite the fact that we were the only party from the Opposition which participated continuously in those sessions, had made elaborate contribution towards its deliberations. But, then all of that had been put on the back burner and we are now not referring to those deliberations of the APRC. Added to that, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena this morning said that there was no consensus whatsoever in the Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reforms, which I agree. But, there were some

deliberations, there was some good work done though we have not come to a total consensus on some of the issues. But, then many of the features that had been agreed upon could be continued if the Government wishes to go ahead with the process of discussion with the Opposition. Hon. Presiding Member, I would also like to refer to another issue that the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa referred to this morning; about a new system called, Jana Sabha. There is an attempt to set up a Jana Sabha in every Grama Sevaka Division in the country and if I am correct, there was an attempt to employ unemployed graduates as secretaries to these Jana Sabhas. There was an attempt to appoint them before the Election but the Election Commissioner intervened and those appointments were put off. But, then how is the selection process going to take place? There are almost 37,000 unemployed graduates in this country. Are you going to simply pick and choose them at the whims and fancies of the governing party or, are you going to have a selection criteria which would be transparent and acceptable? There are almost 37,000 unemployed graduates and if you are going to pick for almost 14,900 Grama Seva Niladari Divisions in this country - I am told the Ministry of Public Administration is getting ready to re-demarcate the GS Divisions and there has been a paper notice that has already been published. Even the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions are going to be re-demarcated. That process has to go through a Commission which has to be appointed to go into public petitions and representations. I am sure the Government will do that. The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne who took over duties as the new Minister of Public Administration, I hope would listen to the Opposition, about the grievances we have, about re-demarcation and demarcation of the Grama Niladari Divisions, the need to create the lowest level of administrative demarcations in a passion to satisfy all interest groups: be it communities, ethnicities or even castes, because we have seen that in the past ad hoc decisions made without due consideration to public demands and requests have brought about the sorry history of unnecessary conflicts in this country. Therefore, while we welcome the attempt to set up a Jana Sabha system, let us have a very transparent and acceptable criteria that would select the graduates to serve in the Jana Sabhas. Well, some of us do not have total confidence in the Samurdhi Officers though you want to engage them because that movement has been totally politicized and against all norms, all of us know that even the Grama Niladaries are doing politics in most of the villages. So, we have to de-politicize at the lowest level if this Jana Sabha system is going to bring any benefit to this country.

So, with those comments I do not want to linger too long. Mr. Presiding Member, I must also refer to the Presidential pardon given to the journalist, Mr. J.S. Tissainayagam. It was, I think, a very timely and

8 PL 004831

107 108

[ ]

considered decision since all of us felt that the sentence itself is too harsh for whatever reason. None of us are holding a brief for what he wrote, but then I do not think we need to be using such draconian methods to incarcerate journalists, because their freedom to write is something that we must accept an honour. There must be clash of ideas. There must be healthy discussion about the ideology of different parties and persons and journalists after all ply a trade which has been somewhat dangerous in the past years. Hopefully, in the future with peace dawning in this country, with terror behind us, we would be able to have people who would fearlessly write and ensure that we will have democracy, justice and equality for everyone in this country. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member)
