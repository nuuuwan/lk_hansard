( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Chairman, I have looked at the Performance Report of the Ministry of External Affairs and would like to recommend to the Minister changing the format. Last year was an important year as far as the activities of the Ministry of External Affairs was concerned, with the collapse of the LTTE and the discussions that went on. But, unfortunately, this is only a record of events where Ministers have gone through. So, I would suggest that 2010 onwards, you have one section which really deals with the content policy and the views. We can agree; we can disagree. But, I would like to have a change in this, so that the House can make use of it and, may we even have a Quarterly Report of the Ministry of External Affairs to the Committee or to the House, so that the Consultative Committee could take it up. This is becoming a more and more important issue.

The work of the Global Climate Warming Conference should also be coordinated through the Ministry of External Affairs. It is becoming one of the most important issues in the world. I do not think it can stand alone. It is too important to be left out and it is becoming a part of the foreign policies of most governments and you find people like President Obama taking the issue up. The leaders of those countries are taking this issue up. So, while the relevant Ministry does all the technical work, I would like to say that the Ministry of External Affairs must certainly coordinate this issue as far as the global climate warming is concerned. . ,- [ ] .

) (The Chairman) The next Speaker is the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

) (The Chairman) What is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I refer to Standing Order No. 130A (i). It states, I quote:

Every Committee and any Sub-Committee appointed by such Committee when so authorized by the Committee shall have power to.......... .

Sir, under that particular Standing Order, I wish to move that the Committee appoints a sub-committee of itself to examine the question whether an additional programme needs to be added as "Programme 03" under Head 112 for the purpose of examining the incidents at the UN Office in Colombo and report to this House by 4.00 p.m. on Friday, 9th July, 2010. These incidents were disclosed by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I strongly suggest, Sir, that you appoint a sub-committee to look into this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) That is, this Committee can appoint a sub-committee. You can take a vote on this. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, there is provision under the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, it does not come under the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why can you not appoint a sub-committee?

( ) (The Chairman) .. ?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I think he has no objection.

( ) (The Chairman) point of Order - [Interruption .]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) If your hands are clean, there is no reason why you should not have it.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, no. You cannot appoint a sub-committee.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why are you trying to circumvent?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You cannot appoint a sub-committee under that Standing Order.

( ) (The Chairman) . . [ ] . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is your collective responsibility.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, that is our responsibility. That is what the Hon. Leader of the House and myself are expressing.

( ) (The Chairman) .. .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) [Interruption.] No, the Government is avoiding this. You have to concede that. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) We will leave it to the Minister of External Affairs.

[.. 10.01] .. ( )

( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Chairman, there are several matters that I would like to deal with. I would first like to inform the House with your permission, Mr. Chairman, that His Excellency the President was successful yesterday in bringing together the different groups involved in the Maldivian political crisis and at 4.30 last afternoon, a Cabinet of Ministers was sworn in by President Mohamed Nasheed. About an hour before that, His Excellency, President Mahinda Rajapaksa met both groups, that is the Ruling Party and four different groups comprising the Opposition. This meeting took place under the auspices of the Sri Lankan President, who offered his services as a former President of SAARC, as a neighbour and a friend of the Maldives. His intervention was greatly appreciated by all political parties in the Maldives. There was increasing rancour and acrimony; there was the failure of a dialogue. But, President Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to bring all the parties together. There was action taken by the President of the Maldives yesterday, to swear in a Cabinet of Ministers exactly 90 minutes after President Mahinda Rajapaksa got all the groups together in one room under his auspices, where I was also present. I am very happy to be able to tell the House that this was a very substantial achievement in the interests of the well-being of a friendly country, with whom we have constantly had the warmest possible relationships. - [Interruption.] I have very limited time.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Deputy Speaker is under siege at this moment and Mr. Qasim Ibrahim is also under custody. So, is that the solution? [Interruption.] Are you not aware? [Interruption.] . Just because a Cabinet was sworn in - [Interruption.]

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) It is not for me, Mr. Chairman, to comment on the internal political affairs of another country. Our purpose was to get a dialogue going. That was all. The substantive solution is a matter for the Maldivian authorities; that is not a matter for Sri Lanka. Our limited purpose, at their request, was to initiate a dialogue between the parties, That had not happened up to the time President Mahinda Rajapaksa arrived in the Maldives, and that was the extent of the achievement, yesterday.

Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by referring to a very refreshing development which

907 908

occurred when President Mahinda Rajapaksa was in Delhi, a few weeks ago. I refer to the meeting that he had with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mrs. Shrimathi Sushma Swaraj. Mrs. Shrimathi Sushma Swaraj made a categorical statement on the attitude of the Indian Opposition to the conduct of foreign policy by the Indian State. She said, "We have our problems; we fight domestically. Sometimes, the temperature is pretty high. But, there is one principle which we will never compromise. That is, when we go abroad, when we meet foreign leaders, we raise our voice in defence of Indian interests. There is no difference at all. We do not do anything at all to weaken, to erode the image, the self-respect and the dignity of India. We are all for India - we may be Government, we may be Opposition. We fight with each other within the country. But abroad, when we face the world, we speak with one voice" She used the words, "there is continuity". This was a very strong message that she gave which we appreciated very much.

Now, what I am about to say, Mr. Chairman, is not said in anger or resentment, I am only making what I consider to be a constructive suggestion. I entirely agree with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition that nobody can object to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition meeting many potential envoys of sovereign States. That is the right of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition; it is a right to which nobody can object. However, what we are saying, Mr. Chairman, is that some other things that have happened are unfortunate, not because they damage a government or a political party, but because they inflict great damage on Sri Lanka, on the country that we all love; the country that we were born; the country where we are going to live in and the country in which ultimately, we are going to lay down our bones. Now, I stress again, that this is not said in a spirit of antagonism. With great respect I would like to bring to your notice, Mr. Chairman, a very formal document of the United States Senate.

I refer to the Report of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate dated the 7th of December, 2009. The title of this document is, "Sri Lanka : Recharting Strategy after the War". This is not a statement by the Government of Sri Lanka. This is a statement made by the United States. This is what the document states. I will table* this document with your permission.

Mr. Chairman, I quote from page 15 of that document:

Many Sri Lankan Government officials seemed surprised by the barrage of international criticism and intense public scrutiny they

received following the war. They had expected instead praise for defeating a notorious terrorist group-which pioneered suicide bombing techniques and assassinated Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Ghandi in 1991 and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993-and space to make the transition to a post-conflict environment.

Then comes the next paragraph, I quote:

Opposition Leaders take a different view. United National Party and opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said the United States was on the right track in publishing the 'Incidents Report' and should..

These are their words, not my words.

"'keep the pressure on the Government'.''

The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, according to this Report, is putting pressure on the United States to publish the Incidents Report. This is a report which purports to describe events which occurred in the closing stages of the war. It is a Report by the United States State Department to the US Senate. It contains a series of allegations against military personnel and others in Sri Lanka. The United States Senate is saying that the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is urging them to publish the Incidents Report and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasighe, the Leader of the United National Party and the Leader of the Opposition, as is characterized in this document, is also exhorting the United States, to keep the pressure on the government.

That is unfortunate in my humble view. The Hon. (Mrs.) Sushma Swaraj is saying, When we go abroad..... This was repeated to me, Mr. Chairman, by the Hon. Yashwant Sinha, who will be delivering the Dudley Senanayake Memorial Lecture in a few days time. The Hon. Yashwant Sinha and I used to meet regularly in Washington when we both were handling matters connected with the Treasury. He was later, a leading figure in the Indian Opposition, the BJP. He is incidentally the father-in-law of the present Indian High Commissioner in Colombo. He used to tell me regularly this, "Minister, the Congress Party and the BJP, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, as far as foreign relations are concerned, there is not one iota of difference. We are all for India."

The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is somebody to whom I have taught in the University. I have no personal enmity with him at all. I am only saying with great regret that this kind of behaviour inflicts the greatest possible damage not on President Rajapaksa, not on the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, not on the Rajapaksa Government but, on Sri Lanka, because what the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is asking the United States to do, is to publish material that is inimical, as detrimental as anything in this world could be. I do not agree, as a matter of law, with the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, that there is no risk of these persons - there is no danger whatsoever of soldiers, people who fought the war and people who eradicated terrorism from our motherland - being called up before

international tribunals because we are not signatories to the Treaty of Rome. In my view, there are at least three different ways in which this could happen. This is not the time to go into those matters. But, with great respect, I profoundly disagree with the conclusion arrived at and articulated in the House today by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. But, now I am on a different point. There is no - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I want to point out that you have misquoted. After you finish your speech, I will clarify that.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, certainly. I appreciate your courtesy. This is nothing personal. [Interruption.] The document is here. I am tabling that document. [Interruption.] Mr. Chairman, this is the United States of America saying that, "the Hon. Leader of the Opposition will not leave us alone; he is breathing down our necks; he is putting pressure on us to attack Sri Lanka". Look at the words. They quote the words, "should keep the pressure on the government" and publish the "Incidents Report". The Incidents Report is not critical of President Rajapaksa. It is critical of the soldiers who fought the war and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe wants the United States to publish this Report and to pursue the Government on matters connected with, maybe the lives, potentially the lives of people who fought the war. So, that is the complaint. It is not a complaint against the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe meeting High Commissioners and Ambassadors. That is perfectly legitimate; there is no complaint about it. But, it is this that we are profoundly sad about. We are not indignant, we are not angry, we are not hysterical, but we are deeply, very deeply sorry, Mr. Chairman, that this attitude is being manifested by a responsible Opposition, by a major political party with a proud history. The leader of such a party now goes to the United States and exhorts them to hound Sri Lankan soldiers. That is a matter of profound regret as far as we are concerned.

This is what the American Senate states in the last sentence of this paragraph. I quote:

Wickremesinghe said Sri Lankans did not want to lose their relationship with the United States, and the Governments criticism of recent U.S. remarks was 'complete nonsense'."

So, that is the contrast. That is the vivid, the graphic, the striking contrast between the attitude of the Indian Opposition in the Lok Sabha led by Srimathi Sushma Swaraj and the attitude of the Sri Lankan Opposition led by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. I state that for what it is worth, for reflection and consideration; not to sling mud, not to create any unnecessary rancour or acrimony.

I would like the Hon. Members of the Opposition to search their conscience.

In a very difficult situation where Sri Lanka is emerging from the darkness of war, the light is now visible at the end of the tunnel. Sri Lankas economy is in the process of being resuscitated. The most visible developments are in the sphere of tourism. Foreign Direct Investment is flowing into the country. In this quarter, the economy of Sri Lanka has grown by 7.1 per cent. It is a beginning of a promising dawn. It is, therefore, the duty of all of us, whatever party we may belong to, whether we are in the Government or in the Opposition, to join hands in matters that go to the heart of the well-being of Sri Lanka and it is in that spirit that I would like the Opposition to approach the conduct of Sri Lankas foreign relations.

I have very little time, Mr. Chairman. I am now wondering what issues I should deal with. I would like to say that one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy is our relationship with India. That is absolutely pivotal. The Indian Government has told me on many occasions, We are not people who issue statements. We show our feelings, our attitudes, our loyalties by concrete actions. One of the most concrete manifestations of Indias great friendship for this nation is the visit by the Commander of the Indian Navy, Admiral Nirmal Verma. He spent five days here. He met the President, he met me, he met several personalities. I do not know whether he met the Leader of the Opposition. He might have done so. There is a very solid, unshakable relationship between India and Sri Lanka. This is manifested in the most concrete and tangible ways conceivable, Mr. Chairman. When His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and I visited India recently, their goodwill towards this nation found expression in financial arrangements, which by any standard, are of unparalleled magnitude. They are constructing three major railroad systems in the North. That is worth US Dollars 800 million. The Sampur facility in Trincomalee was agreed upon while we were there in India. It had not been agreed on earlier. The Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, at the request of the Hon. Chidambaram, Minister of Home Affairs and the Hon. Pranab Mukherjee came to the hotel to meet the President at 10.30 in the night just to tell him how welcome he was and Pranab Mukherjee as the Finance Minister told me, Do not worry about red tape; anything for Sri Lanka outside the normal systems. We are not interested in the normal bureaucratic machinery when it comes to Sri Lanka. It is a very special situation, and we will give you the utmost priority". In 10 minutes, they set aside US Dollars 250 million for the construction of 50,000 houses for the benefit of persons who had been internally displaced. So, that is the attitude of India towards us. They are building Kankesanthurai Port, Palali Airport; all of these are being done by India. The success of President Rajapaksas foreign policy is that all these nations are our friends. Whatever internal issues

911 912

there may be, those are not reflected in the quality, the range, the depth of their relationship with Sri Lanka.

Take China, for instance. We had a visit by the Vice-Premier of China. China is helping us with the Colombo-Katunayake Highway; with the Matara-Kataragama Railway. They are helping us with the Norachcholai Power Project, with that huge building that is coming up in Colombo, the Centre for the Performing Arts. China is also helping us with the Seaport in Hambantota, the International Airport at Maththala. Add up all these. How much are they worth? What is India doing for us? What is China doing for us? A friend in need is a friend indeed.

When we were having problems, Mr. Chairman, with regard to the purchase of oil, that was not our fault, it was a global crisis, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran told our President, "I will give you the resources to buy the oil". For seven months no interest was charged. After that, it was a very concessionary interest rate. I have been present at least on three occasions when there were direct meetings between President Rajapaksa and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the most recent of which took place in Tehran on the occasion when His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka took over the leadership of G15 from Iran. I know the warmth of that relationship. It has translated into the most significant tangible benefits for this nation.

Then take Japan. Yasushi Akashi with whom I have worked for almost 10 years, is a great friend of Sri Lanka. He was influential with the previous government; he was influential with Hatoyama. He is also influential with the present Prime Minister. Now, what has Japan done? When Akashi was here, he announced that Japan was giving us a package that is worth US Dollars 400 million. That is over and above their normal assistance to this country.

So, all of this is a demonstration of the warmth, the good feeling that all these important countries have towards us. These things do not just happen, Mr. Chairman. They do not happen by coincidence, they are not gratuitous. They happen because the foreign policy of this nation is carefully formulated, skillfully implemented. The components of that foreign policy have required careful assessment and consideration and it is a measure of that achievement that all these nations in unison are helping us as we recover from the ravages of war and we, endeavour to the best of our ability, to be a proud and dignified nation on its feet. So, that is as far as our relations with other countries are concerned.

I had the privilege of attending the Shangri-La Dialogue. It was attended, Mr. Chairman, by 21 Defence

Ministers from all over the world. Together with me as members of our delegation, the Chief of Defence Staff and the Commander of the Sri Lankan Army, were present in Singapore. On that occasion, Dr. Liam Fox, Secretary of State for Defence of the new Government of the United Kingdom led by Prime Minister David Cameron, had a long and exceptionally warm bilateral meeting with me.

Dr. Liam Fox is one of the most influential figures in the new government of the United Kingdom. Dr. Liam Fox, with whom I have worked for a long time, told me, We want to work with you; we are proud of your achievement. Let us, Mr. Chairman, not belittle the extent of Sri Lankas achievement in eradicating terrorism. I was with President Rajapaksa just a few days ago in the Ukraine. I know personally that even in comparison with similar institutions in the United Kingdom, the University of Oxford has a chair in military strategy. So, I know what I am talking about. But, one of the most prestigious institutions in that field is located in Kiev, the Capital of the Ukraine and the Defence Academy of the Ukraine, which is a renowned institution the world over, are now looking at these specific modalities which Sri Lanka employed, particularly, the tactics of the Sri Lankan Navy with the use of small boats to defeat the sea tigers. This is attracting the attention of the world, universities, research institutions and thinktanks. All these are focusing upon the quality of Sri Lanka's achievement in eradicating terrorism. A challenge, that is what we are proud of as a nation; not just as a Government - Opposition, Government, green, blue, red or whatever colour - and we all should be proud of that singular achievement; and that is why this particular development is really a matter for profound sadness.

In the Ukraine, they told us, We are very interested in studying how you did this. Please send your military people to lecture to us. We are now teaching the world. We are now teaching the world at their invitation how to overcome terrorism; countries that are a hundred times richer than us; countries which have at their disposal the most powerful armies, navies and air force. This is a daunting challenge that they have not been able to meet with a modicum of the success, with a modicum of the success, that Sri Lanka has achieved with such limited resources in terms of money, in terms of manpower, in terms of military, pecuniary and every other form of strength. So, this is the wonder of the world and there is great appreciation. There is fulsome praise. There is fulsome praise, Mr. Chairman, for the quality of that achievement. All of this has been made possible because of a foreign policy, which is nuanced and balanced. On the one hand, there is a military strategy. On the other hand, there is the political leadership. There is also the willingness and the capability to set apart resources which are required to do this at a time of global recession when the paucity of resources was an inevitable fact.

The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, in his intervention a little while ago, asked about the political situation. On the day before I left for the Maldives, there was a meeting which His Excellency President Rajapaksa had with the Hon. R. Sampanthan, the Leader of the Tamil National Alliance. I was present at that meeting. It was a good meeting. It was the second meeting which the Hon. R. Sampanthan had with President Rajapaksa. There was a previous meeting which I also attended. It is an ongoing process. His Excellency President Rajapaksa has made it clear, that he does not believe for one moment, that military victory per se is going to overcome a problem that emanates from the hearts and minds of people. It has to be handled through a multi-pronged approach. One of the essential elements of which is the focus on a viable, practical and implementable political solution. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe knows, as well as I do, that successive governments with different political complexions, committed to different ideologies and nurtured by different value systems, have over the last decade, endeavoured to the best of their ability, to resolve this problem. Regrettably, Mr. Chairman all these attempts have failed for the reason that there was an insufficient consensus in the country in support of implementation of what had been proposed. There was a strange disconnect between what was being proposed in the higher echelons of Government and the sentiments, the feelings of ordinary people.

It is the earnest desire of President Rajapaksa, not to fall into that situation and to come up with a set of proposals, which has the potential for implementation and the discussions that are now underway with the Hon. R. Sampanthan, will provide a foundation for the emergence of what we expect, would be a viable solution. It is an ongoing process. It is not confined to one or two meetings. We are talking to him. We are getting into the minutiae of what is being proposed and that is very much an ongoing process. I do not wish to take very much time, Mr. Chairman.

Then, on the situation that arose in the United Nations office, I would like to respond to that. The Governments approach is based upon a balance between two obligations. The Government of Sri Lanka has obligations to its own people. That is a domestic matter. The Government of Sri Lanka also has obligations at international law. As far as our own people are concerned, the Government has a duty to protect peaceful demonstrations. We cannot clamp down on peaceful demonstrations. That is a right that is guaranteed by the highest law of this land, the Constitution of the Republic. It is also guaranteed and protected by instruments of the United Nations. The right of protest, the right of demonstration, the right of assembly, we cannot curtail those rights. That would be fundamentally undemocratic. Therefore, the demonstration on Bullers Lane outside the United Nations office is not something that can be

prohibited by the Government of Sri Lanka and we will not use force to disburse a lawful demonstration. That is one side of it. The other side of the coin is, our inalienable obligations at international law. We have the duty to protect the sanctity and the integrity of diplomatic precincts. And into that category, undoubtedly, the United Nations office would fall. Therefore, we have to protect that as well. What was done was, we strengthened the perimeter; the police was strengthened at the perimeter. I was in regular contact with Mr. Romesh Jayasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs. I was phoning him every 45 minutes in the Maldives while very sensitive discussions were going on with different political parties. I was phoning Mr. Romesh Jayasinghe and I was phoning other officials of the Government and I was aware of what was happening.

At the end of the day when the UN personnel would be going home, we saw to it that they had the right to leave those premises without any hindrance or impediment whatsoever. At that time, about five senior personnel of the United Nations office in Colombo said that they would like to stay on. That was a voluntary and spontaneous action on their part. It is not that they were restrained. They could have left, but they said, We would like to stay on a little longer. So they stayed on and we saw to it that they were not harmed or threatened in anyway. So, that is the manner in which the Government of Sri Lanka reconciled its obligations to its own people and its sacrosanct obligations at international law.

So, these are the matters that I would like to bring to your notice and I would once again say, as I did at the beginning, that these are matters which must be handled in a spirit of cordiality, amity and a broader perspective. In the emerging political culture of a mature nation, we must carve out a certain niche where there is no room for the usual acrimony of politics. One of the main problems in this country is the adversarial and confrontational nature of our political culture. We fight about everything and there is nothing that we are not prepared not to fight about. That may be alright with regard to the generality of matters as India has figured out with great distinction. But, when it comes to a certain limited range of matters, that attitude simply is not in the interest of the Sri Lankan nation and it is time, 60 years after Independence, for us to realize that basic fact. It is very much in that spirit, Mr. Chairman, that I appeal to my Friends occupying the benches of the Opposition for a re-orientation of their attitude, maturity, empathy, goodwill and friendship - not generally; I am not asking for that, that is too much to ask for. I am asking for that with regard to a restricted category of matters particularly in relation to the conduct of foreign policy that goes to the very heart of national well-being.

I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

( ) (The Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. S. Shritharan. He has 15 minutes. - [Pause.] He is not here. I now call upon the Hon. Sajith Premadasa to speak.

[.. 11.01] ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Mr. Chairman, I wish at the outset, to congratulate the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris on his appointment - may I say, his well-deserved and long-overdue appointment - as Sri Lankas Minister of External Affairs. He has an arduous task, Sir. I might even say he has three onerous tasks : facing a new wave of challenges to Sri Lankas sovereignty, overcoming the legacy of damage to Sri Lankas image and credibility inflicted by a singularly undistinguished predecessor, and neutralizing the negative consequences of his own Governments rhetoric and actions. I trust his stellar credentials as a renowned exceptional academic will help him educate his Colleagues in matters of external affairs, though his success in that endeavour presupposes that these Colleagues are indeed educable on the existence of a complex international milieu. I wish that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris does not play the role and suffer the destiny of General Colin Powell, a fine man and a superb Secretary of State of a great country, whose credibility was undermined and efforts frustrated by the primitive and extremist ideology of the administration that he served, an administration and an ideology which, I must add, seems to be a declared role model and inspiration for Sri Lankas incumbent administration.

Sri Lankas sovereignty, Mr. Chairman, is not a matter for negotiation. It is absolute, fundamental and I would say, sacred and sacrosanct. In defence of sovereignty, we must stand shoulder to shoulder and by we I mean all citizens of this country, Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim; Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and Christian; North and South, East and West; Government and Opposition; haves and have-nots. Sri Lankas sovereignty must be a rock solid rampart, an iron wall, which we shall defend without condition and without exception. My father, the late President Premadasa fully

925 926

[ ]

2010 08

restored Sri Lankas sovereignty and defended it against all comers. When our independence as a country, our sovereignty as a State and our liberty as a nation are at stake, we shall defend them even at the cost of our lives.

Mr. Chairman, we, in the United National Party, do not believe that the sovereignty of the State can be counterposed to that of the people or conversely, that the sovereignty of the citizen can be pitted against the sovereignty of the nation. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs, an expert in Constitutional law, will agree with me that in a democratic republic such as Sri Lanka, the wellspring, the very fount of all sovereignty is the sovereignty of the people. The sovereignty of the State and certainly that of rulers, emanates from and is conferred upon by the sovereignty of the people. There are no kings and emperors in a republic, Sir. If anyone says there is, it violates the very essence of our republican Constitution. The people are the nation and there can be no effort to safeguard State and national sovereignty which simultaneously does not affirm and defend popular sovereignty.

All forms of sovereignty rest upon the sovereignty of the people, Mr. Chairman. Therefore, we, in the United National Party vehemently reject and remain vigilant against any external attempt to violate the sovereignty of the Sri Lankan State in a false bid to protect the sovereignty of the individual Sri Lankan citizen, just as we reject and remain attentive against any internal attempt to violate and suppress the sovereign right of the Sri Lankan people, the countrys citizenry, in the name of an abstract, disembodied national or State sovereignty functioning as a mask for an emerging autocracy and oligarchy.

Mr. Chairman, Sri Lankas struggle for its unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty was waged mainly but not exclusively on this Island, on our soil, by the skilled use of superior force of the legitimate State. We applaud the success of the Armed Forces, the Government and the countrys elected political leadership for that historic path-breaking achievement. But, laurels are not to be rested upon. The achievements of the past must be safeguarded in the present and the future. Today and tomorrow, Mr. Chairman, the struggle to safeguard our sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity does not take place fundamentally and primarily on our own soil. It takes place in the global arena. It does not take place through the use of armed force. It entails mainly the use of innovative strategies, skilful diplomacy, ideas, arguments, winning over the world media and world opinion.

I do not doubt that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is capable of this task. Indeed, his track record is beyond reproach. But, is he a voice in the wilderness - that is the

UPFA Government - and the state structure today? Is he a lost person in the quagmire and confusion created by a plethora of differing opinions expressed by the various factions within the Government? The danger, Mr. Chairman, is that we are losing the battle for world opinion. If the balance of world opinion tilts against Sri Lanka in the long term, we stand in danger of jeopardizing the fruits of our hard-fought, hard-won military victory.

Today, we are in a dangerously vulnerable situation. While there are renewed incursions on our sovereignty from misguided quarters, it would appear that fewer of our friends are standing up promptly and robustly for us. We seem to be unable to deter or defeat moves against us. We must be careful not to lose the vast middle ground internationally and to do whatever is necessary to keep our traditional friends from shifting to a position of benign neutrality.

There are limits to what Sri Lanka can do to influence the behaviour of the powerful, Mr. Chairman. But, are we doing our very best within the parameters of our national self-respect? Are we doing our best to help our friends who help us? Or, are we acting in such a manner that goes against our best interests as a State? Are we acting in accordance with or against our enlightened national interest, Mr. Chairman?

Whatever the breakthroughs and accomplishments in Washington DC and in New York by our Minister of External Affairs - we applaud his success - all of that is thrown away, and elements who are opposed to us in the United States of America are strengthened by irresponsible and openly threatening statements made to a worldwide television audience in relation to the former Army Commander of Sri Lanka, who led the ground forces to victory over the LTTE. This is the equivalent of spooning a catch to the anti-Sri Lankan fielders in the global arena. What more evidence is needed that impunity is rampant in Sri Lanka? What further arguments need to be provided to those who want to appoint international panels to ensure that we comply with basic norms and standards of accountability?

Even worse, Mr. Chairman, is the self-congratulatory propaganda that follows in the State media. The egregious blunders are hailed as the acme of anti-imperialist patriotism. I would submit that if one wanted to witness an anti-imperialist performing skillfully and winning over his audience, one should simply watch the three-part "Hard Talk" that immediately followed the four-part series on Sri Lanka. In it, Stephen Sackur attempted to grill Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who responded spiritedly but in such a civil manner that the hostile interviewer was left smiling.

927 928

Sir, as we go on, matters get worse. The Sunday Times of Sri Lanka quotes a statement made by a ranking Government official to Ms. Samantha Power, a member of the National Security Council of the United States of America and an assistant to President Obama that Sri Lanka thinks the United States of America is jealous of us because we have done what the USA could not do. This report has not been contradicted so far. Sir, the important Members of this Government must not live in a world of delusion, illusion and misapprehension and assume that everyone else is like them. No major power formulates its policies on the basis of jealousy and I rather doubt that any big power is jealous of Sri Lanka. It is one thing to say that big powers are animated by a perception of rivalry. Country X could be apprehensive of Sri Lankas links with country Y, however unwarranted that apprehension maybe, but jealousy does not come into it

The Sunday Times then goes on to state that Mr. Obamas assistant was told in the same conversation that Sri Lanka had implemented what President Bush had said, to wage a war on terror. It is nothing less than shocking, Sir, that this Government should know the utter inappropriateness, futility and counterproductive nature of quoting the discredited doctrines of George Bush to a member of the staff of President Obama, who came to office repudiating that doctrine. That phrase has been dropped by the Obama administration. It is as if someone quoted "Chandrika Chintana" to a well-known assistant of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

In the important interaction between the Obama and Rajapaksa administrations, Sir, there seems to be a comprehension gap, and much is lost in translation. It would be of no little interest for us in this House to know a public opinion poll conducted by the respected Pew Research Foundation, records that for the first time in decades, 58 per cent of the Russian public and 57 per cent of the Chinese public approve of President Obama, while he has similar support in Brazil, India and South Africa. It is the very reverse of the global unpopularity that the USA suffered from prior to President Obama. There are lessons here for Sri Lanka on how to win over hostile world opinion. The repairing of the global image of the United States of America is the positive result of listening to the views of others, of reaching out and speaking reasonably.

We, in the United National Party, Sir, are consistently and vehemently opposed to the United Nations Secretary-Generals patronizing incursion into our domestic affairs. The Secretary-General of the United Nations must remember that he is an international civil servant, chosen to serve the needs and interests of the United Nations,

which is the largest inter-governmental body. He must never allow the lobbying of those who control the purse in terms of UN funding and unaccountable INGOs to influence him more than the voice of legitimate states nor, must he be pressurized and dictated to by the few into ignoring the wishes of the many. Hence, I consider the arbitrary decision taken by the United Nations Secretary-General repugnant, repulsive and reprehensive. However, it seems to me that it is the incompetence and negligence on the part of the Government that has left room for such incursions into our sovereignty.

Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.

Sir, in the matter of the panel appointed by the UN Secretary-General, I urge the Government to contain and limit the scope of this confrontation. This is surely a problem we have with the 38th Floor, not with the entirety of the United Nations. The rabble rousing call by the Minister, Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, to surround the UN office here in Colombo and take its staff hostage is a sort of lunacy that could create a serious international incident. Sadly, I do not know which is more irrational, Sir, the report that Ministers, Hon. Milroy Fernando and the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran, were summoned to Temple Trees for a dressing-down because they sang and danced at a wedding reception, or the fact that the Minister, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, was not similarly summoned to Temple Trees for a dressing-down over a matter with far more serious consequences for Sri Lanka.

Sir, it is my belief that virulent, vitriolic and pseudo-nationalistic declarations and proclamations which are primarily designed to satisfy the short-term political exigencies of the domestic constituency, will not in the medium and long-term result in positive outcomes for the nation as a whole. Yesterdays disgraceful behaviour on the part of the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and his cohorts deserves unreserved universal condemnation. I take this opportunity to wholeheartedly condemn the demonstrators for their abhorrent and deplorable behaviour and misconduct.

Sir, Sri Lankan policy-making must not be embroiled in a senseless controversy over whether we should be closer to India or China. We should be close to both, at the expense of neither. We must draw comfort from the rise of both powers because we belong to Asia, a continent which can only prosper from the economic emergence of both powers. May I remind this august Assembly that the joint economic mechanism between India and Sri Lanka was initiated in the early 1990s during my late fathers tenure as the President at his insistence. He was far-sighted enough to discern that the decision to open up the Indian economy in 1991, would lead to beneficial spin-offs for Sri Lanka and was eager to uplink Sri Lanka with the coming economic blast off of India. Late President Premadasas patriotism excluded economic isolationism and xenophobia. Indeed, it is well-known and documented that even in the 1960s, he was keen to link Sri Lanka with ASEAN because he intuitively spotted the economic potential of East Asia and the need for us in South Asia to build economic bridges to the Far East.

At this point, Sir, I turn my attention to a single most important external relationship, namely, with our great neighbour India. The majority in this country believe in the teachings of and is identified with the greatest son and sage of India, Gautama the Buddha, while the largest minority of the Island shares the same language and ethnicity with a portion of Southern India. Given the demographic reality of an ethnic group that cross cuts the borders of India and Sri Lanka, Sri Lankas ethnic issue is not only a domestic concern for Sri Lanka, it is a domestic issue for India as well. An unresolved problem with Sri Lankas ethnic minority can, and probably will, negatively impact on Sri Lankas relations with India.

In the international arena, Sir, India has been a good friend to Sri Lanka. We need Indias good offices to prevent its strategic partner, the United States of America, from being tempted to mount economic pressure on Sri Lanka. At a time when Sri Lanka has once again become the target of certain elements in the international community, we must strengthen our equation with India making it multidimensional and irreversible. Our equation with India must be strategic, Sir, and not merely tactical. Furthermore, we must not let Sri Lanka be used as a pawn in the power struggle that some outside our region are trying to create within our region to prevent or retard the rise of Asia.

Tamil Nadu is an important and influential State of the Indian Union. Separatist elements in Tamil Nadu spread propaganda to the effect that Delhi is not sensitive to Tamil Nadus feelings for the Tamils in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has to help Delhi prevent these extremists from gaining ground. This is mutually beneficial because we do not want Tamil Nadu being used once again as a rear base for the separatist Tamil Eelam cause. For this, we need Indias help, just as we ourselves must help India. May I say, Sir, it is now a strategic necessity for the Government to implement a solution to the ethnic issue without delay.

Sir, how long can this Government vacillate on a political solution and still count on India as an active defender in the international stage when we are already under siege?

When it comes to Constitutional amendments extending the term of the Presidency, there is an unseemly haste. But, when it comes to the most outstanding and long-standing political problem of ethnic reconciliation, the Government persists on an intentional policy of exclusion, evasion and prevarication.

Sir, this Administration has the option of activating the existing provisions of the Constitution as demanded by their own Cabinet Colleague, the Hon. Douglas Devananda, or implementing the Report of the APRC,

931 932

produced by yet another Cabinet Colleague, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana. But, this Administration has done neither. Had it done so or were it to do so now, I believe that the wind could be taken out of the sails of our international critics and detractors and the hands of our global friends in the the East and the West, the South and the North, could be immeasurably strengthened. Their voices would be louder in our defence today. I refer in particular to India, Sir.

Solemn international commitments must be kept, Sir. We, in the United National Party, played no part in drafting or signing the Agreements of May, 2009, arrived at between the Government of Sri Lanka, the Government of India and the United Nations' Secretary-General respectively. These were not tactics so that we could win the war; they were signed after the military victory and the death of Prabhakaran. One Joint Statement refers to the firm resolve of the Sri Lankan President to implement the 13th Amendment. We do not agree with the UN Secretary-Generals interpretation of the Statement to the effect that we agreed to an internationally- supervised accountability mechanism or indeed any accountability mechanism. However, there are commitments made, which are transparent, plain and unambiguous. Once such commitments have been made, we fail to keep them at the cost of the credibility of Sri Lanka as a State. At this juncture, may I remind this House of the famous Grotian dictum "pacta sunt servanda" - thou shall abide by agreements.

Sir, I take this opportunity to table* the relevant Joint Statements citing the agreements the President of Sri Lanka entered into with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Indian officials to be included in Hansard.

Economic diplomacy is vital to Sri Lankas well-being and the post-war take-off, Sir. We are opposed to the crude ultimatum of the European Union. The question is not whether we should or should have complied with the EU's stipulated conditions for continuing to enjoy the GSP Plus. The question is, why many of those conditions still remain to be presented to us by outsiders as conditions we have to comply with. Why must Sri Lanka suffer this indignity? One year after the war, why is the Emergency not removed or drastically scaled down? Why has the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ICCPR - which no less a patriot than the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar proudly signed us up to in 1997, not yet been ratified even a year after the war?

Why does the Prevention of Terrorism Act remain unchanged in peace time?

Sir, the crisis with the EU on GSP Plus will be dwarfed by another challenge that is on the horizon. The gigantic US trade union combine, the AFL-CIO, is petitioning the US Trade Representative against extending preferential access for Sri Lankan exports to the United States market, on grounds of non-compliance with certain labour laws. Whatever the motivations behind this, however unfair or malign the motivations, why are we in a situation vulnerable to such criticisms, as those levelled against us on governance issues by the EU and the AFL-CIO petitioners? We successfully gained access to the US market during the tenure of President Premadasa, with Mr. Milinda Moragoda as our special negotiator. During the Premadasa years, we not only made headway in privatization, in successfully attracting foreign capital and jump-starting the stock market, we also had a huge growth in the number of registered trade unions. The Premadasa administration transformed an unprecedented number of workers into shareholders through the programme of peoplization while the 200-Garment Factories Programme provided employment and prosperity to large numbers of poverty-stricken young men and women in rural and semi-urban areas in Sri Lanka. It pains us in the United National Party and it especially pains me, to see all the economic openings and opportunities with their resultant benefits for the country and our people being jeopardized by misguided, ill-informed Government policies; jeopardized needlessly, might I add. Is it not because, one year after the war, there is no post-war relaxation or catch-up with global norms of good governance?

Why are we running this huge economic risk of losing preferential access to both the EU and the US market, with the terrible costs that will have to be borne by the women workers in our garment sector? What is keeping us this way, a target for anti-Sri Lanka propaganda? Is it a misplaced doctrine of economic autarchy parading as "self sufficiency", which is an anomaly in a globalized world economy, or is it a need to keep in place repressive laws, rules, regulations and practices so as to implement the project of dynastic succession and the monopolization of political and economic power in the hands of an exclusive coterie?

Is Sri Lankas economy, its workers and their families and the business sector having to pay the price of bad governance and paucity of human rights simply in order to build a quasi-monarchy, itself an unsustainable absurdity in the 21st Century? Do the Sri Lankan people, whom I would refer to as the silent majority, continue to become "sacrificial lambs" for the benefit of the affluent

and privileged few?

In winding up my speech, I strike this note of caution, Sir: the dominant ideological and rhetorical impulses of this Government, or should I say, of its dominant stratum, are those of aggressive isolationism, involution and xenophobia. They combine to constitute a syndrome. This syndrome is not only at variance with the globalized world and the information age, but it will also cause us to lose the battle for world opinion and will assist those secessionist and irredentist elements in the diaspora, who have never given up the struggle against Sri Lanka and the creation of a separate State. If the Government's own Minister of External Affairs is to succeed in his task, the Government must abandon this syndrome. If we are to consolidate the victory of the Armed Forces, the Government must change its mindset and make way for those of us, whose broad and pluralist mainstream patriotism can win that new war in the world arena.

But, what is the definition of that pluralist patriotism? I can do no better than to quote the words of my late father, who, as President, said in November, 1990, The history and the future of Sri Lanka do not belong to any group. Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers have equal access and equal places in our society. Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity are all religions of Sri Lanka. Any government that is committed to a free and a united Sri Lanka must be committed to these concepts."

Sir, let me conclude with a fine universal definition of patriotism I have encountered. I chanced upon it while perusing a speech, the then Senator Barack Obama made in 2008. In it he quoted Mark Twain, one of the greatest of American writers and a favourite of the late Hon. S.W.R.D Bandaranaike. Mark Twain rightly states, I quote:

Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.

Mr. Chairman, let me assure this distinguished and illustrious Assembly that we, the United National Party, will at all times, strive ceaselessly to protect the unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence of our motherland while concurrently ensuring, protecting and promoting the political, civil, human, economic and social rights of all citizens of Sri Lanka irrespective of ethnicity, caste, creed, religion and political affiliations.

I thank you.

( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Mr. Chairman, the Government of Sri Lanka, under its national development framework, "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future" has envisioned to transform Sri Lanka into the Emerging Wonder of Asia achieving the Millennium Development Goals and thereby eradicate extreme poverty, achieve universal access to primary education, improve maternal health, reduce child mortality, ensure gender equality and environmental sustainability and make Sri Lanka a very promising beautiful island. The Governments "Mahinda Chintana" strategy envisages to make Sri Lanka an excellent place to live with diverse community who respect and care for one another, to create wealth and creative citizens who have skills to compete internationally. The "Mahinda Chintana" strategy incorporates five hub concepts, which focus on key areas like sea, aviation, commerce, energy and knowledge to make our motherland, a strategically important economic centre of the world.

2010 08

The three-decade old conflict has been brought to an end. We were even able to withstand the global financial and economic crisis and we are moving on a road that leads to prosperity.

Despite progress, there are major challenges faced by us. The growing economic prosperity and the benefits of recent developments have to filter down to all people. It is clear that in the past, the economic growth has largely bypassed the rural areas and concentrated in the Western Province. The statistical evidence clearly confirms that over 45 per cent of the national GDP contribution comes from the Western Province, whereas the contributions from other provinces are very marginal. For example, the contribution to the national GDP by the Northern Province is 2.9 per cent, by the Uva Province it is 4.6 per cent, by the North-Central Province it is 4.7 per cent and by the Eastern Province it is 5.5 per cent which indicates the high level of regional disparity. It is, therefore, important to address the regional disparities.

His Excellency the Presidents "Mahinda Chintana -Vision for the Future" emphasizes very strongly on the need for strengthening the traditional industries and small and medium enterprises with a view to enhance the income of rural masses, create self-employment opportunities, increase the regional GDP and reduce poverty and regional income disparities. Small and medium industries are considered as the backbone of our national economy.

The vision of my Ministry is to upgrade, expand and strengthen the traditional industries and small and medium enterprises and make them large, dynamic and vibrant economic sectors that can contribute significantly to the Gross National Product by producing world-class, highly value-added and profitable products that can compete both locally and internationally and generate sustainable employment and income to the rural masses. This vision integrates the positive attributes of a liberal market economy with domestic aspirations.

In terms of the vision, my Ministry is actively involved in the formulation of policies and programmes and directing the implementation of such policies and programmes in the area of Handicraft Sector, Small and Medium Industries - SMIs - and Small and Medium Enterprises - SMEs - Elephant Pass and Kurinchativu Saltern and the Palmyrah Sector.

The institutions that come under the purview of my Ministry are the Industrial Development Board - IDB - the National Craft Council - NCC - the National Design Centre - NDC - Palmyrah Development Board, Elephant Pass and Kurinchativu Saltern and North Sea Limited.

As the Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, my Ministry will play a leading role in the country by mobilizing the small entrepreneurs

engaged in traditional industries, handicrafts and small industries and enterprises scattered all over the island, and contribute towards the "Mahinda Chintana" vision of transforming Sri Lanka as the Emerging Wonder of Asia. In this regard, a medium-term Results Focused Strategic Plan is being prepared by the Ministry.

My Ministry will play a significant role by supporting in the transfer of technology to the rural industrialists and handicraftsmen; introduce innovative designs to enhance competitiveness in the market; provide opportunities to run trade fairs at provincial and national levels to find market opportunities to promote handicraft and small industries; transfer technical, managerial and entrepreneurial skills and training to small and medium enterprises; streamline the availability of credit to SMIs and provide quality raw materials and equipment to support the SMIs and SMEs scattered all over the island.

One of the major constraints in setting up of SMIs in the rural sector has been the difficulties experienced in finding suitable locations to set up industries with infrastructure facilities. In this regard, the IDB has been supporting the industrialists with industrial estates.

In the early 1970s, the IDB set up an industrial estate in Atchuveli, Jaffna and it had 36 factory units with successful SMEs. The building and infrastructure has been completely destroyed due to the prevailed conflict which prevailed. It is proposed to re-establish the Atchuveli industrial estate in Jaffna which has 65 acres of land and my Ministry is working very closely with the Ministry of Finance and Planning on this initiative.

Moreover, preliminary discussions are underway on the proposal to set up Garment Manufacturing Projects at the IDB Industrial Estate, Atchuveli, for generating employment opportunities in Jaffna. My Ministry, in collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Development and BOI, is in the process of obtaining the consent of major investors such as MAS Holdings, Brandix, Timex and Omega Line to establish Garments Manufacturing Projects at their cost in the 25 acres of Atchuveli Industrial Estate land.

With regard to the SMEs, there are many challenges, and my Ministry plans to address those challenges through a medium-term plan. The lack of infrastructure facilities for SMEs remains a major constraint. The Ministry has initiated action to address these issues by strengthening and establishing industrial estates with infrastructure facilities, readily-built factory units and common service centres. Moreover, the SMIs will be supported with necessary equipment and facilities.

Cost of finance and availability of concessionary credit and emphasis on collaterals by banks and financial institutions remains a challenge. An effective system of

947 948

credit guarantee would help in this regard. The existing financial institutions need to take a proactive role in helping local enterprises. My Ministry will address these issues and assist SMEs to prepare feasibility reports and obtain concessionary credit.

Low level of technology, lack of technical know-how and low productivity are problems encountered by SMIs. My Ministry will examine the existing technology transfer initiatives and strengthen programmes with more appropriate technical know-how.

Lack of marketing facilities is also a major problem. My Ministry has initiated action to establish Lakkam" Sales Centres to provide display and sales facilities on major road routes and provide support to conduct trade fairs and exhibitions to promote market facility.

Access to raw materials is also a challenge. My Ministry will purchase scrap materials and issue them to SMIs and SMEs. The Cess fund and other facilities will be optimally uitilized in a very transparent manner for this purpose.

Establishment of incubators and industrial estates with infrastructure facilities are fundamental to create competitive advantage for industries.

No venture capital funding is made available to SMEs in Sri Lanka. Capital market is hardly used for raising funds for their businesses. The Ministry will study this area and formulate suitable strategies.

My Ministry will take action to introduce a database and information management system on SMIs and handicraft villages. The national development plan, Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future recognizes handicraft sector as the drive for rural livelihood development, self-employment and poverty reduction. From a cultural perspective, the handicraft sector has potential to project Sri Lankas rich and diverse cultural heritage. It is also a vital source for the livelihood of women, youth, people with disabilities and displaced and has potentials to mainstream vulnerable groups into the national economic development.

My Ministry will initiate action to develop a national strategy on handicraft sector to mainstream this creative industry. The traditional handicraft sector has 19 clusters which includes clay, coir and fibre, jute, cane, metal, jewellery, masks, batik, lace-work, wood-based products, leather et cetera. The medium-term focus of the Ministry will be to strengthen the handicraft villages; provide support in the form of raw materials; access to credit, encourage market-oriented designs and product development, transfer of technology and craftsmanship, training and capacity development of craftsmen, quality

improvement, establishment of a marketing network through national and provincial exhibitions and trade fairs, recognition of craftsmen through awarding medals, cash prizes, awards and certificates; creation of craft villages, museums and centres and link with the tourism sector to make this a dynamic and vibrant sector. Moreover, a web-based information system will be developed to link the handicraft sector and the handicraft villages with the tourism sector.

My Ministry has organized a four-day National Exhibition and Trade Fair on Handicrafts and Small Industries at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Exhibition Centre, BMICH from 22nd July to 25th July, 2010, which will be inaugurated by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This national exhibition will display over 1,200 handicraft items and over 700 craftsmen from 19 handicraft clusters and over 90 small and medium industrialists with over 1,000 products from 14 clusters will participate to showcase their creative products, processes, skills and talents. There will be over 156 trade stalls given to producers to sell their products. Out of those 156 stalls, 68 stalls would be for handicrafts and 68 would be for SMIs. Stalls will only be given to producers and not to the middlemen. This gives an opportunity for the people to buy directly from the producers.

I take this opportunity to invite all the Hon. Members of Parliament to visit the National Exhibition and Trade Fair and extend their support to the handicraft sector and small and medium industries. I am happy and pleased to state that all the Provincial Councils also have organized such provincial exhibitions and trade fairs to promote handicrafts and SMIs, and they closely work with my Ministry in this national endeavour.

Similarly, the National Award Ceremony on Handicrafts and Small Industries is to be held during August, 2010 at the Janakalakendraya, Battaramulla to recognize and appreciate the high standards of craftsmanship and entrepreneurial skills of our national winners - the craftsmen and small industrialists.

The Palmyrah Industry is also a very important industry that comes under the purview of my Ministry. Under the Mahinda Chintana : Vision for a New Sri Lanka, A Ten-Year Horizon Development Framework 2006 -2016, it is planned to increase the number of palmyrah plants from the current level of 11 million to 20 million by 2016. The Ministry will also develop and promote the palmyrah industry as a significant contributor to the national GDP with a focus on increasing the new plantations and enhancing product development and research.

It is also proposed to expand the Katpagam sales outlets in Colombo and Kandy; popularize palmyrah products; enhance production of palmyrah handicrafts, SAP production, pulp production, the production of soft

949 950

[ ]

2010 08

drinks and jaggery, fibre production, promote other value-added productions such as pinatu, sweet toddy, tuber flour, palmyrah jam et cetera; conduct exhibitions and trade fairs and marketing arrangements to popularize the palmyrah products; re-establish the Kaithady Research Institute; relocate the Head Office of the Palmyrah Development Board in Jaffna; and to provide employment and income to the dependents of this sector. The Palmyrah Research Institute in Jaffna was deserted after 1995 due to the civil unrest that prevailed. The Government of India has agreed to provide, under its small grant assistance scheme, modern laboratory equipment to re-establish and strengthen the Kaithady Palmyrah Research Institute at a cost of Rs. 70.5 million. With this support, the palmyrah products are expected to be popularized in the domestic and overseas markets through promoting value-added and new products.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up. Your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Sir, give me just two more minutes, please.

The Annual Implementation Plan for 2010, among many other nationwide initiatives, includes a kitul production programme, development of craft villages, improvement of the Polonnaruwa and Badulla "Lakkam" Sales Centres, establishment of "Lakkam" Sales Centres in Jaffna, Vavuniya and Batticaloa and strengthening of Common Service Centres.

Moreover, the 2010 Implementation Plan includes the reactivation of the abandoned Elephant Pass and Kurinchativu Salterns in the North, which will be able to help achieve a national salt production level of at least 60,000 to 80,000 metric tons in the medium-term and provide employment opportunities to 2,000 people. I understand that Elephant Pass had been the largest saltern in the Island.

My Ministry will closely work with the other Line Ministries, Provincial Councils, the Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industries, the private sector and other development partners to fulfill the achievement of its mission. The total budget of my Ministry is Rs. 687 million, of which Rs. 493 million is for Recurrent Expenditure and Rs. 194 million is for Capital Expenditure.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Minister, I do not want to interrupt you. I just want to -

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Give me one more minute, Sir. I am going to wind up.

My Ministry will ensure that every rupee of the budget is spent in a result-oriented manner to meet the vision of the national development plan.

Finally, let me express my sincere appreciation of the contribution made by the Hon. Deputy Minister, the Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake, the Secretary and the staff of my Ministry, the chairmen of all the institutions that come under the purview of my Ministry.

Under the "Mahinda Chintana" development framework, several long-term development activities have been introduced which aim to boost the economy of the country, emphasizing on economic growth through industrial development, especially the development of the SME sector. Through the Budget 2010, the Government expects to implement an island-wide integrated development strategy introduced by the "Mahinda Chintana" in order to minimize regional disparities. The Budget has focused on infrastructure development with the objective of attracting foreign investment, which is a vital factor to stimulate economic growth. It also introduces a simple, lower and broad-based tax regime which gears towards an investment-friendly environment. In addition, interest rates have been reduced from 25 - 30 per cent to 14-16 per cent within the last year which is a further encouragement to investment. A special emphasis has been made by the Budget 2010 for the development of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces which have not been able to benefit through the development programmes implemented by the Government, due to the war situation which prevailed in those areas. The Government hopes to mobilize the human and other resources, which had long been abandoned in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, along with the national development activities. As a person who was directly affected by the LTTE terrorism, who had to undergo much suffering through displacement of our families from our homes and lands, the rebuilding of this country is of special significance to me. The UPFA Government's endeavour is to build a peaceful and prosperous nation where all communities can exist together in harmony. In spite of the war situation that halted the economic activities of one-third of the country, Sri Lanka has been able to maintain a stable growth rate close to around 6.4

per cent, as well as other economic and social indicators, which signify an upward trend. - [ Interruption.] Hon. Harees, we are planning to establish 100 industries in the Northern and Eastern areas within three years. Also, an inflation rate of 4.6 per cent has been reported in the last month. It should be noted that even during the recent global economic downturn, the growth rate did not go down beyond 3.5 per cent , which is remarkable.

The above figures signify a stable and predictable macroeconomic environment, which is conducive for the acceleration of economic activities, as well as to attract foreign and local investments.

The Government has stressed the importance of expediting the infrastructure and other development activities in the North and the East which are essential to stimulate and encourage investments in order to uplift the standards of living on par with the other areas of the country. Concessionary schemes for investments in development projects of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces have already been proposed.

At this moment, I must mention that due to the war situation, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, especially the North, was not in a position to get full advantage of these programmes at that time. Since rehabilitation, resettlement and provision of infrastructure are underway and nearing completion, I believe that people in those areas are ready to reap the benefits of those programmes now. Therefore, it is our duty to provide concessions to attract investments to those provinces which had lost an opportunity earlier. For this purpose, we have already submitted a Cabinet Paper and made arrangements to open a sub-regional office in Vavuniya. This, I hope, would expedite various programmes with proper coordination.

Further, the Government has planned to implement and rejuvenate 100 new and existing industrial development programmes within the next three years in the Northern Province. These include palmyrah and rice-based industries, fish processing, fishing gear manufacturing, salt and salt-based industries, construction material manufacturing as well as handloom and textile industries. Several activities with regard to the training of weavers and trainers, design development and the provision of yarn, handloom spares have already been carried out in the North and the East by the Kantha Diriya programme aiming the skilled and non-skilled labour in abundance, especially the large number of widows. Activities in relation to technology improvement and product development, supply of backward and forward linkages et cetera, would also be carried out in order to support the said programmes.

In order to increase salt manufacturing of Manthai Salt Limited, the Government has planned to extend the Mannar Saltern by fifty acres, with the view to increasing

the production by an additional 3,000 metric tons of salt per annum. In addition to this, plans have been laid to re-activate the Kumburupitiya Saltern ,which is located in Trincomalee. It has the capacity to produce 7,000 metric tons of salt per annum.

Since the war that devastated the economy of Sri Lanka for 30 years has come to an end, the Government has been able to grant many concessions to the industrial sector.

During the past year, a significant growth in the industrial sector has been observed. At present, even with the global downturn, industrial sector has managed to contribute 4.2 per cent to the GDP and 25 per cent to the total employment in Sri Lanka.

Also, many developments have taken place recently, which have contributed to the advancement of the industrial sector.

The scheme for exemption from excise duty for locally assembled or manufactured motor vehicles with at least 30 per cent local value addition, has encouraged several investments in the industry which has resulted in many locally assembled motor vehicles being available in the local market at competitive prices. As a result, a significant development in the automobile components manufacturing industry has been observed. At present, many local industries are in a position to manufacture high quality components which contribute to the saving of foreign exchange through import substitution.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Okay, Sir. In order to facilitate local industries, import duty on raw materials and intermediate input has been brought down to zero so that they could be imported duty free. As a result of the duty reduction, the cost of production of local industries would come down making their products more competitive in the local and international markets.

The high cost of capital has been identified as a major barrier to investments. As such, the Government has taken steps to reduce the import duty on machinery to zero and to remove the VAT on several items of machinery and equipment.

In addition to the above, the Government has made significant headway in the area of regional development through the Regional Industrial Estate Development Programme and the "Gamata Karmantha" 300-Industries

971 972

Programme. At present, 26 industrial estates in various parts of the country have been established providing more than 250 industrial units and 15,000 direct job opportunities. Six more industrial estates are under construction. They are scattered in regional areas and concentrate on the usage of local raw material, technology transfer, employment generation and investment promotion in rural areas.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, I table* the rest of my speech. In conclusion, I wish to thank my Deputy Minister, the Hon. Jayarathne Herath, my Secretary, Mr. Tilak Collure and the other officials of my Ministry. * : * : * Rest of the speech tabled: In order to bring out collective solutions to issues faced by various industries, advisory committees have been established which comprise of all relevant stakeholders of the Government and the private sector. A Significant feature of these advisory committees is the assistance given by the Government to universities and other Government institutions for introduction of various facilitation centres, technology development, industrial designing, laboratory upgrading, quality improvement and environment management.

Since the Small and Medium Enterprises, which accounts for 96 per cent of all industrial establishments, is the backbone of the rural economy, the Government has identified the SME sector as the key to rural development. Hence, many programmes have been implemented island-wide to facilitate this sector. The National Enterprises Development Authority-NEDA-has planned to establish entrepreneurial centres in every district to encourage small and medium-scale entrepreneurs. The NEDA has also planned to establish a SME University with the support of JICA, for the skill development of entrepreneurs.

With the abolition of the quota system and the recent issues which has arisen with regard to the GSP Plus scheme, the apparel sector had to face numerous challenges in the competitive global market. Therefore, many programmes have been launched by the Government to increase the competitiveness of the local apparel sector, enabling them to overcome their problems. These include, programmes on productivity improvement in the apparel sector, apparel sector image building, Clothing Design Degree Programme conducted by the University of Moratuwa and programmes to develop the small and medium apparel industry. The Government has granted several concessions for the development of the handloom industry as well.

The export sector of Sri Lanka which experienced a severe setback in 2009 due to the global economic downturn performed satisfactorily during the first five months of this year registering a positive growth rate of 10 per cent. This could be attributed to the pragmatic policies adopted by the Government, the resilience shown by the private sector in the pace of numerous adversities and the development programmes carried out by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board during this period. The

EDB initiated several measures to diversify into new markets and to broaden export supply base to suit the new markets. These initiatives contributed towards reducing the impact of the global recession and support the export sector to weather crisis.

In its efforts to promote and develop exports of Sri Lanka, the Export Development Board-EDB-carried out an array of programmes pertaining to enhance the supply chain efficiency, promotion of export-oriented SMEs, trade facilitation, provision of trade information, e-commerce services and other support services and entrepreneurship and skills development during this period. The main objective of these programmes was to enhance the competiveness of the export sector and thereby enabling them to confront the global challenges.

During the year 2009, Sri Lanka has expanded its foreign trade relations, through bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreements of which it is a party.

In order to improve market access for Sri Lankan exports, the Government has taken positive steps to negotiate the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement-APT- which facilitates Sri Lanka to enhance her market access, particularly to three major markets namely, China, South Korea and India. It is noteworthy to mention that the export growth to China and South Korea under APTA was 53 per cent and 99 per cent respectively during the year 2009.

In addition, Sri Lanka effectively participates in the deliberations of the South Asian Free Trade AreaSAFTA, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Co-operationBIMSTEC, and Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Co-operation-IOR-ARC.

In addition to the above, Sri Lanka is a party to bilateral trade agreements such as, India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement-ISFTA, Pakistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement-PSFTA, and Trade and Investment Framework Agreement-TIFA with the USA, which have made a substantial contribution to the export diversification and foreign exchange earning.

Under this Budget, a solid foundation has now been laid to promote a high level of production and investment in our economy. My Ministry and institutions coming under that will also fully participate in the national economic development effort which is being spearheaded by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa through his Ministry.

We hope to receive the fullest support and advice of our industrialists, exporters and their chambers for this purpose. We will maintain an active dialogue with these stakeholders to formulate necessary strategies and plans to achieve the national development targets. With such dedicated efforts, it will be possible to fulfil the inspired vision of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make Sri Lanka the Wonder of Asia.

) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. You have 30 minutes.

[. . 1.42] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman, for giving me this opportunity to speak on a day we are Discussing the Votes of many Ministries of importance.

Sir, let me start off with the Ministry of External Affairs. I am happy to see the Hon. Minister coming in. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris may be able person, but as the Minister of External Affairs, he may not be. That is the question at this particular moment, because in the morning he referred to acrimonious politics that is being played.

When we talk about national politics, unfortunately, it necessitates us to take stands from a political perspective. The United National Party has always been having a very clear, crisp, coherent, consistent policy unlike alliances, which change day by day. So, as a result, whatever that is attributed is being taken as for the administration and may not be personal. You were on this side, we were on that side; that does not make any difference. But, at this particular moment we want to reflect the policy of the Government, vis-a-vis, in todays context. I agree that the External Affairs is a very important Ministry that is playing a very pivotal role today, but let me ask you Hon. Minister, what is the policy of the Government?

I just read the "Performance Report 2009" that was given to us today. This is what you have stated under Mission. It states, I quote:

The promotion, projection and protection internationally on Sri Lankas national interests, in accordance with the foreign policy of the Government and to advise the Government on managing international developments in keeping with the best interests of Sri Lanka.

Fantastic! If that is the "Mission" statement, is the Minister and the Ministry going according to the mission that is expected of them? That is certainly the expectation and I guess that is the necessity to achieve it.

I will go a little further. Under "Subjects and Functions", it states, I quote: Implementation of political, plans and programmes in respect of External Affairs; representation of Sri Lanka abroad; international agreements, treaties; foreign Government and International organization representation in Sri Lanka; external publicity; diplomatic immunities and privileges and consular function.

So, as you see the "Mission" and the "Subjects and Functions" that are there, it is very clearly spelt out that Sri Lanka is not a country in isolation. We are a little country in the world. The world is not inside Sri Lanka. , . So, as a result, we have got to have our policies that are necessary in order to ensure that we achieve our objective. If I may put it in a different term; the foreign policy is an extension of the domestic interest. We must adopt a policy of "friendship with all but malice with none". That should be the cardinal principle in what we are doing. We must have a policy of catching more bees with honey than with vinegar. What is the policy? We must go along with certain accepted

norms. I am sure you know it. Is it that the Government as a policy is not allowing to go along? There is no point in having personal expectations and saying, Yes, we do this, but as a policy of the Government, it is not going ahead.

So, Hon. Minister, all I want to say is, today there are very critical matters that affect the ongoing situation of the country. I know you were making certain important points in the morning. Unfortunately, you were representing points that were put across rather than spelling out the policy of your Ministry. But, I am sure at the end of it, you may do so.

Hon. Minister, I think what we have got to do is, ensure that Sri Lanka is in a market position, a niche market. There is no point in trying to be the lovers of the entire world and at the end of the day antagonizing the people who can help you. There is no point in going after people who absolutely have no interest in Sri Lanka. The world has no interest in Sri Lanka at all. Let us accept that. But, we have to position ourselves in order to ensure that Sri Lanka is recognized and accepted in the international community. There are 195 countries in the world. Sri Lanka is just another one of them. So, do not think that our shouting around and our machofying will help Sri Lanka to get attention. We must not alienate ourselves. That is what is happening today.

Let me take trade. Being in the field, I thought it was my duty to spell out certain things that would be helpful in order to take Sri Lanka to a better tomorrow. When you were the Minister of Industries, you were helpful in those areas. You know that as an Opposition Member, my intention is to promote more trade rather than go on aid, because if you trade yourself, you do not need the aid. That is the result. I think you are also aware of this as the External Affairs Minister. Today commercial diplomacy is the want of the day. The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, spoke previously on that issue. I think between the Industries Minister and the External Affairs Minister, is where our future lies. We must face the challenges that are before us. It is said, Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass, it is about learning how to dance in the rain. There is no point in waiting till everything comes to normality. The world is in absolute turbulence. Let us go through that. So, certainly, we must get Sri Lanka better known as a trading nation rather than a nation that is traded. At this particular moment, we have shown as if we are trading. The country is being traded to obtain petrol for six months from here and two months import subsidy from there. That does not help. Today, we are recognized for having got rid of terrorism. Certainly! Now, with that, let us take the intrinsic skills that are there; ensure that we are able to put that into the world market.

You stated that "a friend in need is a friend indeed". If that is the case, there is no point in a country giving

975 976

you aid at 8 or 9 per cent. Then, that country is not a friend in need and a friend indeed. Anybody can come and give you money at interest rates of 5, 6, 7 or 8 per cent. If a person comes and tells you to ensure that you stand on your two [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

feet and do the correct thing, and just because he says something correct, that does not mean that he is against you. It is like the Opposition. We tell you to correct yourselves. Remember, we are playing with the nations economy. This is not the Presidents economy or a Ministers economy. This is the countrys economy. This cannot be colourized. There is no blue, green, or red to it. So, all what we are saying is what is good for Mother Lanka and that is what we have got to look at.

You mentioned about the Chinese aid that has been given. I asked a Question regarding that when you were present at that time and the answer was that US Dollars 3,500 million was given. Then, I asked you about the interest rates but you avoided giving that. But, subsequently, when you add on the contracts and put them together, it is 3 to 4 per cent for the first phase of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant Project and for the second phase, it is 7 to 9 per cent. You do not need a friend to give that. You can walk into a commercial bank and get that money at a cheaper rate. So, just because you are basically strangulated in certain areas and you do not get money, and somebody coming and helping you does not mean that he is a friend. He is taking a commercial opportunity of a particular want. So, Hon. Minister, you were talking on that basis. It is not like trying to have instant Chinese noodles. China is there. It is certainly a very important country and we have got to ensure that we trade in a way that it is advantageous to us. We basically have more imports coming in than exports. What about the exports to China? In 1952, at least we were able to have the Rubber-Rice Agreement with China. Then, at least, there was an import and export movement. Today, we have a 1 : 100 type of ratio with China. So, ensure that is changed. That should be the Government policy.

Take the Indo-Lanka Accord. When you and I were in Government in 2002-2004, the export ratio was 1 : 10. For every 10 exports from India, there was only one import from Sri Lanka. But, finally, when we left, there was one import from Sri Lanka for every four exports from India. We reduced the gap. That is what is required when two different countries are engaged in trade. Just because China gives money it does not mean that she is a friend. We do not need to antagonize them. Let us get as much money as possible on concessionary rates and not on commercial rates. Likewise is India.

The President had stated, What India thinks matters to me. Why should I worry about the rest of the world? That is a very friendly statement to India and if you walk the talk, certainly that is beneficial but only walk the talk is in the proof of the pudding. Only mentioning that does not help. The LIOC is in a problem if they are not able to revise the selling standards here. India has been asked to come and aid us in the KKS Port but when they come, the Chinese aid is already there.

The Palali Airport is being spoken of by the Indian Government but the Chinese aid has already come in. The roads there have been financed by China. If that is the Indian thinking, then we must mould ourselves to accept that and see how the Indians are responding to that. India is certainly a very important geopolitical friend to us and they have always been there during a particular need. But, then, our reciprocity should be from the same point. They have been asking us to solve the political problem in this country since 2005. Escaping from them and moving from one to another is not the answer. You must engage yourself and take a stand on the country because this country does not belong to one particular person or family. This is a country. So, our policies should be in order to ensure that we get the maximum benefit for Sri Lanka.

On that basis, look at the SAARC. China and India are very important. Let us engage them in a manner that is useful and beneficial for Sri Lanka. Then, you move on to the region. We have to trade with them and that is how we can take Sri Lanka forward. If little Sri Lanka does not have its market share, we have to open it out, and opening it out means regional trade, bilateral trade and that is where we have to go forward. So, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs certainly has a pivotal role to play.

With regard to the SAARC, where is the move forward? We have taken one step forward and come back two steps. With regard to the BIMSTEC, where is the move forward? Nothing happening there. There is only talk and nothing is moving forward. It has nothing to do with you as the Minister. You have only inherited what has been coming down. That has been the Government policy. Look at the stand you took on Pakistan; look at the stand you took on the PLO. You voted against that. You are a friend on one side, and on the other, you vote against that. Look at the situation with regard to the Commonwealth. You were trying to host the conference, but you were knocked off. Why? Because we are not accepted as an international player. So, let us not get isolated because after all, Sri Lanka has to play a pivotal role in that area, especially at a time when the entire world is looking at us. Further, we have got to develop the SAARC because that is the regional strength with which we can take the world on.

Then, look at the EU. The European Union is a very formidable association. But, now we are paying scant

977 978

[ ]

2010 08

respect to them. On the one hand, you say, Please help us, please aid us and on the other, you say, Please forget us. You and I managed to get the Labour GSP for this country. I am sure you would not deny that. When we got it, we got it from 2005 to 2008. We got a further extension. For two years, I had been telling your predecessor in this House, Let us work together. Protect the Labour GSP because it is very important for Sri Lanka. At that time, what did they tell us? They said: We will do our job. You do not worry about it from the Opposition. Two years and one month later, we have lost it. We do not relish that. It is not good for the country, neither is it good for you. Even at this late stage, the Government and the Opposition can work together; let us protect this country. Let three or four lakhs of innocent people not lose out on this owing to your arrogance, disobedience or lack of international knowledge. We have to alienate ourselves from that.

Hon. Minister, I take your mind back to a statement you made in this House. I am quoting from column 1,014 of the Hansard of 10th October, 2007:

The GSP Plus arrangements are absolutely vital for the economy of Sri Lanka. I would describe it as a lifeline of our economy.

In column 1,015 of the same Hansard you state, I quote:

The Government of Sri Lanka will shortly negotiate for the extension of this GSP Plus concession for a further three years from 2008 to 2011. That again is a very considerable benefit that we would be entitled to if we comply with certain criteria.

So, you knew that you will have to comply with some criteria, not that they were unknown conditions. I, at this particular moment, , . . . . .

As a last comment, Sir, I would like to earnestly appeal to everybody, all political parties and all groups of the country, to treat the matter above the level of partisan politics. We may disagree on many matters. Politics is about power. There is no doubt about that. But, there are certain things that go beyond adversarial, confrontational politics. Your words were the same, Hon. Minister; two years ago you said the same thing. Are you not pursuing adversarial politics? On one side, you are asking us to engage with you and on the other, our Members are being harassed. The Hon. Palitha Tewarapperuma is still in jail; the Hon. Sarath Fonseka is in jail. You have KP out there. So, where is adversarial politics being maintained? It is not by the Opposition. We said two years ago, We are ready to engage with you. Let us walk together and ensure that we challenge the world. That was

disregarded. It may not be by you, Hon. Minister, maybe by your predecessor, but it is one administration. There is no point in blaming the last Minister when it is the same Government you are talking to. That is the proof of the pudding. So, there is no point in paying lip-service if you are not doing what you have got to do. I mentioned that only to show that we keep a tab of what is being spoken.

On the same basis, I must state that the Harare Declaration is something that is absolutely essential for us. We must ensure, if we are to be in the "international club", as they call it - I am sure you understand what I mean - that democracy, the democratic process and institutions are maintained. There is no point in saying certain things and not doing them because the rest of the world is looking at the agreements we have signed. With your permission, Sir, I will read out from the Harare Declaration. It states, I quote:

democracy, democratic processes and institutions which reflect national circumstances, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, just and honest government;

fundamental human rights, including equal rights and opportunities for all citizens regardless of race, colour, creed or political belief;

Our own Constitution has this. Forget what is in the Harare Declaration.

. , there is no point in saying do what I say, but do not do what I do. That is what I am trying to say. So, do not point the finger at the Opposition and say, "You are not doing anything. We are helping you. You are disregarding us. You, sometimes, even malign us saying, This is what you go and say to the outside world. Your incompetence should not be put on our competence. We are there to defend the country. When it comes to national issues, we are there together. But, when it comes to political issues, we may differ and we have to differ. Otherwise, there would be no difference. But, let us ensure that we have a stand. We must have a character to take a decision. At this point, what a joke one Minister has become! The Cabinet of Ministers have a collective responsibility.

, . . . , . . . plug . . . ? "Ban Ki-moon, go to the moon" ?

979 980

? ? . . , . . . ? , . . . , . ? ? . That is the essentiality of external affairs.

I know you spoke from the Maldives, Hon. Minister. Mr. Romesh Jayasinghe, the Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs, goes there. You just replay the video. What a disgrace it was! It is better if he did not go there. He was made to go. Look at the ridiculousness of how the IGP and a DIG were dealt with by a Minister in this country. That is what we are talking about.

. . ; . . . . . - [ ] . . . . , plug . plug -[ ] . .

Coming back to Ban Ki-moon, you know, Hon. Minister of External Affairs, that your vote was for Ban Ki-moon when he was contesting for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations. I remember, you did not help Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, a Sri Lankan. You did not help Mr. Deva Aditya, another Sri Lankan. So, what is the difference between the Ban Ki-moon then and the Ban Ki-moon now? When he came to Sri Lanka on the 23rd of May, 2009, the Leader of the Opposition and also the Leader of the the United National Party, the party that brought Independence to this country, was not afforded an opportunity to meet him. Finally, at the last moment, their local representative asked us to come to the Airport and only during the last 15 minutes before he left in his own jet, the Leader of the Opposition was permitted to meet him. So, why do you need to do this type of things in a shroud of secrecy? Let us engage with each other. . .

. ; . . . . . . .

Hon. Minister of External Affairs, I also want to mention about certain things that he stated. I am talking of him, Sir. I will quote what you said: The Secretary-General stated that he is acting on the basis of the Joint Statement of the Government of Sri Lanka and the Secretary-General dated 23rd May, 2009; that the Government had given an undertaking to take measures to address the grievances relating to violations of Human Rights Laws.

You have given this assurance. So, do not blame the world for what you have given. Others contradict this saying, Ban Ki-moon is lying. So, we must ensure that when you mess up the country, we are going to take it up. I am talking on political terms. It will not take too long, the way you are heading. But, when that happens, we must ensure that we take Sri Lanka on without any problem. When you toppled our government, you took over a country with external resources. You had the Ministry of Finance free from debt and you were able to go forward without a problem. So, what we want to do is, ensure that we act together. .

Sir, the position of the Government of Sri Lanka was stated in that. I think it was misinterpreted by some speakers who quoted from the Joint Statement of His Excellency the President and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I wish to quote again from the same statement that was issued at the end of the visit of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to Sri Lanka. In that, the section in question is the last two paragraphs. It states, I quote :

President Rajapaksa informed the UN Secretary-General regarding ongoing initiatives relating to rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-combatants. In addition to the ongoing work by the office of the Commissioner General for Rehabilitation, a National Framework for the Integration of Ex-Combatant into Civilian Life is under preparation, with the assistance of the UN and other International Organizations.

It further states, I quote :

Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lankas international obligations. The Secretary General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances.

This is what was stated. In fact, that is what is being addressed today. The Sri Lankan Government under the guidance of His Excellency the President has set up the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. It is now in motion and this is what the agreement was all about. It is the first step towards the reconciliation process and we have recognized what the Secretary-General and the President stated in that Joint Statement. I would like to make the position very clear in regard to the Joint Statement.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, if you can give me a minute, I could clear another point regarding the GSP issue with the United States of America, which has been raised again. I must state that the ILO has very clearly held our labour standards in very high regard. We have had no complaints so far regarding the labour relations in Sri Lanka. Our negotiations on the GSP issue with the USTR will continue in a positive manner. It is a consultative process that is now being launched and the International Labour Organizations regulations that we

991 992

have already adhered to have been now put forward to the USTR via the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Washington . This process will continue and we are very confident about the position as far as the labour relations in Sri Lanka, of which we have had a very good and a very clear record in the region as well, is concerned and it will be put forward very strongly to the USTR in Washington.

Sir, I thank you for allowing me to speak. [.. 2.35] ( )

( - , )

(The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade) Hon. Deputy Chairman, I thank you for giving me this opportunity and I am very happy to speak today on the Head 116, Head 298 and Heads 300 to 302 of the Ministry of Co-operatives and Internal Trade. I am also very happy to be in the Government as a Member of Parliament elected by the voters of the Puttalam District and for being able to work as the Deputy Minister under the Hon. Johnston Fernando, Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade. We have a proper open economic policy which looks after the interests of the manufacturer, the grower and the consumer.

There are 12 institutions which come under this Ministry. I have only five minutes time, Mr. Deputy Chairman, and within that time I would be unable to speak on all the subjects. I am, of course, very jealous that the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara is seated there. And, I am very jealous about our General-Secretary as well. So, it does not matter. You can sit there.

The current issue is regarding paddy. So, I would like to talk about the Paddy Marketing Board. I would like to say that it was about to be closed in 1990 when Mr. D.M.S. Marapona was the Chairman at that time. But, ever since President Mahinda Rajapaksa took office, he revived the Paddy Marketing Board as he promised in the "Mahinda Chintana". Out of the 375 stores that were available in the Paddy Marketing Board at that time, 61 stores had been sold. Therefore, from the existing stores we purchase paddy. We are self-sufficient in paddy. Actually, we will be having more paddy this year. So, we are ready to purchase it. In 2005, President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his "Mahinda Chintana" promised to give fertilizer which is the most expensive commodity for paddy cultivation at Rs. 350 and even after five years, we are still giving fertilizer at Rs. 350. Actually, a bag of fertilizer that was sold at Rs. 350 in 2005 will cost Rs. 1,000 today if you take the devaluation into consideration and the international prices of fertilizer.

Actually, "Lak Sathosa" was formed by His Excellency the President. He took the initiative. In 2006, we started with one "Lak Sathosa" and increased it to 50 outlets and sales stood at Rs. 586 million. I am happy to state that now there are 201 "Lak Sathosas" and my Minister, the Hon. Johnston Fernando has taken an initiative to increase it to 250 outlets by the end of the year. Thereby, we will become the market leaders in all supermarkets and co-op cities in the country. There are 1,004 co-op cities in the country in which sales have been increased over Rupees one billion per year. So, with the existing 201 "Lak Sathosas", sales for six months have already exceeded Rupees six billion. Therefore, we have got the trust and faith of the people and will continue to monitor the prices and maintain a fair price in the field.

I would like to mention that all the other institutions are also performing very well and we want to create a competitiveness. That is the most important thing. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake also said that we have to open the doors and be competitive so that there will be transparency. So, we have maintained utmost dedication to keep the competitiveness open and give a fair price, despite the prices prevalent in the market. From April up to now, prices have reduced. The price of rice was actually above Rs.100 during the election time. There was an artificial shortage created by the Hon. Members of the Opposition thinking that they are going to get the Government.- [Interruption.] Tea prices are good. That is why you are laughing. You are not even going back to your constituency. You are not talking about the high tea prices. - [Interruption.] I am talking about internal trade. Actually, our Lord Chicken from Kurunegala is also here. He has got a dose of chickenpox during the last few days. "Lord Chicken" is the one who has been importing chicken legs and chicken heads. So, he was affected by the announcement to import chicken. So, I am very thankful - [Interruption.] No, no. I am talking about the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara. He imports chicken. If you want to be part of the Government - I think you will never win by votes. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake stated that there were malpractices during the General Election but the Leader of the United National Party and all other party leaders confirmed that the General Election was free and fair. I think there is no democracy in the United National Party and there is a huge issue on the leadership of the United National Party. We do not have -[Interruption.] There is no democracy in your party. I think your party democracy must come first, before the country.

So, I would like to tell you that we will not allow any corruption to take place. We will also look after the grower, the consumer and everybody else in the country and we will make sure that there will be - [Interruption.] We will look after the Members of the Opposition also, so that they will talk good about our Ministry. We will do our best to keep the Ministry moving forward.

I would like to thank the Secretary, all the Chairmen, the Board of Directors and the officials of the Ministry for doing an excellent job.

We hope to increase sales not by 10 or 20 per cent, but by the end of the year, within 365 days, we will double the sales in our institutions, and I would like to state that we will give quality products unlike the expired products that were offered during your time.

Thank you. [.. 2.42] . ( . ) (The Hon. J. Sri Ranga) , - . - , . 1930 , , . . , 1930, , . . 1930 . 1970 . 1930 1970 40 1970 . . , 1970 Milton Friedman . , 2010 , 40 , . , ? ; . , , , . , ,

Mr. Presiding Member, in 2009, when I was in charge of the Ministry of Youth Empowerment and Socio- Economic Development, 95 projects had been given water supply and two projects had been given electricity supply facilities. Two hundred and eight projects had been developed with roads, footpaths and pavements. Twenty one projects had been completed to develop school buildings and other facilities and 70 religious places and cultural centres had also been developed. Furthermore, 44 sports developments projects, 11 healthcare and sanitation projects, 46 common amenities projects and six skills development projects had also been completed in 2009.

Under the rural development component, the Ministry has developed a five-year plan to overcome the problems which have caused the present unsatisfactory situation in line with the Mahinda Chintana policy document adopting the concept of Maga Naguma and Jana Sabha. Sir, the plan consists of identification of highly lagging areas and preparation of village plans for 100 villages per annum, to restore villages and estates as the centre of prosperity. Development of basic infrastructure facilities, electricity supply, water supply - both drinking and irrigation - and common area development to support the livelihood would be the key priorities.

We have to provide individual houses to those who are living in line rooms without even the minimum facilities. The housing requirement is about 200,000 and out of that 35,000 houses were provided. There are about 1,680 houses under construction through the Plantation Human Development Trust and the NHDA programmes. These programmes have been accelerated and targeted to be completed within the year 2010. The Ministry has proposed to provide 12,500 individual houses within the next five-year period starting from 2010.

The Thondaman Vocational Training Centre - TVTC - has developed 14 training courses to improve the

1027 1028

vocational skills of rural youth in order to compete in the job market. We also have financial support programmes to cater to the youths. At this juncture, Sir, I would like to thank the Government of India for providing instructors at their cost for the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre. Sir, the IT and language training is very essential to develop youth talents to enter the outside job market. Therefore, my Ministry has developed 44 "Praja Shakthi" centres to provide training in IT and languages. This programme has been implemented through the Saumiyamoorthi Thondaman Memorial Foundation - STMF. This programme will be expanded under the proposed five-year plan.

The "Navashakti" project under the STMF has been conceptually well-designed to build the capacity of the rural youth in order to take up self-employment so as to arrest migration of rural youth to urban areas. The youth have been systematically selected and been provided entrepreneurship development training. The objective of the training programme has been to provide orientation and awareness pertaining to various managerial and operational functions like handling finance, production, marketing, enterprise management, banking formalities, bookkeeping et cetera.

Credit being the most critical input for starting an enterprise, the Ministry has subsidized the interest component to facilitate the youth to receive collateral free loans from the banks to set up income generating activities and enterprises. The Ministry has also facilitated marketing support to encourage the youth to run their enterprises successfully.

Sports and cultural development is also very important for social integration, spiritual and capacity development of rural communities. Hence, the Ministry has developed several programmes in rural areas in order to support sports and cultural events. Development of the Norwood Stadium and Ramboda Cultural Centre under this programme aims to develop cultural values of plantation communities in our country.

Sir, the livestock sector is an integral part of the agricultural economy in Sri Lanka and plays a dominant role in food security, poverty reduction, livelihood development, saving valuable foreign exchange, improvement of soil fertility and the conservation of environment. More than 400,000 families are directly engaged in the livestock sector activities in dairy, poultry, goat and swine farming.

The Mahinda Chintana policy document and the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the future has earmarked dairy industry as a key priority area for investment and would help develop the target to achieve 50 per cent self-reliance in local milk production by the year 2015. The country has reached 35 per cent self-

reliance in local milk production at present. There is an increase of 21 per cent in the production of milk from 192 million litres in 2006 to 233 million litres in 2009. The milk collection in the formal milk market too has increased from 113 million litres in 2006 to 125 million litres in 2009 showing an increase of 10 per cent. During the year 2009, Sri Lanka has imported 62,350 metric tons of milk powder costing more than Rs. 19 billion. Therefore, our effort is to increase local milk production to save valuable foreign exchange that is being spent to import milk powder.

The poultry industry of which almost 95 per cent is in the hands of the private entrepreneurs has shown a tremendous growth during the past years. However, due to the Avian influenza disease which affected most of the countries in the world, the local poultry industrialists also reduced their import of parent birds which has resulted in a minor setback in the poultry production at present. I wish to state that Sri Lanka is very fortunate to be free from this disease which has affected most of our neighbouring countries due to the stringent quarantine formalities adopted.

At present, locally produced poultry meat and meat products meet 70 per cent of the country's requirements. However, both the private and the State sector poultry organizations are now gearing up for increased production with import of parent birds and 100 per cent self-reliance is to be reached in the near future. The goat and swine sectors which make a little contribution to the total livestock production need much attention.

There are three main programmes implemented by my Ministry, namely, the establishment of dairy villages to increase milk production, formation of livestock breeder farms to supply breeding animals and the establishment of liquid milk sales outlets to promote consumption of liquid milk.

The Department of Animal Production and Health - DAPH - provides the technical expertise and backup services to the livestock industry. There are 289 field veterinary centres under the provincial DAPH to implement livestock disease control measures and develop programmes at grass roots level. I am happy to inform you that the DAPH has carried out 865,468 immunizations to prevent contagious diseases in cattle and buffaloes. One hundred and seventy two thousand and three hundred and nineteen artificial inseminations had been carried out in 2009, which will result in an estimated 28,000 good quality female calves.

Sir, the National Livestock Development Board - NLDB - which has nearly 40,000 acres under its control, does the main function of supplying the much-needed breeding material to the livestock farmers. The NLDB has issued 1.7 million broiler chicks, 0.5 million layer chicks, 1,033 cattle, 1,833 piglings, 274 goats and 312 sheep to livestock farmers during 2009. The embryo

1029 1030

[ ]

2010 08

transfer programme which was initiated with the import of 200 embryos has produced 50 calves up to now.

The Milco (Pvt.) Limited which is the only State owned milk processing organization has four factories located in Colombo, Digana, Ambewela and Polonnaruwa. It collects 55 million litres out of the total 125 million litres of milk collected by major processors through 76 collecting centres established in the country. The major processed products that are manufactured are milk powder, sterilized and pasteurized milk, yoghurt, ice cream, condensed milk and cheese.

Milco has produced 4,178 metric tons of milk powder, 13.7 million litres of liquid milk, 100,992 kilograms of condensed milk, 2.8 million litres of ice cream, 0.6 million litres of curd, 33,536 kilograms of cheese and 3.9 million litres of milk utilized for making yoghurt in 2009. Milco also has 2,216 Farmer Managed Societies - FMS - spread throughout the island with a membership of 49,498. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) Sir, I will wind up in two minutes. Sir, I am happy to inform you that Milco has increased its purchasing price of liquid milk by 10 per cent per litre with effect from 22nd June this year. I also wish to state that the price of any of the milk products marketed by Milco will not be increased as a result of increase of the purchasing price of milk. Under my guidance, the NLDB has initiated arrangements to produce and launch a fresh milk tetra pack named, DELITE in the very near future at a competitive price. The shelf life of this tetra pack will be six months without affecting the quality or the freshness of the milk. At the same time, Milco (Pvt.) Limited is making arrangements to market UHT processed liquid milk in 180 and 400 millilitre nutritional packs with 30-45 day shelf life, especially for school going children.

Sir, there are two more institutions that come under the purview of my Ministry. They are, the Sri Lanka-Libya Agricultural and Livestock Development Company Limited and the Mahaweli Livestock Enterprises Company. The Sri Lanka-Libya Agricultural and Livestock Development Company Limited which was primarily started for tea export to Libya had later diversified into poultry and egg production. At the same time, the Mahaweli Livestock Enterprises Company which is situated at Tambuttegama in Anuradhapura District mainly caters to produce day-old broiler chicks to the industry.

Mr. Presiding Member, what I highlighted in Sinhala was that we are in a day and age where sustainable development is the cornerstone of progress and future prosperity of our nation. Sustainable development means, "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". We will strive to make this country a sustainable Sri Lanka to bring about economic prosperity, giving the required leadership set out in the "Mahinda Chintana - Idiri Dekma" to achieve that goal.

Sir, we see countries trying to point a finger at us without realizing that they should not throw stones from glass houses. Human rights have been used by certain quarters falsely to batter us under the influence of the remnants of the vanquished LTTE. However, most western nations, which consider themselves champions of human rights, have exploited natural resources without having concern for the present or the future, which is totally detrimental to the well-being of the global community.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Deputy Minister, you have another minute.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The so-called champions of human rights have failed to give their citizens a clean and healthy environment, which could cause disaster for themselves and the globe at large. It is not a time and age where one should shed crocodile tears alleging violation of human rights by others, but take stock of the damage committed by themselves and their co-partners, violating the basic human right the people have, to a clean and healthy environment.

Sir, we are in a day and age where we should live in sustainable cities. Kandy, which is a sacred city, is unfortunately one of the most polluted cities in our country. With the strength and encouragement of my Minister, we will strive to make Kandy a role model of a sustainable green city.

, .

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, please give me just half-a-minute more.

The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale raised a question with regard to the gem industry. We propose to make this country a hub of the gem industry and also to restructure the whole industry. As 75 per cent of our earnings now come from the diamond industry, my Minister makes a broad-based proposal, with which we would make Sri Lanka, a hub of the jewellery industry.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay, that is very good.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Then, I would like to thank the Hon. Minister, the Secretary and all other officials for taking this Ministry forward.

Thank you.

( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Sir, is this the last speech?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Thank you, Sir. Just for the record I want to assure my good Friend in the Opposition, a young Member of Parliament, that despite your interpretation of my body language, I am quite happy with the portfolio that I have got. It is a very big charge. It is a large charge. It has 14 institutions under it. I can assure you that I will not disappoint you and ensure that the delivery is there to your expectations as well. Sir, I have only five minutes. So, I want your permission to - [Interruption.] Sir, how many minutes have I got?

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have got eight minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Can I seek your permission to table the text of my speech? I really want to use the time allotted to me to reply to some of the observations made by our Friends in the Opposition. The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka as well as the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale made a very important observation in respect of re-planting. I fully agree with you. Re-planting is absolutely essential not only in tea but also in rubber and coconut as well. But, more seriously, it is important with regard to tea. Really,

1085 1086

[ ]

2010 08

the tea bushes are very old and re-planting has to be given priority. At the moment, re-planting is about 0.5 per cent and is below the required percentage which is 3 per cent. We are working out a programme with the Treasury to see whether we can give some form of concessionary loans to the big RPCs as well as go for a subsidy scheme with the smallholders. We cannot expect the smallholders to take loans and go for re-planting. If we are going to really and successfully embark on the re-planting strategy, we also have to ensure that until such time the tea bush can be made use of - once re-planting takes place - some alternative income earning avenues are also given to the smallholders, so that for the period that they have to wait, there is some income coming to them. So, we are working with various bilateral as well as multilateral agencies to see whether we can get some assistance for smallholders because smallholders are extremely important. They produce 75 per cent of the tea. The RPCs produce only minority of the tea production. So, I want to assure both these Hon. Members, that we will be giving this top priority and at the same time, we also want to give top priority to infilling. Infilling is also very much below the targeted percentage. So, we want to ensure that infilling also takes place.

Certainly, factory modernization is very important. I want to say in this House that during the last three years, we got about Rupees three billion. That is about US Dollars 30 million from ADB and JICA. Out of the 101 factories that are there, 75 factories were modernized and ISO standards in these factories have also been reached. The HACCP standard has been reached but we want to go in for a third phase so that more factories can be caught in the net. The Sri Lanka Tea Board is working out a programme to see how we can put in place what is needed to modernize these factories and meet the ISO standards, which can be a huge successful marketing tool to market Ceylon tea products overseas. So, this is something that we are in the process of doing. I have taken a policy decision that we go in immediately for factory modernization, especially the 12 factories of the Tea Shakthi Fund, two of these factories in Kalubovitiyana and Derangala and the TRI factory at St. Coombs. Other safety standards are to be brought into those factories so that we can reach the ISO standards, and then use the factories as a demonstration model to the private sector so that they also can be benefited by investing money in factory modernization and reaching the ISO standards. There is definitely a return for the investment that they may make in reaching those standards.

Then, Sir, I must say a word about the coconut wilt disease. As you know, the Galle District, - it is your district, Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka - the Matara District and the Hambantota District have been affected by the wilt. We are in the process of identifying the number of trees that have been affected. I am not going to speculate in this House to say, This is how much we think the wilt has affected in terms of the number of

trees. We are in the process of going from tree to tree in those three districts by employing quite a large number of officers who visit these villages and identify the affected trees. By the end of this month, we would have the statistics. So, we will have a database to work on. At the same time, there would be a questionnaire where the affected people will be asked as to what kind of other income-generating activity they would like to get into.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What about the Puttalam District? Is it free of the disease?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Fortunately, I am assured by the Coconut Research Institute - that is a good question - that the Coconut Triangle has still not been affected. We are putting in place containment strategies to ensure, for example, that nurseries are prohibited in these areas.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Coconut Research Institute is also in the Puttalam District.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes, that is another challenge we have. This is why it is important that we go in for a permanent solution.

Containment is taking place, as we speak at the moment. But, the Coconut Research Institute has told them in writing that the only permanent solution is to get rid of these trees. Whilst we are in the process of implementing that policy decision, we also want to ensure that the people who are affected are not abandoned because it is not out of their fault, the wilt has affected the coconut trees. Some of them live on income derived from those trees. So, once again, as I said earlier, the questionnaire will identify the various cash crops that they might prefer to go into.

The TSHDA is giving them assistance to grow tea in certain areas. The Rubber Development Department is assisting them to grow rubber in certain areas and of course, cash crops and in livestock also. This is something that we immediately go in with. After that, hopefully we will be able to introduce the wilt-resistant clone that has now been found in India. The Chairman of the Coconut Research Institute will be visiting India with a delegation shortly. If we can get that clone, hopefully we will be able to grow coconut once again, but notwithstanding what we have to do in the South, we are

1087 1088

in the process of going in for an accelerated coconut cultivation programme in the North. We have identified areas of one hundred thousand acres to grow coconut. We are now in the process of establishing the nurseries. We have situated ourselves in those very areas and we are working through the GAs and the AGAs to identify the resettled people so that they can be assisted in getting into coconut cultivation. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is working very closely with us and this is something that I want to place on record. I want to also place on record that we are looking at increasing the oil palm cultivation to five thousand hectares.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your speech must come to an end.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes, that is why I asked your permission. I will table* my speech now. Thank you very much, Sir.

... ( )

( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman, on the 2nd of July, 2010, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, abusing his privileges as a Member of Parliament, unleashed a vituperative attack on the higher judiciary of the country and any right-thinking citizen of the country, taking an objective view of the manner in which the attack was made, would not fail to see that his intentions are dangerously sinister and it is clearly an attempt to send out a message of intimidation to the judges.

In this sense, he is most certainly following the infamous tradition set in motion by his partys predecessors, who chose to stone the houses of the Judges of the Supreme Court, who ordered the police to prevent the Supreme Court Judges from entering their Chamber, who treated the rule of law so callously that the well-pronounced judgments on violation of fundamental rights

of citizens were thrown into the dustbin and the violators were given promotions for their wrongdoings.

He speaks about the importance of preserving the Rule of Law. The cardinal principle of the preservation of the Rule of Law in any democracy is that there should be unreserved respect and regard for separation of powers, the very essence of the constitutionalism of our country. The very Member who shed crocodile tears over the need to protect the rule of law, violated it so unreservedly, when he chose the course of attacking the Judiciary without following the proper Parliamentary Procedures. These Procedures are laid down so firmly because the Constitutional lawmakers are mindful of the need to preserve the true spirit embodied in the separation of powers in the governance. The legislator cannot overstep its turf disregarding these principles and that is the very reason why there are special procedures laid down to impeach errant judges. To criticize judges without following the proper procedure is a very dangerous trend and this will most certainly be a contributory factor in eroding the confidence of the public on the Judiciary. This is what the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is so keen to witness happening.

In order to cast a reflection on a member of the Judiciary, there is, under our law, a system, a special procedure to be followed. The conduct and actions of a judge maybe criticized or reflected upon only by a specific and distinct substantive motion naming the judge and stating the charge or complaint against him. Any member who moves such a motion should substantiate it with evidence. This has been the accepted practice of the Parliamentary traditions throughout the world since time immemorial. This is what the Parliamentary culture around the world should follow. The object of this rule is not to protect malicious or dishonest judges, but to protect the public from the danger to which the administration of justice would be exposed if persons therein were readily subject to inquiring for malice or misconduct.

It is essential that judges should be permitted to administer law not only independently and freely and without favour, but also without fear of attack upon them or their decisions, which in the nature of the system must inevitably incur the displeasure of one person or another.

If this were not the rule, attacks upon and calumnious accusations against judges would clear the way for subversions of the independence of the Judiciary and great mischief and insecurity in the administration of justice.

It is unfortunate that the Hon. Members statement has attempted to tarnish the image of Sri Lanka and further undermines the independence of the Judiciary. His singular references directed at the higher echelons of the judiciary tantamount, both as a matter of contempt to the said members and as an intimidatory act, directed at the members of the Judiciary. This is a deplorable conduct by the said Member of Parliament and we, as a

1139 1140

Government who have always stood for the independence of the Judiciary, condemn this intrusion to the annuls of the Judiciary.

The recent developments from the forces working against the national interests of Sri Lanka, emanating from in and outside Sri Lanka ,clearly shows the efforts made to undermine Sri Lankas image and its democratic profile. The Hon. Members statement clearly indicates his intention to be supportive of these forces working against the interests of Sri Lanka and convey to the international fora, a distorted version of Sri Lanka's Judicial system and that of the democratic environment prevalent in Sri Lanka.

It is well-known that in Sri Lanka the judiciary is fiercely independent and it has always safeguarded and upheld the Constitutional framework and the Rule of Law thus protecting the rights of the people.

The democratic value of Sri Lanka that prevailed has been endorsed by the people at successive elections and His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has received an overwhelming majority at the last two elections. The leadership of the President has been able to achieve these successes whilst defeating terrorism in Sri Lanka, which has prevailed over three decades and bring in about normalcy and security to her people.

I only regret to mention that the attempts made by the Hon. Member of Parliament to tarnish the image of Sri Lanka, will amount once again to giving a lifeline to the separatist forces still active, and are now trying to resurface within and outside Sri Lanka.

Thank you. [.. 7.36] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , - - .

Sir, there is one other matter that I need to mention. There have been some unfair comments made against "Sirasa" channel, which I think, need to be corrected. You know how fiercely independent they are. At this particular moment, sometimes the Government Members are more reflected on Sirasa than the Opposition Members. So, I thought it is my duty to state this before the House. This is a channel that is showing both sides. - [Interruption.] In this House there have been many comments made. - [Interruption.] You did not, not you. The cap can fit anybody who made the comments. So, I thought it is my duty to state that because "Sirasa" has helped us, your Members as well as myself and my party, a lot.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, is this subject coming under the purview of the Motion that is before the House? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, it is. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Why can you not take it up on another occasion?

1181 1182

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This will come on that channel as well. So, it is relevant on that basis.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I see! Is it a warning?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, it is not. It is just a reflection on a question that you posed to me. So, I thought as a mark of gratitude this needs to be corrected and also, if there has been a wrong play, it also needs to be corrected. I appreciate the fiercely independent stand being taken by "Sirasa" and I hope "Rupavahini" also will take the same stand because we never come on "Rupavahini" except for being maligned and character assassinated.
