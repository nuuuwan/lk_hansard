[. . 10.25] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, the Budget, which was presented on the 29th, the first since the defeat of the LTTE in May last year, could well have been the most important Budget presented in Sri Lanka. In recent times, this Budget could well have heralded a new era of peace and economic prosperity for this country. However, instead we were presented with an IMF-approved wish list without any reference whatsoever to the practical day-to-day nightmares our people are facing today. The unhappy task of presenting this unhappy Budget - I think already the Government has admitted that it is not really a Budget - was entrusted to my good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, a very capable and experienced politician, whom the Government thought was unfit even to hold a Cabinet Ministership. But, however, even at the last minute, perhaps knowing well the unpopularity of this Budget, he was entrusted, as I said, with the unhappy task of presenting this wish list.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

.

As I mentioned in my speech at the last Emergency Debate, Sir, the end of the long drawn-out war gave us an unprecedented opportunity to win peace and give our

645 646

2010 02

long-suffering people a prosperous and peaceful future they really and truly deserve. The peace dividends could have been utilized to strengthen the economic well-being of all our people and our democratic institutions, in turn, would have harnessed international goodwill, co-operation and investment needed to kick start the long overdue economic take-off.

As I asked this very House at the last occasion - we have a choice before us - are we going to take the route to Utopia or are we going to destroy ourselves in an autocratic dystopia? The choice before us, Sir, is democracy and economic prosperity or autocratic suppression and economic ruin. Unfortunately, it is extremely clear now that the Rajapaksa regime has made its choice. Instead of wanting to pass on the peace dividends for the benefit of the people, the Government is now hell-bent on exploiting the war victory to further entrench themselves in power. The irrelevant and dangerously anti-democratic constitutional reforms, secretly and hurriedly being drawn up, we hear, proves beyond any reasonable doubt, the true autocratic motives of the Rajapaksa administration. During the run-up to the final defeat of the LTTE, the Government used the weariness of a nation battered and bruised by a brutal war for nearly 26 years impatient to see an end to the scourge of terrorism to disregard its fundamental democratic obligation. The odious and murderous nature of LTTE terrorism was used as a basis or pretext not only to disregard the Government's international obligations, but also to silence and control democratic dissent within the country.

Sir, this Government, in its obsession to perpetuate a dynasty, is now systematically dismantling the rule of law, which came under severe strain during this period. Exploiting the general feeling of goodwill towards the regime for finally defeating the LTTE and utilizing the ill-gotten near two-thirds majority at the recent elections, the Government is now hastily preparing to perform the last rites on democracy in our country, in Sri Lanka, just the way Hitler did in Germany after the infamous Election of 12th November, 1933 when he formalized his dictatorship with the overwhelming majority he had in Reichstag.

Mr. Speaker, as the Council of the International Bar Association stated in a resolution in September 2005, that "The rule of law is the foundation of a civilized society". If I may quote President Barack Obama, who stated in a BBC interview last year, that "The rule of law and democracy are not simply principles of the West to be foisted on other countries". He stressed that these are, "but universal principles that each country could embrace and affirm as part of their national identity. In fact, the new British Prime Minister, David Cameron, as well in a speech made at the Foreign Policy Centre two years ago stated,, "The simple, yet profound expression - freedom under the rule of law explains everything one needs to know about a country; its institutions, its culture and even its economy. And, the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore recently said in a speech, "The rule of law is

especially important as an influence on economic development in developing and emerging markets".

It is in this context, Sir, that the importance of the rule of law must be analysed and understood. I would like to remind those influential sections of the Government, especially those super secretaries of the defence and finance sectors - Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, I am just talking about some of the super secretaries in the finance and the defence sectors - I believe, are the key architects of the new order and I know personally because I was also a friend of theirs at one time, they firmly believe that an autocratic form of governance is the recipe for economic development. Some of them actually believed that a dictatorship is needed in this country to take it out of this situation. But, I would like to point out that no country has ever achieved economic prosperity because you are the person who has been entrusted with the task of developing the economy. In fact, although, I have certain problems with your policies, with all due respect to you, Mr. Speaker, he is the most capable man of that family. So, I wish you well. But, please, you have to do it within the boundaries of democracy, because as I was about to say, no country has ever achieved economic prosperity for the people by suppressing the rule of law. All those who tried to do so have only brought economic ruin to their people. Just look at the examples in countries like Zimbabwe, Myanmar or look at a country like North Korea. You are trying to go in that direction. But, I hope, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, that you have the courage of your convictions to steer this country towards democracy while achieving economic progress.

In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Declaration on the Rule of Law made by the International Commission of Jurists in Athens in 1955, a long time ago, emphasized that the State is subject to the law and declared that judges should be guided by the Rule of Law, protect it and enforce it without fear or favour and resist any encroachments by Government or political parties in their independence as judges. In fact, the most serious assault against the rule of law today in Sri Lanka, is the encroachment of the judiciary

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

in the most unscrupulous manner. This is where the most dangerous assault on the rule of law at the moment is taking place. I must admit that the lower levels of the judiciary, the judges and the magistrates in the outstations and in the lower courts are putting up a very brave, valiant and courageous front to preserve their independence. But, many judges from the higher echelons of the judiciary - I will not name them at the moment - have compromised their independence and integrity in the most shocking manner. Plump positions for spouses - some judges' husands have been given plump positions in the State sector. Then, we know certain children -

647 648

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Will you please hurry up and raise your point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) First, I must take my seat. The point of Order is, the Hon. Member should know better than others, even last evening, Sir, this matter was referred to in this manner. It is very clear under Standing Order No. 78. He is referring to the conduct of the judges and he goes on to say that the judges influenced the Executive - [Interruption.] Wait, wait, I have not finished. [Interruption.] No use of names. [Interruption.] to get their spouses appointed. [Interruption.] Sir, that is, direct reference to the judicial officers. He is stating that they have [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] He cannot refer to them according to Standing Order No. 78. He should know that. He must withdraw that.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , . . . . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Judges . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, please ensure that the two minutes that was lost is taken from the time allotted to the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Yes, thank you. , . . , 1989

. . [ ] . , .

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . [ ] , . . , [ ] The promise of promotions including the promise of promotion to the Supreme Court is being made. We know certain judges are being tempted with the prospect of being appointed Chief Justice and are used as bait and some are being tempted with diplomatic postings after retirement. This is how the rule of law has been assaulted and is being undermined by the Government at the moment.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

and lawyers who appear against the interests of the Government are threatened and labelled as terrorists by the Ministry of Defence.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) In fact, the Ministry of Defence seems to be gradually replacing the Judiciary by being the judge and the executioner. As I said, the Ministry of Defence is replacing the Judiciary of Sri Lanka today. The judge is also at the Ministry of Defence and the Executioner is also at the Ministry of Defence because we saw the Chief Financial Officer of the Ministry of Defence going on BBC and saying that General Sarath Fonseka should be hanged. The judge and the Executioner.[Interruption.] Mr. Speaker - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the business of the House should be conducted according to laid down procedures. That is the Standing Orders. That is very clear. I also brought Standing Order No. 78 to your notice, Sir, He is saying that the

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] This cannot be allowed.

649 650

2010 02

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . "Judges are summoned by the Executive" .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, despite being a Rajapaksa, I trust your ability to be independent. So, I will leave it to you. I was just saying [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are a [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

of the Matara masses. You cannot do that. [Interruption.] Sir, he cannot do so. You are the -[Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , point of Order -- , . . -"Judges are summoned by the Executive" . , . . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I anticipated that the [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] [Interruption.] In fact, the archaic Standing Orders [Interruption.] Okay, I agree. There are certain Standing Orders which prevent us from talking about these very important areas. In my notes itself, I had anticipated what you were going to say. I am just saying, the archaic Standing Orders of this Parliament prevent me from placing before you precise details of the manner in which some judges are compromising the independence of their profession. We have the precise details; we know the names; we know how they have been compromised; we know how they have been threatened and we know how some of them have been bribed with.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is so insolent to the judges and the courts. We cannot allow him to go on. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

But, because the Standing Orders do not allow us and because of the situation of the judiciary is so critical, this warrants the urgent attention of this House and I urge, especially my Colleagues in the Opposition, to seriously consider an Impeachment Motion against some of these errant judges so that Members could be in a position to place before this House, exact details of certain judges who have compromised their independence. Let us bring an Impeachment Motion against them and then show them and speak to them with facts and details. Of course, the chances of succeeding such an Impeachment Motion is rather remote, but it would be very important as a means of opening a national debate. A Select Committee - I believe, this has already been proposed by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - to review the impartiality of the judiciary must also be considered immediately since this is a matter of national priority.

For the first time in our history, the assault on the rule of law is almost complete with the Attorney Generals Department, which has been brought under the President for the first time ever, and while police has become so politicized that even police promotions are handled personally by the Defence Secretary where seniority, integrity and experience are overlooked in favour of blind loyalty to the Rajapaksa regime.

The Governments thinking was amply exposed when the President, immediately after the last Presidential Election said, - [Interruption.] You jump up. I am talking about it. You can jump up. - Everyone is subject to the law, other than the President. Sir, I am quoting His Excellency the President from his Address to the Nation the day after the last Presidential Election was won. What did he say? He said, Everyone is subject to the law, other than the President. So, this obviously is the real thinking of the Government. It proves beyond doubt what I am saying.

As you know, in a democracy, one can never be so high that you are above the law, even if you have delusions of being a God-King. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) This is the Constitution which is - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No. You have taken enough and more time. - [Interruption.]

651 652

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) As Thomas Paine, one of the founding fathers of the US wrote way back in 1776, I quote:

For as in absolute governments the king is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king and there ought to be no other.

The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, the law must be king, and there ought to be no other.

Today, what is happening in Sri Lanka? The rule of law is only applied to those who are perceived as enemies of the ruling family while a select group of family and friends are clearly above the law. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are so jealous.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) From flouting traffic laws to killing, imprisoning and threatening journalists and other such acts are carried out with absolute impunity. -[Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What about Richard de zoysa?

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

This culture of impunity and the rape of the rule of law will be total and complete if the Government is allowed to carry out the proposed Constitutional amendments giving the Executive the ultimate power of appointing the Constitutional Council. Any semblance of independence these Commissions may have, will be stifled and the police, the judiciary and the Elections Commission will become mere extensions of the Executive dropping any pretences to impartiality they may still have.

Mr. Speaker, some people say that nationalism is the last resort of all scoundrels. I think it was the late Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru was who first said that. But, today it seems to be that nationalism is the last resort of all budding dictators as well. Like Mugabe, resorting to anti-imperialist rhetoric to justify to his people the consequences of his dictatorial rule, this

regime is also very good at playing to the gallery by portraying every criticism of the Government as an infringement of national sovereignty. Instead of meeting various allegations made against the country in a rational and a mature manner, through proper diplomatic channels, the Government has managed to earn the contempt of all right-thinking people due to the crude and brutish manner of a village thug.

. .

But, they all tried to solve each problem as if they were in the Beliatta Junction, which cannot be done. This is how the Government resorts to in dealing with the international community. The Government has, according to newspapers, Sir, responded to the possibility of losing the GSP Plus concession in its usual shrill and hysterical manner. The Government and its kept media in a fret of what would one call "nationalistic fervour", are shouting that "they will not allow the sovereignty of the country to be compromised for150 million dollars. " - [Interruption.] Thank you, Hon. Azwer. - [Interruption.] The statement attributed to the highest in the land displays the total ignorance of the economic fall-out of losing the GSP Plus concession and the duplicitous nature of the Government invade in to portray the demands of the EU as a threat to our sovereignty.

Lets us now see, Sir, what we stand to lose if this concession is withdrawn. Let us look at it objectively. As you know, given Sri Lankas high dependence on trade with a trade GDP ratio of 54 per cent and the relatively small size of our domestic market of 20 million people, export markets like the EU has been vital for our economic sustainability. The EU as you know, is Sri Lankas largest trading partner and currently we export goods and services worth over US Dollars three billion which is actually 37 per cent of Sri Lankas total exports to the EU.

The GSP Plus scheme has helped boost exports to the EU by enabling local manufacturers to remain competitive despite an increasingly competitive global environment. As a result of this comparative advantage, Mr. Speaker, exports to the EU increased from US Dollars 1.8 billion in 2004 to US Dollars 2.9 billion in 2009. The withdrawal of the GSP Plus concession, Mr. Speaker will have serious ripple effects on the economy and in addition to the loss of revenue, it would lead to job losses with the possibility of foreign investments being pulled out and factories being closed down. In fact, the garment sector which contributes 8 per cent to GDP and accounts for 40 per cent of total industrial production and 40 per cent to total export earnings will be the worst hit. The garment sector provides 280,000 direct employments and generates nearly one million indirect employment opportunities. More than 5,000 jobs also in the ceramics industry, will be affected which has benefited from this concession.

653 654

2010 02

According to the Department of Commerce, one of the strongest beneficiaries of GSP Plus has been the fisheries sector, while new industries such as bicycle exports have also benefited. Sir, during the first year of the GSP Plus concession in 2005, the plastics-rubber industry grew by 13 per cent. The first year of the operation of the GSP Plus, the plastic-rubber industry grew by 13 per cent. For the same period 2005 to 2006, processed food exports grew by 13 per cent, machinery and mechanical appliance grew by 29 per cent and transport equipment grew by 26 per cent. This shows what a boon it was to our country, to our economy and to our people. Yet, the callous and irresponsible disregard of the Government to the economic implications of the withdrawal of the GSP Plus concession and to the plight of thousands of workers who will be left without a livelihood as a result is a clear indication of the power craze or megalomania of the regime which is willing to sacrifice the economic well-being of the country to entrench themselves further in power by its systematic strangulation of the rule of law and the rules of good governance. In other words, The unacceptable demands infringing on Sri Lankas sovereignty, as the Government says, which the Government has rejected in a hysterical rage are demands that require them to uphold the rule of law and ensure good governance for the benefit of all Sri Lankan citizens. I repeat, Mr. Speaker, all these conditions which the EU has put forward are for the benefit of all Sri Lankans living in Sri Lanka. These are not for the benefit of any other country. These are for the benefit of the Sinhalese people living in Sri Lanka, for the benefit of the Tamil people living in Sri Lanka, for the benefit of the Muslims, the Malays and the Burghers living in Sri Lanka. In short, all these are conditions put forward for the benefit of all Sri Lankans in Sri Lanka. In fact, the Government can easily address almost all the shortcomings pointed out by the EU by the implementation of provisions already in our Constitution such as the Seventeenth Amendment. But, at the moment, as you know, the Government is secretly drawing up plans to completely withdraw this Amendment in the third week of July. However, Mr. Speaker, the Seventeenth Amendment was passed in September, 2001 in this very House by a full House minus one. It was the very first time in the history of this Parliament, other than, I believe, the Hon. Champika Ranawaka's party, all parties, the Peoples Alliance at that time, the United National Party, the JVP and the TNA voted for a Bill. So, how an Amendment which has been brought forward to strengthen the independence of our judiciary, the independence of our police, the independence of our electoral system can be a threat to national sovereignty is something very confusing indeed. I would like to hear, perhaps from one of the senior Members of the Government why they consider the Seventeenth Amendment a threat to the sovereignty of this country.

The other conditions which the Government is objecting to now are ones which the Government of Sri Lanka agreed to implement as a condition for receiving this much-coveted concession. Discussions to get the GSP Plus concession which has been granted to only 16 countries in the world so far, were initiated by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe in 2003 and finally the Agreement was signed by the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government on 27th of June 2005, in which the present President was the Prime Minister. He approved this in the Cabinet. He agreed with the conditions of the EU. But, now he is turning around and telling the country, It is an infringement on the sovereignty.

In fact, one of the key areas in this Agreement is the effective implementation of the ICCPR, the CAT and the CRC. In fact, at that time the Government of Sri Lanka told the EU in order to receive that that we have implemented all 16 human and labour rights conventions by that time. It was based on the assurance given by the Government at that time, this concession was given and which paved the way. Thanks to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and thanks to the then President Kumaratunga, thousands and thousands of young people in this country got a job opportunity in the new industries which sprang up as a result.

Mr. Speaker, the ICCPR, what exactly is it? The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a multilateral treaty committing its parties to respect the civil and political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights, and rights to due process and fair trial. How could these conditions be an infringement on the sovereignty of this country, I would like to ask this House? In fact, as of 2009 there were 165 parties who had signed this Convention. Many countries including the United States, Israel, which is a country constantly at war, more or less, as well as countries like Bangladesh and Maldives in our region have ratified and made it into domestic law but with certain reservations. Certain reservations were pointed out by the US for example, by Israel for example when ratifying this Convention but with those reservations they have implemented that Law. The other two Conventions we have agreed to ratify and implement through domestic law were the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment - CAT Act - and the Convention on the Rights of the Child - CRC. The CAT Act aims to prevent torture around the world and it requires State parties to take effective measures to prevent torture within their borders. As of January 2010, 146 countries are parties to this Treaty and the CRC - Convention on the Rights of the Child - is a Treaty setting out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of children, and as of November 2009, Mr. Speaker, 194 countries have ratified the CRC.

655 656

So, actually, I am very confused. Maybe the Government, some responsible Member, perhaps even the former Prime Minister can enlighten us on how these conditions, how these Covenants and Conventions can be called a threat to our sovereignty? How can the giving of rights to children and people be a threat to our sovereignty?

. - [ Interruption.] You can certainly reply during your speech, Hon. Nanayakkara. I have very limited amount time. You are a very senior politician, but I would rather prefer if the answer came from a responsible Minister of the Government. You are just a backbencher. Like the Hon. Azwer after many years, you are still there. Let us hear from the horses mouth itself. I mean, yours is a second-hand answer. I know that you are a very liberal-minded man and I am sure you will give a very liberal twist to it but to what happens finally even you have no control. We know that you are opposed to these Constitutional reforms. I hope you win the day, but I very much doubt it. But, you can answer these questions later.

In fact, many of the shortcomings which are incongruous with the original Agreement as pointed out by the EU Report are based on the current Emergency Laws in Sri Lanka despite the end of hostilities. These can be easily addressed through either revoking the Emergency Laws or amending the Emergency legislation to better reflect the current security climate to realign it with our human rights obligations to our people.

Mr. Speaker, the Report was issued by the EU on the 19th of October, 2009 on the basis of the facts and information available, including relevant materials and information provided by the Government of Sri Lanka. In this Report, they actually say that they are basing their Report on information which was provided by the Government and according to that they have concluded that neither the ICCPR, the CAT, the CRC nor the legislation incorporating the obligations under these Conventions have been effectively implemented. Mr. Speaker, the Government today, I think has a duty by the country, specially to the thousands of people who will be left jobless as a result of the withdrawal of GSP Plus to explain in detail how the implementation of our obligations towards our own people and our children can constitute a threat to our national sovereignty. The Governments complex and utter lack of response will be a clear indication how much this regime is willing to sacrifice to achieve their autocratic objectives. Also, Mr. Speaker, even though you are pointing out and shouting about national sovereignty, about the United Nations trying to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka, I would like to remind this House, in this very House many years ago, it was Member of Parliament, Mahinda Rajapaksa who requested the foreign agencies to come to Sri Lanka and to interfere in its internal

affairs. In those heady days of the Premadasa regime, Hon. Azwer, it was Member of Parliament, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who said so. It is in Hansard. He said: " , , ." 1990 25 365 . : " , , , , , ,... " IMF , . .

If you want to develop the country, first you have to ensure that there is law and order and you have to put a stop to frauds and corruption in the country. There is a famous fraud in the country, the VAT fraud, amounting to Rs. 24 billion. What is the present situation? The main culprit is happily living outside the country in Dubai. He is running a couple of hotels and there are some people in remand. But, no action is being taken against the main culprit, and we are told that he funded the Government election campaign very lavishly. Also, especially when the Government MPs go to Dubai, they stay in these hotels, free of charge. So, if that is the attitude of the Government, there is no point in chasing the small fellows. Go and catch the main culprits and try to stop the frauds. Without stopping the frauds, there will not be development in this country and there will be no economic development without proper law and order.

What is the situation of KP? I am not going state in detail how he was captured because then, I would be divulging security issues. I will not do that. But, why is KP moving around freely and having a good time without being produced before the court or without legal action being taken against him? He is most probably going to end up as the Chief Minister of the Northern Province one of these days. He is addressing the Government Agents, he is summoning the Assistant Government Agents, but he was one of the top-most culprits of the last insurgency. He was the man who was running the funds for insurgency. Even now, he has bank accounts worth billions of dollars. Why the Government is trying to mollycoddle him is because the Government is eyeing for his money. They want to get friendly with him to take charge of his money. So, that is why he has become a favourite. But, small people, the ranaviruwas, are in the jail and KP is having a good honeymoon with the Government. That is the situation today. If you want to develop the country, develop the economy. Please, first

attend to the law and order situation. Without law and order, you will never develop the country. That is all.

Thank you, very much.

( () - , ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa - Deputy Minister of Water Supply and Drainage)

Hon. Deputy Speaker, at the outset let me thank the voters of the Hambantota District, especially those of the Mulkirigala Electorate, for having reposed confidence in me and electing me to Parliament.

I am privileged to speak on the First Budget of the Seventh Parliament. The war has ended and people are moving freely from North to South and vice versa. They have no fear in their minds. The country has returned to normalcy after 30 years. The entire country is under one umbrella now and there is no colour, creed, religious or provincial discrimination. All these were made possible by the excellent and bold leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and our brave forces, about 30,000 of whom sacrificed their lives. We owe our gratitude to them, and it is the duty of the Government and everyone of us to assist and work towards the welfare of their families.

Sir, the people of this country have utmost faith in His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and in the UPFA. This is evident from the landslide victories gained both at the Presidential Election in January, 2010 and at the General Election held in April, 2010. I wish to thank the people for returning the UPFA candidates with large majorities which show their faith and trust in His Excellencys wisdom and desire to protect the country, a united Sri Lanka. I am proud to say that His Excellency President Mahainda Rajapaksa is the only Leader who was brave enough to reunite a separated and divided country without passing on the burden to the next generation.

As you are aware, Sri Lanka witnessed both natural and man-made disasters. The tsunami tragedy made several hundreds homeless and took away the lives of thousands. Coastal areas, including Hambantota, were affected severely. Following this, the age-old conflict in the North and the East worsened with the loss of lives, property, wealth et cetera and made several homeless and internally displaced. But, the Government under the able and astute leadership of the President was able to withstand these challenges and strive for economic development while fighting the war. The policies and programmes envisioned in the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future, which is the brainchild of His Excellency the President has begun to transform our economy from a stagnant to an expanding and progressive one.

Sir, this Budget is a peoples Budget. This has not burdened the average citizen of this country. It encourages and supports the farmers with several

facilities to produce rice and other agricultural products. Consequent to the proper land use policy and the recovery of extra land, both from the North and South, cultivation during the on-coming Maha season will be augmented. I am confident that apart from paddy cultivation, the recovery in livestock and the fisheries sector, the growth in plantation, agriculture and industries will help our economy to grow immensely and the income levels of the farmers and agriculturists will increase substantially.

With the accelerated development launched in multiple sectors in Sri Lanka, the country had shown a steep growth related to economic development. The per capita income in Sri Lanka has registered a steady increase from 2005 onwards and at the end of 2009 had reached US Dollars 2,053. This is a remarkable achievement by the Government in spite of heavy war expenditure. We are graduating to a middle-income economy status.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, much was said about the recession in the global economy and its impact on Sri Lanka. The UPFA Government under the guidance of His Excellency was able to withstand such shocks, whereas giant companies and banks in the US and the West failed and collapsed. Our labour policies and labour standards protected not only the workers from being thrown out of employment, but also employers were able to sustain their industries.

The UPFA Government shunned the privatization policies of the previous regime and brought back the privatized institutions under the management of the Government thus ensuring that the peoples properties and assets were not plundered by a few. The UPFA Government brought together the private, public and corporate sectors. The policies of the Government are transparent and progressive. The Government does not resort to protectionism. Equal opportunities, be they social-life, education, employment, trade, business or other opportunities, are offered to everybody. We are reaching the common man not through empty words or promises, but through solid small, medium and mega development programmes of infrastructure such as development of roads, water supply and sanitation, construction of schools, hospitals, irrigation schemes, farming and milk production and port development.

The Government has embarked on the development of Moragahakanda, Uma Oya, Deduru Oya, Welioya and several other minor irrigation schemes to offer irrigation facilities to the farmers in agricultural areas. Budgetary provision has been made in my own Ministry for priority projects in water supply schemes in Hambantota, Batticaloa, Mutur and Polonnaruwa. This will ensure that 236 rural water supply schemes will be completed and the estimated rural population covered by the rural water schemes will be 318,000.

An analysis of the economic situation in the country has shown that the Government has achieved 6 per cent annual growth for the last five years. Unemployment has been brought down from 8.3 to 5 per cent in 2004. Inflation has stabilized at 5 per cent. Our international reserves have shown an increase from US Dollars 1.2 billion to US Dollars 6 billion providing stability to the exchange rate. Interest rates have been brought down. Poverty indicators have also drastically declined to around 15 per cent of the household population as compared to 23 per cent a few years ago. Export earnings have increased by 28.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2010.

The remittances from our migrant workers have increased. Tourist arrivals have increased. Sri Lanka will soon be a tourist paradise earning much-needed foreign exchange and providing employment to hundreds of youth all over the country. These show that the policies envisioned in the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the future" have paved the way for progress.

The youth are the future leaders of this country. Recognizing their importance, His Excellency has mobilized all government skills, education institutions under the newly created Ministry of Youth Affairs. These public institutions in partnership with the privately-managed Skills Education Centres, will supply the much needed multi-skills for a high performing economy. Our migrant workers will not be unskilled hereafter.

We will concentrate on providing necessary training facilities in all parts of the country so that they are geared to face challenges and obtain lucrative employment, both in Sri Lanka and abroad. Empowering youth is our main concern. Our manpower exports in future will increase our foreign exchange reserves.

All Government policies and programmes are translated into action by our Public servants. They are an important segment of the population. His Excellency the President took prompt action by raising the minimum salary of a Public servant from Rs. 7,900 to Rs. 11,730 from the first Budget itself. In addition, a cost of living allowance of Rs. 5,250 has been introduced. Concessionary housing loans, leave benefits, medical insurance and pension rights have been restored.

The newly created Ministry of Public Management Reforms headed by the former Prime Minister will render an efficient Public service. An effective social security system for our workforce will be introduced in the year 2011. There is much scope to expand and exploit the full potential of our tea, rubber and cinnamon industries. Prospects of the rubber industry have improved. Cinnamon exports have made good progress. Therefore, it has become necessary for the Government to encourage and provide support and technical assistance to both growers and exporters.

Children are our biggest asset. Realizing and strengthening this treasure, the Government is committed to provide free education to all. This Budget has focused attention on long-term goals targeting a series of child welfare measures and improving nutrition and supporting low-income families. The Government has allocated Rs. 7,363 million for the provision of free text books, nutritional food, school uniforms and subsidized transport and scholarships to three million children.

In terms of the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future" the Government has proposed not only to increase rice production but also to hold adequate buffer stocks to maintain price stability during off seasons. Since the return of peace, there has been much enthusiasm among the farmers to go back to the land. The Governments array of incentives and high prices, since the year 2005, is the main cause for this phenomenon.

The Government is very concerned about the young children of this country who will be the leaders of tomorrow. Milk is an important and essential nutrient food item for the young.

About US Dollars 300 million is spent in importing milk powder. The Government has initiated prompt strategies to increase milk production by getting small and medium-scale farmers as well as the large-scale private sector to participate. The newly created Livestock and Rural Community Development Ministry has taken quick action to reactivate the abandoned farms especially in the North and the East to ensure higher milk production.

The Government has embarked on heavy infrastructure development programmes such as the International Airport and the Port at Hambantota, the Southern Expressway, Matara-Kataragama Railway Line, the Colombo Port, the Ports at Kankesanthurai, Oluvil and Trincomalee.

Additionally, 20,000 kilometres of the rural road network has been rehabilitated under the Maga Naguma programme spending US Dollars 360 million. About 2,500 kilometres of rural roads have been concreted.

The Government has invested about US Dollars 2,500 million for the construction of four power plants at Norachcholai, Kerawalapitiya, upper Kotmale and Sampur.

The Government has initiated strategies to develop various development activities by the provincial councils and line Ministries. These regional institutions will initially target 10,000 lagging villages providing drinking water, access roads, electricity and quality housing. The North and the East are being developed through the Uthuru Wasanthaya and Nagenahira Udanaya programmes.

There have been several misreports in spite of the Governments bold efforts to resettle the internally displaced persons. So far, 250,000 persons have been resettled. Only about 25,000 persons remain displaced. I am happy to state that our neighbour India has been able to help us substantially in de-mining and with resettlement programmes.

With the opening of the A-9 Road, there is a steady movement of devotees visiting Nagadeepa which the Buddhists could not visit for almost 30 years. The Jaffna District is now bubbling with much economic activity.

I would like to mention a few benefits the Budget has provided such as income support of families benefiting under the Samurdhi Programme, support of nutritional improvements to around 74,000 expectant mothers, lactating mothers and infants, fertilizer subsidies, subsidized credit and the procurement of paddy at the guaranteed price, the supply of medicines and other pharmaceuticals to around 50 million of indoor and outdoor patients visiting the Government healthcare centres.

As you would agree, His Excellency the President has made history locally and abroad. He is the only President who could communicate with the Tamil people in their mother tongue. He spoke in Tamil at the UN General Assembly, which made the Tamil language known internationally. We are all very proud of him.

But, it is observed that external forces are active in depriving certain concessions such as the GSP Plus, which is said, will affect our garment industry. We support His Excellencys move to reject any condition imposed by the EU.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa, your time is over. (() ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa) Sir, give me two more minutes, please.

As a sovereign State, we cannot yield to economic pressures. We also support the Governments move to go ahead in finding new markets for our garments.

We also oppose the UNs determination to appoint an inquiry panel, be it investigative or advisory, and we extend our full support to His Excellency in rejecting the proposal.

Before I conclude, may I call upon all our citizens to unite together and join hands with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to usher in an era of peace, friendship, prosperity and a better future for us and for our children.

Thank you.

Thanking you for allowing me to speak, Sir, let me finally touch on one other important aspect because the Hon. Members of the TNA made a few remarks over and over again. It is very pertinent that they all get together and come out with a tangible plan or a proposal to develop this country. We are not expecting to develop the North and the East of this country alone. We know the problems all of us have faced. We have to learn from the past. Therefore, we urge the Representatives, the Hon. Members of Parliament, of the North and the East to come out with a plan or an alternate proposal, if we are not doing something right; without being critical or criticizing what we have proposed, to come out with their plan, which we can then discuss to make this country a better place.

Thank you very much. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , ! 25 .

He was quoting from the leaders of the United States of America, UK and Singapore. He stated their version of the rule of law and democracy and implied that we also must learn lessons from them.

I think I must tell you, Sir, that we are a country which has been nourished and nurtured by the prestige doctrine

of Lord Buddha - that is Buddhism - for about 2,500 years. Therefore, nobody, especially the Western countries, can teach us about the rule of law and democracy. You may be surprised to hear that we are the only country in the world which has fed the terrorists, fought the terrorists and treated them when they got injured. That is our rule of law and that is our democracy. I think about 26,000 people have died and we have apprehended about 12,000 terrorists at the last stages of the war, but we never killed them. We rehabilitated them, about 4,000 were released and we even went to the extent of giving them in marriage - about 53 couples. That is our rule of law and that is our democracy. Also 294,000 people were displaced in Vanni and 214,000 people were displaced in the East. As at present, about 85 per cent people have been resettled out of sheer compassion towards our tamil brethren and that is our rule of law and that is our democracy. Therefore, nobody, especially the Western countries, can teach us about the rule of law and democracy.

So, therefore, it is very unfortunate that Members of Parliament make statements of this nature knowing about our heritage and history of about 2,500 years. , 60,000 , . -- . 5 . . , . , . . . . . 2,700 4,000 . 48 . , ; ; . 30 . . . 35 . .

It states, I quote: Moscow has taken note of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moons decision to appoint a UN panel of experts to investigate war crimes during the period of the campaign against the Tamil Tigers. As follows from UN sources, this panel is not a fact finding or investigation mechanism, but is designed solely to advise him on accountability issues relating to alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.

"In doing so, the UN Secretary-General as chief administrative officer of the United Nations should apparently have asked the opinion of the Security Council or the General Assembly on this matter.

What also makes us cautious is the fact that this decision was taken without regard to the position of a sovereign state and a member of the UN - Sri Lanka. As is known, they in Sri Lanka have already begun their own investigation process at national level (the Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation with a mandate to review all aspects of the conflict).

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is encouraging and a coincidence that it is left to you to preside over the proceedings of the House when we discuss an Adjournment Motion which deals with an internationally important issue of this magnitude and we very much welcome that position because you have always held a firm stand safeguarding the self-respect of individuals and the nations. We are a self-respecting nation. Therefore, Sir, we would not like anybody else from anywhere in the world to come and interfere in our internal affairs.

The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moons unilateral decision to appoint a three-member panel to probe into Sri Lanka's internal conflicts amounts not only to interference but to gross intrusion vis--vis the terrible tragedies which have occurred in recent times or are still occurring in many parts of the world, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Gaza, Guantanamo, Gujarat, Bosnia, Palestine and other countries. No panel was, and is, deemed necessary to visit these devastated lands and check out on the horrible atrocities, which were and are, still being committed in those respective soils. Palestinians have been suffering for the last 60 years. No panel has gone there. All human rights were violated, left, right and centre. What is the UN doing? The UN has a firm Security Council Resolution 242. They are still not prepared to implement that.

Illogical as it seems, Sri Lanka has suddenly become, for some unknown reason, Mr. Ban Ki-moons sorrowful

821 822

scapegoat and that too for having wiped out terrorism which had tormented this paradise isle for 30 years.

Look at what His Excellency the President has said in his historic visit to Ukraine. I quote the "Daily Mirror" of 2nd July, 2010. It states: While claiming that an army of another country will not solve the internal problems of a country, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that to settle such problems support of the people of the country was essential. He said Sri Lanka would be a model for the entire world.

A model for the entire world! We can export the commodity called, How to end terrorism in the world?. So, in place of commendations which were rightly due to us, we see international interference and intrusion, which I can only describe, are in poor taste.

Sri Lanks boasts of a proud history of over 2,500 years wherein Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and also Muslims collectively lived in harmony and with self-respect in this self-righteous nation.

I must also state here, Sir, as to what prompted an international action of this sort. It is because of the Hon. Sarath Fonseka saying that we have committed this sin in the North, whereas we have finished the war on terrorists. If they have picked up, he is the source of information and we have every right to call him a traitor of this nation.

Sri Lanka aspires to be friendly with all nations interacting in commerce and co-existence, maintaining law and order, upholding the tenets of all great religions, downplaying the deadly menace of terrorism in all its forms which it has destroyed forever, building multiracial harmony amongst its citizenry and is now looking towards the horizon for tremendous economic development with a view to ascending to the next level proceeding along the "Mahinda Chintana Idiri Dekma". Let us teach this to the UN Secretary-General and all other people who wanted to interfere with our affairs. "No, no, we will never allow that", is what you yourself very vibrantly said in this House this morning, Mr. Presiding Member. It is a historic speech you made in this House, Sir, which will be remembered forever by the people of this country.

In the light of such an illuminating state of affairs, the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, strikes pale in arranging to dispatch the three stooges - he mentioned the names - which move, in itself, if not distasteful, is an attempt at displaying the hypocrisy of his motives. You can do a "ban choon", Ban Ki-moon, to which Sri Lanka will not bow down as a dignified nation. Mr. Ki-moon, - there is the moon; there is the sun; there is the sky and there are stars, all created by the Almighty God - who is he? Though the moon or the sun is greater to us, the God above will look into these injustices they are trying to

perpetrate on our Island, on our country. I wonder why Mr. Ki-moon is so seriously concerned about investigating the Sri Lankan Government, which annihilated the worlds most dangerous terrorist group in the 30-year old civil war, with a view to finding out about civilian casualties and attempting to bring war crime charges against it, instead of showering encomiums on it and extending colossal aid for future economic development, notwithstanding awarding to its well-deserved President the Nobel Peace Prize. I would say, blatant Western hypocrisy presently prevails at its disgraceful peak. Not only Russia, but also China has expressed the same concern. "UN should not interfere." Who says? The Japanese Envoy Yasushi Akashi as reported in the Daily News of 21st June, 2010.

We do not want this hegemony of great nations; we are a friendly nation. We will talk to any nation from the West, the East, the Centre, the Middle East or from the Far East, but on equal terms.

Thank you.

Sir, I would like to present the statement prepared by the Ministry of External Affairs. It states, I quote:

STATEMENT ON THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SRI LANKA - PANEL OF EXPERTS BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS The Government of Sri Lanka strongly opposes the appointment, by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, of the Sri Lanka - Panel of Experts announced by his Spokesperson in New York on Tuesday, 22nd June 2010. Sri Lanka was ravaged by the scourge of terrorism for over 30 years. The people of Sri Lanka have, during this period, suffered violence and terror of unimaginable proportions, unleashed on them by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world. After a long and difficult struggle the Government of Sri Lanka has successfully rid the country of terror, and is in the process of rebuilding the lives of her people. As an important part of this process His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka has appointed a Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, a statutory regime available under Sri Lankan law.

The Government is confident that the Commission would make a most significant contribution to the further strengthening of national amity, through a process of restorative justice. Sri Lanka is a sovereign state with a robustly independent judiciary and a tried and tested system for the administration of justice. The Government of Sri Lanka has consistently promoted and protected human rights. Indeed, this has been explicitly acknowledged by legitimate organs of the United Nations system. The Human Rights Council of the United Nations has formally adopted, after the cessation of the conflict situation, a resolution commending, inter alia, the commitment of Sri Lanka to the promotion and protection of human rights. Sri Lanka regards the appointment of the Sri Lanka - Panel of Experts as an unwarranted and unnecessary interference with a sovereign nation. This interference, moreover, has potential for exploitation by vested interests hostile to the process of reconciliation taking place in Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka notes that the joint statement of the President of Sri Lanka and the Secretary-General issued at the conclusion of the Secretary-Generals visit to the country on 23rd May, 2009 makes no reference to allegations of violations of international humanitarian law committed during military operations between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation of Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Ministry of External Affairs Colombo 23rd June, 2010. .
