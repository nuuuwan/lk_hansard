... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote, for the information of the Hon. Members of the Opposition, Standing Order No. 78. It states, I quote:

The conduct of the President, or acting President, Members of Parliament, Judges or other persons engaged in the administration of

969 970

2010 17

justice shall not be raised except upon a substantive motion; and in any amendment, question to a Minister,

or remarks in a debate on a motion dealing with any other subject reference to the conduct of the persons aforesaid shall be out of order.

Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition today made a speech condemning the judgment - [Interruption.] I am on a point of Order. Let me continue. He condemned the verdict given by the General Court Martial against Mr. Sarath Fonseka, which held that Mr. Fonseka's decorations and medals be withdrawn and he be cashiered, and this was ratified by His Excellency the President. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You cannot condemn the action of His Excellency the President. The General Court Martial has given its verdict and the President has sanctionced it. That is one matter.

The other matter is, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition being a lawyer himself, today ridiculed the judges, ridiculed the judgment of a court. The General Court Martial is also established as a part of the judicature of this country. Therefore, Sir, every word -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I would appeal to you that every word uttered by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition be expunged. He referred to the judgment, referred to the President who sanctioned the withdrawal of the decorations - [Interruption.] Sir, I have not finished.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . [ ] . . [ ] . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Mr. Speaker, a point of Order was raised and I want to reply to that. 78. Conduct of the President .

Standing Order No. 78 states, I quote:

. acting President, Members of Parliament, judges or other persons engaged in the administration of justice.

Judicial officer 170 () .

Article 170 (a) of the Constitution states, I quote:

(a) a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of the Court of Appeal;

(b) any Judge of the High Court or any judge, presiding officer or member of any other Court of First Instance, tribunal or institution created and established for the administration of justice or for the adjudication of any labour or other dispute but does not include a person who performs arbitral functions or a public officer whose principal duty or duties is or are not the performance of functions of a judicial nature.

105 (1) . Article 105 (1) of the Constitution states, I quote :

Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the institutions for the administration of justice which protect, vindicate and enforce the rights of the People shall be-

(a) the Supreme Court

(b) the Court of Appeal..

(c) the High Court and such other Courts of First Instance, tribunals or such institutions as Parliament may from time to time ordain and establish.

One requirement is, the members have to be appointed for Courts of First Instance by the Judicial Service Commission other than the Judges of the High Court. Now, a Court Martial which has been held in earlier cases does not come within the ambit of a judicial institution or institution administering justice. Therefore, I did not discuss that issue.

. , . - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am sorry, the Deputy Chairman of Committees.The

971 972

Deputy Chairman of Committees did not suspend the House. He just went off. So, now there is a vacuum. There is a complete vacuum. There is a vacuum in this House. That is the issue. There is a complete vacuum. We cannot go ahead. - [Interruption.] We can only meet tomorrow. We cannot meet today. I must thank the Hon. Azwer for raising this issue. There is a vacuum. He raised it. Now, we cannot sit. We have to take this issue up tomorrow.

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, there are ways of raising protests in the House, but it must be done in accordance with the Constitution of the country and the Standing Orders of Parliament. I think it is entirely unsatisfactory for decisions of judicial tribunals to be attacked in this manner in the House. What had transpired in this Assembly this afternoon is a gross violation of the principles contained in the Constitution and the Standing Orders.

Sir, I would like, with great respect, to disagree with what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said. He referred to Judges. But, the Standing Orders are very clear. Standing Order No. 78 refers to, I quote:

.Judges or other persons engaged in the administration of justice.

Tribunals established by law very clearly come within the purview of this provision. Sir, if we look at the Constitution, Article 4 (c) deals with the judicial power and it states, I quote:

the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized, by the Constitution, or created and established by law,..

It states "courts, tribunals and institutions". So, it is not restricted to courts. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition cited the definition of courts, but the Standing Order is of far wider scope. Sir, I ask your indulgence to refer to the wording that is used in Standing Order No. 78. I would, with great respect, direct the attention of the Hon. Speaker to the words used in Standing Order No. 78. Standing Order No. 78 is not confined, in its application, to Judges of the Republic. It has a wider scope. It deliberately uses the phrase Judges or other persons engaged in the administration of justice.

Today, Sri Lanka has an Army Act, a Navy Act and an Air Force Act. Those are part and parcel of the Statute Laws of the Republic. - [Interruption.] We can say what we like; we can protest, but there is a way of protesting and the protest must not inflict irreparable damage on institutions administering justice in this country. Courts martial are also -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. With all due respect to the learned Hon. Minister on the other side, if he is a lecturer and if this is the way justice is lectured about by

981 982

2010 17

him, then I do not think there is any future for justice in this country. - [Interruption.] But, all we can ask is, is this relevant to the kangaroo courts as well? - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . 78 , "... ..." . . [ ]

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Sir, whichever side of the House we are on, we are all bound by the provisions of the Constitution and the Standing Orders. We are all bound by these instruments and the effect of these provisions is very clear. That is, the Army Act, the Navy Act and the Air Force Act were not enacted yesterday or the day before. They go back to 1948; this is legislation going back to almost British times. They have remained part and parcel of our law for more than half a century and these are institutions that have administered justice over the decades. They are protected by law. Otherwise, if they are to be attacked in this manner on the Floor of Parliament, how can they discharge their functions at all in the future? That is the important principle. These provisions are there for an overriding purpose of public policy. It is to ensure that people functioning in these tribunals, in courts martial, will be able to act without fear of irresponsible attacks on the Floor of Parliament. That is the rationale underpinning these provisions and it is a very sound and compelling rationale. What happened on the Floor of this House a few minutes ago, I assert without fear of contradiction, is a gross violation of the provisions contained in the Constitution and the Standing Orders. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition I think, is well aware that the protection conferred by Standing Order No. 78 is not restricted to Judges. It is much wider; it goes further. It states Judges or other persons engaged in the administration of justice.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, they themselves are calling him

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

So, what can I do?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Sir, all I am saying is that there are established procedures for criticizing judges and others administering justice. I am not saying that judges and those administering justice cannot be criticized. They can be criticized. But, there is a procedure to criticize them. The procedure is a Substantive Motion. If there has been a miscarriage of justice, as Hon. Members of the Opposition maintain, then there are remedies available. I am not saying that we must put up with injustice. If there has been a flagrant travesty of justice, then the law amply provides for remedies to deal with that situation. The remedy, in this case, is a Substantive Motion that is brought before Parliament. That is the established law and practice of this country. What happened in this House, with all respect, is absolutely inexcusable; it is unpardonable because, with impunity, we have departed from the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point or Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised. . ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs raised a legal issue based on the Standing Orders and the Constitution. He himself suggested to this House that in the event you want to challenge a decision or to make constructive criticism about a person who is engaged in the administration of justice, then there is a way of doing it. For that, the Hon. Minister himself suggested that there has to be a Substantive Motion.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) What I am saying is, that is the procedure; that is the procedure laid down by law. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) I concede that. My question is, does the Hon. Minister say that we can bring in a Motion against the Members of the Panel sitting under the Army Act? Are they considered as judges? If the Hon. Minister says that, if he sticks to that argument, then we can bring in a Motion tomorrow. Is it correct? Hon Minister, do you concede that we have a right to bring in a Motion against those persons? That is self-contradictory; this argument is debunked.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, Mr. Speaker, all that I said was this. At this moment, there is no Substantive Motion of any kind before the House. Nevertheless, there was an attack on the body in question: the Court Martial. If the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is correct, then Standing Order No. 78 would have stopped with the word "Judges"; it would not have gone on to use the next phrase. The next phrase must have some meaning.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) What about Labour Tribunals?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) It cannot be a set of words which adds nothing to the content of the Standing Order. Now, there are institutions administering justice in this country which do not come within the purview of judges. It is abundantly clear on the face of Standing Order No. 78, that those tribunals are also brought within the ambit of protection conferred by Standing Order No. 78, and there is a good and sufficient reason of policy why that has been done.

All I am saying is, let us respect the law. Let us not offend against the letter and spirit of the Constitution and the Standing Orders, because if that is done, one side may be in power today and other side may be in power tomorrow. But, if these instruments are violated - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) If one side is in power, you will be on that side.

985 986

2010 17

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) But, Mr. Speaker, if these instruments are violated with impunity, we are doing an irreparable damage to institutions, which we are all bound to protect, if we believe in public life in this country. The Standing Orders are there and we must respect the Standing Orders. The Standing Orders are very clear, Mr. Speaker. There is no doubt about this. This is crystal clear. The Court Martial comes within the ambit of Standing Order No. 78. It is not a matter which admits of any ambiguity at all. There is no shadow of doubt. The meaning is perfectly evident on the face of the Standing Order. It is very clear that the Court Martial is protected by Standing Order No. 78.

Consequently, the debate that took place on the Floor of this House is entirely contrary to Standing Order No. 78 and I respectfully ask you, Mr. Speaker, to expunge the whole of that from Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I am reading from the Army Act. What is a Court Martial? It deals with persons subject to military law, all officers and soldiers of the regular force and those in other categories serving in the Army. That is all. That is administration; just as much as the income tax officers administer the income tax law in the first instance. You can have appeals to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. That is the safeguard that is given here. What is meant here by "The persons engaged in the administration of justice" can be Presidents of Labour Tribunals. There are many such bodies. But, this is not recognized. There have been many court cases in Sri Lanka reported in the Sri Lankan Law Reports. None of them has said that these Courts Martial exercise the judicial power that is required to come into this. The Courts of First Instance is not merely referred to in Article 3 and 4. This Constitution came in after my honourable Friend and I, both left the Law Faculty, but certainly, as far as this is concerned, you would find in Chapter XV. Articles 105, 106, 107 and it goes on to all those who are administering the establishment of courts and other institutions. If you read Article 105 and then go down, it is clear that the judges have to be appointed by the Judicial Service Commission.

I would also like to say that separation of powers was first brought in the United States and they have gone into the whole issue. They have separated the Courts Martial from the Supreme Court and the other Courts that administer the law. If you want, we can certainly have a debate on it tomorrow or the day after. I did not bring all the authorities with me today . But, you can go into them. We have done research into this. The Court Martial is a separate issue. That is why even in fundamental rights, certain restrictions can be imposed in

the laws regarding the fundamental rights for the security forces. These are an exception to the normal rule. That is why you have the courts martial, the field courts martial to take action when there is an offence.

I would appreciate if the Hon. Minister can quote a case now that he has brought this matter up. There are a large number of cases in Sri Lanka in regard to judicial power coming from the 1960s; From about 1965 or 1966; from Ranasinghe and the Bribery Commissioner vs. Devanayagams case; all have dealt with judicial power. There have also been instances where courts martial have come up. I would like the Hon. Minister to give me now, the cases in which courts martial have been held to be judicial bodies. [Interruption.] That is all. You might say it is quasi or it has a certain military function like the Inland Revenue Act and the Monetary Law which are administered by the Controller of Exchange and the Central Bank. Those are not judicial bodies, but certainly they give decisions and you can appeal against their decisions in the Supreme Court. I studied this before I took this up. That is why I would like to say with a sense of responsibility that the Members of the Court Martial are excluded from the persons administering justice. Otherwise, I would not have referred to the persons administering justice. I referred to the Judge Advocate-General and the lawyer who is not under that. But, I have also said that they have been misled. In one instance, I have referred to the Court Martial. That is in regard to a judgment, which is contrary to Article 11 of the Constitution on the Fundamental Rights. But, it has been very clearly established that these are not judicial bodies, certainly not. They may have powers, I mean basically under emergency you give powers to the Armed Forces to decide on the life and death. People can even be disposed of without inquiry. Those are special circumstances which the Armed Forces need to have. I have also disputed the right of the Hon. Sarath Fonseka to be tried by a Court Martial. Nevertheless, I have brought up this legal issue and I would also like to thank my Colleague, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who brought up here, another valid point.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, with an equal sense of responsibility, I would like to say that a Court Martial definitely has judicial power because it has the power to impose the gravest penalties in this country including the sentence of death. It has the power to do so. How can you possibly argue that a tribunal which has the power to pass the gravest penalties are known to the Criminal Law? Can

987 988

one possibly argue that such a body does not exercise judicial power? Then what kind of power does it exercise? If the Court Martial in this country has the power to impose sentences of death, sentences of imprisonment from very long periods, how can one with any logic, apart from any legal basis, possibly maintain that there is no judicial power that is exercised by such a body? In any case, -[Interruption.] - this phrase in Standing Order No. 78 would have no meaning whatsoever. How can the Hon. Leader of the Opposition say that there is a distinction between Industrial Courts and Labour Tribunals on the one hand and the Court Martial on the other? The Court Marital has a power to hand down sentences of far greater severity than is possible with the Labour Tribunals. So, to argue that a Labour Tribunal has judicial power and a Court Martial does not, would seem to fly in the face of all basic logic and also, it is not consistent with any rational interpretation of Standing Order No. 78. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Minister, he is a past student of yours. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Therefore, Sir, with a due sense of responsibility I am suggesting that the proper course of action would be to expunge the whole of those proceedings from Hansard because there is a question of fundamental principle involved here. If it is allowed to happen once, it can happen again. It would be a very unsound precedent. It means that persons administering justice in this country will not be protected. Standing Order No. 78 will be a dead letter; it will be a dead letter. We are ignoring it completely. That would be a disastrous precedent to set and for that reason it is not confined to a particular case or any specific situation. It has a far broader applicability to the laws and sound practices of this country. Therefore, in order to protect the integrity of those practices, I respectfully ask you, Sir, that the whole of those proceedings should be expunged from Hansard. [Interruption.] There is no other course of action that is compatible with upholding the very plain and apparent content of Standing Order No. 78 and Article 4 of the Constitution of the Republic. That is my respectful submission to you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I would first like to say that in my speech there were only two sentences regarding the Court Martial. I talked about the Judge Advocate-General and the prosecuting lawyer. They are not the persons

administering justice even by the definition he has given. But, I stand by what I have said. There is a special law for military purposes. I have told you that there are American laws and there are British laws. I will bring them to you if you want to. There have been so many cases, starting from the Bribery Commission Vs. Ranasinghe. Even the Bribery Commission did not have the powers. Look at the powers he exercises. Then, you had the Devanayagam case. I have quoted a series of cases. I have told you to look at the American Law and the English Law. This is an exception made in all countries in regard to the armed forces and the military law. My Friend has not yet written a book on military law. That much, I must tell you. But, okay, if my Friend says that this is a body administering justice, kindly quote one such case. I can tell you there have been number of cases about military authorities in Sri Lanka and others. So, you cannot take this out. If you want to have a debate on that, whether they are people who are administering justice, for that sentence certainly, we will have it. But, the rest of my speech cannot be taken out. How can you come here and say that it should be taken out? When I referred to the evidence here, when I referred to what was said by the prosecuting counsel - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) 78 - - , . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) . But, I have made only one sentence on the Court Martial. The rest is about the prosecuting counsel and the Judge Advocate-General. He has not made any reference to them. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I have mentioned only one sentence. We are only arguing on one sentence. Someone can mislead them. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. Minister of External Affairs mentioned that the Standing Orders and the Constitution must be upheld. Did he not forget that the Seventeenth Amendment is not in force? So in that case - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am on a point of Order.

. , 2 524 (4) . I will read the English translation of the Bill. Clause 2 of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill states, I quote:

(4) The petitioner shall tender with the petition proof of payment of charges to cover the cost of publication of the notice under section 529.

Hon. Minister, I think it must be a mistake on the part of the drafters. It has to be corrected as, .in terms of section 529 (2). Otherwise, you will lose the intended meaning of it.

Similarly, in Clause 5, again there is a repetition. That is, with reference to section 529. I think that has to be corrected as, . section 529 (2).

There is another legal issue that I would like to draw your attention to. It is in Clause 8 of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill. Clause 8 of the Bill states, I quote:

Section 541 of the principal enactment is hereby amended in subsection (2) of that section by the substitution for the words 'the respondents to the original petition for probate or letters of administration or certificates of heirship' of the words 'the heirs of the deceased or other persons who have objected to the application'".

I think, Hon. Minister, it is a matter that you will have to look into very carefully. The Hon. Deputy Minister is also here. In the previous Act, it refers to any person who is interested in the estate. Although testamentary proceeding is a legal proceeding, those litigants are not willing litigants. They have not committed any wrong; there is no violation of the law. But, they have to resort to the legal system in our country not for anything else - not to grab anything else from anybody else - but just to get the inheritance rights; what have been devolved on them from their parents or kith and kin. Therefore, they should not be subjected to this kind of harassment. Testamentary proceeding is a family matter; it is a family concern. Why should you allow a man from the street to come and file papers in a testamentary case? Then, this will end up in a disaster. Therefore, I suggest that before we pass this Bill, these three corrections should be made, at least at this stage. Otherwise, the purpose of presenting this Bill will be lost and it will not be for the benefit or the advantage of the litigants. By not doing that, we are being unfair by them. Therefore, it is our duty; whether we are in the Opposition or the Government it makes no difference. When there is a Bill, when there is a good move for the benefit of the people, we all are here to support it. Therefore, I think the Hon. Minister would take necessary legal advice and do the corrections.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to express my views on the proposed amendments to the Clauses dealing with Testamentary Jurisdiction in the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill.

I think I am better equipped and qualified to speak regarding the amendments. These amendments are a long-felt need.

1003 1004

During the period when the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the Prime Minister, the then Minister of Justice, Hon. Felix Dias Bandaranaike transferred the subject of Testamentary Jurisdiction to the Public Trustee Department and I was handpicked to be in charge of the testamentary work in that Department and I did it for nearly seven years.

The problem with the testamentary cases is that they drag on for years and years. But, if you know the intricacies and the steps to be taken, you can terminate the proceedings in the testamentary cases within six months. I have attended to several testamentary cases and I got the proceedings terminated within a period of six months.

Earlier if the value of the intestate estate was over Rupees five lakhs, a testamentary case has to be filed to administer the property, but now according to the amended proposals of the Hon. Minister, only if the property is worth more than Rs. 25 lakhs, you will have to go to courts to administer the estate. In this connection, I wish to thank the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice for having brought these timely amendments.

Some Hon. Members - I think I will have to refer to that - in this House seem to have accused the Tamils in the North and the East saying that they are objecting to Sinhalese people going and buying properties in the North and East. This is not correct. We do not object to any Sinhalese person going and buying properties in the North and the East. We only object to mass-scale government sponsored colonization schemes in the Tamil areas. I also want to inform the Hon. Members of this House that Tamil-speaking persons are not allowed to buy property at Ampara.

I want the Hon. Minister of Justice to bring in a Bill, after consulting the Leaders of all the political parties, to prevent Members of Parliament crossing over. If a person is elected from one party and if he wants to cross over, he will have to resign from his seat and cross over.

Further, I also want to request the Hon. Minister to take steps to issue death certificates for those people who have been missing for the last 15 to 20 years.

Thank you very much. [. . 4.20]
