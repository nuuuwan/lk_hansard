( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, as you know, today the Vote on the Ministry of External Affairs has to be taken up for discussion. It is the Opposition which prepares the Committee Stage Programme of the Budget. But, there was a request that the Minister, owing to some very important work, will be out of the country and the Votes on the Ministry of External Affairs be taken up on Thursday. It is now found out that he is in the Maldives where the Cabinet of Ministers have resigned. So, the Discussion on the Vote of an important Ministry such as that of External Affairs has been put off and the Minister is snorkelling in the Maldives at the moment where the Cabinet of Ministers is not functioning. Can you please tell us what the priority of this Government is?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

" Rabbi Zidni Ilman" - "Oh! Lord, increase me in my knowledge!" That is the saying of the Holy Quran, which proves how much of importance Islam attaches to education.

We are very happy today that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has placed the future educational development of this country in the very safe hands of the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education and also the Hon. Bandula Gunawardena, Minister of Education.

Sir, when speaking about education, I cannot help but refer to one of our great educationalists who departed from us a couple of days ago - on Sunday, 4th July, 2010. I am referring to Alhaj Moulavi Niyas Mohamed (AL-Gaffoori). The Hon. Prime Minister too wanted me to mention that when he took office, the Moulavi came rushing from Colombo to Kahatapitiya, Gampola, and said a special prayer for the success of his future career.

We are also requesting, Sir, to help the Arabic Colleges in our country and upgrade them, and also to give a fillip to the Ahadiya Schools like Daham Pasalas. The Ahadiya Society has asked for free passes in public transport for their school teachers, and if that could be done, it would be greatly appreciated.

So by founding the Ihasaniya Arabic College, in Peer Saibo Street, Hulftsdorp, Moulavi Niyas Mohamed created a new dimension in the educational sphere of this

country.

It was last night, the Venerable Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thero, the Head Priest of the Nagaviharaya Temple, Kotte paid an eloquent tribute to the late Moulavi Niyas. He referred to him as "Doramadalawa Moulavi". Taking into consideration the great national services rendered by the late Moulavi, His Excellency the President appointed him as his Adviser for Muslim Religious Affairs.

Sir, the day before he left for Badulla - he liked Badulla, he always spoke about the developments of the schools in Badulla, he has travelled far and wide in this country - we met him at Rheinland Place in Colpetty. We never had an inkling that fate would never return him alive to our midst again. The Governor of the Western Province, the Hon. Alavi Moulana and the children of that great educationalist, Dr. M.M. Uvais - Akram, Ajmal, Yusri - and our good friend F.A.Yaseen were all there. Moulavi Niyas took a keen interest in discussing educational problems with Muslim groups. I should mention one particular person that he liked, Salih Hajiar or Salih naana in that place. We never dreamt that he was having his last supper, so well prepared by Salih naana, before he left for Badulla.

Sir, I am well aware that everybody in this House knows him well. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, himself has issued a condolence message on the demise of this eminent Moulavi. I do not want to read the whole statement but I would table* it to be included in Hansard.

I will quote only a part of it which states:

Cleric Niyas Moulavi not only had extensive knowledge on the Holy Prophets teachings in the Holy Quran but he also possessed a very good knowledge about other religions as well. As a result he was a religious dignitary who had a character possessed with humanity sans borders such as ethnic, caste or religions. Because of this trait he was revered by all religions alike. His proud message was that this country was one nation in which all should live together without differences.

Inna Lillahi Wa-inna Ilaihi Raji-oon!

In "Doramadalawa", the Moulavi used to address Hasantha Hettiarrachchi, as "Putha Hasantha". He revived Muslim education through "Doramadalawa". He imparted Buddhist knowledge to Muslims and Islamic concepts to Sinhalese. Among the number of educated Bhikkus and Hindu-Christian prelates, he extolled the virtues of Islamic thoughts and philosophy. Moulavi Niyas was an embodiment of peace and unity. He loved his country so dearly. He became, in fact, a national figure.

Sir, we have been facing so many problems in the education sector in this country. I am very hopeful that the Hon. Bandula Gunawardena would rise up to the occasion. After great men of the calibre of Dr. T.B. Jayah, Sir Razik Fareed and Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel during the State Council days, and their services in the Free Education Committee, it was left to Alhaj Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud to revitalize Muslim education in this country.

Sir, there is a Report in my hand published by a Special Commission appointed by His Excellency the President. The Chairman of this Commission was Dr. A.G. Hussain Ismail, and its Members included Mrs. Jezima Ismail, Mr. S.H.M. Jameel and Dr. (Mrs.) J.M.K.B. Ajabdan Mansoor.

They are all great educationalists in this country. I do not want to read the whole Report, Sir. But, there are very important and salient features about the Muslim education in this country and also details as to how the Muslims lived with amity and peace with the rest of the communities in this country namely, the majority Sinhalese and also the Tamils.

For example, Sir, page 3 of the Report on Issues Related to Education of the Muslim Community in Sri Lanka states, I quote: Robert Knox says that the Moors were given plots of lands by Kandyan Kings. King Rajasinha being pleased with the Arab fighters, . Mind you, the word, fighters, made them settled at Akurana thus giving rise to prominently Moorish settlements in high lands. King Rajasingha II (1635-1687) gifted the village Pangaragammana in the Bintenna Korala, Badulla as a tribute to the memory of a Moor women who had been killed by the Portuguese for refusing to divulge the whereabouts of the King who has defeated in Uva.... ......A Copper Plate presented to Kulanthai Maraikar of Beruwala in 1070 AC by Dhambadaniya King Jaya Bahu II states as follows: 'So long the sun rises in Sri Lanka .

Mark these words, Sir, I would repeat it. " 'So long the sun rises in Sri Lanka Muslims are at liberty to carry on trade and put up Mosques.' This historic document shows how the Muslims were living among Sinhalese with full right and dignity." ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

. , .

, . , . Whereupon THE HON. R. YOGARAJAN left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I do not want to read more extracts from this Report here. The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, Minister of Education, is passing by me. Please listen to this. The purpose of presenting this document is to implement the recommendations of this Report, because the All-Ceylon Muslim Education Conference met His Excellency the President and, mind you, after 60 years, after the Soulbury Commission, a minority Muslim problem concerning education and cultural aspects was discussed in detail only after the appointment of this Commission. Mr. Mohamed Y.A. Bawa, Secretary and Moulavi Farook Ibrahim, Treasurer, together with Mr. F.M. Fairoos, their media spokesman, saw me today. Their request was to implement this Report as early as possible. Now, it is left to the Hon. Minister of Education to do so.

Then, I would like to speak about Higher Education. I am very pleased, Sir, to state that I had the greatest opportunity of travelling with the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake to Ampara, to Oluvil, to Batticaloa and also to Trincomalee in the Eastern Province.

Now, see his philosophical thoughts which he has included in this Progress Report, "Review of Activities - 2009". I would ask every Hon. Member to read this. The Hon. Minister has a great wisdom, Sir. I quote the Hon. Minister's Message in the Report:

"In line with the Mahinda Chintana of His Excellency the President I shoulder the burden to generate a man through the university capable to see beyond the horizon."

.

These are great thoughts indeed. I also commend the services of the Deputy Minister, Hon. S. Nandimithra Ekanayaka.

Sir, our visit to Oluvil University was very, very useful. The Hon. Minister is a practical man; he went to the canteen and saw the shortcomings there.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you have two minutes more. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay. At Vantharumoolai, The Hon. Minister bought a cutlet from a canteen there and shared it with me. He

433 434

went to the animal husbandry farm; talked to the undergraduate children. For the first time after the establishment of the Oluvil University, for which the credit should go to the Hon. Alhaj Marhoom M.H.M. Ashraff, the Hon. Minister had the Vice-Chancellor, the Deans, and all the other staff summoned at the Guest House built by Marhoom Ashraff and discussed the problems of the Oluvil University until midnight. At the end, he entertained them for dinner. Therefore, Hon. Minister, we can be sure that we are safe with the subject of Higher Education as long as it is in your hands. You have an able Secretary, Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawarathna.

Then, Sir, the Hon. Gamini Lokuge and the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage dealt with the subject of Sports. I must also say this, Sir. His Excellency the President lays a lot of emphasis on the development of sports not only in Colombo but also in rural areas. He wants to improve the schools not only in the South but also in Jaffna. The Chairman of the Tharunyata Hetak, the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, has already started building a swimming pool in the North. Can you believe this, Sir? And, he has already allocated about Rs. 200 lakhs in order to build this swimming pool there and it will be completed within four months. Sir, there is a Cricket Stadium coming up in Jaffna. I am talking about your area, Sir, and in Kilinochchi, 400 hundred students were enlisted for sports like Volleyball, and after 40 years, four girls were selected to the Sri Lanka junior pool. Therefore, I would commend all the steps taken to develop sports in the North.

When you point a finger at someone, there are three fingers pointing towards you. I admire you, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga; you know it. I used to inform your great Dad of your scores when you were playing cricket abroad. I liked your father and your mother also. We always had a very close friendship and understanding. Now, you made certain remarks about officials who cannot defend themselves in this House. You accused Mr. S. Liyanagama in so many words. He was earlier the Secretary to the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage. He was the Secretary to the Ministry of Export Development and Industrial Trade which came under the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. Then, he was the Secretary to the Chief Government Whip of Parliament under the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle and the present incumbent, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. Then, he was Director, Research and Development when His Excellency the President was the Minister of Labour during the period 1994-1997. He was also in the Ministry of Fisheries under His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa in 1997 and he has also functioned as Senior Assistant Secretary in the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. Therefore, Sir, I think you must be more careful when you accuse others.

Mr. D.S. de Silva is one person who has flown our flag high in the arena of international cricket. Hon. Ranatunga, you have played with him. He had once been the Captain of the Sri Lankan Cricket Team. I think His Excellency the President has chosen the correct person as the Presidential Adviser on Cricket. He has taken cricket to the village and has been helping children in Jaffna and even in the Eastern province to improve cricket over there.

Thank you very much. : : Document tabled:

In answer to (b)(ii) of that Question, you said, I quote:

There are two types of private higher education providers in the country at present in addition to the State universities and higher educational institutions as follows:

1. Eight institutions which have been given recognition under Section 25A of the Universities Act to award some selected degree programmes...

. Then, what is spelt out in Section 25A of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 is, I quote:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, subject to the provisions of section 70C, by an Order (hereinafter referred to as a 'Degree Awarding Institute Order')...........

That is, to carry on as that type of a degree awarding institution. That means, , degrees award .

:

I quote: "2. About 73 institutions preparing students for degrees awarded by the offshore universities such as APIIT, ACBT, Royal Institute. et cetera. Sir, unfortunately, I have only the English version of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of 1990. I will take the opportunity to read out a few Sections from that. From the Answer you gave, Hon. Minister, we understand that Section 14 of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act basically governs this. It states, I quote: (1) No person shall, establish, manage, run or control any institute for the provision of tertiary education and vocational education, or tertiary education or vocational education without being registered under this Act. (2) Any development plan may classify the categories of persons and establishments providing tertiary education and vocational education or tertiary education or vocational education as the case may be, for the purpose of registration under subsection (1). Then, Section 15 (1) of the Act states, I quote: No person or establishment shall conduct any tertiary education and vocational education course or tertiary education course or vocational education course being a specified course without being registered under this Act. Then, Section 16 (1) states, I quote: No person or establishment shall conduct any examination for conferring or granting any tertiary education award or vocational education award, without being registered with the Director-General under this Act: There are four subsections under Section 16 (1).

I am asking you whether you could reply to me. Ask your own conscience. What is your programme for the Pradeshiya Sabhas? You have extended the period of it. Good! Are you going for a Ward system or a Proportional Representation system? Tell me. You cannot give an answer. You do not know. [Interruption.] I cannot give you my time. Are you going to present it to Parliament? You can give an answer to it in your speech. I am challenging you. Are you going to bring in the Jana Sabha system? Are you going to abolish the Local Government system? I am challenging you. You are trying to do that. You are going to ruin the whole economy and the structure of the village level. I am challenging you. I have the facts and figures, everything. Do not ruin this country. Ruin yourselves, that is okay; country comes first. I started my political life from a Gam Sabha. That is my experience. Here, the saddest thing is that you dance to the whims and fancies of the politicians. Hon. former Prime Minister, I know your conscience, I respect you. But, the saddest thing in this country is that you are ruining the country. You do not know the subject yet though you have been appointed. The Ministers have been appointed. Anyone can challenge me; I am openly challenging you to come to a debate on Local Government, Provincial Councils or national development.

Do not blame the Government servants. They are okay. During the floods in Gampaha your President blamed the AGAs. No, you must not do that. The initiative should be taken by the politicians. But, it took two or three days to take the initiative and you blamed the Government servants. I have proved this in the Wayamba Provincial Council as the Chief Minister and as a District Minister also. The Hon. Minister was pressing me and within three months I completed the Kuda Gal Amuna project. Before constructing the dam and the irrigation system, people were begging along the Kataragama, Kiri Vehera-Sella Kataragama Road.

Hon. Minister, because there are no commissions today, Rs. 76 million is spent in vain. This is public money, I am telling you. When there are examinations, the papers are leaked out because there is no Commission.

( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Deputy Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs)Hon. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity offered to me to address the House on the Votes of the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. I am also happy to speak after my good Friend, the Hon. J. Sri Ranga, a unique gentleman, who has come to Parliament. He was born in Jaffna but today he is representing the people of the plantation areas. I wish him all the very best!

This Ministry has a crucial responsibility for the implementation of the Public Administration component of the Mahinda Chintana - Idiri Dekma. Public Administration deals with matters where the private sector fails. For example, the private sector sells food items but, when there is a disastrous situation like tsunami, the private sector closes down and the Government has to step in and provide food. Another example is, the private sector provides goods and services only for those who have income to purchase them.

Public Administration deals with that section of society which has no income and tries to provide them with measures of poverty alleviation to build up their purchasing capacity. There are more applicants than relief could provide. Therefore, a system of rationing and allocation has to be adopted. Many complaints made by some of the Members who spoke during the Committee Stage Discussion today dealt with such individual issues and the misuse of discretion. I have carefully noted some of them and I will ensure rectification of those issues in future.

497 498

It is a common complaint that Public Administration is yet colonial. This is correct. Sixty years have passed since Independence and we are yet having an unaccountable Public Administration meant for ruling the people, and not trying to respond to their needs.

The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution is a huge topic today. What has it done? The Seventeenth Amendment strengthened this colonial tendency. Under the guise of making Public Administration independent, it made it sovereign.

There are two sectors of Public servants. The elected Public servants and the selected Public servants. What did the Seventeenth Amendment do? The Seventeenth Amendment took away the say that the elected Public servants had. The elected Public servants had no say. The selected Public servants had their own way. That is what the Seventeenth Amendment did. So, you must realize it when you are talking big about the Seventeenth Amendment. Do not just follow the Seventeenth Amendment like a manthra. But, remember that we are the elected Public servants. So, let us keep the power the elected Public servants have and then, give whatever we can give to the selected Public servants. Under the guise of the Seventeenth Amendment, what happened was, by saying we are trying to make the Public Administration independent, we made it sovereign. We gave all our powers to the selected Public servants. So, I would like to focus the attention of this House to that aspect of the Seventeenth Amendment. In a democracy this is all wrong. We are trying to change this through the route of culture. Instead of a colonial culture, we are trying to have a Public Administration based on Buddhist culture with a mixture of the Hindu, Christian and the Islamic culture as well.

In "Nandiyamiga Jataka", Nandiya taught ten royal qualities of public governance to the ruler of the ancient kingdom of Kosala in India. They were, generosity, moral observances, sacrifice of possessions, honesty, gentleness, austerity, non-hatred, non-violence, patience and, of course, fidelity to the Constitution.

In "Sigalovadaya", Lord Buddha preached not of rights but of obligation, the virtue of harmonious relationships and treating each other appropriately as father, mother, brother, sister et cetera Recently, I was in China and this concept of harmony in relationship is now widely accepted there.

Lord Buddha also emphasized the concept of Karuna - compassion, a concept not too widely practised by a rule-bound Public Administration. This Ministry would be developing a home-grown culture of Public Administration to replace the worn-out model that is now prevalent.

In the last two and half months, the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne, who has been my leader in this Ministry working under the guidance of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and correctly directing me, has embarked on a number of initiatives. The time given does not enable me to dilate on all of them. However, some significant ones need to be mentioned.

One deals with corruption. Corruption is one of the endemic problems of Public Administration since it does not have any competitors. A number of legal steps have been taken but the most promising step is clean-hands campaign initiated by none other than our the Secretary in our own Ministry. It is initiated by committed Public servants determined to restore respect to their services for its integrity. This is a commendable internal initiative to cleanse itself and has the full support of the Government. It will be expanded as a major initiative of the Government.

Another initiative is expanding the "Next Generation of Citizens' Charter" programme. As I mentioned, Public Administration has a monopoly in the supply of its goods and services. A dissatisfied applicant has no alternative place to go. Where do they go? They go to the Member of Parliament. So, the "Next Generation of Citizens' Charter" programme is a device to introduce the internal markets. It makes a written promise that the services will be provided within a specified period of time. For example, a birth certificate will be issued within a day. This happens in a number of Divisional Secretaries' Divisions right now in this country.

A citizens' charter should eventually be available at each retail point where public services are being provided. By doing so, Public servants are also being taught that those who come for services are customers and they need to be treated like customers. Public Administration has given special attention to the war-affected citizens of our population in the North. Over the last three decades, most of these citizens have lost their loved ones, their possessions, their livelihood and basic documents like birth certificates et cetera.

On a decision taken by His Excellency the President, a group of young Members of Parliament led by the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, especially co-ordinated by the Hon. Kanaka Herath regarding matters in our Ministry, were appointed to review the ground situation. Based on a study made by them, we held a two-day mobile service in Kilinochchi last week and issued almost 10,000 birth certificates immediately. It is intended to have a similar mobile service in Mullaitivu on the 31st of July. This will be extended to Mannar and Jaffna.

In addition, a loan of Rs. 900 million from ADB has been negotiated to restore Public administration infrastructure for the North. This project would be commissioned next week and should be completed by the end of 2011. Four Assistant Government Agents' offices

have been upgraded in Jaffna and they will be opened in August.

There are two forms of Public governance in Sri Lanka. One is the de-concentrated variety with Cabinet Ministers and reaching the people through Government Agents, Divisional Secretaries and Grama Niladharis. The other is the devolved variety, working through Provincial Ministers and their lower ranks. But, the executive responsibility for governance of the whole country is vested with His Excellency the President who has been given this responsibility by a direct vote of the people. It is, therefore, necessary to have a co-ordinating mechanism at district and divisional levels.

I am sure that is the problem the Hon. J. Sri Ranga mentioned because there is a problem of co-ordination between these two arms of the Government. The Government Agent seems to be the prime choice as the co-ordinator in the district, either in his own right or under political control. The Government Agent has a variety of responsibilities and he plays many roles. Yet, there is confusion about the relationship he has with the devolution based form of governance. This has to be studied carefully to see whether they are under de-concentrated governance or devolved governance to enable a better delivery of Public services to the people of this country.

Hon. Chairman, the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs is celebrating the fortieth year of establishment this year. Its first Minister was the late Hon. Felix R.D. Bandaranaike and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister was the late Hon. Neal de Alwis. Many files have flowed through the Ministry since then. In another ten more years, Hon. Chairman, the Public Administration in this country will be completing the fiftieth year and we will be celebrating the Golden Jubilee. So, when we celebrate the Golden Jubilee, where should we be?

A former Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs and the former Prime Minister, Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, a politician whom I always respect, is seated right in front me. He gave guidance to this Ministry years and years ago and I can remember how he revamped the entire Ministry in 1994 after he took over as the Minister of Public Administration. So, all these Ministers who were in charge of this Ministry tried their best to take it in the right direction so that we would have a Public Administration system that would be handled transparently, honestly, sincerely and to have a properly-administered Public Administration and Home Affairs system from the North to the South and from the West to the East. But, we were unable to do so because of terrorism. Terrorism did not allow the Grama Niladharis to work properly in those areas. We did not have proper Divisional Secretaries working in those areas. Most of the Government Agents were Government Agents when they came to Colombo. They were GAs

here; they were "LAs" there. The Grama Niladharis were Grama Niladharis here under the Government, but they had to be Grama Niladharis also under the LTTE there. That was the truth; on ground that was the bitter truth. Not that they liked it, but they had to do it because there was a gun pointed at their heads. So, let us face this truth. If we do not face this truth, then we would not be looking forward.

This Government, under the guidance of His Excellency the President, is looking forward and I am happy that the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne, who was appointed Minister only two-and-a-half months ago, is giving the right stewardship to this Ministry. We will be completing sixth months in this Ministry on the 21st of October. I assure this House that when we complete six months, we will be ready to present the next Budget for 2011. When the Budget for 2011 comes up, I can assure you, Sir, this Ministry will be ready to move on to the next decade. The next decade is the decade in which this Ministry is going to complete 50 years of being in charge of Public Administration. So, while celebrating the 40th anniversary, we look back to gain from the right things we did and learn from the mistakes because sometimes they say that "failures are the pillars of success".

Sir, while submitting to this House the Progress Report for 2009 and the Action Plan for 2010, it is intended to have a special six-month progress report readied by the end of October to coincide with the presentation of the Budget for 2011. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, the Hon. Members, my Minister, the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne, who is giving me all the space to work as a Deputy Minister, the Secretary of my Ministry and also all the able officials who are helping us in this endeavour.

Thank you very much.

The Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs is trying to re-delimit the Pradeshiya Sabhas and Grama Niladhari Divisions. This should not be done isolatedly because the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils doing it separately and the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs doing it separately cause a lot of problems. Today, the police divisions are different, the administrative Divisional Secretary's Divisions are different, the Local Authority Divisions are different and the judicial districts are different. So, these cause a lot of confusion. There should be a co-ordinated delimitation done so that electorates, Divisional Secretary's Divisions, Provincial divisions, Pradeshiya Sabha divisions, police divisions and judicial districts, all, will have some relationship or some sort of co-ordinated coherent set-up.

Similarly, I also wish to bring this to the attention of the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils.

Sir, I wish to point out a few shortcomings in the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. There was a proposal to appoint 2,500 facilitators to work in the Tamil language in the plantation areas. In this regard, a Cabinet Paper was submitted in 2006, it was approved and 2,500 facilitators were to be appointed in a phased-out manner; 500 per year for five years. In 2006,

500 persons were appointed as facilitators and they are serving in police stations, in pradeshiya sabhas, in divisional secretaries divisions and district secretariat offices. But, unfortunately, out of this 500, about 250 left employment to become teachers in 2007. Because of this, 250 vacancies have arisen. Applications were called to fill the vacancies and nearly 12,000 applications were received. But, nobody has been appointed so far. I request the Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs to take action to appoint these 250 facilitators and also to follow up the Cabinet Paper and appoint the balance 2,000 facilitators who were approved by the Cabinet, very soon. This would help overcome the language problem in the Public sector where people are unable to obtain services in the language of their choice.

Thank you, Sir. [. . 7.25] ( )

There was a huge shortage of chicken due to the bird flue that was prevalent for the last several years. The Government had to prevent the parent stock being imported to the country. Therefore, there was an artificial shortage and we must praise the Government for preventing the importation of parent stock and thereby preventing the bird flue from coming into the country. So, we did not get even a single bird infected with bird flue. Priority was given by the Government to prevent the disease and protect the poultry industry in this country.
