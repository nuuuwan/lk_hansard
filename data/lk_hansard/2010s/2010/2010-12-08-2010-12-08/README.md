: 2010 06 " " : 2010 06 " " PRIVILEGE : "DAILY MIRROR" REPORT OF 06TH DECEMBER, 2010 ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me permission to raise this matter after I met you in the Chambers today. I wish to raise this as a matter of Privilege and Public Importance by invoking Article 157A(1) and (4) of the Constitution and Standing Order No. 84 (x).

I refer to the statement made by a former Secretary-General of Parliament, namely, Mrs. Priyanee Wijesekera to the "Daily Mirror" of 06th December, 2010 appearing in the front page captioned, "Resolution can't unseat an MP", and it states thus, I quote:

"Amidst talks about the government's attempts to unseat UNP MP Dr. Jayalath Jayawardane, former Secretary-General of Parliament, Priyani Wijesekara said yesterday that an MP could not be unseated through a 'mere resolution' in the House".

This statement was made in the wake of the Government's move to forward a Substantive Motion against the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardane for his conduct, supportive of the banned LTTE. This statement of Mrs. Wijesekera is prejudicial to the intended Motion of the Government.

Mrs. Wijesekera is in the pay of Parliament, as she holds a responsible position in the Parliamentary Scholarship Board for which a payment is made to her under Parliamentary Head Vote No. 16. Annually, a sum of Rs. 5 million is released by Parliament for the expenditure of the said Board. Earlier it had been about Rs. 30 million, I understand. Besides, Parliament has released a vehicle No. HH 1934 for her use with a chauffeur and also, fuel is supplied.

Article 157A (3) (d) states, I quote:

"if he is a Member of Parliament or a person in such service or holding such office as is referred to in paragraph (1) of Article 165, cease to be such Member or to be in such service or to hold such office".

Mrs. Wijesekera, by her highly unnecessary and unethical statement, which is uncalled for, has acted in violation of the Constitution. I shall place these facts before you, Mr. Speaker, as the guardian of Parliament, to enable you to proceed to take necessary action in this regard and keep Parliament informed.

Thank you very much for giving me a patient hearing.

( ) (The Chairman) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran, what is your point of Order?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Chairman, I wish to raise a point of Order under Standing Order No. 70(3). That is with regard to the days allotted for the Appropriation Bill.

It states, I quote:

On a day so allotted, the Appropriation Bill shall be put down as the first item of Public Business and no other Public Business shall be taken before 6.00 p.m. on any such day.

If the House is now resolving itself to sit together as a Committee of the whole House, this will be a Committee of the whole House. So, we cannot get the approval for the extension of the state of Emergency when the House is sitting as a Committee.

1685 1686

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) At the Party Leaders' Meeting, it was decided that the Members can express their views with regard to the extension of the state of Emergency when the Defence Vote is taken up. So, if you do not want to express your views now, you can do it at 7.00 p.m.. You have half an hour for that Debate.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Speaker now announced that the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency and the Defence Vote will be taken up together. But, that cannot be taken up together because the Emergency Debate must be taken when the Parliament sits and the Defence Vote is taken in the Committee of the whole Parliament. So, you cannot take up both at the same time. If the Leader of the House is saying - [Interruption.] I understand what the Leader of the House is saying.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, you did not understand.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You said that the Emergency Debate will be taken at 7.00 p.m. Then, is there going to be no Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency because the House is not sitting as a Committee?

What does the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, say? What does the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom say? They say, terrorism is not local, not even regional; it is global and transnational. But, there has to be a concise and consorted effort on the part of the international community to crush this terrorism. We have crushed this terrorism, but what did they do? In France, a statue of Thamilchelvan was erected by LTTE activists. But, the French Government is keeping mum about it. In the United States of America, Tamil terrorists have declared a unilateral declaration of Tamil Eelam. But, the USA Government is not doing anything about it. We know who came as the Chief Guest to that occasion. It was William Ramsay Clark, a former Attorney-General of the USA. That is how the United States of America is looking at it.

In the United Kingdom, Adele Balasingham, the female terrorist leader who has pioneered the LTTE Womens corps, is living very happily while the LTTE is a banned organization in the United Kingdom. But, the government of the United Kingdom is doing nothing about it. We know how the LTTE blood money has rolled the United Kingdom political machines, so much so, for their interest and consorted effort for what we have done to crush terrorism. But, this is the response of the international community.

The Oxford Union has cancelled His Excellency the Presidents free speech and lecture the other day. The former Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan of the United Kingdom, has said that the Oxford Union is the last bastion of free speech in the Western world. But, then he would not have known that one day the Oxford Union would be headed by officers with weak knees. They have trembled and fainted at the sight of the LTTE terrorist sympathizers holding placards and have denied the free speech of a democratically-elected President of any country. So, that is about the Oxford Union.

I think our President going to the Oxford Union and delivering a lecture is an honour to the Oxford Union and not vice versa because President Mahinda Rajapaksa is heading a country which has a very powerful and a very rich heritage, richer than that of the United Kingdom in general and also richer than the Oxford Union in particular. The Oxford Union was started in 1823. But, in our country, in the 15th century we have had a better university than the Oxford University called Vijayaba Pirivena headed by the erudite monk, Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thero. There were about 5,000 national and international students and they have taught many more subjects than the subjects that are being taught in the Oxford University today. So, that is our heritage. I am very sorry about the Oxford Union. That is all I want to say on that matter. You must go through the Sunday Island editorial of the other day of Prabhath Sahabandu. You must photocopy the article and then distribute it among the British citizens. Definitely all these British

1725 1726

citizens would hide their faces in shame after reading that article. [ ] , .

[. . 12.52] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency and the Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence. Before I speak on them, I want to refer to two incidents which happened in this august Assembly when the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution was passed on the 8th of September. General Sarath Fonseka was called upon to speak on the Eighteenth Amendment by the Hon. Speaker and when he tried to speak, about 11 Members of Parliament stood in front of him and started shouting till he finished his speech. We could not hear what he was saying. Then, when the Hon. Sumanthiran was on his feet, several Members from the Government side shouted at him calling him kotiya and he was not allowed to continue with his speech.

Your people in 1956, 1958, 1977 and 1983, massacred the Tamils, burnt them alive in seven provinces, destroyed their houses and the rest of the people were put in a ship and sent to Jaffna and Batticaloa as the Government thought only Jaffna and Batticaloa were safe for the Tamils.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

... , [ ] .

, ... , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Chairman, after the 1983 massacre, the Tamils were forced to arm themselves in order to defend themselves. It was the 1983 massacre which created Prabhakaran. We are called, "Honourable Members" of this House and we must act honourably inside the Well of this House and maintain the decorum at least in future. Every Member of this House has the right to speak without any violent interruption. I felt very sorry and hurt for what happened on the day the Eighteenth Amendment was passed. Since every Member has the right to speak in this House, I hope at least in future that these Hon. Members will allow the other Members to speak without any violent interruption.

Regarding the extension of the state of Emergency, I was carefully listening to what the Hon. Prime Minister was saying and he gave some reasons for extending it. About two weeks ago, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence issued a press statement saying that he wants to extend the state of Emergency because of the TNA and the JVP. This reason was not given by the Hon. Prime Minister in his speech to extend the state of Emergency. I want to ask the Hon. Prime Minister whether he sincerely feels that the state of Emergency is required to run the Government when the President and other important Ministers are telling the world that terrorism is over. What is the necessity to have the state of Emergency now? A state of Emergency can be brought in only when there is an emergency situation, which prevents distribution of food items and when there is a chaos in the country. Since there is no emergency situation in this country now, why does the Hon. Prime Minister want Emergency Regulations to rule this country and why does he want us to help him to extend it for another one month? I think the Government wants to extend the state of Emergency as it affects the Tamils only and to keep the Tamil prisoners indefinitely in prisons and camps. What has happened to those persons who are being kept in unknown destinations, who number about 9,000? Why can the Government not give us at least the details of these persons so that the families will know where they are? I understand that the President has said to some foreign newspaper that he is prepared to give those names. Why can he not give the names here in Sri Lanka?

It is when the so-called state of Emergency was in force that two suspects, with the assistance of another suspect, abducted two young girls on a Saturday evening

1727 1728

[ ]

2010 08

in October, 2010. This incident took place at Palathota in Kalutara when the girls were on their way home after tuition classes. Luckily, the Kalutara Police arrested these two suspects. According to the "Virakesari" newspaper of 13th October, 2010, two girls namely Arulanantham Jeeva, aged 18, and Sebastianpillai Jenitha, aged 13, were abducted about two days prior to 13th October, 2010 when they were standing at a bus-halt to go home at Champion Pattu. People who came in a white van had abducted them. These girls were students of the Champion Pattu American Tamil Mixed School. Then, about three weeks back in Poonakari, a Tamil married lady was raped by two Army officers.

About 1,200 families consisting of 6,000 persons were chased away from Sampur, which was declared a high security zone. These 6,000 persons for the last five years had been detained in camps. After chasing these 6,000 persons, the Government declared a 10,000-acre land as a high security zone and people cannot go there. As a result of this, people living in four villages are unable to go to their own lands. People from Sampur, Koonithivu, Saralaikuda and Sampukani were chased away and nobody is allowed to go and inspect these lands. When will the Government allow these 6,000 persons who were chased away from Sampur to resettle in their own lands? It is a breach of the fundamental rights of a person if he is prevented from living in his own land.

In Nivithigala-Kukulegama Estate, when the Indian labourers were sleeping in their houses, the Sinhalese people set fire to their houses and the Indian labourers left the place and were hiding in bushes. They are unable to return to their estates because of fear. Will the Government take note of it? The police have refused to record their complaints.

Recently, a Major in the Special Task Force was arrested by the Police while accepting a ransom from a Tamil businessman. I also understand that even police officers visit jewellery shops on the pretext of searching for stolen jewellery and have taken the jewellery from these shops.

World famous citizens including Nelson Mandela and Bishop Tutu have expressed their opinion stating that the ethnic question in Sri Lanka has become an international issue. Even the international jurists have expressed concern about the state of Emergency. What we need now is not Emergency but the rule of law, which is lacking now.

In the Jaffna and Trincomalee Districts, when the ex-militants commit an offence it is not investigated by the Police. In Trincomalee, in August 2009 some Members belonging to the TMVP group went to the house of one Dominic, arrested him and took him to their office at Customs Road, Trincomalee, and on the following morning they came and got the cellular phone of

Dominic. Sometime later, Dominic telephoned his wife and said that he was at Customs Road, Trincomalee. When this was brought to my notice, I went to Trincomalee personally to see the DIG and handed over a letter to him and requested him to make a proper inquiry. Thereafter, I met the SSP as well in this connection. But, nothing was done by the Police; Dominic is still missing. What has happened to him? Even in Jaffna, there were several abductions and killings for ransom by the ex-militants but the police did not take sufficient interest to do proper investigations.

In this instance, I wish to mention in this House about the activities of one Major Mathialahan alleged to be working in the Army Intelligence Unit. In the middle of July 2010, one Mrs. Ananthy, who is working in the Kilinochchi Kachcheri, wife of Sinnaturai Sasitharan alias Elilan, wrote to me to find out the whereabouts of her husband. She also sent me a newspaper cutting, which states that Elilan who surrendered to the Army was being interrogated in the Terrorist Investigation Division. She is working in the Kilinochchi Kachcheri.

I wrote to the Director, Terrorist Investigation Division on 18th July, 2010 with a copy of a letter which I received from Elilans wife and asked the Director, TID to inform me the present whereabouts of this person, Elilan. About one and a half months later, one person calling himself Major Mathialahan telephoned me in the morning when I was in the Attorney-Generals Department and told me that he got the letter which I wrote to the Director, Terrorist Investigation Division regarding Elilan. He further told me that Elilan and one Sutha Master are with him, and that he has informed Elilans wife and Sutha Masters mother that they must pay money to get them released. He gave me the telephone number of Mrs. Elilan and he wanted me to tell them that these two people are alive. On my way to Jaffna, I told this to Mrs. Ananthy, wife of Elilan and the mother of Sutha Master. This Major Mathialahan continued to telephone me almost daily. Mrs. Elilan wanted me to tell Major Mathialahan to get Elilan to contact her. When I told this to Major Mathialahan, he said it would create a problem for him and told me that if necessary, I could talk to them.

One day, when I was in Kopay, he telephoned me and said that Sutha Master wanted to speak to me. About five minutes later, one person spoke to me over his phone and said that he was Sutha Master and that he was being detained in an unknown place and his wife and children are being brought to see him every month and he wanted me to tell his mother and his brothers who are abroad to take steps to get him released. I never told Elilans wife to pay money to Major Mathialahan.

On 29th October, 2010, one Mr. N. Panchadcharalingam of Sandilipay came and told me about his brother-in-law, Mr. Nadarasa Nitharsan. He

1729 1730

told me that Mr. Nadarasa Nitharsan was taken into custody on 14th July, 2008 by the Army at Omanthai. He wanted me to do something to find out about this persons whereabouts. This boy is from Varany.

On 3rd November, 2010 when Major Mathialahan telephoned me, I asked him about Mr. Nadarasa Nitharsan. Five minutes later he told me that he is from Varany and that he was being detained there. He wanted me to tell his parents to contact him and I told Mr. N. Panchadcharalingam about this and told him to contact Major Mathialahan.

This is all what I have done.

On 5th November, 2010, this Mr. N. Panchadcharalingam telephoned from Vavuniya and told me that he has given Rupees three and a half lakhs to a person sent by Major Mathialahan and thereafter Major Mathialahan scolded him and told him to go to Jaffna. He also warned him that he should not make any complaint to the police. I immediately contacted the Vavuniya Police Station and told them about this incident and I told Mr. N. Panchadcharalingam also to make a complaint to the Vavuniya Police Station regarding this.

Mr. Panchadcharalingam made a complaint to the Vavuniya Police Station on 5th November ,2010 as directed by me. Subsequently, I also made a statement to the Vavuniya Police Station.

I complained to the Army Commander regarding this incident by letter dated 6th November, 2010 and I table* a copy of that letter to be included in Hansard.

The area of Kanniya where the hot water wells are situated belongs to the Mariamman Temple. Now, the Government Agent in Trincomalee has handed over the management of these hot wells to a Buddhist Temple.

Sir, I also request that those who were arrested under Emergency Regulations and detained in prisons, be released early.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I need only one more minute to speak regarding this incident. Hon. Prime Minister was speaking about the white flag incident. I tell him that Nadesan, Pulidewan and Nadesan's wife, who was a Sinhalese lady, surrendered with a white flag and they were shot dead. This is what Erik Solheim has said.

Thank you.
