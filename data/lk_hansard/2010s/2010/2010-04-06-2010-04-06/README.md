I quote: I have therein specifically expressed the opinion that all the Members of Parliament who were Members of Parliament at the date of dissolution should be summoned, It says at the date of dissolution. .

In the circumstances, the steps adopted in the second paragraph of your letter, is misconceived in law and therefore unwarranted. Accordingly, the swearing in of the persons referred to in the penultimate paragraph in your letter does not arise."

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Hon. Speaker, I am on the point that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris raised about the composition of Parliament. On this argument of the composition of Parliament, by operation of law, the Commissioner is bound to gazette names. Once the gazetting has taken place irrespective of the Member taking oath, he remains a Member of Parliament. It is only a procedural matter for the House. That is my argument. In any event, for him to come and conduct himself as an MP in the House, he has to, of course, take oath. But, despite that, you or nobody else has a right to take away his privilege of being a Member of Parliament. That is one issue. On the other, I would like to very clearly state this. In the event we take the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiriss argument that the composition of Parliament cannot be altered since there is this wording in Article 155 of the Constitution that Members who had been Members when the Parliament got dissolved should be resummoned, what if the Government wishes to bring in a Bill which the Supreme Court finds inconsistent with the Constitution and needs a two-thirds majority? Then, how do you determine that? Then, you would have deprived the Opposition of having the privilege of two or three Members who could have voted and prevented a two-thirds majority being gained. It will result in a serious travesty of justice and it will be a total violation of the Constitution if an interpretation of this nature is to be given. You must bear in mind that the issue of operation of law is what makes one a Member of Parliament and not the issue of taking oaths. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

I would submit with great respect that the answer to the point raised by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem is that that contingency cannot arise at all in a situation where Parliament is dissolved. It is not possible for the Government to come before the House to seek an amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, the need for a

83 84

two-thirds majority cannot arise. There is only one purpose for which Parliament can be summoned subsequent to the dissolution of the House. There is one purpose and one purpose only and that is the purpose envisaged by Article 155 (4). That is the only purpose. The situation envisaged by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem is fictitious; it cannot arise. It is a hypothetical situation for which there is no provision under the constitutional laws of Sri Lanka. Therefore, this Parliament is being convened for the sole and explicit purpose of extending the state of Emergency for a period of 30 days and it is abundantly clear in terms of the wording in the Constitution as well as its overall structure, that the Parliament which is summoned for that purpose has to be identical in composition with the Parliament that was dissolved by His Excellency the President.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , , . . , . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) , . Hon. Deputy Speaker, today we are debating the extension of state of Emergency, and I feel that debating the extension of state of emergency is futile if we are unable to enjoy our basic democratic rights at a time of elections. Having summoned this Parliament, the Government is seeking the necessary mandate to extend the state of Emergency. We have been asking very specifically from the Government to do away with the Emergency since the war has been militarily concluded. I heard the Hon. Prime Minister saying that he wishes that this may be the last time they are seeking to extend the state of Emergency. If we are unable to assume power, well, then you can continue. But, if we assume power, we have very clearly said, we will bring in legislation to ensure that no government can continue beyond six months with the state of Emergency and if you are to extend the state of Emergency beyond six months, a two-thirds majority of the House must be obtained. This we have very clearly said in our Manifesto. Hon. Deputy Speaker, the root causes that led to the war are still existing. The political solution is nowhere in sight. Now, we are in the midst of an election campaign. These very emergency powers are being invoked to stifle our democratic rights. Look at the situation in certain electorates. It is unprecedented in the annuls of the conduct of police, we see that some officers-in-charge have become cronies of certain Ministers and organizers of electorates; absolute cronyism is being practised. We have repeatedly seen reports and complaints pouring in regarding the situation in certain areas. It is not simply an issue of the officer in charge being partial towards the candidate, but the officer-in-charge himself being actively engaged in the campaign and is directly terrorizing the Opposition. This is happening in many electorates. Take for instance, the conduct of the Officer-in-Charge of the Nawalapitiya Police Station, a gentleman called Udaya Wickremasekera. I should not refer to him as a gentleman. He is a virtual thug, a virtual goon. What is happening there is something unprecedented. I must recommend that the Government must give him a double or triple promotion and make him either an Assistant Superintendent of Police or a Superintendent of Police immediately after the election because he, by your yardstick, deserves immediate promotions for the way in which he is conducting himself. It is despicable the way he has been conducting himself.

Some of my supporters were peacefully engaged in house-to-house canvassing in Nawalapitiya the day before yesterday. In the Soysa Kele and Mahakumbura areas, they had been mercilessly set upon by some thugs and goons belonging to the organizer of Nawalapitiya Electorate, Deputy Minister

[ .] [ .] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

I dare say that this Nawalapitiya Electorate has been totally fenced; none of us could enter. In fact, I am going there this evening to offer prayers in certain mosques because people are so petrified and terrified particularly because the OIC himself is terrorizing the people. This has happened. When my people were set upon by the goons, they had no option but to run away from there and then they took refuge in certain houses. Later, we had to call the emergency police and get them to go to the police station. When they went to the police station, the OIC scolded them and told them, How dare you come to Nawalapitiya? You have no duty here; you have no business here; you all must get out of this area. This area belongs to Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Mahindananda Aluthgamage alone. Nobody should step in here and I am telling you, this is his area and you have no right to come here and canvass for votes. This is what he has specifically told them and further told them that he will lock them up on a false charge. They are going to swear affidavits and I am going to file a Fundamental Rights Application before the Supreme Court. This gentleman has had the audacity to paste the posters of the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage on the vehicle in which my supporters were travelling. He himself has come and pasted the posters on the van in which my supporters were travelling.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) . ? . . There are similar incidents which have been previously reported. When my Colleagues, the Hon. Mano Ganesan and the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella attempted to campaign in the Nawalapitiya area, the same set of thugs came and set upon them. They tore their posters, chased them away and terrorized them. This was also on record and the press has reported it. But, we were unable to make any complaint at that police station or do anything because the OIC himself is behaving like a terrorist. He is openly campaigning for this organizer and has barricaded the entire electorate. He comes in his jeep and gives protection to the people who are paste posters on behalf of this organizer. This is what is happening. I would through you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, and through this House, like to make an appeal to the Elections Commissioner - I would be meeting him this afternoon at 1.00 oclock . That is, if the voters of Nawalapitiya are to exercise their vote peacefully and without any threat, the Elections Commissioner must request the IGP that the army be deployed in the Nawalapitiya Electorate. I am also making that request as a candidate in the Kandy District. We have no confidence in the police there. The army must be

deployed if the Government is to ensure a free and fair election in that Electorate. I dare say, this may be necessary for the entire Kandy Electorate, going by the conduct of certain people. Three days ago, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Defence Secretary, came to Akurana. When he came, the OIC of the Katugastota Police behaved in a manner which was so reprehensible. I had just opened one office, which was a very active office, where my supporters were conducting their election work. I had applied for the registration of that office with all due regard to the provisions of the Election Laws. I had given the application to the OIC of Katugastota Police three weeks ago. He kept on postponing giving us the ultimate letter, but we functioned in the office. But, the day Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa came to Akurana, the OIC came in and forcibly closed my office, tore my posters and my cutouts and threw them out. He did that in order to please the Defence Secretary. In Akurana, for every hundred yard, there is an office of the UPFA. But, mine was the only office which had flags depicting green and yellow colours, my Partys colours. The OIC did not want the Defence Secretary passing that way to see that office functioning there and that is why he forcibly closed my office. This is a very reprehensible act.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

Please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Therefore, I would appeal through you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, to the Commissioner of Elections to ensure that Army is deployed in the Nawalapitiya Electorate. Otherwise we will not have a free vote there.
