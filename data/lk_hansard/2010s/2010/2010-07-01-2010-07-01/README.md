[. . 10.20]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, the Acting Minister of Finance, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, as usual, is not present in the House today as well. - [Interruption.] That is a serious violation of the conventions of Parliament.

( ) (An Hon. Member) But, he is also the Deputy Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes. Indeed, there are several Deputy Ministers and none of them are present in the House today. I think perhaps the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama is not here today because he knows very well that what he read out that day was an excellent essay on the state of the economy and not the Budget. The Budget was totally devoid of revenue proposals; it did not contain all the traditional items; it went on to labour on different projections for the next three to six years and that was what was offered to us as the Budget for this year.

Having said that, Mr. Speaker, before I come to the main issues of the Budget, I would rather refer to a particular issue that has some connection to the Adjournment Debate yesterday, which was moved by the Hon. Sajith Premadasa : the issue of paddy prices and the predicament of the paddy farmers in the country. Paragraph 28 of the Budget Speech states, I quote :

391 392

Hon. Speaker, food security is a paramount development objective in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future". In this regard the government not only proposes to increase our rice production but also maintain adequate buffer stocks to ensure price stability during - off seasons. Hon. Speaker in the forthcoming "Maha" Season, we have planned to cultivate 750,500 hectares of land in comparison to 641,600 hectares cultivated in the previous "Maha" season. Out of this new space of almost 100,000 hectares of land, 40,000 hectares is expected to be cultivated in the North and East.

Sir, yesterday, in reply, the Hon. Johnston Fernando said that the Cabinet has already decided and sent out monies to the Government Agents in various districts to purchase paddy at the rate of Rs. 28 a kilo, the guaranteed price. Up to now - I checked up today from the Ampara District - farmers are unaware as to the availability of money for the purchase of paddy at the guaranteed price. The Government Agent of Ampara has not taken any steps to procure the necessary storage facilities nor has he nominated agents who would purchase paddy on behalf of the Government. All the stores are full of paddy. Normally, it has to be either the multi-purpose co-operative societies or the agriculture productivity committees. None of those people have so far been informed about this availability of money to purchase paddy at the guaranteed price. That is in a district which is producing almost a quarter of the countrys requirement of rice. In another two to three weeks, the Meda Kanna or the intermediate season's harvest is to take place. When that paddy also comes into the market, these prices are going to be further dipped. Now, as it is, it is about Rs. 18 to Rs. 20 a kilo in the market and the farmers are not selling their paddy. All their houses are stocked up with paddy. But, the Minister says, We have taken a decision. How would just Rs. 150 million, this meagre sum, suffice to buy paddy at the guaranteed price all over the country? The Minister, the Hon. Johnston Fernando, was poking fun at the Hon. Sajith Premadasa that his father had taken over all the paddy storage facilities for setting up garment factories and therefore, they are unable to store paddy. But then, for several years since 1989 up to now, successive Governments have not set up these storage facilities. At least now, having stated this in the "Mahinda Chintana" so pompously, no action has been taken to set up the necessary paddy storage facilities and having announced that you are going to purchase paddy at the rate of Rs. 28 per kilo, up to now none of the Government Agents at least in the Ampara District have been told about it.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Can you remember, in 2003 and 2004, we were able to store all the paddy when we had self-sufficiency? So, how can the Hon. Minister now say that they have no stores?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is exactly so. This is just an excuse to avoid purchase or not to purchase paddy from the farmers. For instance, in the case of the Ampara District, the issue is that the normal expenses of the farmer to cultivate an acre of paddy is more than that of the other areas because they use more fertilizer and more insecticides in order to increase the yield as those are quality rice producing areas. Therefore, the cost of production is higher and they are in a worse position. Unfortunately, with the Meda Kanna" harvest that is to come in another two to three weeks, the problem is going to be further compounded and the Government is yet to provide relief to the farmer. Having said that, I would also like to bring this to the notice, through you, Hon. Speaker, of the Hon. Minister in charge of environment. He was here this morning. The Hon. Faizal Cassim, Member of Parliament from the Ampara District, has brought it to my notice that this is a very serious matter.

Again, in paragraph 28 of the Budget Speech, you very pompously say, I quote:

"......we have planned to cultivate 750,500 hectares of land in comparison to 641,600 hectares cultivated in the previous 'Maha' season."

Then you go on to say, I quote:

"Out of this new space of almost 100,000 hectares of land, 40,000 hectares is expected to be cultivated in the North and East..."

Now, what is happening in the East? For instance, take this complaint by the Cultivator Society, Tharampalai Puthukkandam, Pottuvil. I would read out certain important portions of that letter, which is in Sinhala.

Mr. Speaker, the Budget this time, as I told you, was presented in a very non-traditional manner. It was a good essay on the state of economy of the country. But then, the traditional portions relating to the revenue proposals were missing. It was merely a projection of three to six years about what is envisaged to be done. Then, the cat was let out of the bag the very next day. A very strange news item appeared on page one of the "Financial Review" of "The Island" newspaper of 30th June, 2010. The Island" newspaper is supposed to be a very friendly newspaper to the Government. Sometimes the Hon. Kumara Welgama and Mr. Nimal Welgama may be summoned by the President about this news item when he returns, because they let the cat out of the bag. It states, I quote:

"IMF approves Sri Lankas 2010 Budget

What does it say? I quote:

Having seen the 2010 budget months in advance the IMF released US $ 407.8 million under the standby facility programme yesterday and released a statement approving the budget hours before it was presented to the Parliament for the first time. The IMF said if the budget was implemented Sri Lanka could significantly address past fiscal slippages".

Then, it further states:

"It released the following statement hours before the budget was read in parliament: Following the Executive Boards discussion on Sri Lanka.

So, the Executive Board had met just one day prior to the Budget being presented in the House. The standby facility for Serbia and Sri Lanka was discussed on the same day and passed without any hiccup. Finally, "The Island" newspaper - a very friendly newspaper to the Government - has let the cat out of the bag.

So, this is virtually prepared by the IMF, dictated by the IMF and had been presented and simply read by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Acting Minister of Finance and Planning who was sworn in just hours before he came and presented the Budget in the House. That was also to get over a difficulty. We were expecting the Hon. D.M. Jayaratne to present the Budget, but however, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama played his role; the usual role of being the cat's paw for the Minister, His Excellency the President. Of course, we expect him to come; all the Public servants are waiting for the President to come to the House, maybe at the end of this year and present the 2011 Budget because they are expecting salary increases. But, whether all that will materialize is to be seen although promises have been made.

Now, let me come to some of the main issues pertaining to the principles in the Budget. I was surprised that the Hon. DEW Gunasekara has said - I read it in the newspapers today - that the IMF is a lame duck institution. Now, this has become a hobby horse of the Government. You go to some institution begging for some assistance, and having got the assistance you call it a lame duck institution. You go and ask the European Union for GSP facilities and thereafter you call it by all sorts of names. I just had a cursory look at the front page of todays Daily Mirror". The main news item was about Ban Ki-moon and his decision to appoint the experts panel to advise him on the human rights situation of Sri Lanka during the civil war. Further below, you find the European Union refusing Sri Lankas charges relating to the GSP Plus concessions. So, newspapers are full of these issues, but then, I am constrained not to go into these areas. Todays The Island newspaper states that the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa has threatened to encircle the UN compound. It is a very serious issue. The UN compound is to be surrounded and we do not know what is going to happen to the UN employees. By this type of empty threats, this type of bravado being displayed, I

395 396

think - particularly a Minister of the Government in order to score brownie points in the South - you are putting the entire country into jeopardy. Where in the world do you make threats like this? All of us know and His Excellency the President may also know this. We saw certain things; suddenly a bevy of important VIPs were arriving in the country. Soon after the President visited New Delhi, Ms. Samantha Power, a Special Adviser to President Barack Obama came here. Then came the UN Under-Secretary-General. We also found Mr. Akashi coming on his 20th or 23rd visit to the country. [Interruption.] His 24th visit. God bless him! So, when Mr. Akashi came, we had a dinner together and he waxed eloquent about what is to be done and what are they going to do. So, it is quite clear for all of us that there is a pattern; that there is a method in this madness. But then, why are you going and putting the foot in the mouth, by going and trying to take on the UN and by trying to call European Union all sorts of names?

Now, what the good professor, the Hon. G.L. Peiris, Minister of Foreign Affairs said with regard to GSP Plus in 2007, is in Column 1014 of the Hansard of 10th October, 2007 during the presentation of the ICCPR Bill to the House.

He says this. I quote:

"Sir, there is one other matter that I would like to refer to. We have done what is right for the right reason. The right reason is to give the people of our country the benefit of these rights which are available to them in public international law. That alone is sufficient reason for the action taken by this Government to formulate and present this legislation.

But, I would like to refer also to a very considerable social benefit that accrues to the people of our country as a result of the legislation which is now under consideration in this House. I refer to the GSP Plus arrangements. These are concessions that we have had from the European Union during the period 2005 to 2008. The GSP Plus arrangements are absolutely vital for the economy of Sri Lanka. I would describe it as a lifeline of our economy."

This was on 10th October, 2007. He says, "I would describe it as a lifeline of our economy" - the GSP Plus. Now, what are they saying? They are calling the European Union by all sorts of names. They say, "Do not come and interfere in our sovereignty. Do not come and tell us to implement the Seventeenth Amendment. This is identical to the Opposition's demands. The EU and the Opposition are hand-in-hand."

Now, this is our great story. Having set up a committee to go and meet, senior Ministers were appointed - the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peris, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama and various others. They all went to Brussels, met people and hopefully the EU may consider this favourably. As I told you, there is a method in this madness. The international community is acting in a particular cohesive

fashion and I am sure well-meaning friends like India and others would assist you in trying to get what you should get. But then, you must get stop calling them names, in order to score brownie points in the South. You say one thing to your domestic electorates and you say something else to the international audience. . . [ ] . [ ]

This is a dichotomous situation in your diplomacy. This has to change. We are only offering you some constructive advice. That is about all. The Government has an unassailable majority, an almost two-thirds majority. And, then you have, at least, with the standby facility that has been promised by the IMF, if certain rules are followed, the health of the economy could improve. I am not saying, do not take it from the IMF. But then, having taken the money, do not start blaming the IMF, do not call it names. Yesterday, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara said that it is a lame duck institution; it can do nothing; it has money; it has no way to give that to others, so they are giving it to us. That is the manner in which you are now calling the IMF after having taken the loan.

How does the IMF operate? Let us not fool ourselves in looking at the structure of the IMF. It is an institution which has links with the UN. When it comes to UNs voting rights, each member has one vote. But, in the IMF, although it is a Bretton Woods Institution that was set up after World War II, the Americans and the Brits had a bigger say and they designed it in such a way that according to the size of the economy, you get your voting rights. The Americans have almost 16.7 per cent of the voting rights. EU Members like France, Britain and Italy have almost another 10 to 12 per cent or more. Japan has almost up to 5 per cent of the voting rights; China has about 3 per cent of the voting rights. That is how the structure of the IMF is. In order to have an important decision passed, you need to have 85 per cent of the votes being cast. So, virtually -

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa - Minister of Economic Development) We got it.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, you got it. That is what I am saying. ( )(The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Then what are you talking about?

397 398

[ ]

2010 01

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What I am saying is, then do not call it names. Some of your Ministers are calling it by names. They are calling it a "lame duck" institution. When it suits you, you do not say such things. The UN Under-Secretary-General came here and yesterday, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa wanted to encircle the UN compound and threaten the UN officials here. They have come to assist you, to get out of a problem. Though I was tempted to talk about this whole issue of Ban Ki-moons Advisory Panel and the GSP Plus at length, I am somewhat constrained because this Government will easily call us unpatriotic, if we start talking about those things. Patriotism and this are sometimes mixed up and then you call us all sorts of names. Patriotism, they say is the last refuge of the scoundrel. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What are you then? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am a patriot in my own right. Perhaps, my patriotism ends where your patriotism begins. But then, patriotism is a relative term. It is unpatriotic to come and discuss the issue of diplomacy in this country. You have to deal with the international community in a diplomatic fashion. What you do is, you put your foot in the mouth; you go with a begging bowl to the EU to get GSP Plus; you appoint Ministers; committees go to Brussels to have discussions and come here and then say, We do not want it. Of course the President a few days ago has said to an Indian newspaper, Well, we do not want it any more because we will find other means. He has said, "Soon after the tsunami we needed certain assistance. Now we may not need." That is a "sour grapes" story. Having tried and when you cannot progress, they have tied it up with good governance issues. Now, I am not going to go into good governance issues because there are various issues which we may have to discuss later on. Subject to that, let me just look at the main Budget Proposals and the implications that it entails. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Prime Minister, is that the view of the Government which the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa expresses? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Certainly not. Let us give them the benefit of the doubt. Certainly not. I am sure the Hon. Prime Minister is much more knowledgeable and -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What about the Leader of the Opposition? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) These are all people trying to score their brownie points in their own ways. But then, certain people have to be reined in. You know when some Ministers dance, the President calls them and say, Do not dance.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Devil dance! ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am not going to mention names because they are all Friends. In a wedding, if you have a dance and if you were caught in a camera, then you are in trouble. Here, you have a bigger dance before the UN compound. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) How do you dance? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) If you want, come home. I will show you how I dance. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) At what time do you dance? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let us not go into the question of dance because they are all our Colleagues. They have some enjoyment in their own way in a function. That is a different matter. I am not going to comment on that, but I am sure His Excellency the President will be livid if he hears that this has been done because this should not happen.

Now, the total revenue of the Central Government has been insufficient to meet even the recurrent expenditures of the Government for the past 20 years. It is not your own problem. For the past 20 years, the total revenue of the Central Government was insufficient to meet even the recurrent expenditures of the Government. Therefore, part of the recurrent expenditure and the entire capital expenditure of the Government is financed through domestic and foreign borrowings. Furthermore, the bulk

399 400

of the annual Government revenue goes for repayment of public debt. Therefore, it is high time the Government thinks out of the box to fix its fiscal problems by transforming the nature, content and extent of the fiscal architecture of the National Government, vis--vis the provinces.

I have a suggestion, just to say this, because this also might be confused with patriotism, but this is about devolution. This is about financial devolution. The National Government, in my opinion, should abdicate most of its functions to the provinces except monetary, currency, defence and foreign affairs. The National Governments primary function should be: regulation of the provincial councils under a united country such as imposing a cap on provincial budget deficit. This is taking place in India today. I was in Chennai two or three days ago.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Coimbatore. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, I was in Coimbatore in the famous Tamil Semmoli Conference. There, they are raising funds. Their tax base is wide, broadened and the State Governments are allowed to collect sufficient taxation to run their State without having to wait with a begging bowl and go to the Centre for anything and everything. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I have no time to listen to him, Mr. Speaker. Let him not disturb me.

The National Governments primary function should be: regulation of the provincial councils under a united country, such as imposing a cap on provincial budget deficit. Each province should impose and collect taxes except import duty, excise duty and VAT on imports. The National Governments revenue should primarily accrue from duties and taxes on international trade. Businesses within each province should register with their respective provincial council, and pay taxes both direct and indirect to their provincial government. Both public and private sector employees should pay income tax to their respective provincial government. At the same time, the national Government employees, such as the Central

Bank Staff, the three Armed Forces, and the employees of the Ministry of Finance should pay income tax to the Central Government. By providing fiscal autonomy to the provinces, the National Government could promote competition among the provinces to attract business and investment, both domestic and foreign. This is happening today in the State Governments of India. The National Government behaves like a nanny state providing grants based on certain criteria. This is what we have been observing for the last several years ever since the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord was implemented, the Thirteenth Amendment came into play. We have the Finance Commission, we have the criteria-based funds and all types of funds being doled out to the provinces; the provinces are starved of funds. What is happening? Because of this nanny state behaviour, present transfers from the Centre to the provinces are barely adequate to pay salaries, pensions, and to meet the recurrent expenditure of the provinces. On the contrary, provinces should be encouraged to earn and spend their own money. This is the easier method of managing the economy rather than to hang on to the Centre for everything and finally you achieve sweet nothing.

Now the Government very correctly having told the IMF that they will follow a certain pattern of collecting revenue, the Acting Minister of Finance and Planning read this out from page 82 of the Budget Speech. I quote:

"The total revenue is estimated at Rs. 817.8 billion consisting of Rs. 729 billion tax revenue and Rs. 88.8 billion non-tax revenue."

It goes on to state:

"Tax on Goods and Services is expected to generate Rs. 423.4 billion. This is nearly 60 per cent of the tax revenue. There is an increase of 17.8 per cent in the overall tax revenue...."

But, these are all projections. The Government considers that the projected increase is reasonable and you are going to collect all these taxes and then what will happen to our tax administration? When I was the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, we looked into the efficiency of tax collection in the country when we went into the massive fraud that took place in the Inland Revenue Department. It was an almost Rs. 3,900 million VAT fraud, and apart from the VAT fraud what we observed was interesting. That is, the tax arrears as a percentage of the collection during the year 2000 was 19 per cent which had increased to 62 per cent in the year 2006. According to the published statements of the Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Finance and Planning, we noted with great concern that a larger portion of taxes in arrears is bad and doubtful. By its very nature, there is no reason to have heavy accumulation of VAT in arrears as VAT is collected by third parties on behalf of the Government and remitted to the Inland Revenue Department within 20 days after the closure of the VAT period. All of us know that. Surprisingly, VAT in arrears had increased drastically

401 402

[ ]

2010 01

and amounted to Rs. 74.4 billion as at the end of the year 2006. As at 31.3. 2007, VAT in arrears was 51.6 per cent of the total tax in arrears and stands at Rs. 86.6 billion out of Rs. 167.7 billion. As per the Report of the Department of Inland Revenue, the VAT in arrears as at 31.12.2006 was Rs. 74.4 billion of which Rs. 60 billion is perceived as being bad and doubtful, leaving only Rs. 14.4 billion as being collectible. This is the state of efficiency of the Department of Inland Revenue in collecting taxes.

Now, of course, the Budget proposes certain things. Page 72 of the Budget Speech of 2010 states, I quote:

"His Excellency the President, having recognized the need for this transformation appointed a Presidential Commission on Taxation in 2009. The Commission which has given valuable insight into our tax system is expected to finalize its recommendations on tax policy, and tax administration before August this year.

It further proposes to do away with the operation of multiple taxes and move on to a simple, broad-based, low tax regime.

That is a very good thing; it proposes to introduce a four-band tariff structure. In Dubai, they have a single-band tariff structure. So, you can follow whatever system you want but then, the efficiency of the system will have to be improved if you expect to get all the taxes that have been collected into the kitties of the Treasury.

Mr. Speaker, but let me come to another issue pertaining to the loans that we have taken. There is an interesting article by Sirimal Abeyratne, Professor of Economics, University of Colombo in the "Economic Review" magazine of December 2009/January 2010.

There he states:

With the approval of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stand-By Arrangement in July 2009, Sri Lanka narrowly escaped from a serious macroeconomic crisis. The macroeconomic crisis emerged from two fronts, internally and externally. It was initially a home-grown problem due to worsening fiscal and external finance positions of the country for many years. Externally, the problem was aggravated by the global oil and food crises during 2007-2008 and the transmission of the adverse impact of the global financial crisis since the latter part of 2008.

So, all the problems cannot be heaped onto the Government. Some external shocks too created this difficult situation of the balance of payment crisis in the country. So all of us agree, but then, Professor Abeyratne further states:

The IMF Stand-By Arrangement was followed by an upsurge in capital inflows,

You talked about your foreign exchange reserves very pompously, that you have got almost up to US Dollars four billion. How did it happen?

He further states, I quote:

.largely as financial investments in government securities, including the United States Dollar (USD) - denominated development and sovereign bonds. The respite could be temporary and dangerous as the highly volatile capital inflows could also reverse suddenly dragging the balance of payments into the same problem. In this context, the main issue in question is whether the country has actually avoided its fundamental macroeconomic imbalances.

That is what has got to be borne in mind in attracting this type of fly-by-night investors who would come for attractive interest rates. Now, how did this accumulate?

He goes on to say, I quote:

As envisaged, the approval of the IMF Stand-By Agreement improved the investor confidence that had deteriorated prior to the mid -2009. First, it averted the possible and painful exchange rate depreciation that would have affected negatively the capital and interest gain of the foreign investments in government securities. Secondly, the conditions attached to the IMF assistance in relation to the fiscal policy, monetary policy, and balance of payments withered away the risk and uncertainty resulting from macroeconomic imbalances. Thirdly, the government securities and the USD-denominated international bonds offered lucrative capital and interest gains that are significantly higher than the international standards. Finally, the frequent downward revisions in the domestic interest rates further increased the capital gains of the foreign investments in USD-denominated bonds. The latest USD 500 million 5-year sovereign bond issue in September 2009, according to Press Release of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (October 16, 2009), was over-subscribed by more than 13 times.

These fly-by-night investors are coming because you are offering them very high interest rates. These have all got to be paid back at very high interest rates and therefore the monies have come. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, you have four more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, having said that, may I refer to this issue. I beg your pardon for saying this. When I was the Minister of Ports and Shipping, we were also keen to implement the Hambantota Project. But, then, we had this difficulty in going for funding. When we went, nobody was willing to fund because they did not see it as a very feasible project. With the heavy investment that was supposed to be made, they said, It was not that commercially viable.

I can understand His Excellency the President having a keen interest in developing Hambantota because his politics from 1970 has been from that land of his own and then he had a sentimental reason. And you, Mr. Speaker, have throughout been representing the Hambantota District which is one of the most poverty-stricken and backward areas in the country. Nobody has any problem about developing Hambantota, the Hambantota Port coming in and the Weerawila International Airport

403 404

coming in. None of us are objecting to it but then, at what cost is the issue. It was attempted during my time as the Minister of Ports and Shipping. We simply could not get that necessary level of concessionary financing because all the institutions before whom we went did not look at it as a commercially viable project. So, what is the issue here today? I am not faulting the President for having done the Project, but at what cost, is something that we have to bear in mind. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake raised this issue in Parliament and the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama avoided answering it. This issue came up during "Oral Questions" time, and the Question was asked as to what was the interest rate at which you borrowed these funds from China.

The Chinese have been very generous. Now, look at this. China funds US Dollars 306 million for the Hambantota Port Development Project at 6.3 per cent interest rate; US Dollars 65 million for the Bunkering Facility and Tank Farm Project at Hambantota at 6.5 per cent interest rate and for the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, under four sections, the loan component for every section has an interest rate of 6.3 per cent. Compare that with what Iran gave you for the Uma Oya Hydro Electric and Irrigation Project. Iran gave you for the Uma Oya Hydro Electric and Irrigation Project US Dollars 450 million at LIBOR parity rates, not a per cent more than LIBO Rates. Look at how the Saudis have given you. Saudi Arabia has given you Riyals 75 million from Saudi Fund for Arab Economic Development Project for the Epilepsy Hospital and Health Centres Project and Riyals 11 million for Development of Health Facilities in the Colombo Project as an additional loan at 2 per cent interest rate. The Chinese have given you loans at 6.3 per cent interest rate. Not only that, they have got an insurance premium guarantee fee also at 6 per cent interest rate. So, the Chinese are not giving you this money summa. This has to be paid. Now, look at it. The grace period for the Chinese loans is only four years. But, the grace period for Iranian loans for the Uma Oya Hydro Electric and Irrigation Project is 5.4 years. The repayment period for the Chinese loans including the grace period is about 11 to 12 years.

So, within this term of the President, this country will have to start repaying all these loans. Then, whether it is going to be commercially viable is an issue. Of course, ambitious plans are being made and roads are being developed. It is a pleasure to go to the South these days.

Now, an international cricket stadium is coming up and we are very happy about it. But then, how do we do the debt financing if it is going to be at such high interest rates? Even our administration could have done this at that time if we were able to borrow at this rate or maybe even at a lesser rate. But then, could it be serviced? What would happen to the Colombo Port? Now, what has happened to the Colombo South Harbour? You were

Minister of Ports and Shipping. The Colombo South Harbour Project is in limbo actually.

The Budget says the breakwater is proceeding as planned but for the terminals, the tenders have still not closed, I am sure. Once tenders were called and it was cancelled and now again the whole thing is in limbo. You have to develop the Colombo Port because developing the Hambantota Port will take time. It has to first be an industrial port and later it has to become a transhippment port. These are all going to take time and then, inevitably Hambantota Port will run at a massive loss for sometime. But,then, how do we manage this? That is the issue. Certainly, I am not at cross purposes about developing the South but then, the question of cost and the servicing of the debt is going to cause problems in the future. Having said that, I conclude my speech, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . , . 25 .

( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Sir, let me first spend a few minutes highlighting our recent economic challenges and achievements.

As the war drew to a close, Sri Lanka was in a very precarious position with foreign reserves as low as US Dollars one billion with donor nations holding back aid flows and the general conditions for exports also looking weak due to the world economic crisis. Sir, on the domestic front, the domestic consumption and internal trade was also seeing steep declines as the population was unsure of what the future held. As economic activity slowed during 2008 and 2009, so did Government revenues from tax collection. The consequent increase in the Budget deficit was slightly unnerving, to say the least.

Sir, today, a little over a year later, we look back and view May, 2009 as if it were a distant memory. All major towns in the country are enjoying brisk business. Traders are well stocked and business people are finally looking forward to years of profitable business. Consumers too are viewing their future with more confidence. I think many, including our Friends in the Opposition, expected the economy to go through a period of dire difficulty. Those negative expectations have not come to pass and the country has re-emerged stronger economically, better than we all expected. The peace dividend is already

evident in the newfound confidence of the investors, both local and foreign.

Sir, today, most industrialists regardless of their political beliefs, admit that Sri Lanka is now a much better destination to engage in business. The large Sri Lankan diaspora has begun to trickle back to take advantage of the economic opportunities that are about to unfold. All this has translated into renewed confidence that Sri Lanka will re-emerge as a country with accelerated economic growth. The early signs are promising. Foreign investors are investing reasonably and aggressively in Sri Lankan rupee and dollar denominated debt. As a consequence, our reserve position has crossed the US Dollars 5.5 billion line. Sir, from US Dollars one billion a year ago, it is now at US Dollars 5.5 billion, a little bit over. These, I believe are good challenges for a country like Sri Lanka to have. When most of the world is worried about serious declines in asset prices, we are today in an enviable position where we have to plan how to manage rapid economic development.

All this is possible because there was a decisive victory against the LTTE a little over a year ago. Sri Lanka, under the leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is forging closer economic ties with its Asian neighbours in economic, social, cultural and development spheres. Just as in the economic sphere, a degree of fearlessness and candour in articulating the national interest in the field of diplomatic relations and international affairs can only help to safeguard national sovereignty, protect our vital interests and raise the national profile on the global stage. Our own interactions, while acknowledging the concerns and interest of fellow members of the international community, must be respectful, but never be from a position of subservience and undue deference.

Sir, suddenly the challenges the Sri Lankan economy faces seem entirely different from a few years ago. Today, we are concerned about protecting our exporters from the Sri Lankan rupee strengthening too fast. Today, we are also faced with a situation where the policy makers have to be mindful about inflation because of the sudden upturn in consumer demand and increased investment activity. The towns in the North and the East that failed to attract visitors are suddenly facing fresh challenges of having to manage the domestic and foreign tourist demands. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of the North and the East and other planned infrastructure development in the country will put pressure on demand for construction materials and skilled and unskilled labour. With the amount of infrastructure projects planned, which will come on stream for which this Budget has made substantial allocations, we can expect to see a significant growth in the construction sector. We have to ensure that domestic construction costs do not escalate.

439 440

I look forward to supporting the national endeavour of developing Sri Lanka by ensuring that our agricultural sector is uplifted to compete in the international markets. Today, the single largest challenge faced by our agrarian sector is the high cost of production of most agricultural products. We are indeed lucky that most of our agri-products such as tea, coconut, and spices such as pepper and cinnamon fetch higher prices due to the distinctive flavour and aroma. However, in the long-term, we need to bring our cost of production lower especially in areas of rubber, coconut and tea. Sir, take for example, tea for which our cost of production is the highest in the world. But, still we get a premium over everyone else at the auctions because of the quality. But, it is imperative, if we are to survive, that the cost of production is brought down.

Sir, in a country where a one-third of the population is gainfully employed in agriculture, it is imperative that we build an internationally competitive agrarian sector. Whilst some of these objectives cannot be achieved in a short space of time, we must plan and work towards improving agricultural productivity. As sectors such as tourism grow and demand more workers at all levels, our agri-sector must be able to release workers whilst not reducing production. The failure to achieve this would result in even higher cost of production that would lead to uncompetitiveness of products in the international markets.

We will soon have an estimate of the extent of land available for agricultural use in the North and the East. We are in the process of doing that. For example, my Ministry has already written to the three GAs of Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi to find out the extent of land available so that we can embark on a fast track, a dynamic strategy of cultivating plantation crops in the North-East as well. Sri Lanka needs to decide whether we rely on our traditional crops or whether we move to growing new crops such as palm oil. My Ministry is giving leadership to increase the area under palm cultivation from 5,000 hectares which is the present position up to 25,000 hectares in the next few years. Experts are evaluating the ideal industrial structure and the ideal lands suited for this purpose. The Ministry of Plantation Industries is also looking at opportunities where another 100,000 hectares of coconut could be cultivated in land released in the North and the East. Today, we import a significant portion of our vegetable oil requirement. Nearly 50 per cent of it is being imported. I would like to see Sri Lanka achieving at least 50 per cent self-sufficiency in vegetable oil over the next decade. This would effectively mean a saving of millions of dollars for the country. However, I advocate a minimum long-term protection for the sector, as Sri Lanka needs to evolve as an efficient producer of palm oil.

Sir, the years we suffered with the war, we were content under successive governments to grow the State sector even though it may not have been the most efficient. It is imperative for the long-term well being of the country that we look to limit the size of the State sector in business and work harder at delivering State services more efficiently. Let us not forget that whilst peace may be new to Sri Lanka for the international consumer of Sri Lankan products and services, what ultimately matters is whether we are competitive in the international market.

So, whilst tourism may boom from the 480,000 tourists as at present to possibly 2,000,000 tourists in a few years time, the long-term success and growth of the sector would depend on the ability of a travel agent in Europe or Asia to sell Sri Lanka at a more attractive price than, say, compared to an Asian competitor country.

As such, it is important that all support services to tourism such as airlines, other transport services, hotels and tourist attractions be competitively priced. One country that has built a very successful tourism product based on efficiency, is Malaysia. Today, they enjoy tourist arrivals of over 10 million per annum. Sri Lanka too can expect to see tourism contribute as much as 6 to 8 per cent of GDP from the present 1 per cent of GDP, if we build our business on strong fundamentals. I have no hesitation in saying that under the able leadership of the Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, this can be made possible.

Sir, as I mentioned earlier, I believe this generation of Sri Lankans will live through possibly the most prosperous period the nation has experienced in the post-Independence period. However, in order to unleash the full potential of the country, we will have to invest in infrastructure, industry and services sector development. The investment of our present national savings of 24 per cent of GDP is hardly sufficient to realize our full potential. Long-term, it is not prudent to raise excessive amounts of debt at a national level. Whilst Sri Lanka has adequate debt servicing capability within the five-year horizon, I feel it is prudent to explore avenues of public private partnerships to build the long-term infrastructure requirements of the country.

So, Sri Lanka has a richly diverse social make-up. One of the challenges in achieving development and economic growth in a pluralistic society is ensuring that it is broad-based, inclusive and equitable. No segment of the national population should feel excluded and marginalized. This inevitably leads to disaffection, discord and instability. This is why President Mahinda Rajapaksa only recently pointed out the close correlation between development and peace. Speaking at the Business Forum organized jointly by the Indian and Sri Lankan Chambers of Commerce, the President said, I quote:

441 442

[ ]

2010 01

Today, we extend our hand of friendship and opportunity to all nationalities and communities, while we are well on our way to bring about a true re-conciliation within our communities and extensive economic empowerment among our people. We strongly believe that to bring permanent peace there must be development. As I have often said, there is no peace without development, and no development without peace.

This then encapsulates our vision, a vision for development with equity. As President Rajapaksa stressed in his recent comments about economic prospects for the future, our economic fundamentals are sound and our macroeconomic management helped us overcome the worst effects of the economic crisis. Now, with the advent of peace, we must strive to attract investment in the key sectors of our economy. Virtually, limitless opportunities have opened up in several areas in which Sri Lanka welcomes partnership.

Further, at the above Business Forum, His Excellency the President pointed out, I quote:

Those of you who are keen to explore, will find abundant opportunities for investment in Sri Lanka. The scope is immense: from infrastructure, to agri-business, to manufacturing and to a range of services. You will also find that our country offers a rare package of skills, capacity, and a willingness to learn and adapt. Our policy is vibrant, our package is enticing and exciting, and you would do well to join us in our forward march.

While we believe that the private sector is the primary engine and drive of growth, Public investment, as and when necessary, on a suitable scale is necessary to foster and supplement growth. We must at the same time nurture and safeguard local entrepreneurship and business. Although these initiatives in selected areas may be branded economic nationalism, we must, while encouraging stronger and more productive business ties with regional and global players, also strengthen our national economic base. It is only then that we will be able to overcome the inevitable vicissitudes and tribulations that face any developing nation state in the modern era.

In conclusion, I would like to commend His Excellency the President, who is also the Minister of Finance and Planning, for the excellent mini-Budget presented and also the Acting Minister of Finance and Planning and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, the Hon. Sarath Amunugama for his presentation yesterday.

Thank you very much. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara please. You have 30 minutes.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [. . 6.17]

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I am very happy to make my contribution on the First Budget of the Seventh Parliament. As I recall vividly, this

is my 10th speech during the Second Reading Debate of a Budget. I also vividly remember the fact that when I first made my contribution during the Second Reading Debate of the Budget in 2000, this country was facing an economic crisis of the magnitude that we have never before witnessed. On that occasion, the LTTE had attacked the port and the airport and there was an insurance surcharge on the country. Tourism had declined to a very minimal level. There was an economic decline and certainly, as far as the debt burden was concerned, it had gone up to 101 per cent in the year 2000. That is, when you are earning Rs. 100, you have to pay out Rs. 101.

Today we are facing a different situation after 10 years. The LTTE threat is no longer there. The war has ended, and as far as the macroeconomic stability is concerned, we are certainly facing better prospects for the future. Therefore, we can only look forward in optimism with regard to the economy and hope for the best. I would say that the bad years are behind us. As far as the economy is concerned, we can only look forward and hope for better times ahead, for our country.

Certainly, as far as the Budget is concerned, it is only an estimate of what can happen and it is an estimate of the amount of money that is allocated to various Ministries. It is not really an accurate reflection of exactly what will happen during this financial year. But, certainly as far as I know, and I am sure the UNP would also agree with me, that the figures of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka have been very accurate over the last 50 years. You cannot dispute that. When the UNP was in power for 17 years, and then during the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes time also, you went on the Central Bank figures and now we are certainly entitled to go by all those figures as well.

I would say that this Budget is a budget that is going to consolidate - I emphasize again, "consolidate" - the financial position of this country. We do not have to be popular. Certainly as far as the Government is concerned, after a massive mandate in the Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Elections, the Government does not have to take popular measures to consolidate itself. What we have to do now, is to take a long-term view of the economy and bring about meaningful measures that will consolidate the economy.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, ... .

, , ... . Whereupon THE HON ACHALA JAGODA left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) , . - - 6.2 7.1 . There has been an economic growth rate of 6.2 per cent in the last quarter of 2009 and it was 7.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Therefore, the economy looks upbeat; there are more investments coming in and as far as the interest rates are concerned, certainly they have come down. Therefore, the private sector has a better option of borrowing to invest in their own enterprises.

Sir, I would like to at this moment place before the House an assessment of our economy - I would say it is an impartial assessment - and this goes back to history as well and both parties should reflect what this assessment states. I downloaded this from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia in the internet. It states, I quote: "Economy of Sri Lanka

Since becoming independent from Britain in February 1948, the economy of the country has been affected by natural disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and a number of insurrections....."

This is very interesting. A foreigner who is looking at our economy highlights the fact as to how our economy has been affected.

It further states, I quote:

".. .such as the 1971, the 1987-89, and the 1983-2009 civil war. The parties which ruled the country after 1948 did not implement any national plan or policy on the economy, veering between left and right wing economic practices. The government during 1970-77 period applied pro-left economic policies and practices. Between 1977 and 1994 the country came under UNP rule and between 1994 and 2004 under SLFP rule. Both of these parties applied pro-right policies."

It is a common denominator that both parties accept the same economic policies.

It goes on to state: "In 2001, Sri Lanka faced bankruptcy, with debt reaching 101% of GDP. The impending currency crisis was averted after the country reached a hasty ceasefire agreement with the LTTE and brokered substantial foreign loans. After 2004 the UPFA government has concentrated on mass production of goods for domestic consumption such as rice, grain and other agricultural products."

So, you have an assessment of our economy from a foreign source that gives a macroeconomic outlook of what our economy has achieved and the potential it can achieve. Therefore, I would say that right at the moment the main challenge that our economy is facing is the debt burden. The total Government-sector debt is 85.6 per cent at the moment and it was 101 per cent in 2001. Therefore, the Government will have to take meaningful and conservative financial measures to bring down the debt burden. , 100 85 . 15 . , , 15 .

Sir, we are squeezing Rs. 315 billion from the local economy this year. This Rs. 315 billion can be pumped into other ventures. For example, the private-sector investments and the private sector would have more funds if this Rs. 315 billion was left and given to them. But, unfortunately, we have to squeeze Rs. 315 billion through Central Bank operations and give our Treasury Bills to fund our domestic debt burden.

Then, coming on to the macroeconomic stability, the State cannot afford to continue to finance a large public sector. I would propose that we have an independent and transparent manpower audit - audit . The results of such an audit would need to be made public and legislations introduced to ensure adherence to the findings of the audit. . . ? . 300 290 . ? , . . Therefore, I would say that one of the main ingredients, one of the great public policies that we have to adopt is to reduce the State expenditure by curtailing the personnel in the Public Service.

Then, Sir, I would also say that the future of Sri Lanka would depend on us developing our country as a hub, mainly a financial hub, a medical hub, and an educational hub. This we can do; we have taken measures now under the Hon. S.B. Dissanayakes leadership to invite foreign universities to come to Sri Lanka. So, this is a very innovative method. We must

535 536

persuade foreign universities, foreign education institutions to come to Sri Lanka. At the moment, we are spending large amounts of money on our children studying abroad. Therefore, if we can develop Sri Lanka as an education hub in this region, I think that would be a meaningful measure for not only students who come from overseas but our very own students will benefit from this. I know very well that there are foreign universities in countries like Singapore. For example, the INSEAD Management School is based in Singapore at the moment. It creates a great deal of value for your own country when you have foreign institutions of prestige operating there. And, of course, I would say that in the foreseeable future, the Sri Lankan Government, under the leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, will take every measure for fiscal consolidation and the countrys long-term future would depend on the conservative financial measures that would be taken.

Of course, there are issues in the economy. For example, we harp on the fact that the per capita income has gone up to US Dollars 2,050 now but, is this per capita income seeable and is it really felt in the rural areas? Obviously not. This is because the growth is centered in the Western Province and we, as policy makers, as legislators, should always remember the fact that the rural economy of Sri Lanka has not taken off. So, although the increase in per capita is a very good measure for ourselves, for policy makers to gloat about, the reality is different. In fact, in rural areas in Sri Lanka, the poverty rate is still 23 per cent which means that 23 per cent of our rural population are below the poverty line and certainly the Hon. R. Yogarajan - both of us represent the Nuwara Eliya District - would testify that in the estates, the percentage is much more high.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Sir, just give me one more minute.

I would also say that in terms of Foreign Direct Investment, we had a very bad year during 2008/2009. Certainly, the BOI has to be geared up now to attract a great deal of foreign investment from different categories and I hope the BOI can be restructured to meet these challenges. Also, I would say that the interest payments that our country is making is phenomenal. We have set apart an estimated Rs. 309 billion for this year, that is, 6.4 per cent of GDP, 44 per cent of Government revenue, for interest payments. Therefore, you can see that we have borrowed so much, it will take at least another five or six years for us to make these repayments and start

breathing normally. So, I would say that on this historical occasion, the Government and the Opposition should come together and put everybody's ideas together, to make us a prosperous nation and move our country forward in the right direction.

Thank you very much. [. . 6.32]

The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, in his speech this morning, stated that the Hambantota Port Development Project is not a feasible and commercially viable project. I would like to state that the reason for choosing Hambantota to build this port is not because it is the hometown of His Excellency the President, but purely because of its geographical location, and the fact that it is the hometown of His Excellency the President, is merely a coincidence.

Sri Lanka is situated along the key shipping route between the Malacca Straits and the Suez Canal which links Asia and Europe. There are about 250 to 325 vessels passing this Island a day, but only about 350 vessels call in at the Port of Colombo, for a month.

The first phase of the Hambantota Port Development Project will provide a gas-fired power plant project, a ship repair unit, a bunkering terminal and crew change facilities whereby we would be able to draw in a large number of ships and obtain the above-mentioned services.
