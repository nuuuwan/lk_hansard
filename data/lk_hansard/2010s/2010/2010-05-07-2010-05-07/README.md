Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be able to say a few words on the Vote of Condolence in respect of the demise of the Hon. Richard Pathirana who I knew well in this House. He was a very amiable person, a very helpful person and a person who, I think endeavoured to maintain a very cordial relationship with everybody in this House. One must watch the career of the Hon. Richard Pathirana to understand the ups and downs of politics in this country. If one looks back at the late 1970s, the 1980s and the early 1990s, one would observe that at that point of time the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, if I might use that expression, was in the dumps; struggling to survive, struggling to exist against a very, very powerful UNP Government which had been in power for a considerable length of time. I think the Hon. Richard Pathirana was one of the pioneers in that struggle against the Government of that day and in the efforts of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to recapture power in this country. The

409 410

late Hon. Richard Pathirana and the late Hon. Amarasiri Dodangoda were two Members who returned to this House and, I believe along with the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, they waged a relentless struggle to capture power in the Southern Province in early 1994, and I think it was the victory at the Southern Provincial Council Election which brought the SLFP back into power with Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga being successful in the Presidential Election conducted that year and a little before that in the Parliamentary Election. That, I think was the route through which the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ascended to power in this country. Mr. Speaker, I have not the slightest doubt that you would be aware of this history, and I must say that the Hon. Richard Pathirana made a very significant contribution in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party coming to power. I recall that in the 1994 Parliament, he was the Minister of Education and subsequently I believe, he was the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs and Administrative Reforms in a later Parliament. I remember he supported President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas proposals for constitutional reform to the hilt. He was very progressive in his thinking, very liberal in his views and he took the view very strongly that there must be substantial power-sharing in this country within the centre and the regions and that Legislative, Executive and Judicial power must be devolved, and that the regions must have control over vital areas such as law and order, land, education and other matters of socio-economic cultural importance to the regions concerned. He clearly took the view that the regions must be supreme in the areas of competence. As a matter of fact, I might even say that His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was in Government at that time, a Minister and subsequently the Prime Minister, was in total agreement with his views. He supported these positions. He never opposed these positions. Unfortunately, the inability of the two major parties to adopt a bipartisan approach and arrive at a consensus resulted in those proposals of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga not seeing the light of day. But, I must say very clearly, Mr. Speaker, that the Hon. Richard Pathirana was a person who very strongly supported those new constitutional arrangements and we did very strongly appreciate the role that he played at that point of time in taking those proposals forward. We look forward to other persons in Government at the present time playing such a constructive role to bring about permanent peace and harmony in this country. We find, Sir, that in recent times, there is much talk in the air about truth and reconciliation. In fact, I believe that there was an announcement yesterday, carried in the media today, that the Government proposes to appoint a commission comprising of eminent Sri Lankans to investigate some of the battles that have happened in this country recently, and make recommendations to find out the truth in regard to what happened and to make

recommendations in regard to what needs to be done to ensure that these things will not be repeated. I think, Sir, a person like the late Hon. Richard Pathirana would have made a very significant contribution if he was alive to dispose of the truth, the ascertainment of the truth and reconciliation. But, I think by and large, all the people in this country had immense respect for him and trusted him. I would say, Sir, that he would have also taken the view that the cornerstone of any such process would inevitably be the evolution of an acceptable political solution to the national question because that was the beginning of the conflict and unless one addresses the root causes of the conflict and comes to an acceptable solution in regard to that matter, I do not think there can be reconciliation in any meaningful way amongst the different peoples who inhabit this country. There must be restoration of the self-respect and dignity of the people. Those people must be given a sense of belonging and adequate access to governance as desired by them and not as imposed upon them, democratically within a framework of a united country. I think, Sir, a person like the late Hon. Richard Pathirana would have strongly supported and advocated the pursuit of such a policy to bring about effective and meaningful reconciliation amongst the different peoples in this country. Today, Sir, beyond truth and reconciliation, we see a number of things being bandied about: R2P, the responsibility of the international community to protect the people who are being tormented within their country, excessive human rights violations, the need for investigation into war crimes and so on and so forth. A number of things are being spoken about. We find a number of articles written in the newspapers where different views are being expressed by different people in regard to all these matters. I think all these questions can be addressed through this Commission of Inquiry. If this Commission of Inquiry conducts its functions in an independent and impartial way and if along with that, the truth is being ascertained, there will also be an effective political solution to the conflict in the country, which should bring all these matters to an end. I sincerely regret, Sir, that a person like the Hon. Richard Pathirana, who would have played a very useful role at this point of time, is not with us today, but I am sure, that those who are responsible to bring about such reconciliation and harmony would not fail in their duty and would ensure that his role is adequately fulfilled. I am happy to hear that the late Hon. Richard Pathiranas son has come to this Parliament as a Member. We wish him well. I would request, Sir, that we convey to the family, our deepest condolences on the demise of the Hon. Richard Pathirana and a copy of the Minutes of these Proceedings be sent by you, Mr. Speaker, to the family of the deceased Member. I thank you, Sir.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan)

Mr. Presiding Member, I stand up here today to pay my tribute and to honour a great son of Sri Lanka who served this country and its people without any bias. This tribute will go incomplete if I do not speak on behalf of the up-country Tamil people of this country who gained the most in their education during the period of late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana when he was the Minister of Education in the 1994 Government. I had the privilege of interacting with him when I was in this House from 1994 to 2000, when he was the Minister of Education. The Hon. (Dr.)Richard Pathirana was a politician who was loved by his people. I had the opportunity to visit his home during the Provincial

Council Elections to the Southern Provincial Council in 1999. At that time when I visited his house, I saw the way he spoke to the people who had come to meet him and the command that he had over his people. That type of command a politician can gain only if he is respected and honoured and treated like a paternal leader more than a leader who is doing politics alone. He was treated like a father and the way he used to command them, shout at them, was a visible show that those people loved him so much. So, a leader like him we have lost today. We all pay tribute to him not merely as a formality, but with deep feelings. I am glad that his son is here as a Member of this House to carry forward the work of that great leader. In 1994, the then Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Government decided that the plantation children should be given equal opportunities to proceed with their education. The ratio of teachers to students at that time was 1:60. There were schools that had only one teacher for the whole school and the school was more a daycare centre than a school itself. At that time, we wanted to appoint teachers. There was a batch of 1,250 teachers to be appointed to the plantation schools and it was done according to a special procedure unlike procedures followed in appointing teachers to other schools. This was confined to teachers or young people from the estate itself, and when we found that we did not have a sufficient number of applications to fill 1,250 vacancies with GCE (Advanced Level) qualified people, the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana decided that he would reduce the qualification and admit people with GCE (Ordinary Level) as teachers at that time. This was an exceptional case because he believed and accepted our representation that teachers coming from outside make it a means to find employment and they do not stay there and continue to serve the people of the plantations, but would move out. So, as a special measure, he decided that every teacher who is appointed under that scheme must be a teacher from the plantations itself and because we could not find sufficient numbers with GCE (Advanced Level) qualifications, he reduced the qualification to GCE (Ordinary Level) and he appointed those teachers. During his period as the Minsiter of Education up to 2000, he appointed as many as 4,000 teachers to plantation schools in three phases. This has given a great boost to education in the plantations. This was reflected in 2005 when applications were again called for appointment of teachers to plantation schools. We needed 3,179 teachers. We received more than 12,000 applications from persons with GCE (Advanced Level) qualifications. So, his appointment of teachers in 1996 made the difference and enhanced the quality of education in the plantations so that we had to choose 3,000 teachers from over 12,000 applications in 2005. This is a direct reflection of the great service he did to the plantation people and this should not go unmentioned. That is the reason why I stand up here today to honour that great man who did so much for us.

2010 07 431 432

As the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara stated, when he believed in something he did not allow the bureaucracy to stand in his way. He found a way to do the right thing; he found a way to do justice; he found it not by dubious means but being very straightforward and sticking to his principles. All mentioned about his voice. I think it was not just the loudness of his voice but the command in his voice that made him a colossus in this House. Not only in this House, I am told, even within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party he was able to demand, he was able to dictate because of the command he had and this command, I believe, he gained not by the voice that he had but due to the respect people gave him; due to the straightforwardness he displayed and the humility with which he worked. He respected all and he gained respect from all and as the Chief Government Whip he commanded the respect of all Members of the Government side as well as the Opposition because he was fair, he was straightforward and he was honourable. I am glad that I had the opportunity to interact with a great person like the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana. I have placed these few words; I have stated the few things that I could, in his honour here. There are many other incidents that we could speak of. I am sure any Minister of Education who follows the policies of the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana would be doing a great service to the education in this country and the greatest thing that he did was to serve the people without any bias, any difference of race, language or religion. He had contributed a lot to this country; to the politics of this country; to the education in this country and also to the people of the Galle District who loved and were enamoured by his actions and his service.

Paying these tributes, I feel he should be honoured in greater ways in future. Thank you, Sir.

Mr. Presiding Member, even though I do not wish to elaborate too much on what my father had done for the Galle District during his tenure as the Minister of Education and Higher Education, I wish to quote from the autobiography of Mr. M.D.D. Peiris, a veteran civil servant and the then Secretary to the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. He says, I quote:

The Minister was very active. He brooked no nonsense, nor excuses. It was mainly due to Minister Richard Pathirana that a considerable backlog in project performance that existed when he took over the Ministry was caught up. It was a great advantage to work with a performance-oriented Minister such as Mr. Pathirana. It relieved me of lot of pushing at my level.

He further goes on to explain how Sri Lanka received a lot of funding from different donor agencies during his tenure as Minister of Education in Sri Lanka. I quote: The 3rd and extremely important reason for obtaining this aid was that the country had a fearless, decisive and bold Minister of Education. He judged the funding on its merits, arrived at the conclusion that was most helpful to the country.

( ) (The Presiding Member)

As the son of the late Hon. Richard Pathirana, you have just concluded your speech. I may also express my personal sentiments and condolences because he had been so helpful, generally to the education sector in this country and particularly to Muslim education. I would like you to convey our condolences to your beloved mother and the family members.

I would also like to mention that it was only last evening, the All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference met and expressed their sentiments and appreciated the great service he had done to the education sector in the Galle District and elsewhere.

. orders . . 1866 07 - - . '''' . " 146." , . . . , ; . . . , . . ; . , . , . . . . Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana did immense service to the education of this country. After Dr. C.W.W. Kannangara, we recall the name of Alhaj (Dr.) Badiuddin Mahmud and Dr. Richard Pathirana. In between, there were several others like Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne, the Hon. Susil Premajayantha and other Ministers of Education. Dr. Pathirana saw no differences between man and man, one ethnic group with another ethnic group. He was a great friend of the Muslim community, I must tell you. Particularly, after the late Alhaj. (Dr.) Badiuddin Mahmud, he felt that this was a community that should be helped and they must also be given improved educational facilities in this country. We have an All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference founded by the great principal of Zahira College, Mr. S.L.M. Shafie Marikar. He founded this educational conference. We prepared a memorandum and asked for time to speak to him, and he readily agreed. I must place on record here that all the Ministers of Education in the Island gave time for the Muslim Educational Conference to discuss the problems of the Muslim education at various times except, perhaps one former Minister of Education. I am sorry to say, he was one time Minister of Education, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe.

So, yesterday it was our turn to pay tribute to this great man. When we speak about Malharsulhiya College in Galle, Arafa Central College in Weligama, Zahira College in Gintota and several other institutions, I must tell you that whatever facilities we wanted upgrading -

new buildings or anything else - he readily helped us. He brought about a new outlook and a change into the educational field of this country as far as the Muslims were concerned. Last night it was our turn. The All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference met to felicitate all the Muslim Members of Parliament. There, I took the opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the Muslim community, to the Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana. The Conference was well attended; there was a very impressive gathering, the cream of the society of educationists and others attended. It was very well organized by Mr. M.Y.A. Bawa, the Secretary, Moulavi Farook Ibrahim, Treasurer, Faizal Faleel, M.S. Hameed and other dedicated Members of the Conference. Whenever we went to Galle he warned us - " " .

,

.

, ,

''

. So when I was the Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, I visited Galle several times. Of course, we have been there for the last 50 years - half a century. There was a very good gentleman called N.M.M. Sally Hajiar. One day, he and his wife Sithy Sakeena entertained us for lunch. Suddenly the Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana walked in. We were then UNPers, he was an SLFPer and we never expected him to come like that, uninvited. He said , " , . , . ". Hon. Ramesh, when I relate this story here, it will evoke emotional sentiments in you, I know. You are a worthy son of a great father. As you recall, when I visited the Nawaloka Hospital when he was not well, he caught my hands and said - that is the time he introduced his son - ", , , " . And, today the Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana represents the great people of Galle, obtaining more than 95,000 votes coming second at the last General Election. So we are proud to say today that we had an Education Minister - and he adorned several other Ministries - who was a great democrat. He protected the rights and privileges of Members of this Parliament, irrespective of party divides. I remember the Akmeemana by-election; I went there to work for Mr. Albert Silva. It was a fiercely and closely contested by-election but held with dignity. There were several small incidents but, of course, the Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana saw to it that there were no major conflicts between Members and supporters of both parties. At that time I remember M.Z.M. Saharwadi, ...(S)

There was a question whether the Army Headquarters was aware of the fact that Parliament was sitting on, the 04th, 05th, 06th and 07th of May. I will table a letter to be included in Hansard, which indicates that the Army Commander has written a letter to me stating that Parliament will be sitting on the 04th and the 05th. My lawyers have informed the Army Commander that Parliament will be sitting on the 04th and the 05th of May, 2010.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, in the first instance, I take a broad objection; it is not that I want you to uphold this. But, according to Standing Orders, you cannot bring any Motion or Question before the House which contains any argument, inference, imputation, epithet or ironical expression.
