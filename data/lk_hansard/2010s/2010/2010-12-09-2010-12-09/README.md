( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, let me commence my speech by congratulating the new Minister of Higher Education, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake and his able Secretary, Dr. Nawarathne, under whose able guidance we are certain, we shall see the desired progress in the field of higher education. While we as Sri Lankans, proudly congratulate ourselves on our literacy rate and the level of basic education as compared with the statistics of other nations of the region and even as compared with other nations globally, there is no debate that when it boils down to higher education, we, as a nation, clearly fall short of what is acceptable.

It is a hard fact, Sir, that the system of university admission in Sri Lanka is designed to keep students out rather than allow all those who reached the minimum level of competency to qualify through the Z-score system. What becomes of these students? Well, if you are affluent enough, you end up in a foreign university and when you return to your homeland you end up, more often than not, speaking the Queens English or at least something not too far off from that, being computer literate, exposed to international customs, with broadened views and widened horizons. So, such a graduate finds himself so much more employable than his local counterpart and infinitely luckier than the lesser affluent ones, who qualified to enter the university but got routed by the Z-score system. I ask my friends in the JVP in particular, "Where is the social justice in that?" Golda Meir said, "To satisfy the hunger of the mind is no less urgent than to satisfy the hunger for bread". So, I urge them to rethink their stance in opposing the proposed private university system. If, however, the Opposition is based on the old ideology that education like most other things should be in the tightly clasped palms of the State, then I have to accept their unwillingness to change in the name of ideology, and even though I may believe their view is based on flawed reasoning, nevertheless, respect their view though thoroughly disagreeing with it.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Mr. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

... , [ ] .

, ... , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you can continue with your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Mr. Chairman, the same cannot be said of the UNP however, which party was founded on the principles which are fundamentally different and should, in actual fact, be espousing the cause of the private university. Instead, in typical characteristic fashion, ignoring national interest and the progress of our nation, they have taken the view that they must oppose anything and everything, whether it be the cause of private universities, the war against terrorism or even the Presidents visit to a foreign nation.

Moving to another factor regarding the students studying in foreign universities, it is a well-known fact that the cream of these graduates choose not to return, this being the main contributor to brain drain. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha in this connection are very much an exception to the norm. While the Government strongly supports the concept of free education as they have always done, they rightfully acknowledge that standards must be bettered, conditions ameliorated and more opportunities must be created. It is very conceivable that the private university system will be a source of revenue to the nation as well, and I think it is not too optimistic to expect, that on the one hand the number of students going to foreign universities shall decline, and on the other, that these will also attract alumni from regional nations that have a great many students completing higher education in distant lands in less familiar cultural backgrounds.

Sir, I was quite amused to listen to the Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam who placed before us the facts and figures pertaining to the number of students who go out of the country, the revenue loss to the country and also, he spoke of the brain drain. Can he not see that this is exactly what the proposed reforms are trying to remedy? The blatant inadequacies of our higher education system are obvious. Some who want to continue their education and have met the minimum eligibility criteria are struck off by the Z-score system. Not everyone has the

1917 1918

opportunity to educate themselves overseas and many graduates remain unemployed or at least underemployed.

From the daily advertisements in the newspapers we know only too well that there is no dearth of employment opportunities, but rather the quality of the graduates. Is he educated too narrowly? Are we neglecting to inform them of the tremendous advantage they would have had, had their competency in English or some internationally-spoken language been stronger? Do they know that in cosmopolitan societies as with multinational organizations, skills in management, problem-solving, communication, computer literacy and general knowledge are of reasonable significance? Ultimately, we must ask ourselves honestly, "Are the graduates that our academic institutions keep turning out, employable in the real world?" This is the question the Government is trying to address. If the answer to the question was in the affirmative, governments would not have found it necessary to artificially create opportunities for unemployed graduates, as can be evidenced in this Budget also.

The Victorian system of education that we inherited from the British was an elitist system, by the elite, and for the elite. It was still a wide education ranging from Latin to Art, to outdoor sports to etiquette, to geography. What we have done is, we have taken that model and removed its only endearing feature. That is, its diversity. So, now, we have a very narrowly educated or perhaps, if I may use the term, "miseducated" specimen that suffers from myopia, like the proverbial frog in the well, but does not know it. Britain itself, despite the fact that it has world renowned universities like Oxford and Cambridge, has moved on. They have traditional seats of learning but they have moved on. They have private universities in England; the University of Buckingham is one that comes to my mind. Apart from that, they transformed all their polytechnics into universities. This is done to keep pace with the greater needs and with the changing world. So, why do we not take a leaf out of their book? Why do we not want to progress? Do we simply look at the unemployable graduate and ignore him as if he does not exist? Do we ignore this inconvenient truth or do we dare to make a change? This Government dared to win what many perceived to be an unwinnable war. This Government dared to stand firm against the Opposition, within and without, in matters of national integrity. This Government dares to change Sri Lankas status as a Third World Economy. It aspires to give its citizens an education and thereby opportunities wider and higher than some Members in the Opposition have even scoped to comprehend.

I thank you for giving me this opportunity, Mr. Chairman.

I was also alone, so I sat next to him and started talking to him. He told me a very interesting story. He said he was an old boy of Royal College, and Major H.L. Reed, the Principal of Royal College at that time used to speak to them in Latin because he wanted the students to learn Latin. When they were brought to the Principals room for being naughty, he used to converse with them in Latin. So, I am not saying that we should do that. But, at least, the teachers must be able to speak to the students in English in order to create an English-speaking culture.

[. . 1.00] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Mr. Chairman, today, I stand to address the Governments misguided approach to Higher Education and the lack of importance given to it.

I noted that the Government's expenditure on Higher Education was less than 1 per cent of the GDP till 2010. At the same time, in comparison with other sectors, prioritization on primary and tertiary education is still inadequate. Lack of allocation, investment, prioritization, mismanagement and corruption has led to create gaps between the current education system and the job market. In this context, there is a question as to how we can move forward to a knowledge-based economy in future. As we know, countries such as the United States believes that human capital is now estimated to be at least three times more important than fiscal capital. According to the World Banks research with regard to Higher Education, they found that the developed world is reacting quickly with education as a major political priority. High quality human capital is developed in high quality educational systems with job-oriented education providing the advanced skills that command a premium in todays workplace. But, in Sri Lanka, still we do not have a proper national plan to develop the human capital or create investment opportunities in these sectors. Mr. Chairman, despite boasting an exceptionally high literacy rate, our system of education sadly leaves many fallen by the wayside along the path to university education. The inability of the system to educate our human resource to pass the basic of examinations at the G.C.E. Ordinary and Advanced Level, is appalling. The fact is that 48 per cent of the candidates who sat the G.C.E.(O/L) Examination in 2009 have failed and only 147,000 have qualified to study in the G.C.E. (A/L).

As the remaining students go forward to their Advanced Level Examinations aiming at tertiary education, they are faced with the harsh reality that only the cream of the cream can be accommodated in our under-funded and over-burdened university system. Other gifted and talented students who may have lost out by a few marks have few options left but and no acceptable alternatives are offered to them by the system.

In addition, an abiding flaw in the system is that the subject matter is not aligned to the needs of the students and the country to face the modern world. Year after year, we feed in and turn out graduates whose educational direction has little relevance to the requirements for job opportunities that are present in the market. The resultant frustration is evident in every reaction the students have and the facilitation of unemployment that naturally follows. We should not be surprised that graduates end up as security guards and other positions that have little use for the knowledge and skills they have acquired with

such difficulty. Yet, we continue to send them down a road which we know leads to a dead-end.

Whether we like it or not, we are now in a global marketplace with shrinking distances and fewer barriers for our young men and women to reach it. There is little room for a system that only encourages students to sit for hours and memorize a textbook so that they can just sit and write it at an exam. There is also no room for a system that has removed the joy of learning, and substitutes the time that was once kept for physical and mental development through sporting and extracurricular activities, with tuition classes. There is little room for a system where the noble profession of teaching has become an incentive to lower the standards in the classroom in order to drive students to contribute to the money-making empire of private tuition.

Our young people need the assistance of an education system that facilitates a culture of intuitive and innovative critical thinking; a system that will help them explore their abilities and understand their role in the changing world without the constraint of archaic paradigms. The age of nanotechnology is upon us, and though accepted by many including the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, Minister (Senior) for Scientific Affairs, the Government has failed to take concrete steps to provide for it.

Mr. Chairman, it is clear that we must revise the curricula followed in our university system first; they are to a large extent archaic and non-productive. They offer little insight and preparation for the real world these young men and women will face and take on as they leave these once-hallowed institutions of higher learning. Except in the field of Information Technology, the progressive updating of the curricular lag far behind, and we must correct this immediately.

We need to create alternative graduate programmes such as in the field of innovation, intellectual property and IT development where we can look to change outdated methods and systems and where such graduates can play an important and contributory role. If the Government wants to make Sri Lanka a human resource and talent capital, it is prudent to first conduct an audit of the skills necessary to achieve this vision. The Government should then aim to gear the education system to fill these skill and competency gaps.

We also need to broaden students horizons to the benefits study abroad can bring, both in bringing international students to Sri Lanka and facilitating the exposure of our students to universities abroad. Countries such as China, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea and India have moved forward as emerging nations because their priority was to invest in education. They sponsored many of their most talented students in their studies at better universities in the West hoping that they would then return home bringing with them a wealth of experience and knowledge, thus making them the

1941 1942

vanguard of the economic take-off and in the integration with the outside world.

Mr. Chairman, we must remember that all these countries were well behind us at one time. So, we need to look at this option seriously. But, it is with regret that I note that this Budgets allocation for Higher Education is only 1.95 per cent of the total expenditure, a paltry amount, considering the needs of our young people, our most valuable resource.

The lack of emphasis of the Government on science and technology, IT and innovation is a disgrace. At a time that we need to move forward and develop our young minds to be inventors and visionaries, the allocations have been reduced in real terms, making no allowance for the rapidly-increasing costs the Government has brought about.

With regard to the academics who are the teachers and motivators of these minds, I must make a point. That is, if we do not provide them with realistic remuneration, rewards and facilities to cover their basic needs, they will then turn elsewhere for such benefits leaving our universities and teaching institutions bereft of academia. At a time when we should be attracting our best and brightest academics to teach in our schools and universities, the Government has opted to rather spend those precious funds on lavish tamashas glorifying themselves when the nation is crying for its children to be taken care of.

Today, we are seeing a severe dearth of qualified academics taking up positions in our universities. Highly qualified Sri Lankan academics hold plum positions at prestigious universities abroad and our universities lose the immense benefits these academics could have brought had they returned home. Their choice of staying away, a result of the brain drain that has afflicted Sri Lanka for decades is not due to their lack of love for their country but due to the lack of incentive and research opportunities afforded to them in the Sri Lankan education system.

Sir, I ask the Government why they talk of BPOs and other grand plans but ignore the overall importance of our greatest natural resource, our countrys human capital that is needed to drive those plans? It is like building a racecourse when there are no horses to run. I am using this comparison so that my Colleagues on the other side of the House can understand, as they place a higher priority in gambling than developing our human assets.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) If the Government is sincere about its commitment to uplift this very important asset, where is that reflected in this Budget? It is clear that this Government has made ample provision for the possibility of money laundering for their rich cronies to get richer, yet, they show no concern for the future generations who are urgently in need of clear direction.

As a Member of Parliament and as a mother, it has now come to a stage that I am unable to bear the burden the cost of living has placed on my constituents, while the Government continues to offer empty platitudes without addressing the horrendous difficulties faced by our brothers and sisters who have elected us all to this Assembly.

Last week, such a voter spoke to me of her untold misery of worrying where the next meal is coming from for her family. Her mental state was near collapse as the pressure was too much to bear. Her husband, a Government employee, anticipated with confidence that the Government would deliver at least the salary increase that was promised. With no real increase to cope with the mammoth prices, she was desperate. As a mother, I feel her pain and all of us who sit here need to face the truth of what we, the Sri Lankans, are going through day after day. Yet money seems to be available for junkets and empty celebrations when such celebrations need to be about the people and not the leaders.

The Government has put on the blinkers to this very pressing issue and has focused on grand development plans. While we need to progress, we cannot leave behind our people who are mentally depressed to suicidal extremes. As we all know, real corruption takes place in large-scale projects where the international wheeler-dealers are involved and the benefits of corruption can easily be moved to the pockets overseas that want more and more.

The citizens of this country are not fully aware of the dangers of the endless loans this Government has obtained from willing lenders with vested interests. If the man in the street was to realize that all of the earnings of the Government - I mean, "all" - per month is not enough to pay the loan installment for that month, they would realize that the fiscal policies of the Government would take them down to a precipice and they would be right. This means that all this development and every other expense such as salaries and welfare measures is on

additional borrowings.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over.

1943 1944

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Please give me two minutes, Sir. ( ) (The Chairman) Can the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran give two minutes?

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran) Yes, Sir. ( ) (The Chairman) Okay, I will take two minutes off from your time. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) This method of how the Government wants to go forward is a cruel joke on every citizen of Sri Lanka. Every housewife knows that if she needs to pay a moneylender more every month, more than the total income of the family, it is surely a road to disaster. However, does this worry the Government? No, not at all. The debt burden they have taken on will suck the blood of generations to come and even then, we cannot be sure it will save them from this unmitigated disaster.

In such an environment, the Government is like "Nero fiddling as our country burns". With such an attitude towards the very people who elected them, it is not surprising that higher education and development of our human asset are given lower priority against the pandering to an evergrowing Cabinet.

So, if the Government is serious about developing our human resources and making Sri Lanka a talent capital, we need to do the following. I mean, all universities must be geared to cater to the requirements of the private sector and produce graduates who are equipped to do so. All the tertiary level institutions must be put under one authority and they need to deliver programmes that the private sector and the investors that we are trying to woo want.

The Institute of Personnel Management needs to be strengthened to upskill the public sector and the administration service capability. The ineffective Skills Development Fund must be put under a competent person and run like a private sector institution. We must improve governance in the country to ensure our skilled people remain in the country without migrating to other countries and create an environment for those abroad to return. Good governance would play a large role in convincing them as opposed to the whimsical and arbitrary style of rule that we see today.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have taken the additional two minutes also.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) I am finishing, Sir. All money allocated for training purposes in this Budget should be used to upskill our human capital after a proper skills audit. Since we do not have sufficient skills for this in the Public sector, we need to engage the private sector too. All professional institutions and other private sector institutions delivering education programmes need to be monitored and regulated to prevent Sri Lankan students being exploited.

Finally, we need to force the private sector, like in Singapore, to spend at least 2 per cent of their turnover to further improve their human resources. If we do not take these steps, Mr. Chairman, we have no chance at all to attract any substantial BPOs to set up operations and the private sector will not have the skilled human resources to grow and expand. The result would be that our talented young men and women will continue to languish in the villages with little hope or opportunity.

Thank you.

, , short-term, medium-term, long-term plans . What are the long-term, medium-term and short-term plans of the Ministry of Agriculture for the development of our country's crops? You also have to think of not only of paddy, but seeds, fruits and various other sectors or the specialized research stations we have created. Have the directors given you a goal for those sectors? You are not experienced in those sectors; your Minister post is temporary.

But, that is not the case in India. They have transformed their vision into a mission. They have their short-term, medium-term and long-term plans. Whatever government comes into power or whoever becomes the minister, the policy is there.

This is an agricultural country based on irrigation. Nature has created a paradise for us. Where is that plan? You ask your own officers. Ask them to submit a plan for short-term crops, Hon. Minister. When I was the District Minister, I forced them to open a research institute in Narammala under the first integrated World Bank project. We had one in Matale. But, the climatic conditions of Matale did not suit that of our area. So, the then Minister Dharmadasa Banda came and opened that.

We have to think of a plan first and then what our vision should be and how that vision could be made into

1967 1968

a mission. Research is very important. Let them do a 10-year research. It is okay. Support them with funds, technology and all that. But, whoever becomes the Minister, he must stick to the plan. The officers should know that they would be blamed. I also blame them in a way. Why? They should know as professionals and experts in that field, how to guide, prepare and inform the Ministers of the respective Governments, saying, Sir, this is our plan for the countrys future. You ask them, What is your plan? You will get no reply.

The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake and I, as Minister of Irrigation and Water Management, drew up a plan. Within a period of two years, we were self-sufficient in paddy. We started it in the Mahaweli and other areas. Now, you are the Minister in charge. "One Area-One Product" programme is one way to start it. You can create zones according to the climatic changes during the 12 months. You can grow anything in this country. It is a paradise that Nature has given us. Within those 12 months, see what you can grow in Kalpitya in the North-Western Province. You can grow onions and other crops. In the Mahaweli and other irrigation-based areas, even after taking the harvest of paddy, they sow mung and in three months, they get an income also. Likewise, this has to be inter-linked. The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake and I did that and we were the first to bring about self-sufficiency in paddy. But, yet, you could not do it even with peace.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Chairman, I am happy to follow my Friend, Minister Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. He was so close to me. He was so close to my late leader, the Hon. Kumar Ponnambalam. The Hon. Kumar Ponnambalam, my Friend, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress got together and prepared a manifesto known as "DPA Manifesto". I think that Manifesto might solve the present ethnic question. - [Interruption.] I will come to that.

Mr. V. Kumaraswamy who was a Member for Chavakachcheri in 1952 said that he would bring Mahaweli water to Jaffna. Then, another Member of Parliament told him, How are you going to bring water, is it in your pocket? But, he said, No, I will bring it. So, I am requesting my learned Friend, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, to see that Mahaweli water is taken to Jaffna as early as possible because the Iranamadu Tank has got only about 30 feet of water. That water is only sufficient for the people in the Vanni and no water can be taken from Iranamadu Tank to Jaffna unless you bring water from Mahaweli.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) With the improving of bunds, the capacity will be increased. ) (The Deputy Chairman) The farmers are saying that that is not enough. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) What I am trying to say is, as far as the Tamil families in Jaffna are concerned, several people are living on lands where they do not get potable water. People are going away from several villages because they are unable to get water. They will have to walk about two or three miles to bring potable water.

Another matter that I want to remind my honourable Friend, the Minister, is that there are several ponds. Since they have to harvest with the rain water, we have to rehabilitate and repair them. I also request my learned Friend to give a sewerage system for the Jaffna Town. I hope you will do all these things.

Now, I will come to the subject of Land and Land Development. I think the Minister is also a very good Gentleman. Land and Land Development is a devolved

subject. But, I think the Government is still clinging on to that. What is happening now? In Jaffna, the Army is occupying about 4,000 houses . When are they going to leave and return the houses to the owners?

Sir, I understand from the newspapers that the Chinese Government is going to build 100,000 houses in the North for army personnel. In Sampur about 6,000 people have been chased away. If the subject of Land is given to the provincial councils, such things would not have occurred. I also understand that some people of the majority community try to live in Jaffna and other areas to bring about a demographic pattern in the society. As far as we are concerned, we do not oppose or object to any Sinhalese gentleman coming to Jaffna or to the East or buying or leasing a property and living there. We have no objection to that. But, what we do object to is the Government- sponsored colonization, which can affect the demographic pattern of the society.

I also want to state about the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No, 7 of 1979. It gives wide powers to the divisional secretaries and according to the section amended, if he or she is of the opinion that a particular land is a State land, the matter is over. He or she can give a notice as per Section 3 of the Act and then go to court as per Section 5 of the Act and get the man evicted. He or she cannot be questioned on that. That needs amendment.

In the Trincomalee area, there are several people who have been occupying lands for more than 30 to 40 years. A particular case in question is that of one Ms. Nesaratnam Vairamuththu who has been living there from 1970 onwards. What has happened is, the Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture had issued Circular No.10 dated 1st June, 1995 directing that Land Kachcheries be held and any encroachment made before that date be regularized, if the encroachers still continue to be there. To implement this Circular, the Land Commissioner of Trincomalee appointed a land task force -

- and had a Land Kachcheri in 1995. They recommended the issuance of permits to about 50 or 60 people.One Gnananandam from the Divisional Secretary's Division in Trincomalee and one Balasundaram who was a member of that Land Kachcheri recommended the issuance of permits for 30 people. One of them was one Ms. Nesaratnam Vairamuththu whose father and fathers brother have been occupying a land there for more than 40 to 50 years. The recommendation to issue permits had been given to Divisional Secretary, Trincomalee and to the Land Commissioner, Trincomalee. The Land Commissioner says that they have lost that file. The Divisional Secretary instead of issuing a permit to Ms. Nesaratnam, filed a case in the Magistrates Court as per Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act and now the Magistrate has ordered that she be evicted. Now, she is to go before the Court of Appeal to get a writ against the Divisional

1977 1978

Secretary. So, this particular State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is being misused by the Divisional Secretaries. Their opinion cannot be questioned by anybody. At this juncture, I would like to a refer to an opinion given by the Supreme Court in the Senanayake Vs. Damunupola case in 1982.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, you have only one more minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Okay. The then Chief Justice Sharvananda, Justice Ratwatte and Justice Victor Perera had this to say: The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act was not meant to obtain possession of land which the State had lost possession of by encroachment or ouster, for a considerable period of time by ejecting a person in such possession. Section 3 should not be used by a competent authority to eject a person who has been found by him to be in possession of a land where there is doubt whether the State had title or where the possessor relies on a long period of possession.

I request the Hon. Minister to give a directive to the Divisional Secretary to implement the decision of the Land Kachcheri held in 1995 and see that that recommendation is implemented and Ms. Nesaratnam Vairamuththu be given a permit. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. S.M. Chandrasena. Before that, the Hon. Shantha Bandara will take the Chair.
