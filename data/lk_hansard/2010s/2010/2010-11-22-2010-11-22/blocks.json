When introducing it to the people, I reminded that in my first term of office I won them the peace that they were yearning for. I also assured my deepest commitment to fulfil their future aspirations. I was elected with a majority of 1.84 million votes. This was a stronger mandate than the majority of 180,786 votes that I received at the 2005 Presidential Election. At the subsequent Parliamentary Elections, the United People's Freedom Alliance led by me won 144 seats out of the 225-Member Parliament.

Above all, I inherited a large budget deficit that had prevailed even much longer than the LTTE terrorism. There was no fiscal space. Funds required even to protect the sovereign State from terrorists were not available. Neo-liberal policies had taken deep roots. Hence home grown solutions, local competencies and capabilities were considered inferior. The sale of State assets, pruning capital spending and subsidies to the poor, granting lucrative tax amenities et cetera were regular policy prescriptions.

We all know that the brave men and women in our security forces paved way for this journey forward. Many of our soldiers lost their lives. Some were injured and disabled. It is our duty to look after their long-term welfare. Therefore, Hon. Speaker, I propose at the very outset to allocate Rs. 3,000 million over a period of 3 years to address economic difficulties of service men and women who have suffered as well as their families.

We expanded public investments in building roads and bridges islandwide. The construction of Moragahakanda, Uma Oya and Deduru Oya irrigation schemes together with the rehabilitation of 32 major irrigation systems and reservoirs have been undertaken. Government expenditure has also been diverted to expand the availability of drinking water at both national and community level to ensure that people will have access to quality drinking water. Investments in education and health to modernize school facilities and universities as well as hospital facilities have also been our priority.

Let me focus on the import and export of goods and services which was about US Dollars 21 billion or about 50 per cent of GDP in 2009. The export-import economy is strategic for our growth. A remarkable progress has been achieved in diversifying export products and their markets. However, most exports of tea, garments, leather, rubber, gem and jewellery products, several valuable spices as well as many raw materials are without sufficient value addition. Our manufactured products can be promoted through branding and better marketing efforts. The export potential of value added, branded exports has been estimated in excess of US Dollars 5 billion over the medium term. We still rely heavily on the importation of pharmaceuticals, wheat flour, food grains and energy sources. Space for import substitution in these areas is well in excess of US Dollars 2 billion.",

Exports of finished goods will only be free from such CESS. Second, I propose to reduce duties and taxes on machinery, equipment and raw material to enable our enterprises to have affordable access to world class technology.

In the past, all what successive governments have done in this regard, is offering costly tax concessions, cheap labour and our valuable assets free of charge. A skilled labour force, political stability, a low tax regime and efficient government institutions to facilitate investment must be the basis of our investment promotion strategy. Therefore, the Board of Investment - BOI - will be required to focus on three-core activities. First, is to manage Export Processing Zones efficiently. Investment will be attracted to fill vacant positions in all 12 zones. Second, to concentrate on promoting quality investment from abroad. Such investment must add value to our economy. They must be environment-friendly and socially responsible. Large investment will be promoted under the strategic investment law and income tax laws. I propose to revise BOI Regulations to offer its incentives to carefully targeted priority sectors. Third, is to devote time for monitoring and follow-up. Further, despite having been approved, since many BOI investments are non-performing, I propose to cancel forthwith, all BOI approvals granted before 30th June, 2010, if such investment has not commenced or has remained closed as of today.

Since a large area of land under plantation companies remains unutilized, I propose to give a six month's notice period for such companies to put unused lands into productive use. If plantation companies do not comply with this deadline, such unutilized lands will be distributed among smallholders for re-plantation.

A further 1,500 graduates will be recruited as Management Trainees to State Banks and other financial institutions in order to introduce younger staff. The Ministry of Defence has brought to my notice that 1,500 nurses are needed for its hospitals. These recruitments will absorb graduates and other qualified youth who are seeking employment.",

As such, wage increases are not easy. However, Public servants deserve some relief without compromising development priorities. We cannot forget the exemplary manner in which they managed the Tsunami and liberated people from terrorists while also carrying out their routine responsibilities. We need to prompt Public servants to work harder and serve the people. Their concerns must be recognized and resolved to motivate them. Many Public servants have lost increments due to prevailing anomalies. Certain provincial teachers are yet to receive payments for a previous anomaly correction. Associated anomalies of teachers should be corrected through the new Service Minute.",

Therefore, the basic deficit in our Budget is around Rs. 54 billion. As our major investments in infrastructure, human resources, rural development and social security will be over this deficit, the Budget deficit will amount to Rs. 434 billion which is 6.8 per cent of GDP in 2011. Our medium-term objective is to eliminate our basic deficit and move towards a budget deficit of around 5 per cent of GDP. The Fiscal Management Report 2011 provides relevant details. Hon. Speaker, neo-liberal ideologists must understand that this deficit is not to bail out failed bankrupt companies. This deficit involves provisions for free services, social security and development expenditure.",
