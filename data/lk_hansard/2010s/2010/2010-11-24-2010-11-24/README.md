"That the Bill be now read a Second time".- [His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa] Question again proposed. [. . 9.59] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in this Budget Debate.

From the Budget we find that Rs. 214 billion has been allocated for Defence for the year 2011, which is Rs. 13 billion more than the amount allocated for this year.

This year Rs. 201 billion was allocated and the allocation for 2009 for the Defence Ministry was Rs. 177 billion; Rs. 75 billion has been allocated for the Ministry of Economic Development; Rs. 62 billion for the Ministry of Health and Rs. 31 billion has been allocated for the Ministry of Education. I do not know why the Defence allocation has been increased to such an amount. Now, the war is over and there is peace, such a big amount should not have been allocated for Defence when we are working towards reconciliation.

The real problem the people are facing now is the cost of living. We find no meaningful steps or proposals have been included in the Budget to bring down the cost of living. Almost everyone is affected by the cost of living. Consumers are hard-hit in the stomach. Putting together a simple inexpensive rice and curry meal these days has become a huge strain on the family budget. Duty on imported foodstuff has been increased.

It has been usual for the prices of products to be increased only in the Budget. But, now the Budget has nothing to do with the increase in prices. Almost a year and a half after the war had ended, Sri Lankan consumers still remain in the red every month. Their incomes do not

commensurate the level of expenditure every month given the high cost of living.

The Department of Census and Statistics states that since 2001 to date, the peoples purchasing power has declined by 60 per cent due to the rising cost of living and low level of income. According to the Department of Census and Statistics , the value of the market basket for September was Rs. 39,721.62. The market basket includes the values of essential foods and services required by a family for a month. When the market basket amounts to Rs. 39,721.62, the minimum wage of a Public sector employee stands at just Rs. 16,980 per month, a private sector employee at Rs. 6,750 and an estate worker earns Rs. 290 per day. In 2006, the same market basket was valued at Rs. 24,344. Therefore, the value of the market basket has increased by Rs. 14,377.62 between 2006 and September 2010. Meanwhile, the Central Bank Annual Report for 2009 states that a Sri Lankans medium monthly income is Rs. 17,109.00. These statistics issued by the State are a clear indication of the financial burden faced by the Sri Lankan masses due to the high cost of living.

Then, look at Public Enterprises. Why should the Government not run enterprises? All governments in the last 25 years have in many forms tried their hand in running economic enterprises. Overall, it has been a terrible experience. The general thinking worldwide nowadays is that the Government should not run commercial enterprises, no matter whether they are profit-making or not, and the Government should only limit its involvement to simply running public utilities. We all know that it is not the Governments job to run business. It should act as a regulator and facilitator. Over the years, successive governments have dumped hundreds of millions of rupees just to prop up loss-making state-run corporations at the expense of the taxpayer. The COPE reports are full of such stories.

Governments usually fail in business as politicians because it is not business executives who run the Governments.

It is the Governments job to make and enforce the rules that allow a society to flourish. But, it has a dismal record of regulating itself. Therefore, we all know that capitalism is not perfect. Indeed, to paraphrase Winston Churchills famous description of democracy, it is the worst economic system except for all the others. But, the inescapable fact is that often it is only the profit motive and healthy competition that help to keep enterprises lean, efficient, innovative, encourage meritocracies, become and remain customer-oriented.

Now, I will cite some alarming situations. Take the five big loss makers, which were once categorized as the "biggest monsters" by a Minister of Finance, plus the Sri Lankan Airlines, which have made operating losses

399 400

2010 24

amounting to Rs. 49 billion in 2009. The detailed distribution is alarming : Postal - Rs. 2.4 billion; CEB - Rs. 7.4 billion; CPC - Rs. 12.3 billion; Railways - Rs. 4.8 billion; SLTB including the Government subsidy - Rs. 9.3 billion and Sri Lankan Airlines Rs. 12.2 billion. In addition, Mihin Air - I do not know who started the Mihin Air - the Governments famous budget airline, has made an operating loss of Rs. 930 million in 2009; on top of its previous losses amounting to Rs. 3 billion already absorbed by the Government.

There is nothing new about public enterprises in Sri Lanka, making losses and getting away with such losses with total impunity. In fact, they have been continuously in loss and those losses have been funded by the public through subsidies. For instance, the two transport enterprises, Railways and SLTB have made operating losses year after year since the year 2000, amassing cumulative losses of Rs. 31.3 billion and Rs. 30.3 billion respectively up to 2009. If a private company had run them, they would have been bankrupt by now and forced out of circulation. However, all these enterprises have been able to continue their business because the taxpayers have funded the subsidies given by the Government and paid the interest on the loans raised very often from the two State banks, on the strength of Government guarantees. I understand that the Government has taken over the Shell Company as well. So, it can continue to incur more losses.

Now, Hon. Speaker, regarding the High Security Zones in the North, I understand that the GA Jaffna has told the German delegation which visited Jaffna recently that there are no high security zones in the North. She should get the facts correct before she opens her mouth. Will the Defence Minister enlighten me and this House as regards the areas which have been brought under high security zones and the date on which they were brought under high security zones in the North? Have declarations which made parts of the North as high security zones been approved by Parliament? There is no legal basis for any concept of high security zones in the North now.

Valigamam North area which is about 30 per cent of the North is under the Army occupation and is said to be under a high security zone. In Valigamam North, there are 48 Grama Sevaka Divisions and 28 Grama Sevaka Divisions are said to be under the so-called High Security Zone and nobody is allowed to go and resettle there. Only 12 Grama Sevaka Divisions are fully occupied and five Grama Sevaka Divisions are partly occupied. The Palaly Airport, Teachers Training College, Palaly, Myliddy Fishing Harbour, Chest Hospital Myliddy, KKS Harbour, Cement Factory at Kankesanthurai, Keerimalai Naguleswaram Temple, Maviddapuram Kandasamy Temple, District Hospital, Tellippallai, Cancer Hospital, Tellippallai, Union College, Tellippallai and Mahajana College, Tellippallai are said to be in the so-called High Security Zone. Valigamam North, Mandaitivu from

Jaffna to Columbuthurai, Karampaham, Eluthumatuval North and South, Nagar Kovil and Maravanpulo are said to be situated in the so-called High Security Zones. About 100,000 internally displaced persons in Valigamam North and about 100,000 internally displaced persons in Thenmaradchchi are not allowed to go and resettle in their own lands due to the so-called concept of high security zone. Refusing a person to go and resettle in his own land is a breach of his fundamental right.

Then, at Mandaitivu, about one kilometre from the main road is blocked and Ward numbers 1-5 have been declared as High Security Zones. The Navy officers continue to live in about 75 houses in the so-called High Security Zone. About 1,500 families were displaced from Mandaitivu. They are returning from Vanni and refugees who have returned so far are living in refugees camps in public buildings in Ward No. 6 and 7. They are living under wretched conditions. Let those people who were displaced from Mandaitivu be allowed to be resettled there as early as possible.

As far as the Army and demilitarization are concerned, during the war there were about 100,000 army personnel stationed in the North. They still continue to be there. I understand from a newspaper that the Chinese Government wants to build houses for the families of the army personnel in the North. Sri Lanka is the most militarized country in Asia. What the Tamils want now is normalization and demilitarization. The army in Jaffna can go back to the 1990 position and allow all the people to resettle in the Valigamam North area.

Then, with regard to the Health sector in the country, several persons are in the waiting list for heart surgeries to be done at the Colombo National Hospital. I understand from some doctors that they can increase the number of heart surgeries if more beds are provided in the Intensive Care Unit of the Cardiology Unit. I want the Minister to do something about this.

Further, Sir, with regard to the the Prisons, I must state that the prisons are overcrowded. For example, the capacity of the Colombo Remand Prison is only about 145, but there are about 550 remandees detained there. The Hon. Minister of Prisons and Rehabilitation seems to be doing some good work. He intends building more prisons in the far-off places to ease the congestion. But, I understand the Treasury has refused to release any funds for the Capital Expenditure next year.

The Government is unable to start any major development work to generate employment facilities as it has no funds. The debt the Government incurred so far has reached such an extent that the revenue we get is sufficient only to service the debt and pay the salaries. Somebody has calculated that the amount each one of us has to pay is Rs. 150,000 to settle the debts. The Government should try to get foreign countries to make investments in Sri Lanka and not try to get more loans at high rates of interest.

401 402

I would now like to speak about cutting down wasteful expenditure. The Government does not need 98 Ministers to run this Government. Twenty Ministers are quite sufficient to run the Government. In Japan, when there are about 790 Members of Parliament, there is only a 20-Member Cabinet.

The Government has spent millions of money for tamashas. A film festival was held and several millions of money was wasted on that. When the President went to the UN Assembly, I understand that 37 people had accompanied him. What is the necessity for that? The Government should cut down unnecessary expenses as far as possible.

I would also like to mention in this House that about 350 Sinhalese families who went to Jaffna were staying at the Jaffna Railway Station. I understand that they have now gone to Navatkuli and are putting up sheds there. The Hon. Douglas Devananda, a Minister in the Cabinet seems to have made inquiries about these people and it was revealed that they were not living in Jaffna earlier. Some mischievous groups have sent these people to Jaffna to create problems there. If they were really living in Jaffna earlier and they had been chased away, then they should be resettled there. But, that is not the case here. Some Muslims had been chased away and we are ready to resettle all the Muslims who had been chased away in the places where they were staying earlier.

Now, I would like to say something about this Parliament. I think no proper feasibility study was done before building this Parliament in this low-lying marshy area. If it rains heavily, I fear that half the Parliament might go under water.

Finally, Sir, I want the Government to do away with the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Regulations. I also want the Government to give amnesty to all the Tamil prisoners in remand prisons and release them.

Thank you, Sir.

GSP Plus . Eighty five per cent of the foreign exchange is earned from the European countries. The "Daily Mirror" of 17th November, 2010 states: "Apparel Exports Dwindling".

This has been stated by the Sri Lanka Garment Buying Officers' Association. Foreign exchange has gone down drastically. Factories will be closed. Thousands of people will be unemployed. We criticize the Europeans and the Americans. We cannot sell our products to China. China is self-sufficient. India and China can do mass-scale productions. Eighty five to 90 per cent of our market products go to the European and the Western countries. I am talking not only about garments but of all other products. So, since time is a problem, I am tabling* the figures which show how it has gone down.

90bn Irish bailout ends in turmoil - now Europe fears crisis will spread

They are fearing that the crisis will not only spread in Britain where British Banks have lent to companies in Ireland, but also that the crisis will spread to Spain and Portugal and become a wider European crisis. But, it is not just a European crisis. We are in a globalized world in a globalized economy. The European Central Banks President Jean-Claude Trichet has said that, Global finance and the global economy is extremely fragile. This is not a European crisis - it is a repercussion on Europe. It is at a time in which we have heard that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is liberalizing the Sri Lankan economy. , , . The capital account is being liberalized. I think we need to remember two things at this moment. It is about the timing in the global economy. Is this the appropriate time in which should we be opening our economy to the global economy when there is a crisis developing? The second thing that we need to remember is that our reserves are primarily being built on borrowings rather than the growth of the real sector of the economy and therefore, I would like to highlight that. . . . . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is a cogent argument. But then, even under the Constitution there is no provision for State Ministers; such Ministers were created earlier. The President has the power to create any such Minister and call him by whatever designation he may assign to him.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, I am not saying that His Excellency the President has no power or authority to appoint such Ministers because the entire executive powers are vested in the hands of the President. We are not challenging it. But, what I say is, just because you appoint some Ministers as Senior Ministers, we cannot recognize them as Senior Ministers because there is no legal provision either in the Constitution or in any other statute for such a post. That is why I told you you that we will not be able to recognize them as Senior Ministers. , , . . . , , .

Sir, we did everything with utmost confidence and also with a bona fide intention. We never had any enemies in this Parliament. I will never treat anybody in this Parliament as an enemy. That is, they are only representing opposing political parties. But, when you become a Member of Parliament, especially when you become a Member of an oversight committee, it is an obligation, it is a divine duty that is cast upon you that you will have to act apolitically irrespective of the political affiliation or favouritism; that you will have to act independently. That is what we did. We did nothing wrong.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your long innings must end within another one minute.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) I am sorry. There is the time allotted for the Opposition Whip. I have been asked to take that time.

( ) (The Presiding Member) But, your Whip is not here. You are the last speaker from the Opposition and they have consumed all the time allotted to them.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Then, with respect, Mr. Presiding Member, please give me five more minutes. I will wind up. I will take only five minutes more.
