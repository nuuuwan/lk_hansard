Hon. Minister, thank you for being very clear and concise in giving the Answer. My first supplementary question is, when it comes to the Hambantota Port Project, if you take the feasibility report that has been put forward for the Port development activities, how long would it take to ensure a payback on that particular project for which Chinese aid has been given?

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

I cannot give you the details straightaway. I will check on that and provide an answer. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, the second supplementary question is, what is the interest factor on these loans amounting to US Dollars 3,500 million that have been given to this country? You informed that there has been US Dollars 35 million as grants, well and good. Altogether US Dollars 3,500 million has been given. So, what is the interest rate, above LIBOR, on the loans that have been given by the Exim Bank and the Government of China?

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Let me say that the assistance for the Puttalam Project comes under Preferential Buyer's Credit Loan. The Railway loans were given as Concessional Loans. The assistance for the Hambantota Port Development Project is on a Buyer's Credit Loan. The financing of the

35 36

[ ]

Hambantota International Airport and assistance for the Diesel Multiple Units are on Concessional Loans. I can tell you that these are some of the most favourable terms we have got. I can also tell you what the details are but please believe me, they are the most favourable concessional loans that we have negotiated.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, I know you are specific. But, why do you not give the interest rate? Because, for example, for the first phase of the Coal Power Project in Puttalam, you are getting US Dollars 300 million at almost 9 per cent. So, there is no concession in the loan that is being given.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

In your Question, Hon. Member, you had not asked for the details of the nature of the interest. But, I have no need to hide that. If you ask another question, I will be more than happy to answer it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Would it be possible, with the intervention of the Hon. Speaker, for you to submit this information? I know that you might not be able to give that spot on.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] .

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

If you ask a question on those lines, we will be happy to answer that because I do not want to be vague on that. I can give you the exact details. Please ask a separate question on that. - [Interruption.] No, you had not asked for that. You had asked "whether it is under loan, grant or joint venture" and the financing sources.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes, the financing sources and the related cost. So, the cost means the interest rate.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Yes. But, if you ask a specific question, I can give you an answer.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Come-on! Hon. Minister, you are a very experienced, veteran former Finance Minister. When I say the related cost, it is the financial cost. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

You ask another Question; I will give you all the details.

He was in USA and was making the same type of comments that he makes in conversations and discussions here. He said that nobody is above the law when the US State Department officers questioned him about my position. I would like to remind him that nobody is below the law also. We are all in line with the law. The law is there to look after our interests. We are there to respect the law. These type of fancy stories and comments that are made abroad are not going to do any good or justice to the country. I do not know whether the Minister of External Affairs has much

75 76

experience in practising the law. But, I think he set a bad example when he went out talking about the law and order of the country. How can he maintain law and order in the country when there is a pathetic situation in the Attorney-Generals Department? The Attorney-General is supposed to be the adviser to the Government. His job is to look after the interests of the people of the country, but not the interests of the Government to ensure that the people are penalized. The situation is very pathetic. He is under pressure. The poor man, he had a very bad patch in his life too. We were all praying for him at that time. We thought that the God will look after him. Now, he is not looking after himself. A lot of people left the Army; rendered jobless because of his action and advice. They were sent out. They were put in jail. Their families were rendered without fathers. The children did not have parents at home. This was all due to the wrong advice and wrong thinking of the Attorney-General. The Department of the Attorney-General will have to take serious concern about what is happening and be responsible and genuine when they are advising the Government. If the Government tries to take the Attorney-Generals Department under them and use it like a puppet, it is not going to serve any purpose for the betterment of the country. When I spoke at length last time, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage made some serious imputations and inferences. I think I have the right to vindicate myself about those imputations and inferences. He mentioned about the suicide attack on me. There were children at the balcony listening. They telephoned us, a couple of days after. He said that the suicide attack on me was made by a girlfriend of mine. If I had a girlfriend with that type of courage and guts and who had been really in love with me, I could be very proud. But, everybody in this country knows - the investigation reports are there, the CID reports are there - how the suicide killer came to the Army Headquarters, who brought the suicide killer, what the motive was and who was the handler. Even a child in this country knows that. It is very unfortunate that the Members on the other side do not know what is happening in the country. They are talking nonsense and have no common sense. I think that position has to be rectified. This Hon. Member of Parliament again said that the five officers who left the Army did so because they wanted to save their wives from the then Army Commander. That is a disgrace on the Army. That Hon. Member of Parliament insulted the Army by saying that. There are no -[Interruption.] You go through Standing Order 84 (viii). The Hon. Member of Parliament went on to say that the officers left in order to save their wives. But, the officers in the Army are not cowards. The officers trust their wives and have confidence in them. You do not have to leave the Army to save your wives. If anybody tries that type of a thing in the Army, he will be taught a good lesson in the Army by

the officers and the men. This Hon. Member of Parliament was trying to insult the Army; he was trying to downgrade the Army; he was trying to compare the officers and the men with his activities. He must be in a position like that. But ,the officers do not go through agonies as such. ...... He also said that I was not in the country when Prabhakaran was killed. It is very unfortunate that the Government does not know the time, place and the date Prabhakaran died. Prabharakan died on the 19th of May 2009 and the final battle started on the 17th. This Deputy Minister did not know when the final battle was started and when Prabhakaran was killed. Although some people came to the airport and started kissing the tarmac, Prabhakaran was killed only on the 19th. We won the war on the 19th. Just because they do not know what was going on, that is not our problem. They thought that in the previous week or between the 11th and 17th of May I was out of the country. The Members of Parliament thought the war was being fought for only one week, but as far as I am concerned, the war was being fought for two years and nine months. The war was being fought altogether. ( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) . . , 84(vii) . " ." . . . . [ ] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Member is clarifying the matter. ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) I was trying to vindicate myself. I was referring to a point which was mentioned about me. That was my position. The same Member was talking about the USA PATRIOT Law last time. If people do not know anything, they must not talk. The USA PATRIOT law is not like the emergency regulations here. The PATRIOT law in USA is compared with the PTA in Sri Lanka. The USA PATRIOT Law was activated in 2001. It has temporary clauses; it has permanent clauses. Temporary clauses were activated again in 2005 and the whole law was reduced with the powers again renewed in 2006. The

USA PATRIOT Law is not something like the Emergency Law. I am sure that the Secretary, Defence would have advised him to come and talk about it. But, he was given the wrong impression. Sir, I was talking about his behaviour. I know his behaviour. Freedom of speech in Parliament is to ensure the effective discharge of the collective functions. Freedom of speech is not given to talk about others and disturb others. So, please ensure that the freedom of speech is maintained in relation to the requirement of Parliament, to maintain the collective functions. He was also talking about the coups; he was talking about the officers who were kept in custody because there were coups. Then, I should have also been charged for the coup. Without charging me for a coup, how can you charge the other officers and put them in jail for the coups? The biggest coup took place in this country during the Presidential Election. These maps were prepared at the Security Council. The Defence Minister was there; the Secretary, Defence was there; the ex-Prime Minister was there. According to this map, I was to be arrested on the night of the Election day; the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was to be arrested on the night of the Election day if the rigging was a failure. If they failed in rigging, we were to be arrested and this was confirmed by the ex-Prime Minister when he gave an interview. During the interview, when the Prime Minister was asked that if General Sarath Fonseka won the Election whether he would have been arrested, the Prime Minister had said, Yes. The Army could have still come and arrested him. The coups were not planned by the others. We have evidence. These have come from the Army Headquarters with authenticity. The ex-Prime Minister would have been there at that meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Member must withdraw these words; he has to withdraw them. That is his own thinking. But, he cannot say in this House that the Presidential Election was rigged. Sir, please see that these words are taken out of the Hansard. You cannot make statements which are still subject to - [Interruption.] We cannot allow him to make that statement. You can make any other statements but do not make statements like this. ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) The Hon. Prime Minister was there. He was a strong character. But later on, the Prime Minister said that if the victor is the correct victor, he must be magnanimous enough. If somebody is not magnanimous enough, he is not the victor. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . -

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) . . . ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) He said that the loser has to be humble. If somebody is not humble, he does not have to be the loser. If he is not humble, he is not the loser. The victor has to be magnanimous but the victor of the Presidential Election has never been magnanimous. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This matter is sub judice. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) How can we have law and order in this country when there is a crazy Defence Secretary? The Secretary, Defence thinks that the law belongs to him. The Secretary, Defence is going around saying that he will frame charges against me; he will hang me; he will frame 17 charges against me; he will give me five-years imprisonment. How can the Secretary, Defence talk like that? This is evident from the Defence Secretary's behaviour. You cannot talk about hanging Members of Parliament. The Secretary, Defence has become the latest hangman in this country now. We have found the butcher who is in the Government payroll, the latest hangman and he is going to hang the Members of Parliament. Take action against him and take the Secretary, Defence to task. The Secretary, Defence is the only Secretary in this country who is privileged to go on the political stages. He is a disgrace to his predecessors also. He must not try to take the law into his hand. Why do you not correct that Secretary; why do you try to cover him up? ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) ? . ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) However much you shout, you will not be given a Ministerial portfolio. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! I order to expunge anything that is inconsistent with the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) The Secretary Defence has said that we have a disciplined Army now. What is the disciplined army he is talking about? He has got hold of some timid fellows, some cowardly fellows and he is getting them to do illegal things. He is getting them to arrest people; he is getting them to go and threaten people. All the good people who fought the war, the senior officers, the officers who were strong and the officers who brought the credit to the country have been sent out of the Army. The Secretary, Ministry of Defence is basically messing about with the army. He has got hold of weak people and he had the same habit when he was in the army also. - [Interruption.] The Secretary, Defence thinks that the army belongs to him and his hallmark has been messing around with the army. When he was in the army also he did the same thing. As a junior officer he messed around with the army. He got assaulted by the soldiers. He is the only officer who had moved on to four regiments in the army; he had gone from regiment to regiment when he was getting hammered. The bane of the Rajapaksa regime is the Secretary, Defence messing around with the military. - [Interruption.] The hallmark of the Rajapaksa regime has been messing around with the military. - [Interruption.] The Secretary, Defence has another weakness. He believes all what the female journalists say. If Frederica Jansz says something, that is gospel truth for him. I was arrested on a statement given by a journalist and we are yet to see real justice being done. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have only three more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) There is a General in the Army who was conniving with the terrorists in Colombo: Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe. He was not taken to task; the Secretary, Defence is protecting him. What has he done to General Mahinda Hathurusinghe? Why did they not take action against the Hon. Member of Parliament, the [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] - [Interruption.] He was moving a suicide cadre during the time when I was the Army Commander. We have the telephone conversation details of the Member of the Parliament, the [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

What has the Government done about them? No action has been taken; justice has not been done. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please sit down.

( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) Finally, Nature also rejected that the Rajapaksa regime has anything to do with the war victory; Nature rejected it totally. The war victory celebrations were cancelled. Nature is with us; Nature has agreed that there is no justice in the country. For the first time in the history of the Army, a soldier on parade was struck by lightning and the parade had to be cancelled. - [Interruption.] So, Nature is also refusing that any credit of the war victory should go to the Rajapaksa regime. That is the pathetic situation. Finally, Sir, please ensure that there is discipline not only inside the Army, but also in and outside Parliament. When the Members go outside, they make various speeches. - [Interruption.] The person who is shouting here went on Government TV and said that I have raped 32 women. - [Interruption.] What right does he have to go on Government TV, Government media and blame another Member of Parliament to say that he had raped 32 women? - [Interruption.] He is getting those ideas. Only kudu mudalalis get those ideas. - [Interruption.] I do not know from where he is getting those ideas. - [Interruption.] It is a very pathetic situation. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. Your time is over. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) Sir, I thank you very much. Please ensure there is discipline here; discipline in the country and law and order in the country. I thank you, Hon. Members on this side, for the good conduct. - [Interruption.] Sit down. Thank you very much. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, please. ( () ) (The Hon.

The next Speaker is the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. You have 20 minutes. [. . 12.07] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , . . . . , . . .

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, exactly one year ago with the defeat of the LTTE, a new window of opportunity opened for our long-suffering country. It gave us a chance to move forward along with the rest of the world to become a prosperous, democratic country, united in its ethnic diversity. As I said before, Hon. General Sarath Fonseka, - I mentioned it before too - I still harbour certain reservations about the way in which this war was conducted. But, the defeat of one of the most brutal and ruthless killer machines the world has ever

produced, the LTTE, gave Sri Lanka a wonderful opportunity to win the peace and harness the economic and social prosperity which have remained illusive for the last 62 years since Independence. As you know - I am not going to talk about history because time is limited - the scourge of nationalist politics, I am talking from 1948, every time one of our leaders tried to address the genuine grievances of the Tamil people, the ugly head of the scourge of nationalist politics raised its head and as a result the LTTE finally as an extremist killer group was born, representing the alienated Tamil community. Because of that we even lost the chance of becoming the "Switzerland of the East". That is what the "London Times" had stated Sri Lanka will become on the day we achieved Independence. Of course, during the 62 years you know many of the countries moved forward, especially our neighbourhood. India surged forward becoming one of the most prosperous countries. But, we, Sri Lankans in Sri Lanka who had the best opportunities more so than any of our neighbours, were stuck in the quagmire of hypocrisy, intolerance and political opportunitism. As a result, however much you shout or we shout from this side, we have to admit the sad bitter truth today is that Sri Lanka after 62 years of Independence, you or us or all of us governing this country, is on the verge of being a failed State. Unlike the very optimistic slogan that you had for the last Presidential Election - "From the Third World to the First World" - the reality is that we are on the verge of becoming a failed State. But, that victory which General Sarath Fonseka and the Armed Forces and the Police achieved for this country gave us a wonderful opportunity. But now, one year later, we have to ask ourselves, "We have defeated the LTTE, but have we won the peace?" Have we won the peace, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees? Thanks to the Armed Forces we defeated the LTTE but now it is our turn to win the peace. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Under whose leadership? Why do you not say that? -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The leadership was given by all leaders since 1989, especially by Her Excellency (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, but that is another story. I can prove all my points. -[Interruption.] Now, Sir, the Armed Forces defeated the LTTE and did their duty but now winning the peace is the duty of the politicians and not of the Armed Forces. They have done their duty. Now, it is our duty as politicians and as responsible people to ensure that we win the peace. But, unfortunately, Sir, are we trying to

87 88

win the peace? Instead of trying to win the peace, I was shocked and horrified to read a newspaper today where the Secretary of Defence has stated about hanging the very person who led the Armed Forces under his Ministry. They are not trying to win the peace. They are actually conspiring against those who gave leadership to the victory. But, what is even more distressing, Sir, is that instead of using this golden opportunity to win the hearts and the minds of the Tamil people - that is what I am talking about - the first prerequisite for a durable and lasting peace is to win the hearts and the minds of the Tamil people. But, we have not attempted to do so at all. -[Interruption.] The unashamedly and chauvinistic and triumphant attitude of the Government has made the Tamils, especially of the North and the East, feel like a subjugated race, dependent on the magnanimity and generosity of the Central Government. While the final stages of the war was raging on, I am sure you know, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, hundreds of thousands of innocent Tamils were incarcerated in camps which were not very different from the camps of the Third Reich in the 1930s in Germany. The only crime many of those Tamil people, the innocent civilians had committed was to have been born in areas which were under the writ of the LTTE for several decades. That was the only crime they committed. I am sure future historians will write that the first seeds of a future rebellion were sown inside these outrageous and shocking camps which the Government had for several months. Thanks to the national and international outrage many of them were allowed to go home, but even today thousands of IDPs are still kept in so-called interim camps and they are not being allowed to go home. [Interruption.] Also, Sir, now one year on ; instead of trying to win the hearts and minds of the Tamils, the Government is trying to establish and achieve cultural and political hegemony in the North and the East. What are they doing now? We hear that there are plans to readjust the demographic pattern and now we know that they have started changing names of Tamil villages to Sinhala names. Recently, Sir - [Interruption.] Okay. You can answer. - [Interruption.] I have an example. - [Interruption.] Please, you can answer later. I am giving an example. Recently, Sir, the name of a village in Vanni was changed to Pilimagama referring to the Buddha Statue which has recently been erected there.- [Interruption.] In fact, religious crusades have become the order of the day - [Interruption.] . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Azwer, you can raise your point of Order.

. . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is very clear that according to the Standing Orders, you cannot mislead the House. - [ Interruption.] You must know the meaning of the point of Order. . [ .] [ .] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . Point of Order . bulb .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, there is a point of Order being raised. . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, you cannot mislead the House. Let him mention one village where the name has been changed. village

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) That is not a point of Order, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. Please sit down.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Azwer, please answer later. You have been demoted. You are a very senior Member. You should be in the Front Benches but you have been put to the back.

. . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You have been decimated. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Maybe. Let me have my words. As a true Buddhist, I would like to say that I am a very proud practising Buddhist. I am ashamed of this cannibalization of the Great Lord Buddha's Philosophy based on the pillars of ahimsa compassion, and tolerance. Rather than liberating the long-suffering Tamils from terrorism, each action the

Government has taken since the defeat of the Tigers has made them feel newly pressed. The shocking attitude of this regime was amply demonstrated when the [ .] [ .] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] during the last Presidential Election told a shocked audience in Jaffna threateningly, maybe you were a witness, Sir, after they had dared to heckle at its teleprompted Tamil speech, "Do not forget this is a Sinhala-Buddhist country." This is how he insulted those people. This triumphalist attitude of the Government will not lead to rapprochement but will sow the seeds of future rebellion and the call for separation will surely reignite some embers of war. I am saying all these because we do not want to see terrorism ever again raising its ugly head in this country. We have to ensure it does not do so. Sir, unfortunately for our country the present regime is so obsessed with its own political agenda of establishing a family dynasty. The unprecedented window of opportunity which our nation got for a new beginning is now being squandered away. A new Constitution and Constitutional Reforms are being discussed without any reference - that is the joke - to the political settlement for the ethnic question. The priority of this Government is to do away with the two-term limit of the Presidency when the majority of our main political parties including, I believe, several political parties of the UPFA have agreed that the Executive Presidential system needs to be abolished. The Government wanting to extend the Presidents term is a display of an utter political opportunism and a callous disregard to the burning issues our country is facing today. And also, Sir, a Second Chamber or a Senate, we are told, is also on the cards. A Second Chamber should only be considered, if at all, within a wider political package devolving powers to the North and the East. In the present context, a Senate will be yet another costly tier intended most probably, the way things are now, to provide a living to senior citizens related to the First Family along with other geriatric cronies and henchman who cannot be accommodated in the Government. According to "The Sunday Times" which is usually correct, the former Speaker is now tipped to be its first Chairman. That proves what I am trying to say. Obviously, it is to be a consolation prize for not being appointed as a National List MP. Then what is going to happen is, the provincial councils will be there as training grounds for political offsprings and their spouses, the Central Government for selected members of the first family and their yes-men and the Senate for members of the family to pass away their twilight years. So this is what is going to happen as it is. Therefore, Sir, what I am saying is a Senate would be yet another white elephant, an additional burden our country could hardly afford. As I said before, I am saying it again, the sine qua non or the indispensable prerequisite for peace and prosperity in Sri Lanka is a political settlement which meets the genuine aspirations of the minorities within a united country. Any new Constitution which does not

address this issue is bound to compound our problems as both the 1972 and the 1978 Constitutions did. If we are to develop as a modern and dynamic democracy, an essential prerequisite is the further strengthening of democratic institutions. Instead, many of our key institutions are under attack by the Executive. The police has become the serfdom of the Executive. The AGs Department which the Hon. Sarath Fonseka mentioned just now has become unashamedly and unapologetically political, gazetted directly under the President recently. The judiciary is under severe pressure and the media is controlled, as we all know, by insidious means. Adding insult to injury, it is reported that the Government is to amend the 17th Amendment to the Constitution giving the President, and not to the Constitutional Council, powers to appoint the Chairmen and the Members of the Independent Elections Commission, the National Police Commission and other Commissions. If there are shortcomings - we have here a report. Actually your own Minister, the Hon. Dew Gunasekara has done a very good draft Interim Report. You can implement that without compromising the independence of these commissions which is a key prerequisite for a functioning dynamic democracy today. So, if you want to make changes, I again request you to consider the Dew Gunasekara Report, which I would present to you all for further perusal. And also, instead of using this golden opportunity to solve the burning issues of our time, this Government seems to be hell bent on using the large majority which they got at the last General Election to create an autocracy based on family rule. The proposed Constitutional Reforms, instead of addressing the genuine grievances of the Tamil people and other minorities and strengthening the democratic rights of the Sinhalese and all our citizens, seem to be designed with the sole objective of meeting, with all due respect, Sir, the not-so-genuine aspirations of the Rajapaksa clan. It is designed not to meet the aspirations of the long-suffering Tamil people, but the needs of one family. Sir, with all due respect, I am saying all this because this is a moment we cannot afford to miss. -[Interruption.] Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva, may I paraphrase Shakespeare from Julius Caesar and just say, "It is not that I love Rajapaksas' less, it is because I love my country more." Sir, finally, just a few more words. As we are now at the crossroad of the history, we have a choice; the choice is before us. There are two paths. One path leads to Utopia. Utopia is the promised land and if we go down this Utopia with our Tamil, Muslim, Burgher and Malay brethren, we can forge a new future, a new identity, and this will be a country which can achieve the economic prosperity which it truly deserves. And, we know you got your victory by hook or by crook, but, on the other hand, if you use your ill-gotten majority for the benefit of the country, history will look kindly at you. If you go down that road, the incumbent President, perhaps, can become a modern-day Dharmashoka, I grant it. But, if he stubbornly continues his journey in the same old path, it

91 92

will not be long before that the call for separation is reignited. Unlike before, Sir, the new battle for separation will not be fought in the jungles of Vanni. The new battle for separation is already being fought in the corridors of power in Washington, in New York, in Geneva, in Brussels and in London. In fact, the weapons they will be using will not be the T56s and other weapons. The new weapons of separation will be the BlackBerries and the iPods and the new cadre, Sir, unlike earlier people, will not go around with cyanide capsules around their necks. The new cadre will be the highly-educated and erudite members of the diaspora and their highly-paid lobbyists. This is something we have to understand and the ammunition for these cadres will be supplied not by anyone else but by your Government, by your foolishness. Your policy of triumphalist chauvinism and democratic suppression will be enough ammunition for these new soldiers for a separate Tamil state. I can see the Hon. Champika Ranawaka, here. I abhor his political philosophy, I do not agree with that. I find it the most abhorrent of all philosophies but at the same time, I respect him because he is a good Minister. At least he is doing some good work. , . . [ ] How many more minutes do I have, Sir? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am just rushing through. What I am trying to tell you seriously is - [Interruption.] Those who can understand, please listen and others do not worry. If you all cannot understand, it is not my problem. But, what I am trying to tell you, and tell ourselves is that the new nations of the 21st Century, of our Century, will not be born through the liberation struggle; the era of liberation struggles are over. The new nations of the 21st Century will be created through resolutions endorsed by the international community. In fact, the Prime Minister himself in his speech this morning indirectly admitted what I am saying. He actually talked about the Transnational Government of the diaspora. Do not take these things too lightly. Do not dismiss them because repercussions of all what is happening now are far more serious than before. None of us here want to see our country divided. None of us want to see terrorism raise its high head again but, if we are to stay as one nation, the sine qua non, as I said before, is a political settlement for the Tamil problem and that I say as a nationalist.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please wind up, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) So, if we go on this path, Sir, we will end up finally in a dystopia, as a failed and divided nation surviving on anti-western bravado. . Where will it end? You all will have to finally end up governing like Mugabe of Zimbabwe or Bashir of Sudan. So, that is what I am saying now, Sir. Finally all I have to say is, the choice is yours, the choice is ours; the choice is now before us. We can go either on the path to Utopia and achieve what our people truly deserve or go on dystopia and become a pariah nation of the international state. President Rajapaksa has a choice at this moment; he can either become a Dharmashoka, or end up being a Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Thank you. [. . 12.31] ( )
