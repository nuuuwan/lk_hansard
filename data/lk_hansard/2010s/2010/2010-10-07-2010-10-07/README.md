( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

.. () .. NO-CONFIDENCE IN HON. (PROF.) G.L. PEIRIS, MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [.. 1.12]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, I move,

"that whereas the Hon. (Prof.) G.L.Peiris, Minister of External Affairs has failed to uphold and preserve the reputation and good name of this country internationally which has resulted among other things the Secretary General of the United Nations Organization taking steps for the appointment of a Panel of Experts to advise him on the human rights violations in Sri Lanka and the Minister making several contradictory statements and the steps taken by the Government of Sri Lanka, thereafter, in respect of these maters, as evidenced by :

(a) His interview with Elizabeth Dickinson (Assistant Managing Editor at Foreign Policy) on 25.05.2010, where he said, 'if there are shortcomings, deficiencies that had surfaced, then we will go to the UN and say: We would like assistance with the following ';

(b) However it had been later stated as reported in The Island of 25.05.2010 that there is no justification legal or moral for this step (UN probe) to be taken at this time ;

(c) And again as reported in the Daily News on 26.05.2010 the proposal to conduct international investigations or even to appoint panels would duplicate the work of the Commission and would give rise to a negative political reaction within Sri Lanka.

Knowing fully well that the terms of reference of the Commission do not include any reference to the accountability process for violation of international human rights and that the exclusion of accountability of the Commission is a shortcoming referred to by the Minister which then enables the UN to intervene.

(d) His inability to muster the support of friendly countries specially the members of the Non-Aligned Movement to check Mr. Ban Ki-moons efforts to appoint the panel to advise him on Sri Lankas violation of human rights issue.

(e) His over reacting to the threat to deny the General System of Preference (GSP) to Sri Lanka and making contradictory statements in this regard.

(f) Having disgraced the country by overstaying his invitation to China and thus abusing the hospitality of the host country.

Therefore, Sir, I move that this House has lost confidence in the ability of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L.Peiris, Minister of External Affairs to continue to function as a Minister of the Government of Sri Lanka".

Sir, throughout the history of Sri Lanka we have had excellent relations with the International Community. That was well known over the years. Our relations have been excellent in particular with our immediate neighbours and in general, the more distant countries and all parts of the world.

However, over the past few years one cannot help but notice a steady deterioration of our relations with some of the more important players in the international field, more particularly that of the West. The European Union, Sir, has lost confidence in us and as a result, we lost the General System of Preference, more commonly known as the GSP.

Our relationship with the US is certainly not where it was a few years back and the GSP facility of the US which is also at stake should be protected at any cost.

The West still contributes to around 50 per cent of the world GDP. Therefore, we should not isolate ourselves from them.

Over 50 per cent of our apparels go to the EU. Costs will go up by 10 per cent and most exporters are now working on a 10 - 15 per cent margin, resulting in the closure of industries and loss of job opportunities if the GSP is lost and withdrawn.

The loss of GSP will have a large bearing on the export sector. While we need to maintain and protect our sovereignty, we need to ensure that we manage our international relations professionally so that the country can benefit at all times.

279 280

Our foreign service, Sir, needs to be managed by professionals. We should emphasize more within the foreign service and in our embassies to improve our trade with the countries round the world.

More importantly, our relationship with the premier world body, the United Nations Organization, has suffered greatly due to the spot with the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. So much so, that the Secretary -General has appointed a Panel of Experts to advise him on the human rights violations in Sri Lanka.

On top of that, we go and make contradictory statements regarding the whole episode. First, we go and tell Elizabeth Dickinson, the Assistant Managing Editor at Foreign Policy that, I quote:

If there are shortcomings, deficiencies that had surfaced, then we will go to the UN and say: 'We would like assistance with the following'".

On the other hand there is no justification, legal or moral, for the steps taken.

Sir, these are some of the major areas referred to in this Vote of No-confidence that has been presented. The contents or the averments in this Motion of No-confidence, to a very great extent, is based on newspaper reports and news media agencies, because it is best known to the Hon. Minister than anyone else as to what he has been negotiating.

Therefore, I consider that it would be a good opportunity for the Hon. Minister of External Affairs to explain and enlighten the truth of these reports to this House and through this House to the people of this country.

As we all are aware, Sir, some newspapers and news agencies publish either distorted or false reports provided by unscrupulous sycophants. That is a usual thing. I am quite aware of what took place. I also take this opportunity to explain, for example, what they published about my visit to the United States. I wish to place some facts before this House.

It is the Ministry of External Affairs that extended this invitation to me to be a delegate and to attend the United Nations Sessions in New York. I am thankful to the Ministry of External Affairs and the Hon. Minister of External Affairs for extending this invitation to me to be in this delegation. .

I was given very short notice with a set of air tickets. I rushed to the Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and inquired from him whether there is anything wrong in accepting this invitation to proceed to New York. After much consideration, my Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe advised me not to proceed to New York under the present circumstances. With due respect to my

Leaders advice, I thereafter quickly returned the air tickets to the airline agency and obtained a fresh set of tickets indicating that I will pay, enabling me to proceed to Washington to see my children, which I normally do once a year.

I am sure this invitation to this Session would have been with the concurrence of His Excellency the President, and I am thankful to him as well.

If I remember right, Sir, in 2003, when His Excellency the President was the Leader of the Opposition, it was the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe who was then Prime Minister, provided the opportunity to His Excellency the President to visit New York for the UN Session. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe not only provided this opportunity but went further to inform our Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, Mr. Charlie Mahendran to receive him and give him all the assistance during his stay. Mr. Karunasena Kodituwakku was a witness to this. I am of the view that the invitation extended to me as the Chief Opposition Whip may have been an act of reciprocation for which I deeply appreciate.

I have known the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris for a long period. He was a close supporter of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, that of former President (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, a Minister under the UNP Regime headed by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and today he is a Minister under the Regime of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Whoever it may be, if there is a failure or injustice resulting from any neglect of duties or performance, it is the duty of the Opposition to raise these issues in the House to save the good name of the country. That is why we have embarked on this Motion of No-confidence.

Sir, as the Chief Opposition Whip, time and again, I have requested the Ministry of External Affairs and the Leader of the House to extend invitations to the Opposition to be part of Government delegations, particularly in the United Nations. After all, a delegation is a delegation of the country, not of the PA or of any particular party. In the past, I distinctly remember, particularly during the regime of the late President J.R. Jayewardene, a number of Parliamentarians had the opportunity of attending UN Sessions to which Members of the Opposition were also invited to join those delegations. Delegations consisted of 10 Members at a time for a fortnight, from September to November. Therefore, a large number of Members of Parliament had the opportunity of attending the UN Sessions.

Hon. Minister, I would very sincerely request you and the Government to develop this principle in giving an opportunity to the Members of the Opposition to be included in these delegations, which provide an opportunity for them to learn and understand matters of international affairs. In the past, I had twice been a

281 282

2010 07

delegate to the United Nations. The last was in 2002 with the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe who was then the Prime Minister and I know how useful and beneficial it is to be present and participate in the discussions with the different Heads of States. In our Opposition, Sir, there are young Members of Parliament of the calibre of the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, the Hon. Harin Fernando, the Hon. Wasantha Aluwihare and many others who could be the future leaders of this country. Therefore, these opportunities will be of immense value for the future leadership of this country.

Thank you very much, Sir, for providing me this opportunity to present this No-confidence Motion.

[. . 1.52] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak a few words on the No-confidence Motion that has been brought against the Minister of External Affairs. I do not think it gives me any relish or delight to be talking on a No-confidence Motion against especially a person of the calibre of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. But,

287 288

he must understand that he holds the portfolio of the Minister of External Affairs. There is an element of personal conduct and there is an element of public conduct also. So, when we take this from the point of view of the Opposition, it is that we take on the External Affairs Minister. The individual play comes in only as a support service.

There was a passionate plea made by the last Speaker, but that is not what the No-confidence Motion is all about. You could see that there were certain factors expressed in the No-confidence Motion. As the principal Opposition, it is our duty to ensure that we protect the country and not the Government; protect the country and not the Minister. That is the intention we have. So, there is no sense of animosity or acrimony that we are bringing about. All we want to do is to show that the conduct of a Minister is always for public probity.

So, if I may start with the mission of the Ministry of External Affairs, which I got from the booklet that was given by the Ministry last year: Mission - The promotion, projection and protection internationally of Sri Lankas national interests, in accordance with the foreign policy of the Government and to advise the Government on managing international development in keeping with the best interests of Sri Lanka. Now, the reason mentioned under the "Mission" is the intention of the Government for having an External Affairs Ministry. We also know all external policies have to be determined and implemented by the Ministry of External Affairs.

We have gone through one of the most brutal wars in history while the credit has always been given to the President and the Government for the limited role. It does not stop at that. It goes beyond. Where are the economic dividends that come after the end of the war? Now, these are matters that have got to be looked at. The journey is not one step. As you know the Government has its functions delegated to different people and each of them has a pivotal role to play, and that role when it is being played, has to be played with the rules that are expected to be followed. Now, there is bashing of the Opposition daily. Members like us are hammered daily just because we are standing for the principles of the Opposition. Does anybody get up and ask why it is happening? So, those are the problems we face. These are occupational hazards.

I am sure if amiable and generous disposition does not get too perturbed - because as you know, even before we start I am sure we will be able to prove many points - none of the MPs will have the courage of conviction to work according to their conscience because the Whip will whip them so hard that they would not be able to think beyond what they have been told to do.

So, Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned the economic development from an external perspective has to be

looked at from the External Affairs Ministry. This is a pivotal role it has to play. In todays fast-changing economic dimension where international boundaries are shrinking by the moment, the External Affairs Ministry has to ensure and play that proactive role in order to get our message across and put Sri Lanka on the map. That is what is expected of the External Affairs Ministry. So, there are certain conducts that we have mentioned. We have not said "x","y" and "z". We have thought and maybe it deemed fit from a political perspective, but from a national perspective and as a responsible Government that needs to discharge its responsibilities, we have found that there are certain areas on which we need to question in order to get an answer.

So, Hon. Speaker, I put that forward at the outset, because the passionate plea that was made by no less than a very senior Member, the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, encapsulated it in such a way as if it is a personal battle. In that case, you can tell the Opposition to go home and come back after the next election. However, the Opposition's role is - it is our job as I said - to protect the countrys interests and it has nothing to do with the Governments interests.

Of course, if the Government is doing what is good for the country, we are not so petty not to give credit to where it is due. But, at the time when the Debate comes to a conclusion, I am sure the Ministers and the MPs who are here would be able to find that we have given sufficient evidence that warrant their merit to get a vote and stand up for what is good for the country.

So, Hon. Speaker, as you know, the former Vice-Chancellor joined the SLFP and came in at that time as the Constitutional Affairs Minister in order to ensure that we abolish the Executive Presidency. He did many other stints such as the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning and many other responsible jobs to the best of his ability. There is no question about those roles.

Then, he joined the United National Party and played a pivotal role in the Ceasefire Agreement. In that regard, if there were three pillars, he was one of the them. Thereafter, he also happened to be involved, very passionately and emotionally, in the day-to-day activities in trying to get the labour GSP for Sri Lanka. I also share that credit for doing that enormous service on behalf of the United National Party and let me take it from there onwards.

He, with us ensured that Sri Lanka needed trade instead of aid. So, what our Government decided at that time was to substitute aid with the tool of trade. So, what we as a Government decided was to have bilateral agreements and multilateral agreements and to ensure that we go into each area so that we could put Sri Lanka as a showcase of promoting manufacture and exports rather than imports and trade. We were having our own share of problems in the country and we thought it deemed fit to go to the European Union and tell them,

289 290

[ ]

2010 07

Little Sri Lanka is an Island of poverty in an ocean of prosperity. So, give a helping hand to Sri Lanka so that we can put Sri Lanka in the map in a more advantageous position than what it is". We had our problems of ethnic strife and economic problems. We inherited the Government which he too belonged to, where under Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga, for the first time we had a negative growth. When we went to the European Union led by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris and myself - I had a lesser significant role to play because they played the more important role and subsequently I followed up - we managed to convince the European Union to think passionately and give Sri Lanka what it deserves. It was not an easy passage of time. On that basis, all what we wanted to say was to show why Sri Lanka requires support, not just for the sake of getting the labour GSP benefit, but for the purpose of ensuring that the Sri Lankan citizens get the benefit of that. That is where he played the pivotal role. So, I do not need to say that we managed to get that and after the tsunami, it was expedited. Then, from 2008 to 2011, we were bestowed with the right of getting that. Thereafter, we went into the Opposition. There was a passage of time during which the Hon. Minister was in the Opposition. For reasons best known to himself, he left and joined the Government. That is personal, which I do not need to go into. But, thereafter his public conduct goes as a Minister and that is what we, as an Opposition would like to question. So, let us keep the name, "Prof. G.L. Peiris" out and "Minister of External Affairs" is what we are concerned about.

Sir, I would like to refer to column 1014 of Hansard of 10th October, 2007. That was the speech on Labour GSP made by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, as the then Export Development Minister. I am referring to this because we have lost that benefit as of now. We had the ability of protecting this.

Two years ago when we were in the Opposition, we told the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, Let us work together; let us come and put national policies together. Do not let foreign governments dictate to us as to what we have got to do. Here is the Opposition lending a hand to the Government saying, Let us protect international bullying, if there is any. But what happened was, we were ridiculed. We were told, "We do not need your assistance". Even in this short passage of time, the truth is still being distorted by saying that we have lost the Labour GSP because the Opposition goes overseas and tries to concoct yarns. Now, let me take you down memory lane as to what was told in the Hansard then. This is what the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris said on the 10th of October, 2007, at Column 1014. It states, I quote :

The GSP Plus arrangements are absolutely vital for the economy of Sri Lanka. I would describe it as a lifeline of our economy.

Sir, the garment factories that are functioning up and down the country, particularly in the rural areas provide employment for

thousands of girls. Those girls who come to the garment factories are given breakfast;

there are cooperative societies which sell soap, tins of salmon, toothpaste at subsidized prices; they are given medical facilities; they are given training, all these things are possible because of the GSP Plus arrangements.

That is the importance in you and that is why we went and got it.

He further states, I quote :

The true value of the GSP Plus arrangements is that we enjoy very considerable concessions and privileges with regard to tariffs and duties imposed by the European Union.

He further goes on to say in Column 1015, I quote :

The Government of Sri Lanka will shortly negotiate for the extension of this GSP Plus concessions for a further three years from 2008 to 2011.

Sir, he, as a responsible Minister did his job and - that is what is expected - mentioned that he would be negotiating. This happened in the year 2007.

That again is a very considerable benefit that we would be entitled to if we comply with certain criteria.

So, he as the Minister knew that there were certain criteria. We are not going to ask foreign governments to come and tell us and then we kneel at their beck and call. That was what was not expected. When we got that, we did not have any conditions to fulfil neither was there any necessity for it; we had to only extend it. But, there were expected norms that have got to be in played in the international scene. If you are in the international world club, you expect certain norms to be maintained, to be complied with and that is what was being rebuked at that moment.

He further goes on to say, I quote :

The last comment I would like to make, Sir, is this. I would earnestly appeal to everybody - all political parties and all groups in the country - to treat this matter above the level of partisan politics. We may disagree about many matters. Politics is about power. There is no doubt about that. But there are certain things which should be beyond the field of adversarial, confrontational politics.

That is precisely where we are. We said two years ago, stop this adversarial politics, stop this confrontational politics. But, we were rebuked, Sir. What did the Minister of Foreign Affairs then say? Not only could he save the Labour GSP, but he could not even save his portfolio. That is the difference. So, are these matters that need to be swept under the carpet? No. Surely, the Opposition has a backbone to tell what is good for the country. Leave the individual outside. It can be an "X" person today; it can be another Minister tomorrow; it can be Karuna Amman the day after tomorrow but whoever holds the position, if he has done anything which is not for the benefit of the national interest, we will certainly take it up.

291 292

Sir, you see the absurdity today. Where is the Hon. Sarath Fonseka, the Member of Parliament? Where is KP? The Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms said that he does not know where KP is. But, everybody knows where the Hon. Sarath Fonseka is. Now, is that right? Has the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who is a very senior person, a lovely personality, not have any sense of heart that goes towards that area and ask why he is not here? These are matters that need to be addressed in this Parliament. Lack of attack does not mean that we do not have policy. But, we only want to say, that at a time when it is required to defend the country, we will do that without fear or favour. Hon. Speaker, if we do anything to deprive the people of our country of these very substantial benefits, these innocent girls who work in these factories will be thrown out on the roads as what is happening now. , . .. 834 , . . . . 310 . . Labour GSP . . . . That is one of the reasons. If it was the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena in the Ministry of External Affairs, we would have brought this against the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena. , . . , , . ? So, Hon. Speaker, let us get back to the actual contents; that is what is expected. Because the GSP Plus is not available, it is not the Government that is going to be hurt; extremely correct - a Government is a Government. The Government is not going to fall because the GSP Plus is withheld. But, the persons who will suffer very grievously in the consequence of such will be less privileged sections of the Sri Lankan community. That is what we are speaking of here, Sir. That is what is expected of us. 125 , . . , . . . . , , . " " . ? . ? . ", . . .

. . " . ? ? Court Martial ?

.. ( )

( .. - ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara - Deputy Minister of Agriculture) -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . . . .

So, that is the reason why we basically mentioned it and Sir, the "Sunday Observer" of 11th July, 2010 states, The Govt. ready to consider the constructive EU proposals.

That is correct. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition and we, as Members of Parliament, said, "Let us work together". Now, these are being mentioned because there is US Dollars 3.6 billion trade between the European Union and Sri Lanka growing at 10 to 12 per cent a year; imports from Sri Lanka is US Dollars 1.3 billion and exports from Sri Lanka is US Dollars one million a year. Now, the 11 per cent GSP Plus loss would roughly be about US Dollars 22 billion for the year 2010, Sir. The loss for the year 2011 would be about US Dollars 28 billion and the total loss for three years would roughly be about US Dollars 80 billion. That would mean you can do two or three port projects; you can do two or three Mahaweli projects. , . 18, 20. 38 40 , Labour GSP 2,200 , . . , . . , . . , . . . Can the Government sue now? You said you would sue "Channel 4". Have you done it? Where is the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the then Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights? The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, he is not here, because even when we told him

293 294

[ ]

2010 07

to do it, he did not do it. And, that is the expectation of the people. There is hell of a situation these days. Bashing the Opposition has become a hobby horse of the Government. , , , , , . . , . , . . Hon. Minister, you will survive this. You may survive this if the MPs on that side do not have a right of conscience. If they have a sense of conscience, you may lose the job. But, I am telling you, at least protect the US GSP concession which is also in jeopardy. Do not take it lightly. We are having a garment industry which is competing fiercely and ferociously today owing to the cost-push inflation not done by external factors, but by the Government itself and when we become uncompetitive, do not let the US GSP concessions be lost out like the Labour GSP you lost in Europe. Let us work again on the same basis. We extend our hands from here, but all we want is to do it with a sense of genuineness. Do not put everything on "Mahinda Chintana". You get up in the morning and you breathe this "Mahinda Chintana", you go to sleep because the "Mahinda Chintana" says so. That does not help. Plato once said, The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men. That is why I basically wanted to touch upon your conscience. That is all what is mentioned. So, that is one of the five matters that we have mentioned in the No-confidence Motion. What is wrong in that? You bring trivial matters which entails this, that and other about the United National Party. We are talking about the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

So, Hon. Speaker, let me go on to one other matter. What I thought was, he is a Minister of such a calibre and I grant his knowledge, ability and his communication ability.

. , 2001 Budget . 2001. 2002 24 , ,-

Sir, I quote from Column 394 of Hansard dated 24th January, 2002.

There was a very emotional speech that was made by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva shortly before the walk-out took place.

. .

It further states:

"The reason for the walkout had to do with allegations relating to post election violence. This epitomizes the rancour and the acrimony that is characteristic of the Sri Lankan political culture."

These are common words my good, learned Friend, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris uses. But, I only want to mention - There is no acrimony in what we are saying but this is an extract from Hansard. Now, I quote from Column 395:

The Hon. Sivasisthamparam, whose voice was heard in this assembly after many years, pointed out the reality that it is this spirit of antagonism that has militated against the emergence of a viable political solution to this conflict during the last 35 years.

Why I say this is because there are certain areas which, I am sure, the successive speakers would touch if they target the UNP on certain matters. But, I only want ensure that we strengthen our point of view if such an attempt is made by the same people who, as I said, were the three pillars of the CFA and one of them was himself. That is the reason why I am mentioning this.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , ?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) 28 . 10 .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I again quote from the same Hansard.

Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, I think there is room for hope and expectation. The mood in the country today is one of buoyancy.

. , .

I again quote:

The Royal Norwegian Government in their reference to this matter, has used the phrase, cautious optimism. The hon. Sivasithamparam put it much more vividly when he said that this is the last chance but he emphasized that it is also the best chance.

I do not dispute any of these. Then, going on further with his speech, in Column 398 of Hansard of 24th January 2002, he says, I quote:

I would like on this occasion to acknowledge and to pay tribute to the quality of the contribution that is being made by the Royal Norwegian Government. They are are approaching their task with a great deal of finesse professionalism. They are not there simply to carry messages.

Then, Sir, I will go on to a speech made by the Hon. Prof. G. L. Peiris when the Constitutional Council was brought into place. I am quoting from Column 735 of Hansard of 27th March, 2002.

"Mr. Speaker, we have already made a useful beginning with the establishment of the Constitutional Council which will hold its first meeting on the 5th of April, 2002.

The Constitutional Council will be responsible for the appointment of various other bodies which play an indispensable role in the public life of this country. The Constitutional Council will be responsible for identifying the personnel that will constitute the National Police Commission, The Elections Commission, The Public Service Commission, the Judicial Service Commission, The De-limitation Commission, the Human Rights Commission, and many other vital bodies.

So, now, we have a situation where, Mr. Speaker, these bodies will be manned by people who will command the confidence of the community at large. They will not be seen as friends of the party in power.

297 298

2010 07

That is very relevant today. Is that not right, Hon. Minister?

So, these are very fascinating innovations which have been put in place within so short a period.

Now, we want to expand the scope of this thinking to embrace Parliament, its vital institutions, its structures, its committees and the manner in which it works.

Today, is it there, Sir? The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution has been overrun by the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Eighteenth Amendment has flushed what you had said those days. We mention this for posterity.

I would now quote from Column 911 of Hansard dated 11th of February, 2005. There, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris states, I quote:

Indeed, I will endeavour to show Mr. Speaker, that in some cases there is no connection whatsoever between the content of the Regulations and the tsunami disaster. Under cover of tsunami, the Government is trying to arm itself with dictatorial powers which strike at the very root of individual freedom, essential democratic rights without which a functioning democracy is not possible.

Those powers cannot be wider in scope than is necessary to deal with this particular purpose.

Sir, I will try to give you a few examples. I invite the House to look at the Section 18. It proposes to restrict basic democratic freedoms.

. - . . ?

Now, I quote from Column 913 of the same Hansard. There, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris states, I quote:

Mr. Speaker, I respectfully invite your attention to Section 12 (5). It says, I quote:

Where any person is convicted by any court of any offence against this regulation, then, in addition to any other penalty that the court shall impose for such offence -

(a) all property movable or immovable, of that person shall, by virtue of such conviction, be deemed to be forfeited to the Republic;

This poor man may be in jail. He has lost his job. He has lost his little room. All his savings in the bank for his wife and his children are forfeited to the Republic. Can you think of a more draconian piece of legislation and what in heavens name has it got to do with tsunami? Here, is, Mr. Speaker, a truly despicable attempt on the part of the Government to take cover behind tsunami and with one stroke of the pen ..

Does General Sarath Fonsekas absence not fit into this category? That is the reason why I want to mention these things. These are statements attributed by the External Affairs Minister. These are not wrong; these are

not concocted yarns. I am quoting these things only to corroborate the actions of the External Affairs Minister.

Then, Sir, I would again like to quote from a speech made by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. I quote from Column 202 of Hansard dated 7th December, 2005:

I have no doubt that President Mahinda Rajapaksa will recognize in the fullness of time the chastening effect of power as his predecessors have done before him.

That does not mean that I support the retention of the Executive Presidency without any structural modification whatsoever.

It is quite evident that two changes are overdue and desperately required. One is to cut down the scope, the scale of judicial immunity. No President anywhere in the world enjoys a kind of judicial immunity that is available to the President of Sri Lanka. It cannot be justified by any standard whatsoever.

Secondly, the Executive Presidency must be transformed in order to make it accountable to Parliament. But subject to those two reservations.

Let us look at the situation where the Supreme Court is a court of First Instance and the Last Instance with regard to human rights. That is not desirable.

Is it any better now? Has the Eighteenth Amendment, the despicable piece of legislation that has been sanctioned by the Cabinet of Ministers and endorsed by the Hon. Speaker, not gone even further? So, these are the factors which led to the No-confidence Motion against the External Affairs Minister.

Sir, let me give you another reason that has led to the No-confidence Motion. It is the actions that have stemmed hearing that an Expert Panel on Sri Lanka would be constituted. We, the United National Party, would say that there is no necessity for them to put anything on Sri Lanka. But, have we done the little that we have got to do to obviate the need to do such a thing? We have a Constitution and if you abide by that, there is no necessity for them to do a such thing. Hon. Minister, I do not disagree with you more or agree with you more when I quote the The Island of 25th of May, 2010, which states, Dont interfere in internal affairs : Lanka to UN Chief

Let me second this ten times over; this is absolutely correct. None of the foreign governments needs to come and tell us what to do; leave alone the UN, leave alone the US; not the Chinese, not the Libyan; not the North Koreans. But, Sir, certain statements that have been attributed have led to the No-confidence Motion and that shows the occupational hazard that you are faced with. There was a Joint Statement issued on 23rd May, 2009 signed by the UN Secretary-General and the Government of Sri Lanka. I know you have contradicted it but that contradiction alone does not help. Your actions have led to Ban Ki-moon getting up from his slumber and appointing an Expert Panel on Sri Lanka. What was stated in the Joint Statement, Sir? It is necessary to

299 300

mention it to this House because otherwise you take the abstract and then say this is what was expressed and the Opposition is engaged in mischief-making. Let me quote from the Joint Statement :

The Secretary General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his statement..

. . .

. in Parliament on 19 May, 2009 that a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved. President Rajapakse expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment,

Who has said so? It is the President and it is mentioned in the Joint Statement. If there is no reason to utter this, why is it put to paper?

"...... as well as to begin a broader dialog with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance the process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka."

The second paragraph goes on further to state, I quote:

Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights ..

.

"....standards and Sri Lankas international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances.

What are the grievances that you need to address if there are not any?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , - [ ] [ ] . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) upset . . [ ] , . . [ ] .

Then going further - [ ] . . . ,- [ ] , . [ ] Sir, on meeting the Secretary-General on 24th May, 2010, the External Affairs Minister has said the appointment of a Reconciliation Commission will address the accountability issue. This was reported in the "Daily Mirror" of 26th May, 2010. I do not want to repeat these things because I want to save time but you know what you have said. Have you not put Sri Lanka into a position which compels Mr. Ban Ki-moon to appoint an Expert Panel? If you had said so, what are you talking now? You cannot do anything about Sri Lanka. We would have supported you. We told you that there is no necessity for an external intrusion into the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. But , the Constitution does not permit you to do what you are doing. Where is the Seventeenth Amendment which constituted the Constitutional Council? These are what the people are asking. All you have got to do is to abide by your Constitution. Then, the foreigners will not come and tell us what to do.

Now, Sir, all we want to state is, if you had the courage of conviction at that time to tell Mr. Ban Ki-moon to get out of this, then there would not have been a necessity for us to bring in the No-confidence Motion. But, your very actions stemmed the reaction - the No-Confidence Motion. You are lucky that you have the numbers and the whip, but the whip will not get the numbers. But, at least we will be able to convince some people that we are not doing this for the sake of

doing, but we are doing the correct thing. -[Interruption.] Even though there are people who are barking from behind, remember that the carriage is going not with four wheels but just two wheels. It is going with the greatest of difficulty. Your pointing fingers at the Opposition is done just to distract the attention of the Government but carriage .

Then Sir, "The Island" newspaper of 25th May, 2010 states, I quote:

There is no justification legal or moral for this step (UN probe) to be taken at this time, External Affairs, Minister G.L. Peiris said ahead of meeting with Ban."

"Do not complicate matters at this stage.

All these statements are correct. But, why did not you tell Mr. Ban Ki-moon to get out of this? Then you would not have faced this No-confidence Motion.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) ! ? [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . .

. . , , .

Now, I am coming to a critical point. There is a publication of an interview you have had with Elizabeth Dickinson, the Assistant Managing Editor at Foreign Policy on 25th May, 2010, the caption of which states, I quote:

Sri Lanka rejects war crimes accusations."

In reply to a question on a report on allegations of war crimes, you have given three reasons. There you say, I quote:

"Thirdly, the timing of the report does raise very significant doubts about motivation, about bona fides.

Should you not have told that, this No-confidence Motion would have never come. Your saying such a thing has forced us to bring in a No-confidence Motion against you. If you had told them that there is no necessity for such a thing, then this No-confidence Motion would not be brought in. There is another very important question asked from you. I quote:

" When you said subject to the laws of the land specifically which law are you talking about?

The question is as to why General Sarath Fonseka, who was the Presidents opponent at the Presidential Election, has been arrested. The answer you have given is, I quote:

He is accused of dishonesty, cheating, criminal misappropriation - the purchase of arms. He abused his position in order to confer very large benefits on a company that was run by his son-in-law. Those are crimes in your country; they are crimes in our country. And just because a man contests an election does not mean he is exempt from the operation of those laws.

Sir, touch your conscience and ask whether you can agree with this statement. What are the charges that have been levelled against this person? There are four charges levelled against him and one among them is that he has sat on a tender board to which his son-in-law has forwarded a bid. There has not been any mention about cash misappropriation. Is this not a defamatory statement? - [Interruption.] Mihin Air, it is Rs. 990 million. [Interruption.] Can you please keep quiet and listen? All I am saying is, he may have different political views, but you need not punish him to this extent. One year ago, he was a hero and today he is languishing in jail -[Interruption.] , nursery

(23.0) 8.12 of the Report dated 06.08.2010 - Re Ceylinco Investments Co. Ltd.

This Court makes order cancelling the issue of 500,000 shares belonging to the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Mr. Janaka Ratnayake in Ceylinco Investment Ltd.

It is brought to the notice of Court that Mr. Janaka Ratnayake had issued 500,000 shares amounting to a sum of Rs. 5 million to himself. The Attorney General has gone into this and he has found that it is a totally illegal transaction and the transaction was cancelled and this Rs. 5 million has been reversed. This Rs. 5 million should go to the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka. On the application of parties, this Court .

These are matters that stem from the actions of the External Affairs Minister. I am saying all these things because these statements have been attributed by you. Today Ban Ki-moon is over the moon because of the statements that have been attributed by you. So, if you put one leg in the fire and one leg in the ice, it does not make an average.

Going on further, Sir, all we want to say is, actions that are - [Interruption.] Sir, can you kindly discipline these Hon. Members? If you cannot discipline them, how can you discipline the country? - [Interruption.]

. . .

Hon. Minister, when you all were in Washington, parallelly there was a meeting of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam in New York and former LTTE legal adviser, Rudrakumaran had been selected as its Prime Minister. I do not think we need to waste one second on this issue. But, as you have made statements on other matters, why have you not condemned this particular action? You will have to issue a statement in this regard. You must ensure that these matters are rebuked and knocked out.

The newspaper cutting in my hand states, Canada OK's most Sri Lankan refugee claims. That shows that the Minister of External Affairs has not been able to tell Canada that what is convinced is wrong because there is such a lot of international publicity going around to show that it is right.

Going on further, you have today certain sycophants appointed as ambassadors. And, you have ambassadors who are non-Sri Lankans. As per the report that has come to you, the Ambassador to Vietnam

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

I must say that you did not originate these things but you have got to carry the bad brief of the past regimes or the past Ministers. Since you are the Minister now, and it has been brought to your attention, you can correct this. The Sri Lankan Embassy in India is being used by an official in the Foreign Ministry and it is being questioned. This official's request sent to the USA has been approved and I am made to understand for what reason. Today -

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

. Sir, when you bring in a No-confidence Motion on a particular Minister or a Member, you detail out the reasons and you cannot go beyond them. So, the Hon. Member cannot criticize the appointment of the ambassadors and others. This subject is not listed in the No-confidence Motion. Actually, this is a No-confidence Motion - [Interruption.] No, no, you have to confine yourself to the content. "Erskine May" has said - [Interruption.] " " ? Sir, you cannot go - [Interruption.] It must be expunged, Sir. You cannot go beyond - [Interruption.] It has not been listed. He is misleading the House. [Interruption.] You bring in another Motion.

You must also make sure that this Parliament is not made a place of joke and that all traditions are upheld so that the country can go forward. Our job is to protect the country and not the Ministers or the Government. We have brought in points before you. We want the Hon. Members of this House to agree with what we have said and vote along with us at voting time to show that what we have said is right and that is for the good of the country. Thank you, Sir.

(Prof) G.L. Peiris. He has said that the citizens of the country should be happy that an experienced and articulate person of the calibre of (Prof.) G.L. Peiris without constituency responsibility, is now our foreign Minister. That was the version that was given about the Hon. (Prof) G.L. Peiris by Mr. K. Godage who is an acknowledged diplomat.

Then, Sir, I read an article that had been written by Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka. He has written this article to "The Daily News" on 16th September, 2010 and in his article he states, I quote:

"On the occasions that Prof. Peiris passed through Geneva when I was serving as Permanent Representative, I would eagerly arrange for him to address audiences of ambassadors and academics, and our team would watch with pride as he delivered his remarks, without a note, on almost any subject.

In terms of civility and intellect, of the many who came to Geneva,...G.L. Peiris was in a class by himself. Yet it is precisely against him that the UNP has chosen to move".

It was done by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe -[Interruption.] Yes, of course. You met the Hon. Tony Blair because of me - [Interruption.] You had the opportunity to meet him because of me.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Also, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella in his speech stated that there is no confidence in the Sri Lankan economy. But, let us look at it from two angles. Let us look at it from the domestic angle. The stock exchange is creating records day after day. It was only two-three days ago that the daily turnover was Rs. 12.5 billion. Then, let us take the example of the international dollar bond that this Government has floated - the Central Bank has floated. We were looking for one billion dollars, we got six billion dollars subscribed in 14 hours of which, 55 per cent of the subscription came from the United States of America. This is the very same country that is pointing fingers at us today; the very same country that is saying we have no human rights; the very same country that is saying we have no labour laws. But, they come and subscribe to our dollar bonds. Is this not confidence? What is this? If this is not confidence, please tell us what confidence is. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M.

Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am of course very happy to follow the de facto foreign Minister of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. Unfortunately, I wish his inflated ego could match his size and if according to what he said, that he is so influential as to get an appointment with Mr. Tony Blair, I would recommend to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, who are both here to make him the Foreign Minister in the coming reshuffle in November.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, today, this Motion of No-confidence that is being debated in this House since 1.00 oclock this afternoon is not only a Motion against the capricious Foreign Minister or the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, but also a Debate and an indictment on the failure of the foreign policy of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, as you are probably aware, Sri Lanka in spite of being a little Island of even lesser significance on the global map, has had excellent relations with the rest of the world throughout history. In fact, those who can read books on this side of the House will know that Sri Lanka in its records had diplomatic relations even in the Asian World with two of the great ancient powers of that time - Rome and China. [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I think according to Standing Orders, there cannot be two speeches going on simultaneously.

Let the Hon. Member reply later. In fact, records show that there were ambassadors from Sri Lanka during the reign of Claudius Caesar in 50 AD. There had been ambassadors to the Court of Emperor Julian sent by King Upatissa in 375 AD. Even the Chinese historian Sang Shoo records that in 428 AD, King Mahanama had sent a special envoy to the Imperial Court of China with his address. - [Interruption.]

In fact, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sri Lanka has long been held in high esteem by all civilized nations for thousands of years, since gaining Independence. [Interruption.] - All leaders from D.S. Senanayake onwards shaped our foreign policy in such a manner that made Sri Lanka a shining beacon of moderation and non-alignment and as such, we were respected by every single nation. From Washington to New Delhi and to Beijing, our leaders were always welcome and warmly embraced. That was until recently.

Yet, today, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sri Lankas standing in the international community has reached "rock bottom", so to speak, and nowhere was this amply demonstrated than at the recent UNGA Sessions in New York where Sri Lanka participated with the single largest delegation in New York in September. [Interruption.] Actually, if I quote from The Sunday Times of last Sunday, 3rd October, 2010, in an article captioned More gloom than glory in New York visit, the diplomatic editor of the newspaper writes, I quote:

Sri Lanka did not cover itself with political glory during the UN Summit last week. President Mahinda Rajapaksas reception at the Empire Room of the Waldorf Astoria did not attract any prominent world leaders - with the exception of Cyprus, Fiji and the Maldives raising serious doubts over the efficacy of the Ministry of External Affairs.

In fact, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I understand from reliable information, - from your own Ministry, Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris, - that over hundred leaders were invited including President Obama. [Interruption] But, not only were the Sri Lankan leaders snubbed by not participating at the reception, but also Sri Lankas requests for appointments with prominent leaders did not materialize. [Interruption]

I also understand that the External Affairs Ministry in August, had advised its Missions in Australia, France, Brazil, Iran, South Korea, Russia, Qatar, the UAE, Germany and the UK to seek appointments with the Heads of State, for our President attending the Sessions in New York.However, only one or two countries responded to this request. Even the much publicized photo with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel was a photograph taken in passing, at the German reception. President Rajapaksa who stopped over in Berlin en route to New York was unable to meet Chancellor Merkel in spite of several requests. [Interruption.] Even the request for an appointment with the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton did not materialize.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) That is not a point of Order. [Interruption.] He can deny it later. He has finished speaking.[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Under which Standing Order are you raising this? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is a total fabrication and the Hon. Member is misleading this House. His Excellency the President did not travel to Germany on an official matter.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) - ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Speaker - [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Please expunge that. It is absolute fabrication. Hon. Member, you are misleading the House. You are speaking absolute untruth.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The creator of "Mr. Bean" is misleading the House. According to Standing Order No. 78, he cannot refer to His Excellency the President and also infer wrong information about the President of this country. Therefore, he must withdraw that or you must expunge that, Sir. He makes wrong inferences. He cannot do that.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I think there is no such Standing Order. -[Interruption.] . . . . However, Sir, the unkindest cut was the virtually empty hall when the President spoke. We saw

the pictures of the hall. The hall was virtually empty in New York. The large number of empty seats made some observers speculate whether there was an organized boycott of the Presidents speech, especially in the light of the inaugural speech by President Obama, where there was a veiled reference definitely to the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

Standing Orders . .-[Interruption.] Thank you. This fiasco, Mr. Deputy Speaker, further tarnishing the image of our country is in stark contrast to the first visit of President Rajapaksa as Head of State to the UNGA sessions which the President accompanied me as the Foreign Minister in 2006. He was warmly welcomed and embraced by many Heads of State and his speech in Sinhala was well received. Unfortunately, within a short period of four years, Sri Lanka has managed to squander away the international goodwill our previous leaders had managed to cultivate over the years. Within four years, Mr. Deputy Speaker, President Rajapaksa is now on the verge of being labelled as a

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

leader and Sri Lanka as a pariah state along with countries like Zimbabwe and Myanmar.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, where have we gone wrong? In Sri Lankas battle against terrorism, our traditional allies such as India, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and the EU played a pivotal role in supporting the efforts of successive governments to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Some of these countries banned the LTTE while setting up special mechanisms to monitor fund raising and arms procurement activities of the LTTE. Some of these countries also trained our military from time to time.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, without the support extended by the international community over the last 10 or 15 years, winning of the war over the LTTE would have been virtually impossible. The present regime, instead of thanking our friends after the LTTE was vanquished and cementing our friendship with them in order to get the much-needed assistance for a post-war economic renaissance, have launched vitriolic attacks against them for raising concerns of human rights violations during the war.

This "shoot the messenger" policy of this Government is one of the main reasons for our present plight. The current regimes immature and juvenile rebuttals to the genuine concerns expressed by our international allies have coloured Sri Lanka in a very unfavourable light. The Government instigates rowdy protests in front of friendly embassies. For example, the hooliganism we saw opposite the UK and Norway Embassies last year. Then, we saw State vehicles putting up posters calling various foreign leaders, terrorists. For example, posters put up calling US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton a terrorist - you know by whom - and also the Government Ministers with small brains and big egos are encouraged to burn effigies of the United Nations Secretary-General and to fast in front of the United Nations compound. These are the reasons.

Our woes in the international sphere are further exacerbated by the lack of professional diplomats at our key missions abroad. At a time when Sri Lanka needs the services of experienced and refined career diplomats more than ever, our foreign service has been replaced by puerile rantings of political sycophants and never do-well relatives posing as diplomats.

In Washington, perhaps in the most important mission, the ambassador is a person who at his best was a mediocre door-to-door tea salesman. The ambassadors only qualification to hold such a post is that he is a close relative of the first family. Likewise, our man in Moscow is a person who got his diplomatic training in the night clubs of Moscow. I must admit that this was an appointment made by me against my better judgment and that of the senior officials of the Foreign Ministry on the insistence of the powers above. A man, with extremely dubious background based in Colombo, famous for its drug cartels in Colombia, has recently been appointed as Consul-General in Los Angeles and is now tipped to take over in Washington soon.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Under what Standing Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Under Standing Order No. 78. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please ! There is a point of Order being raised. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, there is a Motion of No-confidence moved in this House. During this Debate, I quoted Erskine May and I also quoted Kaul and Shakders of Indian Parliament saying that you have to confine to the contents of the Motion. You cannot speak anything which is not relevant to the Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) These are merely tactics to eat into my time. Sir, I insist on my time being given. -[Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Speaker, we have been talking about the failure of the foreign policy in Sri Lanka. That is why this Minister is blamed for the all the sins of omissions and commissions of this Government.

Having the ability to make vitriolic verbal attacks against visiting dignitaries is also seen as a qualification to become a diplomat. Sri Lankas former Permanent Representative to Geneva won the affections of the President by launching an immature and irrelevant attack against a visiting US Assistant Under-Secretary of State at Temple Trees in 2006. Like his current hero who likes to take credit for other people's hard work, he tried to snatch the credit for the so called "diplomatic victory" in defeating the EU Resolution in 2009 when, in fact this Pyrrhic victory was the outcome of the work of several senior professionals who worked tirelessly in New York and Geneva. As the chief apologist for the infamous Eighteenth Amendment and a key torch-bearer for the present Minister, he is now tipped to take over in Paris.

Unfortunately for Sri Lanka, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Foreign Service is now full of such unsuitable material. The recent influx of military officers to the Diplomatic Service is bound to confound matters even further.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I can see the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa still retains his sense of humour. That is good.

We cannot hold the Minister solely responsible for the acts of omissions and commissions in the foreign affairs sphere over the last four years. Many people in this country, who perhaps did not recognize the capricious nature of Minister Peiris, had high expectations of him to change the foreign policy direction the country has embarked on. In 1994, we too had high expectations of both the Professor Peiris and the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar when they entered the murky world of politics as National List Members of the Kumaratunga administration. While the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, a man of the highest intellectual and political integrity went on to become the best Foreign Minister Sri Lanka has ever had, Professor Peiris proved himself to be a political chameleon capable of compromising his political principles for power and position.

He abused his position in order to confer very large benefits on a company that was run by his son-in-law. Those are crimes in your country; they are crimes in our country. And just because a man contests an election does not mean he is exempted from the operation of those laws." . "FP : But General Fonseka worked with the president for some time, for example in undertaking the final operations of the campaign against the Tamil Tigers.

"The Secretary-General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his statement in Parliament on 19 May 2009 that a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved.

Presidents Rajapakse expressd his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka."

"Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lanka's international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances."
