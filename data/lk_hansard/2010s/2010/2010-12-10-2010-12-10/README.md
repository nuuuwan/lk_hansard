(c) If not, why?

( )

( - )

(The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Sir, on behalf of the Hon. Minister of External Affairs, I answer the Question as follows:

(a) The number of Honorary Consuls appointed by Sri Lankan Government worldwide during the years 2009 and 2010;

(i) 05

(ii) 1. Baharian - Mr. P.B. Higgoda - 2009.10.08

2. Croatia - Mr. Marko Vojkovic - 2009.11.05

3. Cyprus - Mr. Peiris Theofylaktou Pieri

- 2010.02.01

4. Indonesia, Bali - Mr. Eswenti Sanato - 2010.06.01

5. The Netherlands - Mr. Jozef Menken - 2010.06.01

(iii) - the promotion of bilateral trade and economic relations between

the countries to which the Honarary Consuls are appointed.

- the provision of consular assistance to Sri Lankan expatriates.

- the promotion of Sri Lankas image.

(b) (i) 1. Italy - Naples - Mr. Salvatore Puglisi

- Sicily - Mr. Francesco Guardo

- Milan - Mr. Alessio Rinaldo Fronzoni

2. Japan - Nagoya - Mr. Noboru Akahane

3. Kyrgyzstan - Mr. Mukun Aseino

4. Papua New Guinea - Mr. Wasantha K u m a r a s i r i Sweden - Gothenburg

- Ms. Margareta Haglind

6. Bahamas - Mr. Ravi Jesubatham

(ii) 1. The appointees should be preferably native-born nationals of the country of appointment.

Only if native-born nationals are not a v a i l a b l e , would Sri Lankans who have acquired the nationality of the country of accreditation or Sri Lankan passport holders long resident in the country of accreditation be considered.

2. Should be well-established persons who have distinguished themselves in their different fields of endeavour with sufficient private means to meet the financial obligations of the office.

2113 2114

2010 10

3. Should be over the age of 40 and below 65 on first appointment. They are expected to relinquish their duties on reaching the age of 70.

4. Should generally be limited to countries where there is no resident Sri Lankan representation, unless there are exceptional circumstances such as distance and so on and so forth, warranting appointment of countries where there is resident representation.

(iii) Yes.

(iv) 1. Salzburg, Austria - Ms. Barbara Kiener.

Ms. Kiener had been unable to remain in contact with our Embassy in Vienna. Hence, a note was sent to the Austrian Foreign Ministry on 07th July, 2009 by our Embassy in Vienna informing that she is no longer our Honorary Consul in Salzburg.

2. Cyprus - Mr. Doros Jeropoulos

Mr. Jeropoulos was reminded on 13th October, 2009 that he was past the age of 70 and that since the Government of Sri Lanka wished to release him from his functions, he should return the seals of office.

(c) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Minister. The reason why I asked my first Supplementary Question from you is because the Honorary Consuls do not act any more as Honorary Consuls. That is the reason why I wanted it verified by you. I would appreciate if there would be an annual review of those Honorary Consuls because they seem to be collecting money for various projects and siphoning it off, not for the benefit of the country, but for their personal well-being. I would personally give the information to you without making it public knowledge and I would appreciate if you would look into that. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, if you give us the information, then we will definitely inquire into the matter and see that they no longer hold office. We will remove them as well if they are found fault with and appoint suitable persons. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My second Question is, to my reckoning, as we have 26 Embassies worldwide and are diminishing by the day and the allocations made to them are getting reduced, why do you not use the Honorary Consul concept for trade promotional aspects because that is something you could do basically on their cost. If you could look for qualified, competent and reliable people, they can be appointed for

a year and if they show good performance, their service can be extended. Why do you not, as the Deputy Minister, look into that concept?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, we are looking into it. Last year, we called all the Honorary Consuls to Sri Lanka. We showed them around and gave them a scope of work based on our expectations. Early next year, we are expecting to call them back, give them another scope of work and ask them to work on it to promote Sri Lankas economy and its image. We are working on it. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Last time when you brought down the Honorary Consuls, you paid for their tickets, hotels et cetera. On this type of concept, ensure that they basically do it on an honorary basis and you get the benefit for the country. Otherwise, it becomes a paid holiday. That is exactly the reason why I am trying to stem the tide of these types of activities. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I am not aware whether the Government paid for them or they paid for themselves. I will look into it and get them to sort it out.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you.

I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that the total Government receipts are about Rs. 1 trillion. The total Government expenditure during the coming fiscal year is going to be nearly Rs. 2 trillion - that is Rs. 1.968 trillion. In Parliament, we are approving at this time for each of the Ministries as a collective Rs. 1.1 trillion under the different heads of Ministries. Nearly, Rs. 835 billion is going to be charged to the Consolidated Fund in terms of laws that are already approved by Parliament. But, that does not absolve Parliament from its responsibility even in the expenditure of that Rs. 835 billion. It is nearly 40 per cent of the total expenditure in the coming year. We know that in Volume 1 of the Budget Estimates that are given to all of us, the Parliamentarians, Table 2.1, which is a very important Table, provides a schedule of the provision that can be charged on the Consolidated Fund without approval through the Appropriation Bill. Now, if you look at Head 249, Department of Treasury Operations where it provides the base legislation under which it will be drawn on the Consolidated Fund - the Ceylon Development Loans Act, the National Development Loans Ordinance, the National Development Loan 1950 Act, Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance 1937 and the Foreign Loans Act (as amended), we see that there has been an estimate for recurrent expenditure of Rs. 350 billion and capital expenditure of Rs. 465 billion giving a total of Rs. 815 billion.

Now, it is instrumental for me to mention here, that there were two judgments for the Appropriation Bills of 2007 and 2008. Some of the salient points of those judgments were made when the Supreme Court determined that under Article 148 and Article 150 of the Constitution, Parliament has full control over public finance. So, funds approved in the Appropriation Bill or made under special laws authorized by Parliament have to be consistent in its application with the Constitution. I would like to read some extracts from the judgment of the Supreme Court. It states, I quote:

Since such control is exercised by Parliament in trust for the people, we are of the opinion that the process should be transparent and in the public domain, so that people who remain sovereign are informed as to the manner control is exercised.

I would like to further quote from that judgment:

Debt service and other matters in respect of which the expenditure is charged on the Consolidated Fund are equally activities of Government.

I am glad to note that since that judgment there have been corrections, and the debt service total numbers are disclosed in the Budget.

However, I further quote:

The staggering debt service payments of Rs. 722 billion for the financial year 2009, reflect an accumulation of public debt over the past years that has resulted from irresponsible and reckless handling of public finance by Treasury and a failure on the part of Parliament to exercise full control of Public Finance as mandated by Article 148 of the Constitution.

I am only quoting here from a judgment, which has both an indictment on the management of funds and on the responsibility of Parliament.

Sir, the amounts have increased in the 2011 estimates. While the Treasury officials are provided extra allocations which are deemed to have been covered by Supplementary Estimates submitted by the appropriate Minister, such transfers must be duly reported to Parliament under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003. Also, when you take the spirit of the judgment, there should be a regular reporting, not just an annual reporting of how the Consolidated Fund is going to be charged that Rs. 835 billion. The disclosures under Table 2.1 are insufficient and we would like to have details of those expenditures. We would like to have the details of the expenditures for 2010. Now, I know that the Ministry of Finance and Planning in its Annual Report for 2009 has provided some information. I have also gone through all the other publications that have been given and I am saying that more details than that need to be disclosed to Parliament if Parliament is to fully exercise due diligence over public funding.

Furthermore, Sir, I would like to point out that we are also interested in looking at the contingent liabilities that the Government incurs. These are guarantees, letters of

2165 2166

[ ]

2010 10

comfort, hedging contracts and et cetera. I see that in the year 2009, there was more than Rs. 175 billion in contingent liabilities. How much is it going to be in 2010? Somebody could say that we still do not know. But, I think budgets are budgets and estimates are estimates. Therefore, there should be an estimation and we would like to know about that estimation. How much does the Government intend its contingent liability to be in 2011? Until the dispute about the hedging contract, Parliament was not focused on the contingent liabilities. We need to know that. We cannot afford to have a repetition of such damaging commercial disputes which has put at risk the countrys ability to attract Foreign Direct Investment and therefore we have to act with responsibility.

Sir, the third matter I wish to bring to the attention of this House is that when we look at the balance sheet of the reserves of the country and if we disaggregate the reserves, we see that the IMF approximately has given US Dollars 1.5 billion. Then, there are Euro bonds of approximately US Dollars 1.5 billion in five years, in seven years and so forth and I must say that the last contracted rate of 6.25 per cent was a reasonable rate. Then, we see that the Central Bank has about US Dollars 2 billion and then we see that there is a balance of US Dollars 2 billion which is hot money or foreign holdings of domestic treasury bills.

Now, my question is this. Why does the country need US Dollars 7 billion of reserves? Why does the country need that? We need to realize that with every additional dollar of reserve, there is a huge expense. Why do we need US Dollars 7 billion of reserves and why not US Dollars 5 billion because we need to recognize that if we maintain a hot money reserve of US Dollars 2 billion at a very high rupee interest rate -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may have to wind up in another two minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I need a few more minutes from my 25 minutes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) I am sorry because there are several speakers from your side and from the Government side, they all have to be accommodated today.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Presiding Member, I will try to rush through my speech. We could potentially lose US Dollars 100 million in holding US Dollars 2 billion. This is not a small

amount. This is far more than we have lost on Mihin Air due to the mismanagement of these reserves. We are also putting pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee by unnecessarily having huge reserves and overvaluing the Sri Lankan rupee making our exports uncompetitive. This is a mismanagement of the countrys balance sheet. We need to have an investigation into this. We are paying the cost of not having an independent Central Bank under the Ministry of Finance. Internal best practices have been put in place across the world after decades of experience to derive the best where the public interest will not conflict with private interest. I welcome the statement made by the Central Bank recently with regard to the banking industry that we need more capital and therefore we need to consolidate the industry. Where will this capital come from? Indirectly taking over banks, using captive funds, will not attract foreign investment as captive funds began to take control of banks. What happened is that the investment that came into this country began to flee away. In this Budget, we see that there is going to be a creation of an investment fund and it is laudable that unusual taxes on the financing industry have been reduced in this Budget. But, that surplus should not become another captive fund of the Central Bank. I think the objective is laudable; that it should be lent for long-term projects, but the regulator should be a regulator and not an operational intervention in the market.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Presiding Member, I am concluding my speech. These are not legal arguments but this is about behaviour undermining investments coming into this country. Remember, all your fiscal incentives will not increase investment. Credibility is more important than investment. You need to be transparent and consistent with your policy.

I thank you, Sir, for your courtesy.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, the Hon. Member made certain references with regard to how the Hadj Committee conducted matters. I would like to expressly state that as regards the transportation and accommodation of Hadj pilgrims on which allegations were made, those were done satisfactorily. Also, we brought down the pilgrimage cost from Rs. 425,000 to Rs. 325,000. Certain tour operators were agitated because we did not allow them to sell those packages at a blackmarket rate. I would like to state in this House that it is historical that 6,200 persons went on the pilgrimage to perform Hadj this time because President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave us clear directions that we should ask the tour operators to sell the packages at Rs. 325,000, giving an opportunity to the poor of this country to perform Hadj. Therefore, the United National Party, including yourself, Hon. Member, is using this as a platform.

( ) (The Hon. Abdul Haleem) You are excited. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I am not excited. You sit down, Hon. Member. It is my time to speak. Would you please sit down? It is my time to speak. Hon. Haleeem, would you please sit down? Somebody has written something and you are reading that out. I know you read it for the first time. - [Interruption.] You read it for the first time. You also do not know what you are reading. You were reading somebody's statement.

Thank you.

The question of our reserves being US Dollars 7 billion and of that, US Dollars 2 billion as a result of purchasing Treasury Bills, is an indication of the fact that the foreign investor has confidence in our Government. That is what they are doing. The greater the foreign reserves that we have, the greater the confidence that the investor gains. This is exactly what is happening today. And, we have to be happy that this is being done because of the fact that there is a hostile propaganda being carried out against the Government. This hostile propaganda, raising non-existent political issues, is trying to raise the question of charges against His Excellency the President even on human rights issues so that these investors are kept away. Now, I must state here quite categorically - I know that my Colleague, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara will bear witness - that at the time the LTTE was doing a big crime of herding the civilians into the fighting area for their own protection and human shield, we became aware of that and we said that we have to be careful; these are our own people. His Excellency the President accepted that and what did he do? Ultimately a decision was taken to stop using long-distance firearms and only used short-distance small weaponry. This meant that our soldiers were much more exposed to danger. But, he did that in the interests of protecting our Tamil civilians and now he is being accused of human rights issues. Why is this being done? These are false accusations. Why is this being done? It is done so that those foreign investors would not want to come and invest here. But, now as a result of the fact that we have these reserves, those foreign investors are coming and investing here ignoring those issues. And, that is what you are trying to prevent.

Now, with regard to the question of debt, you have to accept that the debt which was 106 per cent has now come down to 83 per cent. With regard to the question of transparency, I think everything that the Central Bank and the Treasury has been doing has been disclosed to Parliament and approval from Parliament has been obtained. Therefore, do not make these baseless charges in the interest of the foreign people who are opposed to us.

Sir, I conclude by thanking you, Mr. Deputy Chairman, for the time given to me.

Thank you. [. . 1.18]

[. . 3.08]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) , . Before I start, I want to actually congratulate the Government for being more transparent than before in the Budget process. The Open Budget Survey 2010 by the International Budget Partnership has moved Sri Lanka up to be, I think, among the first 15 countries out of 94 countries. Good! It has moved up from being in the category of countries, which gives some information to the public to the category of countries which gives significant information to the public. So, that is laudable; we appreciate it and we hope that they continue this good work.

I table*, Sir, a document prepared by Mr. Chandra Jayaratne, former Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, on this matter.

The title of that is, The Shameful and Wasted Legislative Budget Process. He is pretty critical of it. But, what he is trying to say is, perhaps we should benchmark ourselves against the top country, which is New Zealand.

I quote:

When things were simmering in that state came the resignation of Ministers Philip Gunawardene and William Silva. They were

considered by M.W.H. to be his companions in progress. Their departure made him feel isolated. He did not want to continue

as a lone voice in the wilderness. He, as an honourable man, had no alternative but to resign from the Cabinet and resign he did

on the 11th of June 1959, not only from the Cabinet but also from the Senate.

; . . - - , on a Vote of Condolence moved by the Hon. Pieter Keunemen of the Communist Party. . I quote:

Philip Gunawardene, of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna who was M.W.H.s student at Ananda College, ..."

.

"....speaking on the occasion said, 'I wish to say a little more, if you will excuse me Mr. Speaker of one of the

most distinguished sons of Ceylon' - M.W.H. de Silva.'

Sir, we also appreciate the proposal made by His Excellency the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Planning, in the Budget Speech of 2011 that the target of the Government is to increase the per capita income from US Dollars 2000 to US Dollars 4,000 within a period of six years. That is, when we reach the year 2016, according to the accepted indices, each and every person will get an income of US Dollars 4,000. I have a question in regard to this. Sir, there are economic doctrines and theories which had been recognized all over the world and they cannot be denied or disputed. If a

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, item 2 of today's Order Paper is in terms of the Appropriation Act No. 43 of 2008 and according to Section 8 (1) of that Act, this should have been moved and approved by the House before the 31st of May, 2010. Now, we have come to the end of the year and this item has been in the Order Paper for the last four or five months. I do not know why the Government did not want to get approval before the 31st of May 2010. I leave it for you to explain.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Member, you read Section 9 of that Act. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Speaker, we all know that we had a General Election and thereafter the new Parliament was summoned in April. Then, we had to go to the Cabinet once again and the Cabinet approved it later. So, there is no question of bringing it before the 31st of May 2010 because this happened due to certain circumstances which arose as a result of the dissolution of Parliament. Under these circumstances, we are permitted to bring this Resolution. -[Interruption.] Yes, it can be adopted by a Resolution of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am only pointing out the legality of this Resolution.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Parliament has the power; Parliament is supreme.
