... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in the light of the great celebration that heralded a new era in this country yesterday - the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment - I rise in this House to speak with a sense of elation and happiness, that which the nation wanted - a great revolution - wrought yesterday. The working class in this country was very jubilant and they took to the streets celebrating yesterdays historic occasion by lighting crackers and other forms of expression of happiness in the streets. There were very many demonstrations in support of the working class, particularly of the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, so successfully.

So, Sir, this is an epoch-making period. I could not do better than remembering the great English novelist and thinker, Charles Dickens (1812-1870). In his novel, A Tale of Two Cities, he had written this in the opening paragraph. But, I would like to, with apologies to Charles Dickens, quote this in his inimitable style in the House today: It was the best of times for Mahinda Rajapaksa, it was the worst of times for Ranil Wickremasinghe; it was the age of wisdom for MR, it was the age of foolishness for RW; it was the epoch of belief for MR, it was the epoch of incredulity for RW; it was the season of light for MR, it was the season of darkness for RW; it was the spring of hope for MR, it was the winter of despair for RW; Mahinda Rajapaksa had everything before him, Ranil Wickremasinghe had nothing before him; we were all in the Government side going direct to heaven, they, in the Opposition were all going direct the other way".

In short, the period of Mahinda Rajapaksa's reign is supreme and sublime in every superlative description.

So, Sir, in this atmosphere, we are very happy that the Hon. Gamini Lokuge, Minister of Labour Relations and Productivity Improvement, has presented the National Institute of Labour Studies Bill in this House today, a much sought after legislation. In "Mahinda Chintana", you find inscribed, . Now, this is the prime objective of this Bill. The President has taken all steps possible through "Mahinda Chintana" not only to build peace in this country, to develop this country, but even - particularly - to look after the interests of the working class. I remember yesterday our veteran trade union leader, Seyed Alavi Moulana, the Governor of the Western Province too took to the streets with jubilation with the entire working class movements behind him and with other leaders of the SLFP and the UPFA. This is the scene that is witnessed all over the country today. That is why we are very happy to give our consent to this Bill that is before the House today.

Sir, this has been modelled on the lines of V.V. Giri National Labour Institute - VVGNLI - an autonomous body of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India. It was set up in 1974. It is a premier institute of research, training and education in the area of labour. So, the General Council there - I would like to state this for the information of the authorities - will be executing this Bill hereafter. The General Council, the apex governing body of the Institute, with Union Labour and Employment Minister as its President, lays down the broad policy parameters for the functioning of the institute. The Executive Council with Secretary (Labour and Employment) as a Chairman, monitors and guides the activities of the Institute. Both the General Council and the Executive Council are tripartite in nature and consist of members representing the Government, trade union federations and employers associations.

So, everything laudable is included in this Bill. They have embraced everyone. They have embraced every strata of the society that matters in order to carry forward the objectives of the National Institute of Labour. There are in the structure, eminent scholars and practitioners in the field of labour. The Director of the Institute there, is the Principal Executive and is responsible for management and administration. The Director is aided in the day-to-day functioning by a faculty consisting of 10 professionals representing a wide range of disciplines and support by administrative staff.

My good Friend, the Hon. Arundika Fernando preceding me mentioned about the SriLankan Airlines amalgamation with the UAE. Before the SriLankan

Airlines, Sir, there was Air Ceylon. - -

- I was working there. Sir, today I would only focus attention on the Hon. Minister, that after the liquidation of Air Ceylon, there were arrears due; there were arrears to be paid for certain employees and staff who were working there. The late Hon. Dharmasiri Senanayake was trying to do it, but unfortunately, he was not to be there for long. Then, the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle took action to settle these arrears but that too did not bear results. Today, I would urge the Hon. Gamini Lokuge and also the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne who were always interested in the working class to take action to pay the arrears due arrears to the Air Ceylon employees.

The Opposition wants to destroy everything. They do not want to see the light of day. They always want to be in darkness - day in and day out. We build on labour institutes, schools, maternity homes and hospitals, but the JVP destroyed all those things. Now, today they are coming here and talking about the rights of the working class. What right do they have? My giddy aunt! I would say - what right do they have to speak about the labour movement? They killed labourers, politicians, doctors, teachers, policemen and all others whom they considered their enemies. They can claim no stake whatsoever in the discussion of the Bill that is before the House today.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up. Your time is over.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me one more minute, Sir. So, the country is now ready to take off for the better and create a "Wonder Land".

Yesterday, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe was talking about the Bill that was passed and I also made a remark on that. . ? . "

!"

'' .

, This is the way - if you want to develop the country, you must have a strong leadership. So, Sir, I would take your leave by presenting a poem that is popular - a song very well sung - a sweet song.

"There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza, There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza,"

Hon. Member, (Mrs.) Malani Fonseka, is listening to this very interestingly. So, the song goes.

Today, Sir, this song has been returned and sung at Sirikotha by a troupe: Yvonne, Chitra, Sobana, Medagedara and Abesekara. What do they sing now?

"There is a hole in your bucket, dear Ranila, dear Ranila, Hundreds of holes in your bucket, dear Ranila, dear Ranila, No water holds in your bucket, Oh! dear Ranila Oh, my giddy aunt! - Nor could you hold UNPers in your bucket, dear Ranila, dear Ranila.."

This is the catastrophic scene witnessed in the opposition rank, today.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Karunanayake, you may now move the Motion.

PRESENT ROLE OF CENTRAL BANK ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for permitting me to move the Adjournment Motion, which concerns the present role of the Central Bank. I move:

A country can progress rapidly if a strong and resilient economy is established. For that, financial discipline and coherent economic policies are essentials.

The Central Bank which used to be a non-political organization was at the apex of protecting such policies. However, Central Bank has now badly tainted itself by dabbling in derivatives -hedging, buying minority shares in many companies and exposing the risk to EPF, ETF, not protecting financial companies from the depositors point of view.

Today, the finance companies are endangered. The Central Bank Supervisory Division is having a laissez-faire attitude, not providing the rigid protection that is expected. Golden Key Company Limited, Pramuka Bank, IFCL, Okanda Finance, are amongst many other finance establishments which have taken innocent peoples money and now the depositors, the employees are left in the lurch. The assets are being stripped of the failed finance companies but, the benefits have not gone to the depositors as yet.

Central Bank is using EPF, ETF captive funds under their purview and purchasing minority share interests in many companies which the Government has previously privatized.

Furthermore, the Central Bank involvement in derivatives in hedging is putting Sri Lanka into a dangerous financial exposure with arbitration cases exposing Sri Lanka to a vulnerable position.

Therefore, will the Minister advise as to how this institution will be made to accomplish the statutory role that it is expected to play rather than politicize the institution.

Now, Sir, let me briefly explain the contents of this Motion.

The second paragraph of the Motion states that the Central Bank used to be a non-political organization and was at the apex of protecting such policies. However, the Central Bank has now badly tainted itself by dabbling in derivatives, that is hedging, buying minority shares in many companies and exposing the risk to EPF and ETF, not protecting financial companies from the depositors point of view.

The third paragraph deals with the laissez-faire attitude that is being shown and action taken by the Central Bank especially when it came to the finance companies of this country. The Central Bank is using EPF

and ETF monies to buy minority shares for no apparent reason. If the Government has spelt it out in their policy, then it can be even accepted. But, even without amendments to the Central Bank Act, which is the regulator, the controller of the EPF and ETF, they are doing what is completely contrary to what has been pursued, and to the Government policy. So, the Central Bank, once again I state, in involving in the hedging deal, has placed the country in a great financial jeopardy.

Let me, Sir, before I go forward, just mention about the present economic situation in the country. With the two-thirds that the Government has obtained, the magnitude of the confidence that they have established, the euphoria that they have created, they now think that the country is moving at a high turbo speed. We have no problem in them thinking so, and we will let them be in their own expectations. But, look at what is really happening in the economy today. "Lanka Business Online" of September 01, 2010 states, "Sri Lanka trade deficit surges amid economic recovery". It further states that the trade deficit has expanded by 108 percent, to US Dollars 2.84 billion in the first six months of the year 2010. So, the total exports has accounted for US Dollars 3.6 billion and the imports for US Dollars 6.4 billion resulting in US Dollars 2.84 billion deficit. Now, this is a growing concern. What action has the Government taken in that regard? The Government newspapers would say that there is an increase in the exports; it grew by 13.7 per cent, not showing that the imports grew by 42 per cent. Now, who would finance the 29 per cent deficit? These are the questions for which the professionals, the people in the economic field would like to have an answer from the Government out of their policy. The Government is entrusted with running the economy for a temporary period of time but that has got to be done keeping with the international norms, economic policies, financial disciplines and with the economic plans of the Government that they spell out from time to time. So that is one area.

As per the Fiscal Responsibility Act, it is mandatory to give the actual economic position of the country. When I was just perusing a document which was tabled in Parliament a month ago, I was surprised to note the bank guarantees given by the Central Bank on behalf of the Government. They have given the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation - Rs. 120 billion; the CEB - Rs. 40 billion; Mihin Air - Rs 1.5 billion; SriLankan Airlines - Rs 1.2 billion; the State Trading Corporation - Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, Rs 4.2 billion and worst of all, the Peoples Bank, and the Pension Department - Rs. 2.5 billion. These are some of the bank guarantees that have been given; I have taken up what basically concerns the day to day activities.

Then, Sir, going on further, the Sri Lanka Customs had detained this week's issue of "The Economist" Magazine carrying an article titled, "Sri Lanka's post-war recovery - Rebuilding, but at a cost". I put these issues to the background just to come to the main point. The Central Bank has been established not for its Governor to have breakfast with a beauty queen who comes in the morning; not for the Central Bank economists to go and pick up minority shares in banks, which is not in the Government policy. Maybe the Government is thinking otherwise, but then, that has to be spelt out by the Finance Minister and on this instance the Finance Minister is the President of the country. But, there is no indication by the Government of such a thing.

Now I would like to deal with the aspect of the Governments borrowing. Let me take up this particular matter. I asked a question in the House about a month ago as to how many billion rupees come from China, as aid. The answer that was given which is also a half truth - I will deal with that in another instance owing to lack of time - was US Dollars 3,057 billion and I asked the percentage that comes as grant. The reply was only one per cent. That is the stark reality. Even though they say that China is giving aid, we have got to accept that it is only one per cent of the total aid that comes as grant, that is Rs. 30.57 billion. I now refer to the "The Island-World View" of Thursday, 9th September, 2010 where Indias Prime Minister says Chinas territorial ambition must be challenged. In the second paragraph, it states that China's growing influence in neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, Burma, Nepal and Pakistan is of concern.

Sir, the Central Bank is a neutral body. They have got to look at the borrowing capacity and the paying capacity.

Here, for US Dollars 3,057 billion borrowed, the average interest is around 6 to 7 per cent. You know that the lending rates of the World Bank and the IMF are 1/2 per cent, 1/4 per cent, 1 per cent with a grace period of 10 years, rather than 3 or 4 years. Now, take the Hambantota Port where you basically invest Rs. 440 billion at an interest rate of 6.5 to 7 per cent. The interest cost only per year is roughly about Rs. 4.2 billion. I repeat: the interest cost only is around Rs. 4.2 billion. I will not deal with the whole area, I will deal with only a part of it.

Can the Central Bank guarantee that the country would not go into a debt trap? These are the areas we have got to look at.

One other area I have mentioned in my Adjournment Motion, as a point, is the finance companies. I can remember summoning the present Governor of the Central Bank before the COPE in the year 2006 and asking him, "Is the Central Bank on top of the economic situation that is prevalent?" The answer he categorically gave was, Yes, if not, we will put this before the House. My Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella was there; the Hon. John Amaratunga was there. When we asked the Governor in September, he said, By the first week of November, we will put this before the House. But, what happened? Two months later, finance companies ran into problems. I cannot remember the exact finance companies, but they ran into problems. We have been trying since then to date to summon the Governor of the Central Bank, but giving various reasons such as he was not in the country, he has not come before the COPE. But, finance companies such as Okanda Finance, CFL, Sakvithi Finance Company, F & G, Golden Key have all run aground and no answer has been given.

Then, the Pramuka Bank, about which a big story was mentioned of depositors being paid. What percentage of depositors were paid? There was a question asked in Parliament for which an answer was given that only 10 per cent of the depositors have been paid. What has happened to the others? Nothing has happened. These are the areas where the Central Bank regulators have to play a financial supervisory role. It has got to be done in these types of areas, not go on a witch-hunt on Members of the Opposition et cetera. What have they done? They are talking of the Pramuka Bank, but nothing has been paid.

Then, I move on to the area of bank supervision. You have the famous "KP". We do not know whether he is under arrest or whether he is in the Government tourists list. In an article titled "Ex-LTTE Chief 'KP': The Tiger Who Changed His Strips", the Daily Mirror of 10th July, 2010 reported - see the audacity of this person - that he has been part of Neervely bank robbery of Rs. 8.1 million in 1981.

485 486

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) In Nilaveli. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Not Nilaveli. I thought it was, but it is spelt "N-e-e-r-v-e-l-y". I quoted that from the "Daily Mirror". He was also interviewed by the "Business Today". So, see the audacity. Take any Sri Lankan who works. , , , , . bail . . 8.1 ? 1981 passport . . cases withdraw ? ? , ? The Central Bank is the apex body that controls these types of areas. But, they do nothing on those areas.

Then, look at the area of financial discipline, the financial hub that is being spoken of. Those are things that we have been dreaming of and I must say those are the areas on which the Government must go on. We, as the Opposition, are very happy if the Government can pursue the polices that we embarked on. But, what is on? I am quoting again from an article titled "Financial hub status hinges on oil hedging deal - Daniel", which appeared on page one and continued on page 12 of the "Financial Times" of the "Daily Mirror" of 07th September, 2010, in which Asian Banker CEO Emmanuel Daniel says, I quote:

A deal is a deal and a contract is a contract. Sri Lanka can forget about financial hub status if the hedging issue cannot be resolved. No bank will trust a system that has the power to overrule their contracts.

These are matters that are being referred to by Asian bankers who are trying to establish Sri Lanka as a financial hub. This is what the United National Party tried to do from 1977 to 1994. We did it and we tried to reinvent and bring the system back into order from 2001 to 2004 when President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga displaced us, ending the six-year tenure of office in two years. Now, what are they saying? Who went into the financial hedging deal? The Governor of the Central Bank. When they were earning Rs. 120 million, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie proudly came here and said, We earned Rs. 120 million. Who was behind that deal? The wizkids behind that were the Governor and the Hon. Fowzie, they say. But, when the problem comes up, everybody puts the blame on some puny clerk at some place or a chairman of some institution. Why? What is your responsibility? Today, the Citibank, the Standard

Chartered Bank, the Commercial Bank of Germany, the Peoples Bank and the Commercial Bank of Sri Lanka are in litigation. They are having a problem today dealt at arbitration level, with a contingent liability on Sri Lanka of almost Rs. 95 billion to Rs. 110 billion. That is part of the reason why the petrol price has still not been reduced. When the cost of petrol is only about Rs. 55, today they are selling it at Rs. 115 to Rs. 116. It is obviously because they are trying to cover a percentage for the hedging deal. That is why people like Mr. Emmanuel Daniel say, "Financial hub status hinges on oil hedging deal" and that puts Sri Lanka into a huge problem. We want a financial hub. Is the hedging deal part of the problem? What I am saying is that if the Central Bank was neutral, if it was doing what it was expected of through what was legislated by Parliament, none of these problems would have arisen.

Then, Sir, I will move on to my next point. The Central Bank is entrusted with the running of the EPF and the ETF. It is supposed to be the regulator; it is supposed to be the monitor which monitors. Now, that same person goes and buys shares in minority companies. Under Section 5 of the Employees Provident Fund Act, No. 15 of 1958, the Central Bank is precluded from doing such activities because it is the regulator. You cannot do policing and be part of the buying sphere as well. On that score, there can be defences to say, Yes, we would like to increase our portfolio; we would like to increase the wealth of the Fund. It is perfectly okay. Then, let us get the Act amended. We are talking about an Act of 1953. People are being harassed under the Exchange Control Act of 1953 and the Employees Provident Fund Act, No. 15 of 1958. Then, amend those and make them a reality. That is where the problem lies. You cannot take something archaic and then run the institutions under threat at this particular moment with it.

Now, as I said, the regulator cannot be regulating as well as operating. The EPFs new search is to buy minority shares. The Government brings in regulation saying, You cannot hold more than 10 per cent or 15 per cent in concert with a company or a bank". The Central Bank is maintaining the EPF on behalf of all the workers. We, as the workers, contribute and the contribution is looked after. It is the regulator that is looking after it. Here, he goes and buys into shares. I will just give certain examples. They have bought 1.65 per cent of shares of Sampath Bank. Does buying 1.65 per cent of shares help in getting certain benefits to the Government? Then, why do they want to go after minority shares? A classic example was buying into shares of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation. The Ceylon Hotels Corporation was sold by this same Government under former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga when the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike was the Minister of Tourism. This is a Government that says, they never privatize. But, they privatized that. The Government has the properties under its custody. They are the ones who have an

487 488

2010 09

agreement with the Hotels Corporation Group, which basically says that they have rented it out for an "X" amount for a certain period. They sell it and then the Central Bank goes and buys the same shares from the Hotels Corporation that was privatized three years ago. What is the logic behind this, unless it was done by somebody who had some devious mind. By buying 11 per cent of shares, does he get a directorship over that? Does it help to get somebody else to hold that directorship?

Then, look at certain other things that had been done. They go and buy shares of Riverina Hotels. They go and buy 12 per cent of shares from Eden. They buy 4 per cent of shares from Riverina Hotels. Then, two weeks later, the people whom they have brought in run the failed finance companies, go and co-operate with those hotels. Two weeks before that, the Central Bank, which regulates those matters, goes and buys 4 per cent and 12 per cent of shares of those hotels. Thereafter, the people who are trying to revive the finance companies,- whom I do not want to mention here because they are not here to defend themselves, but I would like to mention them - go and buy the controlling rights of those groups. Is there some ulterior motive behind this? See what more has happened. You have bought 3.2 per cent of shares of the Commercial Bank, 5.71 per cent of HNB shares, 2 per cent of shares of DFCC Bank and 3.6 per cent of shares of John Keells Holdings. What is the purpose of doing this? By Section 5 of the Employees Provident Fund Act, No. 15 of 1958, you are precluded from doing so, but despite that, you go and buy those. Now, the innocent workers have no control. They get a negative return at this moment. Inflation runs at 22 per cent, 28 per cent, 30 per cent, and one and a half years ago they got a return of only 11 per cent. Now, where does this benefit go? Basically, if they decide today over a breakfast meeting that they buy 10 per cent today and they pay Rs. 100 million; three days later they say, before it reduces I will sell 10 per cent at Rs. 50 million, then who takes the loss? These are things that happen in the corporate world. That is why the regulators have been told not to do this. Now, when they do this, what is the ramification that is there?

Sir, how many more minutes do I have? ( ) (The Presiding Member) Ten minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Another 12 minutes must be the balance. As soon I finish my speech, I need to give 10 minutes to my Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Very well. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, going on this basis, there is a necessity to regulate this. I am sure another Colleague who is a banker is here, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne and all of them will basically agree with me. All I am trying to say is, with the EPF, ETF monies that are in the custody of the Central Bank, you cannot be doing this type of horse-trading. I mentioned the reasons; the attitudes and the basic principles that are there. The Hotels Corporation is one classic example. Riverina and Eden Hotels were another super example and the next one is the Dialog company. It is a company that is losing money. These people go and buy. What is the purpose in doing that? There is another hotel. You went and bought a minority share of one person. They bought the shares of that person and that person went and bought another hotel. So, why did the Central Bank not go and buy the Ceylon Continental Hotel directly? These are the mysterious things in using these captive funds. But, today the same person who stopped the checking of pyramid funds in this country, basically harasses the business sector, if they do not sing hosannas to the Government. They are the same people who set this regulator to run amok in doing certain things.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. Your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I would not take further time, because I would like the contribution from my Colleague as well. But, all I want to say is that in none of the finance companies which have been stripped of their assets and sold, the benefits have gone down to the people who have deposited their money. If so, let them come forward and tell us. The depositors of Pramuka Bank have not been paid. The hedging deal has put the country into a serious financial jeopardy as well as putting us out of the financial hub that we could easily be leading into.

The next one is, dabbling in the minority shares, which has not helped the Government, not helped the workers, except maybe one or two people. So once again, I state that the Central Bank Governor is there to govern independently, not on a political basis, not to be talking of Government policies or not to be going for breakfasts with beauty queens who are coming. He has got to do what he is entrusted with and legislated from this House. This is what I say want to say and I hope that will be an acceptable explanation coming from the Government.

Thank you.

Mr. Presiding Member, I just want to shed some light in the context of what my Colleague stated; that is about the politicization of the Central Bank.
