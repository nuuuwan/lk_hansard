[. . 10.57]

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I wish to first thank you for affording me this opportunity to participate and make my first speech at the very first Debate that has been taken up in this Seventh Parliament.

The word debate envisages deliberation, exchange of opposing ideas and the ability for one to convince the other and try to change the viewpoint of opposing positions. Unfortunately at this Debate, even before the Debate begins, this Assembly and even this country knows what the result would be. We deliberate, but at the time of voting, it goes on party lines.

However, this particular Motion to extend the state of Emergency by the Hon. Prime Minister has another aspect to it and that is, even if by an overwhelming majority vote the state of Emergency is extended for another month, there are regulations that are made under those Emergency powers. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs in his detailed speech listed the changes that were being made to the Emergency Regulations that have been imposed until the 2nd of May, 2010. Therefore, with the hope that whatever suggestions that are made at this Debate will be taken into account even in the future when the Emergency Regulations are amended, I venture to point out three aspects and respond to three matters that the Hon. Minister of External Affairs listed yesterday. He said, this is a progressive step; we cannot do away with the State of Emergency once and for all; we have to do it step by step. In that process he listed around 12 items that have been done away with in the Emergency Regulations of 2005. Unfortunately, there are a dozen Emergency Regulations that are in extent and only one of those has been amended. I would not say that the amendments are cosmetic, but I would not go as far as to say that they are substantial either. It is true that powers to impose curfew and various other extraordinary powers that had been granted have now been taken away, but more importantly, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that another set of Emergency Regulations namely, Emergency Regulation (Prevention and Prohibition of Terrorism and Specified Terrorist Activities) No. 7 of December, 2006, has been left untouched.

The Emergency Regulations of 2005 are the set of Regulations that ordinarily have to come into force when a state of Emergency is declared and those are substantially the same as that we had from 1995. But, the one that I am referring to now of 2006 is an extraordinary set of Regulations that was brought in, perhaps due to the fact that at that time there was a Ceasefire Agreement in force conceded by the Government in power at that time because in January 2008, the Government acted under that Agreement and gave notice of abrogation. So, in December 2006, the matters that were declared offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act were brought in through the backdoor, as it were, by the Emergency Regulations of December, 2006. There is heavy criticism by various persons about the content of those Regulations: they are over-broad, vague. Even having dealings with somebody who has dealings with a terrorist is an offence; advising a person who is involved in terrorist activity is an offence. Then, that even touches the privilege of attorneys-at-law to advise somebody to surrender.

That takes me to another Regulation, the Regulation that provides for rehabilitation of surrendees. I think that is another draconian piece because it says that when a person surrenders and the act of surrender is merely his own confession in content, he is taken for what is called "rehabilitation". That goes against all norms, that a person must first be pronounced by a competent court to have committed an offence. Even the Prevention of Terrorism Act has safeguards as to how confessions are made admissible. There are safeguards: you have to make that to a person not below the rank of ASP and so on. Where it involves surendees, that regulation has been left untouched and it was stated in this House yesterday that there are over 11,000 such surrendees kept in an undisclosed place. Although the Hon. Minister of External Affairs stated that a big step has been taken in removing various powers under the Emergency, I think that that is not correct because one out of about twelve Regulations has been slightly amended.

The power of the armed forces to exercise police powers is another matter, which is specifically stated and that continues to be in force. That again is one that is fraught with serious dangers of abuse. There are even the powers to carry out investigations by armed forces. Generally, the powers that are only left with the police are given to the armed forces and those are to still continue. The second issue that I wish to highlight is a very unfortunate one and that is this. We can discuss and debate what is printed under Emergency Regulations and what are given to us. But, I will give two examples of instances where even the powers that are given under the Emergency Regulations are not utilized. One is the High Security Zone in Valikamam in Jaffna. The other is the forcible internment of displaced persons in Vavuniya. Neither of these two examples that I cite come under any Emergency Regulation whatsoever. These are only two

2010 05 173 174

examples of flagrant violations, of total illegality. So, what is the point, I ask, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, of framing regulations, then pruning them down and making announcements that we have done away with the draconian provisions when the Government acts totally outside even those powers that are given under the Emergency Regulations? There is not a single detention order for those 80,000 odd persons - that is the number, the Government says - who are still in the camps. An application has been filed in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court perhaps is so embarrassed that for months no order has been given even with regard to leave to proceed. Ordinarily, on the very first day of support, an order is given either to proceed or that it is dismissed. Several dates have been given for the order and now there is no date at all. For the first time ever in the history of this country, the Supreme Court has not given a date to make an order with regard to leave to proceed.

It is the same with regard to the High Security Zone in Jaffana. An application has been pending in the Supreme Court for the last six years. There is even a judicial pronouncement that it is illegal. Several consequential orders have been made for persons to be resettled in those areas, but apart from a few who were permitted to be resettled in the outer periphery six years ago, not one single person has been allowed inside and that is not a prescribed High Security Zone. There are many areas that have been declared under the Emergency Regulations as High Security Zones, but not Valikamam in Jaffna. Over 100,000 persons are displaced as a result of that.

So, the point I am making is that, it is well and good to discuss what powers are being removed, how we are going on step by step, but all that is irrelevant, all that becomes useless when the Government acts totally outside the powers that are given even through these extraordinary powers of Emergency Regulations. The third issue is with regard to an announcement that the Hon. Minister of External Affairs made yesterday. That is, His Excellency the President has decided to appoint a Reconciliation Commission. He added that this Commission would be in the line with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. We welcome this move. Truth must be told. After all, it is the truth that will set everyone free. But, for truth to be told, as was stated this morning in this House during this Debate, there needs to be a change of attitude. For true reconciliation to take place, one must first understand and accept the fact that this protracted war that went on for over 30 years was not merely fought by a ragtag army, a group of armed men. The very fact that the Hon. Minister says that reconciliation is necessary is enough proof that the Government concedes that as a result of this protracted war, communities in this country have been alienated from each other and we need a processes of reconciliation. For that to happen, attitudes must change, as I said.

I want to highlight one issue with regard to the announcement that there is going to be a week of commemoration or victory celebration to mark what happened last year beginning 12th of May. Last year when there were victory celebrations, I happened to be walking on the streets when buses from various parts of the country came to Colombo for the victory celebrations and we were taunted on the streets, like how they do at big matches, I was told, , . That was the attitude. That hurts; that alienates people. That is not in the spirit of reconciliation that the Hon. Minister for External Affairs stated yesterday. I hope that even when this week is taken to mark the occasion of the end of an armed conflict, it is done sensitively and that the commemoration is as much for the soldiers who died and were maimed and lost various other facilities as for every other Sri Lankan citizen who died and lost facilities, because all those who died in this war are Sri Lankans. All those who lost their limbs, their loved ones, their homes and various other things are all Sri Lankans. We need to address this occasion with a sense of grief. It is not a sense of triumphalism of one over the other but a sense of grief that our country has had to go through this kind of spell and perhaps the sense of relief that we are now coming out of it. Unless our attitude changes in that direction we cannot even think in terms of other processes of reconciliation.

The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah detailed a story yesterday in this House. He told this House that there was a thirteen-year-old teenager who was taken into detention 14 years ago and therefore, for more than half of his life he has been in detention and that he has not committed any offence and he does know why he is in detention. This is not an example that I am giving you. This is an example that was given to this House by a Member of the Government Bench. So I take it, that he knows what he is talking about. That must be one case out of hundreds, even thousands, who are languishing in detention. How can we then say that we are completely free when a teenager who is taken in does not even know, according to the Hon. Deputy Minister himself, why he has been kept behind bars for 14 long years? The Deputy Minister stated this, but did not say what remedial measures have been taken by the Government in that regard. Unless we address these issues, we will not be able to move forward in this process of reconciliation. War is a bad thing. After all, this country and the majority of Buddhist adherents in this country have a connection with Emperor Ashokas conversion to Buddhism. If one thinks about that, his conversion to Buddhism was after a war that he won, through grief that so much was lost during that war. And, if Emperor Ashokas offspring brought Buddhism to this country, that is our history, as true Buddhists and others who follow various other religions who also believe that killing is bad, to simply put it, we must grieve over the hundreds and thousands of persons who lost their lives during this 30-year war.

[ . . ]

We oppose the extension of the state of Emergency for the reasons that I stated, because even the assurance given by the Hon. Minister of External Affairs that these are substantial changes does not convince us. I highlighted some of the provisions that still exist and must be done away with as quickly as possible. I hope the Government will look at the other Emergency Regulations that are in force, particularly the one that was promulgated in December 2006, and take steps to repeal those provisions as well. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman, while urging the Government to take those steps, I would also urge the Government not to act outside the pale of law, outside the strict provisions of the law. The rule of law must prevail and it was only two examples that I gave where a large number of persons are affected. That must be remedied forthwith. If we are to say that we are taking definite and concrete steps to return to normality, then these are some of the essential steps that must be taken. I hope the Government will do that at least in the future. Mr. Deputy Chairman, I will wind up with my third point repeating that the process of reconciliation and truth-telling must commence with changes of attitude and when people tell their stories, they must be received in a spirit that will encourage them to tell their stories. Thank you very much.

[. . 1.42] ( ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha)

Mr. Presiding Member, I should begin by thanking you and the party I represent for giving me the opportunity to speak here today. Many years ago, as a child, I used to attend debates in Parliament and marvel at the learning and commitment of our Members of Parliament. That was in the old Chamber, which was a place of great dignity. I must admit to some sorrow that when I first attended a debate in this Chamber, the debate, I think saw Parliament at its worst. It was the occasion when the Hon. (Mrs.) Bandaranaikes Civic Rights were taken away and I thought then that anyones dreams of becoming a Member of Parliament were totally misplaced. It seemed then that the excessive grandeur of this Chamber went hand in hand with a reduction of the dignity of Parliament, and the situation got worse when that Parliament ensured its own extension without permitting a general election. I am grateful, therefore, to His Excellency the President and the Government that guided us over the last four years to overcome the legacy of authoritarianism and terror that has repressed this country since the early eighties. I hope, Sir, that under the guidance of the Hon. Speaker, this Parliament will be able to herald a return to the dignity and sense of responsibility of earlier Parliaments. I address this House in English for a variety of reasons. One is, the point made by the Hon. Minister of External Affairs that the Emergency is a topic of interest in other countries too. But, more important, Sir, is that through debate - one of the main functions of Parliament - I hope to convince Parliamentarians who are not familiar with Sinhala that they should either support this Motion to extend the Emergency under revised conditions or at least not oppose it. I address myself particularly to those Members from the Jaffna District who spoke yesterday in Tamil and suggested, what seemed to me, extreme views on the current context. One of those Members - I think that is the best answer to the Hon. Member from the National List - talked of a war victory last year of Sinhalese over Tamils and that is nonsense. This Government, aided by loyal public servants, servicemen and a general public tired of terror - Tamils, Muslims as well as Sinhalese - registered a victory for Sri Lankans over terrorism and it is on that basis that we need to move forward. In that respect, today's Motion represents compromise, which, I hope will lead to consensus. As a liberal, as a Representative of a Government committed to the middle path laid down by the founder of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, I am pleased to support this Motion. As you are aware, we have to steer between extremes at this stage.

215 216

On the one hand, there are those who say there is no danger and therefore, no need of special security precautions. On the other, there are those who say this Government is too lax, it should have recruited 100,000 more soldiers to the army and it should not have begun releasing the displaced without more stringent security checks. Sir, it is a peculiarity of the Sri Lankan political system that we have in our midst individuals who have enunciated both these viewpoints, not simultaneously, but without any explanation for their change of mind. The conclusion is inescapable that we have to deal today with individuals who will say anything for political purposes. I do not have time to address the concerns of those who think we are being too lax, since most rational people will realize that the security situation today is much better than a year ago. However, security is the primary duty of Government. Some liberals would say it was the only duty of Government, though encompassing not only physical security, but also financial and legal security. To these, obviously in the Sri Lankan context, we must add social, food, energy and environmental security. But, things being better, the Regulations have been relaxed. I do not need to go into this in detail since the Minister for External Affairs had described the changes, but I should note that I am shocked that hardly any Member of the Opposition has bothered to consider the changes themselves. I was surprised that one distinguished Member complained that he did not know what they were when they were staring him in the face. The fact is, in changing requirements as to publications, periods of arrest, requirements for registration and many others, the Government is making it clear that its aim is to restore normalcy as soon as possible, but without taking away from its primary responsibility of providing security to all our citizens. In this respect, Mr. Presiding Member, I would urge the Hon. Members of the former TNA, rid as they are now of pressures from terrorists, to look at this proposal in a fresh light. If they vote against this, they are suggesting, as they have done before, that they will not meet people moving halfway; they want everything. We have heard, Sir, of the boy who cried wolf when there was no danger, but Sri Lanka must be the only country where the boys persisted in saying "no wolf, no wolf" when the Tiger was howling at the door. Now, they must realize that though the Tiger is no longer there, they must help us to ensure that it does not return in another form so that they, like us, can continue to enjoy the fruits of democracy. I would urge them, therefore, at least to abstain on this occasion to make it clear that they would like to move forward together with us. I was horrified that one Hon. Member of Jaffna, with a display of racism that has done so much to prevent progress in this country, urged all Tamil-speaking Hon. Members to vote against this Motion. That shows a continuing failure to understand

the courage and objectivity of those Tamils and Muslims who have stood up for the rights of all our people, not only those of their own kind in struggling against terrorism. I hope, therefore, that all such Hon. Members, instead of playing politics, will register now the efforts this Government is making to move us all forward and will refrain from partisan politics in the Vote today. In this context, I would like to congratulate the National List Member from the TNA for his studied, moderate speech that did much to make up for the extreme partisan criticism of his Colleagues. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you are left with only one minute. ( ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I take his point that there is further to go and I hope he and his party will join with the Government to enable us to make the journey together. That would immeasurably be facilitated by recognition that we have started on that journey with todays relaxation of some Regulations and in that respect, I would urge a positive view of the Motion before us today. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, the point has been raised that this House has no power to control another institution. As far as the courts are concerned, the Leader of the Opposition this morning very clearly elaborated what is enshrined in the Constitution as courts of law. You cannot consider a general court martial as a court of law. It is a quasi-judicial body and therefore I do not think this institution - [Interruption.] Even if you consider separation of powers, the supremacy of Parliament has to be safeguarded. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) I cannot allow a debate on this. Hon. Member, you are senior enough not to sabotage the Business of the House. Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you are a very senior Member. Calm down, please. Let him speak. [Interruption.]

. , , , . . [. . 3.55] . . ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminadan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am obliged and thankful for giving me the opportunity of addressing this august Assembly today. I must also thank the leadership of my Party for nominating me as a National List Member and I take the responsibility that I should carry out my duties to the utmost. At this stage, I also wish to state and pay my reverence to my forefathers, my great grandfather, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, who was a Member of this Legislature and his grandfather, who was a Member in the Legislature in 1834 under the Colebrook Commission was Arumugampillai Comaraswamy. So, I hope that I could keep up the privileges and the status that my forefathers had done to an august Legislature of this nature. Today, we have seen a number of Hon. Members speaking on the subject of the extension of the state of Emergency. A few minutes ago, we saw in the Chamber itself an unstable situation which created a little bit of a chaotic situation whilst the Legislature was on. Therefore, we should see that in an august Assembly of this nature, we bring some sort of discipline and make this a place where the public will have to have an image on us. For a period of more than fours years and eight months, this situation, the extension of the state of Emergency has been debated and discussed. On paper, certain things can be taken and revoked, but ultimately in the practical field where a person has to face the law of this country, there has to be justice. Whatever the laws may be in this country, whatever the Criminal Procedure or these Acts or the courts may bring to the country, the people who maintain law and order, the people who maintain justice in this country, should be able to uphold the true spirit of the law. But, I am sorry to say that at this stage we have seen and we have experienced the deterioration of justice and law in this society. Therefore, it is our earnest request and my earnest request from the Hon. Prime Minister and the leaders of the Governing party to see at least there is law and justice brought to this country and it is enforced without any political interference. This is what we want. This is what we call justice. We can have documentation; we can sign documentation; we can extend certain rules. But ultimately when you go to enforce them, we see exactly what is happening in this country.

I, as a Tamil, have a right to speak on behalf of the Tamils of this country. Tamil youths of this country, because they carry a Tamil name, are questioned and kept in custody. If they are kept in custody, it is very difficult for them to get out of custody. I think the Hon. Vinayagamoorthy spoke at length on this subject and he even gave certain instances of where it is happening in this country. We, the Tamils have got an equal or a very privileged situation in the culture of this country. If you look at the ancient Sangam period, there was a famous poet called Eelattu Poothanthevan who was called to India when there was a conflict as far as certain issues relating to the Tamil literature was concerned. That was well over 2,000 years ago. So, from that period onwards, you can see in the Anuradhapura period that we have had Hindu Temples; we have had temples of great knowledge situated in Anuradhapura. So, we, the Sinhalese and Tamils have lived together as brothers. I do not understand why the Tamil community is in this present turmoil. Probably, there was a reason for the militants to take over arms. The militancy started because there was a reason. One of the main reasons was the standardization in education. There were young students from the Jaffna Peninsula who were unable to enter a university of this country, who were willing to get some jobs which were useful for their own future. Thereby, confusion was created and there was a complete militant state that had come up. Today, we are thankful that the militancy has been crippled. We are thankful to the Government for doing that. We are thankful to the Government for bringing peace into this country. Peace can be brought to the country but the wounds that have been created in the minds of the people, the wounds that have affected the Tamil community in the Jaffna Peninsula should be healed. Then only the Government of Sri Lanka, the ruling Party as well as the Opposition, can be happy that something has been done to the community. If you look at the Jaffna Peninsula today, what Jaffna is now is worse than what it was during the last forty years. The buildings are damaged, the schools are damaged, the roads are damaged, the people have no place to live properly. The displaced people have no place to live. In Vavuniya, there are more than 25,000 displaced people and in Kilinochchi also, there are large numbers of displaced people. There are so many other factors on which I do not have the correct figures until I check with certain organizations. Is this what we want? Do we want a community of this country to suffer? I am not trying to bring any sort of complexity into the subject as far as Tamils and Sinhalese are concerned. As I told you, the Sinhalese and the Tamils lived together as brothers of this country. We have fought for it. My great grandfather, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, in the Tower Hall in 1919, had convened a meeting for a Sinhala Association. That Association was an organization to foster the Sinhalese political and cultural organizations in this country. So, there were Tamils living together, Tamils

257 258

fighting for causes of this nature. Therefore, I earnestly request you - the Government, the Speaker and every Member concerned - to see that there is a rule of law in this country. The second issue I wish to bring up is the Seventeenth Amendment. We should have an independent Police Commission; we should have an independent Election Commission; we should have a Constitutional Council. If those are brought into place, there would not be any political interference and there would be some sort of independence in this country. If that is brought about, probably we can have a workable solution for the future of this country. I think even today we cannot say that foreign countries should not interfere with the affairs of this country. I may not totally agree with you. Foreign countries or any country would be jealously looking at us with interest, whether we are carrying out our duties: the duties as a citizen of this country, as Members of Parliament or as the Executive of this country. They have a right, a fundamental right to comment on it; whether you want to accept it or not, is another issue. But, a small nation like ours cannot say, You close your eyes to the western world. I do disagree on that point but of course, the Government may not agree with me. That is my personal view. There are certain fundamental issues like the fundamental rights of the people, which have been deprived in this country and those deprivations and issues of justice in this country have been the cause for many factors that has arisen in this country. The war has been won, I totally agree, but so many people have been wounded because of it. We could have had it in a better way, but it is too late to talk about it, now that the job has already been done. But, it is our duty now, at least to see that the Jaffna Peninsula - the North - and the Eastern Province are brought to some stable state with some devolution of power to those people. Devolution of power can be in writing; it can be in a document, but it should be enforced, as I told you. In the Kandyan Convention too, there was a Village committee system, a District Committee system and a State system. We can sign Acts, we can sign treaties, we can do many things, but ultimately if you do not see that it is enforced, there is no justice. So, it is my only earnest request is, at least at this juncture, we ask the ruling party to bring in some sort of resolution or devolution in this country and see that there is fair play to the Tamil community and to the society at large. Thank you very much.
