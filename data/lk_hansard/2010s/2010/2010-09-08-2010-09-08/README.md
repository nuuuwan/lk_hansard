( ) (Mr. Speaker) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran.

[. . 10.10] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak today with a very heavy heart. Not even half a year has passed since I stepped

191 192

[ . . ]

2010 08

into this Assembly for the first time. I did not realize then that I will be participating in a Debate such as this; on a Bill that threatens to finally nail the coffin in which democracy of this country had been laid for some time. -[Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I wish to place on record - for whatever it is worth - our very strong objection to the manner in which this Bill is being rushed through. [Interruption.] Sound is no substitute for substance.

.. ( )

( .. - ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha - Minister of Petroleum Industries) We know who you are. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Susil Premajayantha, sound is no substitute for substance. If you cannot meet the arguments, this is what you will do. - [Interruption.] Yes, I will repeat that today. If you can, try and meet the argument without shouting, please. So, you must let me place the argument. That in itself is an indictment; the manner in which this Bill is rushed through is itself an indictment and an indication of the anxiety of the Government to have it passed with little or no public discussion on the matter.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That is you opinion. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Certainly, it is my opinion. Leave alone discussion, there is no notice to the public and only 24 hours' time was given to the Supreme Court comprising of such -

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) In an urgent Bill, we have to do like that - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, I know that. - [Interruption.] Only 24 hours were given to a bench of Supreme Court Judges, exceptionally talented Judges, who seem to be able to dissect these proposed

Constitutional Amendments with consummate ease and deliver their Determination in such a short time. In the process, though they seem to have overlooked -

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Environment ) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, The Hon. Member seems to show disrespect to the Supreme Court by the manner in which he is commenting about it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, I only said that they are exceptionally talented people.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) We know what you mean.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I only said that they are exceptionally talented people. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You cannot comment on the judges. Obviously, they are talented and that is why they have been appointed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, we know why they were appointed. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) There is no question about that. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Then again, it clearly demonstrates that you are a critique of the Supreme Court. You are insulting the Supreme Court. [Interruption.]- .

193 194

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Let me continue my speech.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, my learned Friend is insulting the institution of the Supreme Court and I object. I object because that is against the Standing Orders. They are exceptionally brilliant. It is an unwarranted comment.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Speaker, this is yet another indication of stifling of any debate on this Bill. Bad enough that there was no time for public discussion. [Interruption.]- .

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Why not? We had discussions with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition also.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Bad enough that there was such a short time given for the deliberation of this Bill; even with the absence of the main Opposition Party when there are only one, two or three Hon. Members available to speak in opposition to this Bill, why is the Government so worried that they should stifle the voice of the Opposition? - [Interruption.]-

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You are worried. We are not worried.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In the process, two important Determinations of the Supreme Court seem to have been overlooked and I am going to refer to them now. Those Determinations were made with a little more time available to the Supreme Court to deliberate on it. -[Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, no. Sir, there is a point of Order being raised. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will refer to that in a little while.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. Hon. Speaker, the Supreme Court has made a determination. He is trying to cite two judgments with regard to that. He should have made these arguments there. He is indirectly criticizing the judgment of the Supreme Court. With great respect, I-

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This House too had very little time to deliberate on this Bill. It is a fact that this House also did not have a copy of this Bill until I had raised a point of Order yesterday. Mr. Speaker, you will recall that when I referred to Clause 20 and Clause 22, none of the Hon. Members of this House had a copy of the Bill in their hands and it was distributed to them only at that stage. [Interruption.] Even the copy that was taken up at the Cabinet is different to the one that was referred to the Supreme Court. [Interruption.] ( ) (Hon. Members) No, no.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now, I will show you the copy. - [Interruption.] If I did not raise that point of Order yesterday perhaps even the -

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes, the Hon. Rajiva Wijesinha. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, I believe, not intentionally but was actually misleading the House, because when he cited the Standing Order, I am sure, in good faith -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) I will decide on that.

195 196

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) He did not notice that the reference was made to Schedule III. It is a point of clarification.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that is not a point of Order. The Hon. Member should know what a point of Order is and what is not.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) You carry on, Hon. Member. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order. I am only referring to the fact that it was only when I raised a point of Order, the copies of this Bill were distributed in this House. That is a fact. [Interruption.] Although there was -[Interruption.] If you disturb me, you will not even allow me to say the good things that I am going to say. So, will you please sit and listen for a change?

Although there was general talk of impending constitutional amendments and that the removal of the term limits of the President was one of those, no proper intimation was given to any one of the contents of this Bill. In fact, what was given publicity was the fact of an agreement reached between His Excellency the President and the Leader of the Opposition that the Executive Presidency would be abolished and that the post of Executive Prime Minister would be introduced in its place. Therefore, when and where did this Bill originate? Was it in the Cabinet?

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade) In Sirikotha. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. The Cabinet of Ministers have certified this Bill as urgent in the national interest. Can anything be more laughable than that? Did the Cabinet of Ministers have a copy of this Bill or even a draft? I think they did not. [Interruption.] What the Cabinet certified and what was sent to the Supreme Court were two different versions.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) How can you say that, Sir?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That came to light at the hearing of the Supreme Court. The Council that is now referred to in the Bill as a Parliamentary Council, is referred to as a Constitutional Council in the version that was certified by the Cabinet. [Interruption.] Oh, I see! Thank you very much. The issue with regard to the removal of the term limit of the President will not be faced by this country at least for another four years and two months. It cannot be faced by this country at least for another four years and two months. [Interruption.] Yes, my problem is, how then did the Cabinet certify this Bill as "Urgent in the national interest"? How does that become urgent when the issue cannot even come up before the country for four years and two months at least? So what warranted this indecent haste? [Interruption.] Sir, I ask you in all humility: is this House also expected to capitulate and take leave of its senses like the Cabinet and permit the passage of this Bill post-haste? The rush is so intense, that even the special resolution provided in Standing Order No. 46 A designed to bypass Constitutional requirements, itself, is being avoided, since there is no time to waste to indulge in something that is made for that very purpose.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Point of clarification please? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, please do not take my time away. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) You are misleading the House. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not misleading the House, Hon. Rajiva Wijesinha. Please take your seat.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) If you look at the Standing Order No. 46 A - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Standing Order No. 46 A is made for the very purpose of bypassing a constitutional requirement. And, I say even that is being bypassed in this intense rush to have this Bill passed. What is the very purpose? I do not think that these manoeuvres by the Government are

197 198

becoming of any responsible government. All right-thinking people in this country have condemned this Bill.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Who? [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am glad that you asked the question. I will give you a list now. The Civil Rights Movement, the Organization of Professional Associations and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka have all warned the Government not to resort to the Urgent Bills procedure. In June, the Bar Association said it. If you read todays newspapers, the Bar Association has issued a statement reiterating its stance and urging the Government to withdraw this Bill. The Bar Association is the only body that represents all the lawyers of this country of which I am a proud Member.

( ) (Hon. Members) Not all lawyers. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) And, on behalf of all the lawyers of this country, a resolution was passed in the Bar Council in the month of June. That was communicated to the Government and given wide publicity. [Interruption.] The Bar Council is not an individual body. Who is the Hon. Member who does not know that. Some leading academics of the country have said this in a statement yesterday. It states: Constitutional reforms, like elections, go to the heart of what it means to be a democracy in the modern-day world. Any changes that are introduced to a countrys constitution should be undertaken after due deliberation and consultation while having at its centre, the will of the people. In a pluralistic society such as Sri Lanka, ascertaining the will of the people can be a time-consuming and complex exercise. While the will of the people must be given due consideration, the essential features of a democracy, such as the rule of law, accountability of the Government and transparency must be preserved and promoted through any constitutional reform. By choosing to amend the constitution through an urgent bill, the entire process of reform has been expedited, if not short-circuited, and no room has been left for any kind of public debate, let alone public consultation. Under the Constitution that explicitly recognizes the 'Sovereignty of the People' that process is not acceptable, especially when no convincing reasons have been given as to the need to expedite this process.

Indeed, the most distressing aspect to this whole process is the lack of interest in Government ranks on the need to raise awareness, let alone build consensus, among the general public on the need for such urgent reform.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka, having warned in due time, has again issued a statement this morning. It states:

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka is perturbed by the move of the Government to introduce the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution as an 'Urgent Bill'.

As early as June this year, the Bar Council resolved that Constitutional Amendments should not be presented as 'Urgent Bills' and urged the Government to desist from proposing Constitutional Amendments in the form of 'Urgent Bills'.

This position of the Bar Association was communicated to the Government and given wide publicity as well. We regret to note that despite this, the Government is planning to proceed with the proposed Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution as an 'Urgent Bill' to be debated and voted on 8th September, 2010.

As the professional body representing all lawyers of this country,...."

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Not all lawyers. We are also lawyers. But, we are not- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Those who say this is not all lawyers do not know the constitution of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka. Every lawyer who takes oath as a lawyer of the Supreme Court is a member of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and I regret very much that persons who claim to be Attorneys-at-law do not know the constitution of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.

Again I read the rest of the statement. It states:

"As the professional body representing all lawyers of this country, we strongly urge the Government not to move this proposed Bill without a fuller public discussion and debate on such an important matter.

Needles to say, no right-thinking person can condone this, and we unreservedly condemn the Government for making a mockery of the hallowed process of constitution-making.

I wish to ask the Hon. Prime Minister : why did you choose to dismiss this wealth of advice from the intelligentsia of this country? There can be only one answer and that is, "Fear".

199 200

2010 08

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, can I interrupt you for a moment? [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There can be many fears, some may be personal. But, there is also the fear that if this is permitted to be discussed in public, it will be roundly rejected. [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please sit down. [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please sit down. [Interruption].There is room for such fear because the people of this country have repeatedly voted to abolish the Executive Presidency, not to bolster it. In 1994, people gave President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga a mandate to abolish the Executive Presidency within six months. She herself introduced a new draft Constitution to this House in August 2000, seeking to abolish the Executive Presidency but retaining it for her term of office. In 2005, President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself sought a mandate to abolish the Executive Presidency in "Mahinda Chintana". I have not attended one Session of this Parliament in which at least one Government Member had not referred to the "Mahinda Chintana" as their Bible. Will they refer to "Mahinda Chintana" today? In the second "Mahinda Chintana" also, President Mahinda Rajapaksa sought and obtained a mandate to reduce the powers of the Executive Presidency. President Mahinda Rajapaksa was at the forefront of the agitation against all anti-democratic moves of the UNP governments. We all know that. It was President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was the champion of human rights, who was the champion for democracy when the UNP was in power. I am absolutely certain that if President Jayewardene had actually tried to abolish this term limit of the President as he contemplated towards the end of his term, President Mahinda Rajapaksa would have been the first to agitate against that move. And, so I ask the Hon. Prime Minister again: why are you moving against the wishes of your Leader and your people? All progressive forces in this country are against the abolition of the term limit of the President. All civilized jurisdictions that have Executive Presidency have a two-term limit. They are all not less intelligent than us. [ ] Yes. That is true. You have some on your side. It is a universal principle that Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Leading academics and jurists have all opined that the concentration of power in one individual for too long is detrimental to democracy. Why is it - [Interruption.] Are you calling for the Hon. Muralidaran to come into the Chamber?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Are you calling for the Hon. Muralidaran to come into the Chamber? If you call like that, he might come. All jurists have opined that concentration of power in - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That gives me time to drink some water. Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Power corrupts and absolute - [Interruption.] It is so predictable. [ ]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Speaker, are you able to control this House, please?

Why is it necessary for me to say this? It is because even such first-principles take a flight out of the window when political office and power ensnares and entraps you.

There is a book that all first year law students of this country study. It is titled, Essays on Administrative Law in Sri Lanka", by G.L. Peiris and it was first published in 1980. I quote from the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiriss book. He is your own Minister. This is what he says at page 309, I quote:

Parliament always enacts legislation on the presumption that the repository of power will act in good faith and reasonably...

yet the courts remain responsible for checking the abuse of powers...

Then, this is what the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris says at page 310 citing the Indian case of Mohambaram vs. Jayavelu. I quote:

201 202

There is no such thing as absolute or untrammeled discretion, the nursery of despotic power in a democracy based on the rule of law.

And on the same page, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, says this in 1980 citing Wade and Schwartz, I quote:

Every legal power must have legal limits, otherwise there is dictatorship.

He says, "otherwise there is dictatorship".

The Civil Rights Movement has reminded us in its statement that in 1978 when immunity was being conferred on the Executive President, which is unparalleled in any civilized country, the consolation against this was that there was a two-term limit on anyone holding the office of President. This Amendment that seeks to permit a person to hold the office of President for life also confers immunity for life on that person. This Amendment will create this super human being not only out of the present incumbent. If the next President ascends to the throne at a tender age of 30, this will enable him to remain President for life, periodic elections notwithstanding. I wish to ask the Hon. Members on the Government side, would you have supported such powers to be concentrated on President Jayewardene or President Premadasa? Or are you under the impression that this amendment will give this power only to President Rajapaksa and to no one after him? - [Interruption.] I will come to that, and I will come to my good Friend, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. For a brief moment, we deluded ourselves into thinking that perhaps the leftists had some conscience left in them. But, alas, they too have gone the way of their departed leader, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, who having prophesied in 1956 that a single language policy will lead to separatism in this country, was the very person who drafted the 1972 Constitution that gave to Sinhala, the status as the only official language for the first time in the Constitution, and as if that was not enough, gave to Buddhism the foremost place to the exception of all other religions. It is perverse to say that you are opposed to this in principle but will vote for it! Principles do not matter to many people in this country anymore. If not, will we see this sad spectacle of so many back-stabbings and defections from the UNP? Surely the consideration for this mass movement cannot be principles?

I was saddened very much when the Hon. Prime Minister made a list of persons who had crossed over and spoke of it drawing positive terms. This country is sickened by political crossovers and I am very sad that today the Hon. Prime Minister stood up in this House and in very lightweight talked about the persons who crossed over. It is a sad day not only for the passing of this Amendment that takes away the democratic rights of

people of this country, but also for the reason that the foremost person in this House seeks to justify political crossovers. -[Interruption.] And, as I speak of political crossovers, appropriately I am being disturbed by one such - [Interruption.]

The concern of the TNA is also to do with regard to the other provisions of this Bill. The removal of the term limit of the President is but one line in this 16-page Bill. The other provisions of this Bill are equally, if not, more dangerous. The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution is the only part of our Constitution, which did not have even one vote cast against its passage in Parliament and has very salutary provisions for good governance and checks and balances against concentration of power. - [Interruption.] That very part of the Constitution is being sought to be nullified by this Bill.- [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, is it necessary for me to appeal to you every time to maintain the decorum of this House?

The Constitutional Council is abolished and in its place a totally ineffective Parliamentary Council is introduced. This Parliamentary Council does not even meet, does not even have a Chairman. Powers of the Election Commission and the National Police Commission are seriously eroded. Even the very limited powers granted by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution - this is where I wish to invite the attention of the Hon. Douglas Devananda and other two Hon. Members of his party - are being removed by this Bill. This affects the Chapter on Devolution, but the Bill has not been referred to the Provincial Councils as mandated by Article 154G (2) and (3).

Clauses 20 and 22 of the Bill have provisions in respect of matters set out in the Provincial Council List and seek to amend and/or repeal the provisions with regard to the Provincial Public Service Commission and the Provincial Police Commission, both of which are referred to in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Sir, he is misleading the House. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) I will look into that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am not misleading the House. The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena would do well to read the Constitution. I am not misleading the House.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Douglas Devananda, you will have your chance. I have studied the Bill. Let me speak, please. I am at least as intelligent as you are. So, please let me speak. I refer to the Hansard of 20th November, 2003.

( ) (Hon. Members) ! .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Members who say that closing their mouth, why do you not stand up and say it?

( ) (Hon. Members) ! ! ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . [ ]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am referring to the Hansard of 20th November, 2003, Volume 151 - No. 2 and I am also referring to the Hansard of 6th January, 2009, Volume 180 - No. 1.

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage - Deputy Minister of Youth Affairs ) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you very much for the correction of my pronunciation. I refer to the Hansard for those two provisions. Article 154G (2) of the Constitution is very clear and specific that if a Bill, after it is published in the Gazette, is not referred to every Provincial Council, it will not become law, if it is in respect of any matter in the Chapter on Devolution. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, he raised this matter yesterday and the Hon. Speaker gave a Ruling. I do not see how he can raise this matter again.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He cannot. It is against the Standing Orders. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not raising it again. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You are repeating the same thing and I object to it. He, yesterday, made the same submissions and the Hon. Speaker gave a Ruling that the Supreme Court has made a clear Determination that it only needs a two-thirds majority.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, carry on with your speech, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Faiszer Musthapha should learn to sit and listen to what I am saying. Before I could conclude, he jumps up like this. I am referring to a principle that he might have vaguely heard of, known as per incuriam law. According to the per incuriam rule, if any court makes a ruling in forgetfulness of the law or for precedence, then that will be summarily set aside by that very court itself and that is the reason why I now referred to two previous

205 206

Determinations that have been recorded in Hansard. So this Bill is in danger.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) What is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is making inferences about the conduct of the learned Judges of the Supreme Court; he talks of their forgetfulness. It is against the Standing Order No. 84. Therefore, you cannot allow that to be recorded here. It must be expunged. He may be a briefless lawyer; he is not a good Parliamentarian. You come to me I will teach you some of the Standing Orders. - [Interruption.] You do not know how to deliver a speech here.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that cannot be expunged from Hansard. I must be heard in defence of what I said. I referred to a rule known as a per incuriam rule. I understand that the Hon. Azwer does not know that. But, that does not mean that that rule does not exist. That is a principle of law. That is in no way in disrespect to either the Supreme Court or any court.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) What is the point of Order?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, this is the holy month of Ramadan and it disturbes me to a great extent that the Members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, whose Leader I see now, have decided to act against their conscience. - [Interruption.] I am saying it. Let them protest. I am saddened that two Members who were elected, one by the plantation Tamil community on the UNP ticket and the other by the Tamil community in Colombo on the UNP ticket - [Interruption.] I will tell you what is wrong. Wait and listen. These two Members have decided to cross over within four months of an election, in which they were elected by anti-government votes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is their right. You do not understand.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is their right, I understand that. But, I am saddened by these spectacles. - [Interruption.] The question has been posed to us. That is what I am coming to.- [Interruption.] Other minority communities in this country know how to survive, never mind principles. -[Interruption.] Why is it that only you, why is it that only this community that I represent is so foolish to hit our heads against the stone all the time? - [Interruption.] I do not think I need to answer that question. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . [ ]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) When the history of this country was written between 1978 and 1994, the Members of this Government had all been describing that rule as a 17-year "misrule" and all that was done during that time. Several amendments to the Constitution were rushed through as urgent Bills and several Members on that side today were the ones vociferously objecting to that procedure during that period of time. - [Interruption.] Those very persons have forgotten their history. Today, when the history is written, we all know that it judges President J.R. Jayewardene in a particular way. When today's history is written, at least, there will be a record of the fact that the Tamil National Alliance did not betray this country even for parochial, short-term considerations for our own community.

Thank you very much.

Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. PIYANKARA JAYARATNE] took the Chair. [. . 11.45] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Debate on the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Before I speak on the Eighteenth Amendment, I want to make it clear to you and to everybody that we do not have any

personal animosity towards anybody or even towards the President. We are doing what our conscience wants us to do. We, the Tamil National Alliance, the TNA Members oppose this amendment and will vote against it.

What is the necessity for this Amendment to be made to the Constitution at this stage? If, by any chance, this Bill is passed, it will ring the death knell for democracy. Who wanted this Amendment to be made? Did President Rajapaksa get the mandate from the people to make this Amendment? When the Parliamentary Election and the Presidential Election were held, did the President tell the people that he would bring this Amendment and get the mandate? It has been the history of this country that when political leaders get a two-thirds majority, they amend the Constitution to suit their whims and fancies.

By this Amendment, presently the President is trying to get a third term and do away with the Seventeenth Amendment. Only in countries where you find dictatorship, the president contests as many times as possible. But in democratic countries, the terms are restricted to two. The

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

is trying to do what Hitler did in Germany. Hitler also became the president by holding an election and thereafter, he became a lifelong president. This Amendment which allows the President to contest as many times as possible will take the country not only towards dictatorship, but something more than that. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, shall I continue? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, please. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The Seventeenth Amendment was passed unanimously without any opposition by all the parties and it curtailed the powers of the President in making appointments. It was passed unanimously to avoid politicizations of government departments. It was observed by former President Mrs. Chandrika

221 222

Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and she implemented the Seventeenth Amendment, but the present President has not taken any steps to appoint the Constitutional Council and implement the Seventeenth Amendment.

According to Lord Acton, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This statement is equally applicable to the present state of affairs in this country. - [Interruption.] You speak when you are given time to speak. The Eighteenth Amendment will do away with the Seventeenth Amendment and it has also removed some powers of the provincial councils.

As far as I am concerned, the Thirteenth Amendment did not give any rights or benefits to the Tamils. This was meant to solve the ethnic question. Has the ethnic question been solved by the Thirteenth Amendment? Has the Thirteenth Amendment been fully implemented? I do not know why we want nine Provincial Councils. Only the North and the East wanted substantial devolution of powers and this Amendment removes the Police Commission and it will affect the independence of the police. Even powers conferred on the Commissioner of Elections by the Seventeenth Amendment have been removed and now it is stated that after the date for the election is fixed, he cannot issue any directives. If we want free and fair elections to be held, there must be an independent Police Commission and an independent Commissioner of Elections. We want the powers enjoyed by the Commissioner of Elections in India to be given to the Commissioner of Elections here as well.

We are opposing this Amendment and will vote against this. The UNP Members staged a protest last evening in Parliament and if they really oppose this Amendment, they must have the guts to be present here and vote against this. ( ) (An Hon. Member) That is a very good point. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I also want to take this opportunity to say something about these crossovers.-[Interruption.] It is political prostitution, I can say. If a Member is elected from one party and comes to Parliament and if he wants to cross over to another party, let him do that. But, to do that, he must resign from his Parliamentary seat first.- [Interruption.] We must bring laws to that effect.- [Interruption.] We have to amend the Election Law or the Constitution. .- [Interruption.] I do not want to see anymore political prostitutes.

Thank you, very much.

When I was contemplating taking this decision a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I had a bad feeling. I thought that my soul was detaching from my heart. But, after some time, considering so many options and for the benefit of the country, I thought, yes, I have to take this decision and I am glad today that I am standing here as a Member of the UNP supporting the Government to change the Constitution.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I must at the very outset, say very categorically that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, without any compulsion whatsoever, has decided to lend our wholehearted support for the Amendments that are being made.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it was very unfortunate that two speakers have referred to the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress in their speeches, from the benches of the Opposition this morning, adverting to this undue pressure that according to their own figments of imagination, has been brought upon us. The SLMCs collective decision was taken after some careful introspection into our Partys policies, its past conduct and its future course. I have, to a certain extent in a column that I wrote to the Sunday Times this weekend, dealt with the background in which we came to this decision. It was the famous Roman General Cesaro, who said, "Nothing is more unreliable than the populace; nothing more obscure than the human intention; nothing more deceptive than the whole electoral system".

Hon. Sumanthiran, speaking this morning said that I have taken this decision against my conscience. My Friend, Hon. Sumanthiran, I would have immediately risen to contradict him, but I did not want to do at that time, because I was myself not too happy with the way in which the Government was treating the Tamil National Alliance by calling them "Tigers" at a moment like this. I think we need to look at the Opposition and their arguments with maturity and also accept the integrity of certain justifications for their argument. Certainly, Hon. Sumanthiran has misconstrued my generosity in appreciating the integrity of some of his arguments when he met me about this issue. As a matter of fact, if we had little more time, I could have acted as a bridge to allay their fears and also to discuss with the Government and perhaps adjust the Bill that you are bringing today in order to have the added credibility of the TNA also supporting this Amendment. Unfortunately, it was not to be. But, however it may be, we cannot for the sake of political expediency, refuse to see the integrity of the arguments of those who oppose it. The substance of this Amendment is one issue. The process by which these Amendments are sought to be passed is another issue. Then the manner in which the Executive will exercise his enormous discretion we would vest in him, is yet another issue.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, US President, Barack Obama has said: "Issues are never simple. One thing I am proud of is that very rarely will you hear me simplify the issues". Therefore, I am not here to simplify these issues. We have got to see the integrity of the argument of the other side when we debate an all important Amendment to our Constitution. Therefore, as I told you, Mr. Deputy Chairman Committees, the eight Members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress deciding to support and our announcement had tilted the scales for the Government to ultimately have the comfortable margin to go beyond the required two-thirds of the votes for these amendments. It is, therefore, with some trepidation and anxiety that we are witnessing the reaction to this, in the country. It is no doubt that we will have to bear responsibility and be held accountable, if the after-effects of these amendments do not allay the fears of the people as far as the opponents are advancing against these amendments. So with that reality in mind, we have taken a pragmatic decision to support the President in this matter because we believe the country was very sharply polarized during the recent elections. That polarization has got to be brought to an end.

His Excellency the President, during my discussion with him, was quite conscious of his duty towards the minorities. He, in fact, told me very unequivocally that he intends to keep his promise about the Thirteenth plus devolution that he wishes to devolve for the minorities in this country. Therefore, it is a momentous occasion for all of us, and to give the benefit of the doubt to his Excellency the President, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa this morning very graciously admitted that this Amendment is not simply to get a third term or go beyond that but more than that; to have a second term without unnecessary convulsions and a very stable government during the second term. That second term is the most important term for all those people who have been freed from the clutches of the LTTE. The minorities in this country are deeply conscious that only a Leader like Mahinda Rajapaksa who has the confidence of a preponderant majority in this country can bring about a reasonable solution that the whole country will endorse. Therefore, we are pinning our hopes on His Excellency the President to do justice by everyone. With that hope, I would also like to comment that whenever a government got a two-thirds majority in this country, there were certain assaults on democracy and good governance. It happened in 1956; it happened in 1970; it happened in 1977 and His Excellency the President is deeply aware and conscious of the faults of the previous administrations which had this two-thirds majority. The J.R. Jayewardene regime and its behaviour with the overpowerful Executive Presidency and a five-sixth majority was something that the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa himself has undergone and realized as to how that regime behaved towards the Opposition. It was very clear from the Hon. Basil Rajapaksas speech today that this is a step to strengthen the sovereignty of the people.

277 278

My late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, when he propounded the theory of supporting the continuation of the Executive Presidency, he always said that while we would support the continuation of the Executive Presidency; we want to strengthen Parliament and I am sure that His Excellency the President is going beyond that. His coming and attending Parliament every three months would also look at other ways in which he can strengthen this House, the deliberations in this House and he will give the Opposition a better say in performing their role as a primary watchdog of public finance in this country. No amount of creation of commissions like the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption; no amount of any other commission would solve the problem of corruption without empowering Parliament. I am sure His Excellency being a firm believer in Parliamentary democracy - I know he was a very reluctant person; in my discussion with him it was quite apparent. - always wanted to return to Parliament. He had the desire to be in this House and he is somebody who had gone through the worst vicissitudes of being an Opposition Member facing the brunt of an overpowerful Executive and Parliament and had gone through the mill: if you are to say and use that phrase. And, therefore, it is in that fervent hope, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is supporting these Amendments and also, I would like to make a comment. I know like how I have become a favourite subject of the cartoonists these few days, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara has also become a favourite subject these days. I read somewhere that the decision the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress had taken - some columnist has written - had delivered a fait accompli to the old Left in the Government. I do not think we need to look at it that way. Some of us who see and realize dangers in the concentration of power, could act on the conscience of this Government. They being within the Government, we being outside, having supported it, we will have the moral right to question this Government about its conduct. Therefore, with those wishes with the sincere belief that the passage of this Bill will enable His Excellency the President to have a trouble-free second term and if possible, with a larger mandate, have yet another term to bring an end to the polarization in this country; bring an end to the protracted political struggles which had destroyed the economy in this country and put the country in the path of prosperity.

Thank you very much.

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to follow my Friend, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, who

expressed, at the conclusion of his speech, a very laudable sentiment with which I find myself in unreserved agreement. He said the need of the hour is a spirit of consensus. We have to get away from confrontational politics. I think that is very much the spirit in which this august Assembly should approach; the serious issues which arise for our consideration from the Eighteenth Amendment which the Government has submitted for the consideration of Parliament. For that reason, Sir, I would like to comment briefly on some of the myths : I call them "myths". They were totally false arguments and premises which underpinned some of the speeches that were made by the Hon. Members of the Opposition. This is necessary in order to introduce an element of clarity into this Debate. An outstanding example of this was the attempt that was made yesterday to prevent this Debate from taking place at all. It is one thing for the Opposition to express their views in a spirit of candour. It is another to stifle this Debate at the very threshold. The argument that was used in support of that position was demonstrably untenable. It was argued that this Debate cannot take place at all because the proposed Eighteenth Amendment infringes upon powers that are conferred on provincial bodies. Consequently, the provincial bodies have to be consulted and because that was not done, there was an incurable procedural flaw which prevented this House from embarking upon this debate in the first instance. The answer to that, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is that in terms of Sri Lankas Constitution there are certain functions which are attributed to the Supreme Court and certain functions which lie within the domain of Parliament. Before a Bill can be considered here, it has to be referred to the Supreme Court in order to be tested for constitutionality. It is the Supreme Court and no other tribunal in this land which is vested with jurisdiction to determine whether the provisions of a proposed Bill are in conflict with the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

The argument that was resorted to yesterday by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran is exactly on all fours with an argument that was presented in those very terms to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. I quote from the Determination of the Supreme Court, Sir. On page 16, it says, I quote:

Mr. Saliya Peiris submitted that Clause 21 of the Bill has the effect of amending Chapter XVII A of the Constitution. Accordingly learned Counsel contended that it is necessary to give effect to Article 154G(2) of the Constitution and therefore the Bill has to be first Gazetted and referred to the Provincial Councils.

This is not a new argument. It is not being presented here for the first time. This is the very argument that was presented to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Sir, what did the Supreme Court say about it? The Supreme Court said, again I quote:

The said Clause was considered by this Court in that Determination as a consequential amendment, which did not require any other procedure to follow such as being Gazetted and referred to the Provincial Councils.

279 280

[ ]

2010 08

So, the Court considered that argument and rejected that argument in unequivocal terms. The Court then went on to explicit conclusions as follows: I quote:

Accordingly it is pertinent that the said amendment does not attract the provision of Article 154G(2) of the Constitution.

It is therefore, Sir, much to be regretted that this attempt was made entirely against the established law and practice of this country. This Parliament has a right to consider the Eighteenth Amendment. The Court has paved the way for that to happen. And, the attempt that was made yesterday was in complete defiance of the determination that was made by the Supreme Court in the exercise of jurisdiction vested in it by the constitutional instrument of this country.

The other myth, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is that an attempt is being made by the Government to extend the term of office of His Excellency the President. Nothing could be further than the truth. That is not the case. All we are doing is removing Article 31(2) which restricts the number of terms of any President, not just this President, but any President at all and we are also removing provision (c) from Article 92 which prevents a person who has held office as the President on two occasions to be a candidate for a third time. What we are doing is giving the people of Sri Lanka the opportunity of electing the candidate of their choice. There is no question of extending the term of office of any particular President. To our mind, Sir, that is an enlargement; a strengthening of the franchise of the people of this country. It is not a restriction; it is not a curtailment of the franchise, but precisely the opposite of that. What is wrong in allowing a person to be elected a third time if that is the declared wish of the sovereign people of this land? That is all we are doing; we are paving the way for the sovereign electorate of this country to exercise their freedom of choice in a manner that is not trammelled or restricted by the law.

In my view, Sir, just as the Executive Presidency was required to eradicate terrorism from this country, a strong Executive is an essential requirement to grapple with some of the formidable challenges that the country faces at the present time. The unique opportunity that we have today after 20 years is to put the economic and social development of our country on a fast track. In order to do this, we need political stability and the strengthening of the executive branch of Government.

At the same time, there is a structural weakness that is embedded in the present Constitution. That has to do with the organic separation of the Executive Presidency from the legislature and the distance between those two institutions. That is an anomaly which is rectified by the Eighteenth Amendment. The position today is that the President of Sri Lanka can attend Sittings of this House if he or she wishes to do so. However, there is no

compulsion for the President to come to this House at all. That is now being changed. The Eighteenth Amendment requires the President, as a matter of compulsory obligation, to attend this Chamber at least once in three months.

Sir Ivor Jennings, in his celebrated work on Parliament, refers to the difference that the immediate presence of the Head of Government makes to the stature of a Parliament: the quality of its debates; the morale and enthusiasm of its Members. This is not a matter of law. It is a matter of political culture. For a backbencher to be encouraged by the Head of the Government when he makes a good speech; for the Head of the Government to come and tell him, You are doing a good job; keep it up. I appreciate what you are doing; for Members of this House to meet the Head of Government in the lobby, in the restaurant, in the library, it makes a tremendous difference and it elevates very appreciably the stature of the sovereign Parliament of this country. That is one of the objectives of the amendments which the Government has placed before this House today.

There is also a myth that has pervaded not only the Debate in this House but discussion of this matter up and down this land. All too often there has been an uncritical tendency to regard the Constitutional Council as an institution which should be preserved, protected and strengthened. That is not the case. The argument is that the Constitutional Council embodies an apolitical approach to the public life of this country. Nothing could be further from the truth. We need to examine the composition of the Constitutional Council. Who constitutes it? These are representatives of political parties who are appointed to the Council for no other reason than their political loyalty and affiliation. It has nothing to do with stature or competence or recognition; it has nothing to do with the application of any objective criteria. Members of the Constitutional Council are there simply because political parties put them there. Their sole loyalty and affiliation is to the political party that makes it possible for them to be members of the Constitutional Council. I honestly fail to understand, Sir, how such a body can make any worthwhile contribution to a process of de-politicization. It is far more satisfactory to transfer that function to a Parliamentary Council as we have done in terms of these amendments. The body that now replaces the Constitutional Council is a body within this Chamber; it is a body that is accountable to the people of Sri Lanka. It is this body which has the obligation of making observations on the persons who should constitute the Commissions and it is far more desirable that that function should be exercised by a body within Parliament rather than that it should be entrusted to outsiders who owe their appointment to no other consideration than their loyalty to a political party. That is very much a partisan approach.

I would also like to point out, Mr. Deputy Chairman

281 282

of Committees, that eventually the President makes the appointment as is the case today. Even under the Seventeenth Amendment, the position is that the President is the appointing authority. It cannot be otherwise because in terms of Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution, the executive power of the republic is vested in the President who is elected by the people. So, what we have done is very sensible. The President has to make the appointments. Nobody else can do so. But, before the President makes up his mind, he will consider the representations that are made to him not by a group of outsiders who are arbitrarily and capriciously appointed, not at all, he will bring his mind to bear upon the recommendations that are made by responsible Members of this Parliament.

I would also like to point out, Sir, that all of this was foreseen by the Supreme Court in its Determination on the Seventeenth Amendment. The Supreme Court declared on that occasion that the Seventeenth Amendment is riddled with contradictions - there are anomalies and contradictions - and that it is simply unworkable on the ground. The observations that were made on that occasion by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka represent a prophetic anticipation of some of the complexities and problems that arose very shortly thereafter. It is that anomaly that is now sought to be rectified by the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment which we have presented to Parliament.

It is also important to point out, Sir, that we cannot have a situation in which an officer of the State who has a responsibility for a particular function is not given the power to fulfil that responsibility. In that case, you must take the responsibility away from that person. The defence of Sri Lanka is an inalienable responsibility of the President. Article 4(b) of the Constitution declares that the executive power of the People, including the defence of Sri Lanka, shall be exercised by the President of the Republic elected by the People. It was always the case that the President has the power to give directions to the Army, Navy and the Air Force, but in terms of the Seventeenth Amendment, as far as the police were concerned, he did not have unqualified authority to direct the Inspector-General of Police because of the crucial functions that were attributed to the National Police Commission. In a time of turbulence, that can be a source of very considerable problems. There can be a breakdown of law and order. Consider for a moment what is happening in the Maldives today. In the Maldives today you have a gridlock situation. That is - [Interruption.] I did not interrupt anybody on your side, I would like to develop my argument in my own way. You have the opportunity of responding to my arguments, when you have your turn. So, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my position is that we cannot have a gridlock situation. In the Maldives, about 70 per cent of their economy, as

you know, is derived from tourism. Today, countries like the United Kingdom and the United States have issued travel advisories because of the instability in that country. That instability is the direct result of a clash between the executive and the legislative organs of Government. That is the last thing we need in Sri Lanka today as we seek to derive the fullest benefit for our people from the unique opportunity that we have today, having eradicated terrorism, enjoying political stability of a degree unprecedented in the history of this country, if we are to derive the fullest benefit from that situation in order to attract investment into this country. That is already happening. The Chairman of the Shangri-La chain of hotels came here 10 days ago. He has already made a firm decision to build a Shangri-La Hotel here and that is a landmark investment. Anand Mahindra of India has come. He is also enthusiastic about contributing vigorously to the economic development of our country. In order to make the maximum use of these opportunities, we must have continuing stability.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please wind up now. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Sir, I am about to finish; just give me one more minute. And, I would also like to point out that the approach reflected in the Eighteenth Amendment is an entirely practical approach. It is the Inspector-General of Police who must run the Department from day to day. The National Police Commission cannot be responsible for deciding who should be promoted from the rank of police constable to the rank of sergeant. That is not a function that can be discharged by the National Police Commission. That must be done by the Inspector-General of Police. However, if there is injustice in what has been done by the Inspector-General of Police, we have made provision for an appeal to the Public Service Commission. If the public have grievance, they can appeal to the National Police Commission. So, all these matters have been addressed in the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment and reflecting the words of the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, I would appeal to all Members of this august Assembly to rise above partisan considerations on this occasion and give their minds in a detached and objective way to the very desirable features of the legislation now before the House.

I thank you, Sir. [.. 2.57] . ( . ) (The Hon. P. Piyasena) ,

( () - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Technology and Research) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my Colleague in the Socialist Alliance, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara has said much of the position that we hold in Sinhala and I thought, therefore, it would be good to make my speech in English so that everybody gets an idea of what, as the Socialist Alliance, as the Left, we stand for.

During the discussion that preceded the appearance of the Eighteenth Amendment, we were heartened by the fact that there was a readiness on the part of the leaders of the Government to consider getting rid of the Executive Presidency and returning Executive power to Parliament. Now, it is very evident that there is no such situation; that there is going to be a continuation of the Executive Presidency and it is in this framework the Eighteenth Amendment is being put forward.

This has led to differences of opinion within my own political party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, and I do not hold it against any persons who have different views within our party, because from the very time that the 1978 Constitution came into effect, the leaders of our party, the leaders of the Left Movement protested against it. I was there opposite the party office with Dr. N.M. Perera, Mr. Pieter Keuneman and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. We sat down on the road and protested against the 1978 Constitution. At that time Dr. N.M. Perera came out with a publication which exposed the dangers of this Constitution. He said that it would lead to an instability in the whole government setup of this country, to a situation where the dangers of authoritarian dictatorship would arise and that all the problems of malgovernance would

arise as a result of separating the electorate from the elector through the large district electoral system. All these deficiencies were pointed out and from that time onwards, we have been opposing this Constitution and we wanted it replaced with an appropriate new Constitution.

The J.R. Jayewardene Constitution was clearly formulated with the intention of permitting the neoliberal rape in our country through the process of the open economy and the idea was to keep down the people and prevent them protesting against what was going on. We have seen the consequences of the dictatorship that have arisen in other countries which have the Executive Presidency. We have seen in our own country the result of this.

During the time of the J.R. Jayewardene Government, there were attacks on Buddhist priests, intellectuals like Sarathchandra, judges, trade union leaders, media personnel and some were killed. What happened to the innocent Tamil people? They were killed, their property was destroyed. In 1980, for a small wage increase, workers went on strike and thousands of them lost their jobs due to this. Then we know what had happened in the Black July of 1983 which led to the LTTE-led war and 26 years of suffering for our people. All those have happened under the Executive Presidency starting with J.R. Jayewardene. We know what happened during the Premadasa period. During 1988-89 uprising, there were large-scale killings not only of youths but also of trade union leaders, Left Party leaders, leaders of our party, leaders of the Communist Party, the Progressive Movement. All those have been the outcome of having this Executive Presidency.

We are fortunate that during the time of the SLFP Presidents, this type of things have been much less. But, we, as a party are committed to the abolition of the 1978 Constitution, to have a return of executive power to Parliament and extensive devolution of power so that power can once again go down to the people, to village committees, to Jana Sabhas and thereby we can make sure that all the people including the minorities will be able to solve their own problems. There should be a proper devolution of power. The APRC process should move towards its conclusion where the representatives of the Tamil people, free from the LTTE pressure, can be brought into the process of forming a Constitution that will be acceptable to people all around the country. That is our position and we will stand by that position.

With regard to the Eighteenth Amendment, I must clearly state that the President, if convinced that he must be an Executive President, to win the economic war the way he won the war against LTTE, we are not on that view. We know that Mahathir Mohamed who served for 22 years as the Prime Minister achieved the Malaysian development miracle. But, the President feels that under

299 300

2010 08

the conditions in our country, he must have the Executive Presidency to achieve that. We want a rapid economic development in our country and we will give our fullest support to the President in that regard. To achieve that, the country must make use of the waves of advanced technology that is sweeping the world. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution will facilitate the mobilization of the Public Service to achieve the Governments aims and that is something that we welcome.

We are also standing for independent commissions which will act in an impartial manner, specially the Judicial Service Commission, the Bribery Commission and so on. In the context of the extra powers that have been given, we have to make sure that they are impartial and win the respect of all the people in this country; ensure that justice is done and that the powers are not abused. We hope that in the period ahead, the President will give the correct leadership to ensure that that is done so that it will help the President when he seeks a further term of office.

On the question of removing the two-term limit, we supported Hugo Chavez in Venezuela when he carried out a similar battle and he got permission for an extra term of office. That was the victory of the people, the progressive people, the socialist people who were supporting the progressive movement of Venezuela to get away from the domination of American imperialism. In the same way, we know that in our country, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken an anti-neoliberal position in internal politics and internal economic management. This has helped our country to have genuine development of our economy in the same way that Hugo Chavez has achieved it in Venezuela in Latin America. So, we feel that President Mahinda Rajapaksa has always been a supporter and someone who has been working closely with the Left Movement, the Socialist Movement and with the Peoples Progressive Movement. Therefore, the fact is, externally as well as internally, he has established relationships with the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement - with China, India, Venezuela, Brazil, South Africa and even with Iran - and got their support and co-operation. This has enabled the Sri Lankan economy, despite the collapse of the American and European markets, to achieve a reasonable rate of growth. So, all those are progressive policies which His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa has adopted as the President. It has already been -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Sir, please give me one more minute.

Next is the question of whether he is going to abuse his powers. Even the international observers very clearly stated that the last Presidential Election was conducted fairly. Therefore, on his having an extra term, I am sure he will ensure that the next Presidential Election after his six-year term will be a fair election and I do not think that these claims and charges of dictatorship need to be envisaged. I am convinced that he will be able to continue the democratic process, the move towards strengthening democracy. We will support him on the question of human rights, on democratizing our State and on minority rights. We will give him maximum support to achieve a fair deal for everybody and to achieve real economic development in our country. Thank you. [. . 3.56]

( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the use of several inflammatory and emotive words and scaremongering has

characterized the public debate regarding this Legislation. Words and phrases like dictatorship, authoritarianism, interfering with the will of the elected representatives of the people, undermining the separation of powers, manipulating the parliamentary process, giving unfettered power to the President, undermining free and fair elections as well as the independence of independent commissions, and all manner of imagined evils, are threatened and predicted as outcomes of this Legislation. However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, anyone with a modicum of common sense, knowledge of the history of this Legislation, and a touch of fair-minded and impartial ability to analyse it, will realize what is factual. Those who seek to generate public trepidation and opposition to the Amendment have consistently sought to undermine confidence in this administration and the one immediately preceding it, both led by His Excellency the President. They do this for reasons known only to themselves and those who command them. Nevertheless, I am confident that the intelligent and erudite Members of this House, who represent a literate and mature electorate and a people, are able to separate inescapable fact from insidious fiction and exercise sober and astute judgment and vote accordingly. Sir, the fact that so many Hon. Members have openly declared their support to this measure is in itself an indication that these agents of fear and discord are largely unsuccessful in their attempts to mislead and confuse the issues.

Sir, one of the aspects of this Bill, which its opponents seek to portray as controversial, is the removal of the two-term limit that hitherto has been attached to the Presidency. The proposed removal of this limit has been criticized as undemocratic. This is the complete opposite from the truth. This is especially the case in a relatively mature democracy such as Sri Lanka. We are quite capable as a people of changing our leaders and Governments democratically and periodically. We have proven this over and over again. Sir, a two-term President presenting himself at a third presidential ballot will have to convince the people that he is a deserving candidate among all other candidates. The people will have a wider choice as to who they want to lead the country. The people ultimately will decide upon their preferred choice. This is the pith and substance of democracy. Sir, how then can this be characterized as undemocratic or tending towards authoritarianism?

One outstanding example from relatively recent memory is the case of President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States. Sir, despite an informal tradition of a two-term limit from the time of President George Washington, FDR - as he is popularly known - died in office while commencing a fourth term. It is commonly known that FDR led the United States through some of the most difficult periods in its modern history - the recovery from the Great Depression and World War II. The legislative intervention by Congress to formalize the original informal two-term limit was only made in 1951, six years after his death in 1945. No one claimed that it

335 336

[ .. ]

2010 08

was to forestall a slow descent into dictatorship in the United States. In Parliamentary democracies, no one insinuates that a Premier who wins consecutive terms, time and time again, is tending towards authoritarianism. Some Prime Ministers are indeed thought to exercise "presidential style" governance and wield an enormous quantum of power and authority. Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are fortunate to have a President who has the ability and the will to lead us through great adversity. He has proven himself in the few years since he took office. He led us through the armed operations against terrorism and the massive humanitarian effort. He led us through a global economic crisis all but unscathed. He has accelerated, initiated and put in place island-wide development initiatives that will make us the emerging Wonder of Asia. If the people wish to continue to repose their faith in his leadership and reap the obvious rewards for a longer period, who are we to stand in their way by continuing to maintain an arbitrary time limit on the Presidency?

Mr. Deputy Speaker, Hon. Members of this House have received the determination of the Supreme Court made in terms of Article 122 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The Apex Court has determined that the Bill may be passed by a special majority of this House. It has determined that a referendum in terms of Article 83 of the Constitution is not warranted. The learned Justices of the Supreme Court have heard several strands of opinion and have determined on the basis of law and the Constitution, that this Bill is consistent with the Constitution. The Justices of the Court have made their determination based on dispassionate assessment of the arguments made before them. They are not swayed by political rhetoric and exaggerations of interested parties interested in impeding the passage of this Bill. They are guided by considerations of legality, justice and reason. We should all respect the opinion of the learned Justices who have determined that the inalienable sovereignty of the people as given expression to in Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution is not infringed by the proposed removal of the time limit on the Presidency.

Another argument, Sir, that is sought to be made out by the opponents of this Bill is that the Presidents presence in Parliament on a regular basis and the conferment of the right to communicate with the legislature is somehow a diminution of sovereignty of the people. Indeed, the Supreme Courts determination accepts that such a measure enhances accountability to the people in a more meaningful manner. Those determined to give this salutary step a negative twist have alleged that this is an interference with the legislature. Nothing, Mr. Deputy Speaker, could be further from the truth.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, on the issue of the Seventeenth Amendment, a lot has been said. So I will not dwell on it. I will only deal with the judgment in relation to this. The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that the exercise of the

executive power of the people resides in the Presidency. The provisions relating to the Constitutional Council have been consistently recognized by the Court as directory and not mandatory. To do otherwise would have necessitated the Seventeenth Amendment being placed before the people at a Referendum in 2001 for its passage, for example. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes, Sir, I am finishing off. While not intending to dwell at length on the legal arguments advanced in Court it is clear that the executive power of the people always resided in the President it and the Seventeenth Amendment did not divest the President of that power. Similarly, with regard to the Public Service, the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers to determine policy and to make appointments of Departmental Heads will be restored to the position that existed before the Seventeenth Amendment.

Several other arguments adduced also failed to convince the Supreme Court of the merit in the claims of the petitioners. In this context, it is my submission that there is no impediment to this House passing this Bill and I urge Hon. Members, through you Mr. Deputy Speaker, to support this Bill and the process of national renewal that we have undertaken under the leadership of His Excellency the President.

In conclusion, to those who continue to protest, as long as they are peaceful and do not infringe upon the rights of others, they are perfectly at liberty to express their views in a display of democratic dissent. This is what happens in a democracy and I can only expect that their protestations will be democratic. I only hope by their actions that their story is not remembered in the same terms as the characterization of life by Shakespeares "Macbeth", where it states: .......a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing."

Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. [. . 5.56]

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I will not read out the whole of my speech since I have very little time, but with your permission, I will table* the whole speech, since I think certain misleading statements of the Opposition should be corrected.

I think it is more important to look at the basic principles on which this Amendment has been put forward. When this Government was elected to office, it found itself required to engage in a great many structural reforms. Sadly, it had to proceed on the basis of a strange and confused Constitution formulated without any principles, grafting a Presidential system on to a Westminster style Parliamentary system. It was amended in the first six years of its existence so as to subvert even the few principles with which it had started - the power of the judiciary, the provision against crossovers, a fixed term for the Presidency and a limited term for Parliament. In those days, there was no resistance to such measures, least of all, from those who now masquerade as defenders of democracy.

The problem, Mr. Speaker, is that the Opposition did not consider how to increase the accountability of the Executive while enforcing and making sure that its authority was not ambiguous. Unfortunately, the authority of the Executive was rendered ambiguous over

the years and it was necessary to clarify it, to remove the confusion introduced by the Seventeenth Amendment. I have, for many years, been pointing out the absurdity of that Amendment which gave authority to a body appointed by a strange formula. Now, we have a change. We have a system in which like in the Westminster system, where the Prime Minister has virtually an unlimited power of selection; there is a process of second guessing. Now, under the Eighteenth Amendment we have a Parliamentary Council which, if it does its job properly, would do even more, given the potentially public nature of debate to prevent the appointment of the unsuitable.

However, Mr. Speaker, I would have wished the Council did not include the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition by name. The former holds an executive office and the latter sees himself, if optimistically, as the alternative Executive. It would have been preferable if the Council had consisted of five Members of Parliament without executive responsibility. But, in our strange Constitution which confuses the Executive and the Legislative in a unique fashion, which we do not find in other countries with Executive Presidential systems, such a duplication unfortunately, cannot be avoided.

I would have wished too, Mr. Speaker, that this first step in ensuring greater accountability in the President by making appearances in Parliament mandatory, had also specified that he would be required to answer questions. I believe this is intended, given that His Excellency the current President enjoys Parliamentary debate. But, we may have in the future a less sociable President. So, it be worth making this mandatory.

With regard to the removal of term limits, I am at a loss to understand the objections based not on any political theory but on the assumption that remaining in office for a long time is bad. This is an argument based on practicalities, but as we know from Greek history, Roman history, American history - I need only mention not only Franklin D. Roosevelt but also Pericles - there will always be exceptions even in democracies considered ideal as to rules or customs about term limits. When such extensions are in accordance with the democratically expressed will of the people, there can be no objections. And, in the present instance, as was graphically expressed in an article in yesterday's "Daily Mirror" by a distinguished Indian journalist, there are very good practical reasons which have to do with the urgency of nation building at this point.

Finally, Mr. Speaker, I must conclude by congratulating the Leader of the Opposition on once again strengthening his own position by engaging in talks with the President. Four years ago, he emerged from those

talks so emboldened that he dismissed a Hon. Member for Gampaha from the post of Deputy Leader. That dismissal strengthened the Government, just as this time round happened after his successful sidelining of Opposition.

Mr. Speaker, there is much more to accomplish in the area of structural reforms. We need to move to a sane electoral system, to ensure authoritative representatives of the people in individual constituency; we need to amend the 13th Amendment to ensure that ambiguities with regard to authority are ironed out; we need to be clear about the authority of the Centre in basic areas. For all this, we hope the Opposition too will act in the national interest. As a result of the broad consensus this Amendment has found, this Government can even more confidently than before, claim to represent a massive cross-section of our people. I hope that the whole Opposition will contribute in the future to helping us build a prosperous unified society. Thank you, Sir.

* : * : * speech tabled: Mr. Speaker, I am sorry for the numerous interruptions to the speeches of opposition Members of parliament, since we must respect those who are willing to engage in debate instead of resorting to unparliamentary tactics. Also, I should note, the more we listen to the opponents of this amendment, the more clearly do we find inconsistencies and assertions that are not entirely accurate. Some of these have already been pointed out, as with the criticism of this Bill being urgent, even by those who wanted urgent implementation of the unworkable Seventeenth Amendment. That, it should be remembered, was rushed through with unseemly haste, and indeed contradicted some aspects of the 13th Amendment, contradictions that have now been thankfully removed.

I will not read out whole of this speech, Mr. Speaker, since I have little time, but with your permission I will table the whole, since I believe certain misleading statements should be corrected. For instance, when the Standing Orders were cited yesterday, and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, following the Hon. ITAK National List Member, claimed that a required Resolution had not been placed before the House, he ignored the fact that the Standing order referred to the List III in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, a List that has not been touched upon in this amendment. Again, when it was claimed that the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people makes public consultation mandatory, the Hon. Member was ignoring the specifications in the Constitution as to how that sovereignty is to be exercised. It is indeed sad when those who still hanker after the Westminster model of government do not seem to understand the basic principles of that government with regard to representation.

But, whilst it would be entertaining to critique inconsistencies, more important I think are the basic principles in terms of which this amendment has been put forward. When this government was elected to office, it found itself required to engage in a great many structural reforms. Sadly, it has to proceed, in building a prosperous unified

351 352

society, on the basis of a strange and confused constitution. That constitution, we all know, was formulated without any principles, grafting a Presidential system onto a Westminster style Parliamentary system.

It was then amended madly in the first six years of its existence so as to subvert even the very few principles with which it had started, for instance the power of the judiciary, the provision against crossovers, a fixed term for the Presidency, a limited term for Parliament. In those days there was no resistance to such measures, least of all from those who now masquerade as defenders of democracy.

Mr. Speaker, in discussing possible reforms, I found in the first few months after the election that members of the opposition were obsessed with the idea that the Executive Presidency should be abolished. They were not prepared to discuss methods to increase the accountability of the office, though this is what they should have been concerned about. They should also, given the preference shown by the electorate to the Executive Presidential system, have tried to clarify the authority with that position.

Sadly, that authority had been rendered ambiguous over the years, and it was necessary to clarify it, to remove the confusion that had been introduced by for instance the Seventeenth Amendment. I have consistently pointed out the absurdity of that amendment, which gave authority to a body appointed by a strange formula. On the contrary, where you have Presidential systems, appointments must be the prerogative of the President, though it is right and proper to limit his ability to appoint arbitrarily.

Even under the Westminster system, though the Prime Minister has virtually an unlimited power of selection, the fact that the final appointment is by the Head of State ensures some limitations on absolute discretion. Now, under the Eighteenth Amendment, we have a Parliamentary Council which, if it does its job properly, would do even more, given the potentially public nature of the debate, to prevent the appointment of the unsuitable. I was glad in this regard that two members of the Council are appointed by the Opposition, since two heads are always better than one, in particular one that has made a fetish of avoiding accountability for a decade and a half.

I should note however, Mr. Speaker, that I would have wished the Council did not include the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition by name. The former holds and Executive Office and the latter sees himself, if optimistically, as the Alternative Executive. It would have been preferable if the Council had consisted of five Members of Parliament without Executive responsibility. Unfortunately, in our strange Constitution which confuses the Executive and the Legislative in a unique fashion which we do not find in other countries with Executive Presidential systems, such a duplication of functions I suppose cannot be avoided.

I would have wished too Mr. Speaker that this first step is ensuring greater accountability in the President, by making appearances in Parliament mandatory, had also specified that he would be required to answer questions relative to his executive functions. I believe this is intended, given that His Excellency the Current President enjoys Parliamentary debate, but we may have in some distant future a less sociable President without communicative skills who might not fulfil this provision in the spirit in which it is intended.

With regard to the removal of term limits, Mr. Speaker, I am at a loss to understand the objections, based as they are not on any political

theory, but on the assumption that remaining in office for a long time is bad for both those in office and those who are governed. That is an argument based on practicalities, but as we know from Greek and Roman and American history - I need only mention / Pericles and Franklin D Roosevelt - there will always be exceptions even in democracies considered ideal to rules or customs about term limits. When such extensions are in accordance with the democratically expressed will of the people, there can be no real objections. And in the present instance, as was graphically expressed in an article in yesterdays Daily Mirror by a distinguished Indian journalist, there are good practical reasons for not allowing extraneous considerations to enter into governance. In practical terms, this is likely to happen in the latter period of a second term presidency which must soon cease because of term limits, and which therefore loses its authority.

Finally Mr. Speaker let me conclude by congratulating the Leader of the Opposition on once again strengthening his own position by engaging in talks with the President. Four years ago he emerged from those talks so emboldened that he was able to dismiss the Hon. Member for Gampaha from the post of Deputy Leader, an action that his then friends in the leading anti-government newspaper justified by claiming, falsely, that there was no position of Deputy Leader in that secret and perennially changing document known as the UNP constitution. That dismissal strengthened the government, just as this time round happened after his successful sidelining of opposition.

Rarely can a man help his country while also helping himself, and we must be glad that the Opposition is blessed with such a Leader, who can now, with no consultation whatsoever, appoint 40 percent of the parliamentary Council. May his advice, during doubtless the next fifteen years, be wise, and in the national interest as well as his own.

For there is much more to accomplish, Mr. Speaker, in the area of structural reforms. We need to move soon to a sane electoral system, to ensure authoritative representatives of the people in each individual constituency, while ensuring that Parliament itself is proportionately and properly representative of all our people. We need to amend the Thirteenth Amendment to ensure that ambiguities with regard to authority are ironed out, in particular with regard to the preposterous, carelessly constituted Concurrent List. We need to be clear about the authority of the Centre in basic areas, but should broadbase involvement in that authority through the establishment of a Second Chamber.

For all this we hope that the Opposition too will act in the national interest, instead of using all issues as levers to undermine an elected government. As a result of the broad consensus this amendment has found, this government can even more confidently than before claim to represent a massive cross-section of our people. Now, with his authority over his own party strengthened, the Leader of the Opposition too will we hope contribute to helping us build a prosperous unified society. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
