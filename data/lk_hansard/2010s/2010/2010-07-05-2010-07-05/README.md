I would thank the Hon. Minister for his reply and his prompt action. But, could I ask him whether an immediate increase in the number of welfare officers would help to lessen the state of tension between guards and prisoners and would it help rehabilitation rather than punishment?

( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) Yes, I fully agree with you. I have already summoned all the top officials in the Prisons Department including the

officials in prisons in all parts of the island. I especially instructed them that their job is not meting out punishments, as it is already being done by the judges; but that they are there to rehabilitate the prisoners. So, I am going to introduce that concept and enforce it to the core and that is why I have already appointed a Committee. That Committee report will reach me in a day or two and thereafter I will make a statement in the House. I will see to it that the recommendations made in the Report are implemented. Hon. (Prof.) Wijesinha, the matter referred by you is already under my consideration and I will take action in that regard.

I also have to vindicate myself because there were some comments made at the last Emergency Debate by the Hon. Minister who is seated in front of me. On that day, this Member said that as I cannot hand over my son-in-law to the police, I have no right to talk about justice in the country. I am sure the day the politicians stop interfering with the law and order of the country, and

[ .] [ ][Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

my son-in-law will come and surrender to the police. But, no father-in-law has any obligation to hand over his son-in-law or any relative to courts. As far as my son-in-law is concerned, he is an elderly person and I cannot control him. When the same Member who blamed me for not handing over my son-in-law,

[ .] [ ][Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

That is my question. [Interruption.] -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. Sir, he is accusing a Member of this House of

[ .] [ ][Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

He must withdraw that or it should be expunged from Hansard. He cannot accuse - [Interruption.]

( )(The Chairman) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sarath Fonseka, you continue. - [Interruption.]

The same Member also said that I court-martialled the innocent people in the Army for personal reasons. If he can point out a single case, I am ready to submit my explanation. At the last Emergency Debate, two Members stated how I went and met them to get various favours. I had no reason to go and beg from any person to become the Commander of the Army. I only met those two Members to get assistance for various other things and those two Members, to my knowledge, are not in a position even now to get a transfer for a Corporal in the Army. The same Member said that I should pay my gratitude to the Secretary, Defence for making me the Commander of the Army. But, they do not even know that I was associating with the present Head of the State when he was the Leader of the Opposition, and none of these Members had the guts and courage even to talk to him.- [Interruption.] Before the 2005 Presidential Election, the Secretary, Defence came to my house with tears in his eyes and said, "I have no money to put advertisements". So, I had to give him Rs. 600,000 from my pocket, from my acount, and after that he almost worshipped me and went away. He went to the Hon. Tiran Allas house, presently, Member of Parliament, sat on a stool and begged for money and after that, they kicked the Hon. Tiran Allas out. "Ungratefulness" is a hallmark of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. They were ungrateful to the JVP, they were ungrateful to the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, Member of Parliament, they were ungrateful to the Hon. Tiran Allas and finally they were ungrateful to me also. [Interruption.] - You were not in a position, and you never visited the President when he was the Leader of the Opposition.

Again and again, the Secretary, Defence has taken law and order into his hands. Did he follow the legal procedure when he destroyed all the pavement shops? All of a sudden, the payment shops were destroyed and the owners were rendered jobless and they could not feed their families. In the same way, now he has taken a decision to go and put up a police post in the land given to me by the Government. He has put up a police post there. Is there law and order in this country? The Secretary, Defence has become the only man who can do any mad things, any crazy things in this country.

Can the Secretary, Defence explain how nine youths were sent to Milano? There were nine Tamil youths who were sent to Milano. They were arrested. They have been taken into custody from an IDP camp on suspicion of being terrorists. Thereafter, they have been sent to Milano. They have confessed that they were told to go and stay in Milano till they get orders from the Secretary, Defence to carry out various missions. This almost amounts to international espionage. This is where you can let down the country. People must take serious concern about these things. These are illegal acts in terms of the international context as well as the local context. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is the Secretary, Defence who gave you an extension to become the Commander of the Army. Can you not remember that?

( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) I was made the Commander of the Army at the age of 55 years. According to the Gazette notification and the Army Regulations, the retirement age was 58 years. Accordingly, I was not supposed to retire for the next three years. So, do not talk about this issue in future. - [Interruption.]

The CID officers are disgusted about the way that the Secretary, Defence is pushing the CID and the way they are getting harassed. The CID is detailed to harass innocent people. - [Interruption.] Nobody wants to serve in the CID now. The CID is being asked to follow various people as per jungle law. The Minister of Defence is also responsible for this. Minister, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the CID is following you also. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Speaker is not present here. Now, the CID has started following the Hon. Speaker also. Even family members are not spared; even own brothers are not spared. So, what is the fate of us in this country? - [Interruption.]

Recently, the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Finance was not in the country when the Budget was presented. He was in Ukraine. He accompanied his son. His son is a lieutenant in the Navy. Normally, when an army lieutenant goes for overseas training, he is not allowed to carry even US Dollars 200 or not allowed to take even 10 pounds of extra baggage. But, when this particular lieutenant went abroad for training, he was accompanied by a team along with the Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance. The cost was over US Dollars 500,000. So, is this justifiable? You all must be concerned about these things. - [Interruption.] Do not try to whitewash everything. The Sattambi Ralas - [Interruption.] About the - I have told; I have already explained about my son-in-law. - [Interruption.] These Sattambi Ralas will be there to do the whitewashing all the time. During ancient days, there was only one Sattambi Rala. But, now we have a series of Sattambi Ralas. - [Interruption.]

( )(The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe. You have 13 minutes. [. . 1.10] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Hon. Deputy Chairman, it is my privilege to speak in support of the Votes on His Excellency the President and of the Ministry of Economic Development. The Office of the President of Sri Lanka has proved to be the glue that binds the fabric of society and of the State in times of upheaval and difficulty. The last five years have proved that a strong presidency, unequivocally supported by the people and their elected representatives, can achieve tremendous things. The courageous and principled leadership of the incumbent constitutional executive has led us to the brink of a better, brighter, more prosperous and peaceful future. Going forward, Sir, we must rely on the continuation of that resolute leadership if we are to truly secure for all our people the real economic, social and cultural advances that the end of armed conflict has made possible.

Sir, our gratitude as a nation must be extended to His Excellency the President for playing a pre-eminent role in defeating terrorism and liberating our people from its clutches. Over the past four years I have been privy to several instances when extreme pressures were exerted on him to halt the humanitarian operations. The steadfast attitude he displayed then and the determination which exemplified his leadership, ably supported by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, enabled us to adopt consistent and coherent strategies which led to our decisive victory. As Minister in charge of the subject of Human Rights, I was able to support his efforts by ensuring that the correct situation was placed before the international community. It was through this engagement that we won the approval of the inter-governmental UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last year, which overwhelmingly voted to congratulate Sri Lanka on her triumph and to express support for reconciliation and unification of the Sri Lankan people.

Sir, our attention as a legislature, a Government and as a nation must now turn to winning the peace in the aftermath of a comprehensive victory over terrorism. Our people expect that they will benefit from the end of a long-drawn out conflict and we must deliver on that expectation. The close correlation between peace and development was trenchantly laid out by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa who stressed that peace is a

sine qua non for development. Our path ahead is clear: it is laid out for us in the strategic goals set out in the "Ten-Year Horizon Development Framework 2006 - 2016" developed in keeping with the policy goals of the "Mahinda Chintana". The advantage of this holistic approach to development planning encapsulated in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future is that we do not focus attention on economic development in isolation but on social, economic and cultural revival and resurgence with equity and justice for all. His Excellency the President, addressing the Sri Lanka-Ukraine Business Forum just last week in Kiev, said, I quote:

Our vision for Sri Lankas development is apparent. It integrates the positive attributes of market economic policies and economic growth with our own domestic aspirations for social justice and human development.

This broad vision for development goes far beyond mere GDP growth - it implies development that is fair and inclusive and leads to the uplift of the physical quality of life of our people. Our efforts in promoting development to combat poverty must not be only targeted at eradicating income poverty but to increase human capabilities in line with the approach propounded by people such as Professor Amartya Sen. It is this overarching vision that must guide us in the months and years to come as we, under the experienced and expert tutelage of His Excellency the President, lead the country forward.

Sir, coming back to the Office of the President, we must also keep in mind that this Vote also encompasses some of the most vital institutions that promote good governance, justice and social equity. As the former Cabinet Minister for Human Rights, I must highlight the importance of the role of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka - an independent institution that will have a critical role to play in assuring those rights of the people guaranteed by our Constitution and the several international instruments that we are a State Party to. I envision a role for the Human Rights Commission that transcends the adversarial, inquiry-based dispute resolution mechanism that it has become and come to be identified as. By confining itself mainly to civil and political rights, Sir, the Commission has limited its mandate and its utility to the nation. To my mind, Mr. Deputy Chairman, the Human Rights Commission has a far greater role to play in promoting human rights through positive programmes focusing more attention on economic, social and cultural rights. Building on the impressive gains we have made over the years, through investment in so-called welfare measures and infrastructural improvements, these programmes should be directed towards generating and exploiting social capital that will advance the cohesion and unity of purpose that we need to develop our country. Social capital is a necessary precondition for successful development. With regard to civil and political rights in particular, the Commission also needs to be more

99 100

2010 05

involved in education, sensitization and training so that the duty-bearers - the agents and instrumentalities of the State - will be better equipped to safeguard and protect the rights of each and every Sri Lankan. This envisaged activity does not unduly broaden the mandate of the Human Rights Commission beyond the scope of the statutory remit accorded to it by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 21 of 1996, but will only refocus its thrust in line with national needs and priorities. The Commission, as I have stated, Sir, is just one of the vital agencies which is covered by this Vote.

Sir, as I stated in my address to this august House last week during the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget 2010, we have recorded many successes in the stabilization of our economic fundamentals in the post-conflict period despite the uncertainties of the external economic environment. Moreover, with increased projections for tourism in 2010 and the near future, we can realize the impressive potential in this sector - building on more than 12 per cent gains recorded in earnings in 2009 over the previous year, with arrivals expected to increase by substantial levels this year. I have no doubt that under the stewardship of my Colleague, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, tourism in Sri Lanka will reach new heights.

Sir, we also need to carefully manage the inflows of investment into Sri Lanka in order to maximize the benefit of such inflows for the people of Sri Lanka. Under the purview of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister for Economic Development, such inflows are being carefully managed to ensure that not only economic sectors that need a boost are being provided with it, but also areas that have been under-served in the past are receiving due attention. A major component of the post-conflict recovery is the development of the regional and rural economy. This is the subject of a special focus and is receiving due attention particularly, the region of the North and the East of Sri Lanka. The impressive achievement in the Eastern Province as a consequence of the "Negenahira Navodaya" Programme is there for all to see. Work on the "Uthuru Wasanthaya" Programme is also proceeding apace. The areas which saw the worst effects of the armed conflict will be able to experience a renewal of economic and social opportunity on a scale unmatched in the past. Taking account of the lessons learned from these two successful programmes, six regional development programmes in the short to medium-term are also envisaged, ensuring balanced regional development throughout the country.

It is also important to note, Sir, that public investment is not the only vehicle or strategy that can be availed of in responding to the call to kick-start the economy. Where appropriate, large-scale public investment has been made. However, the Ministry of Economic Development - the Hon. Minister is here - should and is putting in place public-private partnerships and is incentivizing private

investment in many key areas of the economy. These interventions can and will produce positive benefits for the people and the country as a whole.

Sir, in conclusion, the two aspects covered by these two Votes are most important parts of an integrated whole. The Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has set in place clear goals, priorities and strategies to secure advances in all sectors. The various Ministries whose allocations which we will debate on this week will all work as contributing partners to realize these aims. Through you, Sir, I call upon the Hon. Members of this House, all our people in this country as well as our international friends and partners to work cohesively with us in making Sri Lanka the emerging Wonder of Asia that we hope she will become.

Thank you very much, Sir.

) (The Deputy Chairman) The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, please. You have got 25 minutes. [. . 1.21] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The Rajapaksa administration, Mr. Deputy Chairman, has shown an uncanny ability in recent times to create world records. In fact, before the last General Election, Sri Lanka had the dubious honour of having the worlds largest Cabinet of Ministers and now, I think we have created yet another dubious world record of having the worlds smallest Cabinet of two Ministers.

As some say, this new Cabinet - the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe may or may not agree - consists of two Ministers and 39 doormats for the family, especially for the young Rajapaksas to wipe their feet on while receiving on-job training, at the expense of the senior and experienced politicians holding the rest of the name-board ministries.

In fact, the Rajapaksa triad, consists of His Excellency the President as the Minister of several key ministries along with my good Friend - the "Super Minister", as I would call him - the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and his Super Secretary brother who controls the defence arena. Between these three gentlemen, they are controlling over 63 per cent of the annual budget. According to the reports presented to Parliament, out of the total expenditure of Rs. 1.9 trillion, Rs. 1.2 trillion comes under the direct purview of the Rajapaksa triad.

However, due to the limited time available, Sir, I am not going to discuss the economics of the Heads, which

101 102

come under the Rajapaksa brothers today. Especially, at a time when a three-member Panel of Experts has been appointed to advise the UN Secretary General on Sri Lanka, I feel that it is appropriate to talk about the short- sighted acts of commission and omission of this triad, which has led to the sorry state of affairs our country is facing today. - [Interruption.] Please, I have only 25 minutes and I cannot answer any questions now - [Interruption.] Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, however much you dance, you will not be made a Minister in November. So, just do not dance for your supper - [Interruption.] I know all the officials are here. The "Super Minister" is here. You want His Excellency to know that you defended him. Good for you, but you will not be made a Minister. Sir, the appointment of the Experts' Panel, is the culmination of nearly four years of governance by the Rajapaksa regime where the rule of law in our country was systematically undermined, using the war against terrorism as a basis or justification for doing so. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, if it is a point of Order, it is certainly alright, but do not let him eat into my time with bogus points of Order - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I rise to a point of Order.

( )(The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! A point of Order is being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I am surprised. I do not know whether he is senior or has just come from the Matara bushes. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, it is not a point of Order.

( )(The Deputy Chairman) I am not going to allow him to raise it - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) According to the Constitution, there are no "Super Ministers". There are Cabinet Ministers.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) It is not a point of Order - [Interruption.] In fact, Sir, unlike these jokers who call themselves "Ministers" now, - the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa will testify to what I am saying - as early as 2006, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the then Government, I discussed the consequences of what the Government was doing at the time, several times with His Excellency the President, with the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, who was not "honourable" then, but who was an adviser, and with the Secretary, Defence and with the Secretary to the President. In fact, finally I even wrote to His Excellency the President on the 13th of December 2006, a 13-page letter. In this letter I stated, I quote myself :

.....due to various 'omissions and commissions' on our part.......

I included myself as part of some of these wrongs. I further quote:

"...as the Government, our image internationally is deteriorating rapidly which may lead to serious repercussions for the country in the coming year. As Your Excellencys Minister of Foreign Affairs, I would be failing in my Missions to highlight the true nature of the LTTE as a terrorist organization. Despite your duty if I do not highlight some of these concerns and impending perils."

In fact, going on from there - I do not have time to read some of them - I actually praised the President for the patience and for the courage he showed, in the first year of his Presidency. I further quote:

"As you are aware, during the first six months of Your Presidency, confounding many critics, Sri Lanka achieved many significant and outstanding diplomatic victories in relation to our fight against terrorism. Under your guidance and leadership, my Ministry was able to launch a vigorous and effective campaign abroad through our diplomatic ....".

I am just going through this very quickly and yet, I stated that despite provocations by the LTTE how the President remained calm and collective and how because of our restraint and commitment to a political settlement, I managed actually to obtain, with the direct help of the United States Government - I met Condoleezza Rice personally twice in one year - and through the United States Government, the biggest diplomatic victory Sri Lanka has ever achieved recently, that of the listing of the LTTE as a terrorist organization on the 27th of May 2006. Not only did we stop there, because of our friendship with the United States of America at the time and with the EU, we managed to start what was called "a contact group" and this group was led by the United States. No one knew this at that time and this group actually went to the extent of stopping all LTTE procurements in South-

103 104

2010 05

East Asia and this was made possible because of the excellent foreign relations we had with America and Europe.

Actually, all these facts are stated very much in detail in my letter to His Excellency the President, dated 13th December, 2006. Mr. Deputy Chairman, because of the importance of what is happening now, I would like to table* it now.

And, I would like to urge you to include this in full in the Hansard, so that people will know what chances we had to move forward and not this road to ruin, which we have taken recently. So, please not only table it, but also include my letter of 13 pages in the Hansard.

However, the emergence of the "white van" culture was in mid of 2006. Due to the "white van" culture of abductions and extra-judicial killings, political assassinations of Members of Parliament like the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj, the Hon.T. Maheswaran and the increase in the number of attacks on journalists and as a result of the Defence Ministry's stubborn refusal to investigate such crimes and the Government's inability to respond to serious allegations in a credible manner, the country started to lose the international goodwill His Excellency had harnessed in the first six months. We lost it all in a great overnight because of all these abductions and killings and the culture of impunity. [Interruption.] Hurling abuse - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who murdered the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham? [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay, if you think so. But, I am asking you, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, you are a practical man, please do not believe your own propaganda, tell it to the country. Some fools may believe it, but you all must know the truth, if you are going to face this together, because finally the way things are going, not only the name of the Rajapaksa family will be tarnished, but the name of all Sri Lankans will be tarnished, if you go in this direction. That is why I asked you to look at this matter in a practical manner. -[Interruption.] Hon. Rajapaksa, I do not have to talk like that because the international community is much more aware of what is going on in this country. But, - [Interruption.] Wait, I will come to that. - [Interruption.] Okay. I know you will be replying finally, but I am covering all that, Hon. Rajapaksa.

As I wrote, again I quote:

Instead of responding to the allegations made against us in a credible and factual manner, ... "

You should have done that; we could have faced it together.

"...people who make such allegations become victims of vicious personal attacks bordering on criminal defamation. This strategy of 'shooting the messenger' will only alienate the international community further away from us.

That is how I ended that letter.

My sincere appeal unfortunately, Mr. Deputy Chairman, did fall on deaf ears and finally, today we are on the verge of being labelled as an international fugitive and face the risk of being hauled up before the ICC - International Criminal Court. This would be a severe blow to the image of our country, which has a proud history of being a much-loved and respected member of the international community. Mr. Deputy Chairman, for all those who do not know what the ICC Treaty is, the ICC Treaty or the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, as you know, became operational in 2002 and as of July 2009, there were 110 countries who had become State Parties to it. The ICC, based in Hague in the Netherlands, has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals responsible for the most serious crimes of international concern; genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. However, the ICC has jurisdiction over all these crimes, only if the country is a State Party or a signatory to the Rome Statute. Fortunately, for the Rajapaksa family and for your Government, Sri Lanka is not a signatory to this Treaty because the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe in 2002, refused to be a signatory on the basis that Sri Lanka had the independent institutions able to undertake such investigations, if and when the necessity arises.

In fact, Hon. Rajapaksa, the Rajapaksa family and the Rajapaksa Government owe a debt of gratitude to the much-maligned Ranil Wickremasinghe for his forward-thinking wisdom as the Prime Minister. - [Interruption.] It does not matter. Hon. Rajapaksa, , .

However, Mr. Deputy Chairman, the woes of this regime do not end there because there is provision in the Treaty for the UN Security Council to refer a non-State Party to the ICC like they did to Sudan, which was also a non-signatory to the ICC, in 2005. - [Interruption.]

( )(The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Jagath Pushpakumara, please sit down. Hon. Azwer, please sit down.

105 106

______________ * . * .* Placed in the Library.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Let the dancing monkies dance for you, Hon. Rajapaksa. I urge you to listen to my speech.

Sudan is a case study - please get your officials to study it and educate you on that - of interest to Sri Lanka in the present context. Subsequent to the refusal of the Sudanese Government to co-operate with the UN to investigate allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1593 referring to "the situation prevailing in Darfur since 1st July 2002" to the prosecutor of the ICC. This is the path they are taking now. That is why I am warning you. Despite Sudan insisting that the court has no jurisdiction over the matter - just like here, they got people to shout, they got people to go on protest marches in Darfur - the courts issued arrest warrants in 2007 for the Sudanese Humanitarian Affairs Minister and a militia leader. In July 2008, an arrest warrant was issued for President Omar Al-Bashir, making the first Head of State to be indicted by the ICC. In spite of familiar and anti-Western rhetoric and staged protests in Darfur, President Al-Bashir, even today, remains an international fugitive with an international warrant issued for his arrest; other than to a few other African countries, he is unable to travel outside his country.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, although I have many reservations about the Leaders of this Government, I would hate to see such a scenario being enacted in Sri Lanka. The ignominy of such situation would be a devastating blow to our country and our people, with devastating consequences for years to come. That is why the Government, even at this late stage, must deal with this problem in a responsible manner to salvage the good name of our country instead of resorting to its village-thug tactics and wishfully hoping that countries like China will bail us out of a difficult situation in the UN eventually.

Please listen to this also and keep it in mind. It is interesting to note that China did not use its veto power when the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1593 against Sudan, referring Sudan to the ICC in March 2005. China abstained along with the United States allowing the Resolution to pass by 11 votes. This was in spite of the fact that China and Sudan have very warm and cordial diplomatic relations. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is holding such a brief that we do not know whether he is a member of the American Congress or Sri Lanka.

( )(The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. Please sit down. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Beijings direct investment rose to US Dollars 1.6 billion in 2005 making Sudan the ninth largest recipient of Chinese FDI. Look at this also. Iran is a very close ally of China but, recently China backed the US-sponsored sanctions against Iran about its nuclear powers in the United Nations. So, be practical, be pragmatic. Do not be daydreaming thinking that various other countries will come to save you when things are difficult; it will not happen. Especially the Government of China is a very practical and pragmatic country, which always makes sure that it does not go against the most powerful bloc at critical moments, and that is the history of the United Nations.

If our country is referred to a war crimes prosecution, it will also tarnish the image of our Armed Forces.

The Sri Lankan Army is one of the most disciplined armies in the world and this was the main reason why our army was chosen for peacekeeping activities around the world by the United Nations in 2002. It is simply because Sri Lanka had a disciplined army much respected by the world, that the United Nations thought the Sri Lankan Army was good enough to be part and parcel of the peacekeeping force.- [Interruption.] Exactly. But, as you know, however even in the best of armies, there could be a few black sheep or miscreants who tarnish the image of the entire force by their actions, and many countries not only Sri Lanka, protect the reputation of their respective armies by investigating any allegations and punishing those responsible in keeping with the law of the land.

Everyone talks about the United States, Mr. Deputy Chairman. I will just take one example now because of limited time. In 2004, in The New Yorker" magazine in the United States - I am sure the Hon. Rajapaksa is well aware of that - a journalist called Seymour M. Hersh, along with a local TV station related accounts of physical, psychological and sexual abuse including torture and homicide of prisoners held in the Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq by personnel of the US Army. This magazine accused US army personnel of physical, psychological and sexual abuse of the most horrible crime. For example, Sir, when those allegations were made, what did the US Government do? They did not label the journalist as an Al-Qaida sympathizer and send white vans in search of the journalist nor did they bomb the TV station which announced this allegation. The Secretary, Defence in the United States - you know, unlike in Sri Lanka - is a Cabinet Minister and did not use his position to threaten the media to stop them writing about these allegations.

107 108

2010 05

Instead, Mr. Deputy Chairman, the US Department of Defence carried out a full-scale investigation and 11 soldiers were convicted in court between May 2004 and March 2005 and these 11 soldiers were sentenced to military prison and dishonourably discharged from service. The London Times, last Wednesday reported that the Prime Minister, David Cameron is to announce an inquiry into claims that British Security Services were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects. This is how a government acts when there are such allegations.

Even in Sri Lanka the previous governments had responded swiftly to allegations of State violence. In the face of mounting criticism and outrage at the rape and murder of 16 year old Krishanthi Coomaraswamy in 1996, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga ordered a trial-at-bar against the accused army personnel; the forces personnel behind the floating bodies in Bolgoda Lake in 1995 were also charged and presented to court, and the forces personnel who threatened journalist Iqbal Athas were also brought before the law. This is how we acted. When there were allegations, we even had a trial-at-bar against the personnel of the army. - [Interruption.] Please answer later.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) , ?

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , . This is how responsible governments behave, Sir, to allegations of State violence which is inevitable especially in countries that are fighting the menace of terrorism. Of course, there would be short comings when you are fighting a war against terrorism. Mr. Deputy Chairman, the International Commission of Jurists in the Berlin Declaration of 28th August 2004, stated, I quote:

In adopting measures aimed at suppressing acts of terrorism, states must adhere strictly to the rule of law, including the core principles of criminal and international law and the specific standards and obligations of international human rights law.

It also states, I quote:

the odious nature of terrorist acts cannot serve as a basis or pretext for states to disregard their international obligations.

The Council of Europe also articulated in 2002 the need to uphold the law when fighting terrorism. I quote:

.while the state has the right to employ to the full its arsenal of legal weapons to repress and prevent terrorist activities, it may not use indiscriminate measures which would only undermine the fundamental values they seek to protect. For a state to react in such a way would be to fall....."

This is very important.

..... into the trap set by terrorism for democracy and the rule of law. Unfortunately, Mr. Deputy Chairman, in Sri Lanka, the Government seems to have fallen into this trap. At the way the Government, especially the Ministry of External Affairs along with the rest of the Cabinet, is handling this present crisis - this is a good example where a whole bunch of monkeys are shouting - Prabhakaran may well have the last laugh from beyond the grave. So, for the sake of our country, the Government must act in a responsible manner to save its reputation. Let experienced diplomats handle this situation instead of the jokers and amateurs who have been posing as diplomats over the last four years. - [Interruption.]

Let us also not for a moment forget that this crisis has been brought on by the Government itself. Interruption.]As I pointed out in this House last Friday it was His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa himself as Member of Parliament who invited the UN and other International Human Rights Agencies to intervene in Sri Lanka 21 years ago. I table* that speech also.

- [Interruption.]

Even recently, the United Nations Secretary-General stated that he is acting on the basis of the Joint Statement of the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations Secretary-General on 23rd May, 2009, in which the Government had given an undertaking to take measures to address the grievances relating to violations of human rights. You were the people who gave the undertaking. Neither has this position been refuted by the Government nor has the Ministry of External Affairs stated at any time that the Joint Statement is inoperative. Therefore, in conclusion, Sir, I say that the Government has obviously conceded the position of the United Nations Secretary-General. ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana - Deputy Minister of Ports and Aviation) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Therefore, I request the Government to co-operate with the United Nations to clear the name of our country instead of howling and growling at the moon like a pack of demented wolves.

Thank you, Sir.

You should look into this matter and find out the persons who did this? If the word official is wrong in the official website of the Ministry of Economic Development, it is not good for you; it is not good for the country; it is not good for anybody. That is what I am trying to show you. I am being positive here. I am being constructive in the criticism. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, you sit down. What kind of message are we trying to convey to the people?

Hon. Minister, the last point I really want to make - because I am running out of time - is in regard to one very important agency which comes under the purview of your Ministry. That is the Board of Investment. There is a deficit between the savings and investments.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, give me one more minute, please. I will finish within that time. What we need to do is to bridge the gap between savings and investments.

Now, there is an issue which has come up as to whether it is fair to have non-BOI and BOI companies and whether the tax treatment to those two different entities is fair. I think a decision needs to be made on that. I am aware of that and I believe the Hon. Minister and the others responsible for it will make that decision in the Budget of 2011.

There must be a leverage to our international relations to improve or increase investments. So, Hon. Chairman, we need to be strategic at this crucial time.

Minister will have the wisdom to do so and get the rest of your Colleagues to stand with you.

Thank you very much.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Chairman, from this morning we have been listening to many voices on many issues pertaining to the Seventeenth Amendment and the economy of this country.

Firstly, I wish to touch upon the Seventeenth Amendment which is a vital factor as far as the administration of this country is concerned. We have debated this point many a time, and the salient feature of this is that the Constitutional Council nominates the persons for the Election Commission, the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, which is not in existence at all, the Finance Commission and the Delimitation Commission. All these Commissions have to be appointed under the Seventeenth Amendment. I do not understand why the Government of Sri Lanka today is not appointing the Constitutional Council. In what way can it jeopardize the interests of the administration of this country, is my question. I do not understand how all these powers can be in the hands of His Excellency the President. We are not trying to criticize His Excellency the President, but my position is, why does the Government of Sri Lanka not have the Constitutional Council appointed so that there can be proper administration in this country, and that is a vital issue as far as we are concerned.

There were criticisms made at that time that the late President J.R. Jayewardene appointed the famous lawyer Neville Samarakoon, QC, as the Chief Justice of the country. I agree. Mr. Neville Samarakoon was the most leading practitioner in Sri Lanka, in the District Court of Colombo at that time. He was an undisputed lawyer and the late President J.R. Jayewardene made him the Chief Justice of this country. Justice S. Sharvananda was also appointed from the unofficial Bar. He had the largest practice in the Court of Appeal of this country and was appointed to the Judiciary. Mr. Neville Samarakoon at the latter stages of his career had a dissension with the late President J.R. Jayewardene and quit the post that he

195 196

was holding. That was the criteria and the status of the appointees of the United National Party at that stage. I agree they came from the unofficial Bar, but they were people of a certain category; they were people of a certain calibre who would have adorned the precepts of this country.

In the same way it is important to note that during the former President, Tony Blairs time, the Attorney-General of that country had made a Ruling that the intervention on Iraq by the British Government was illegal. That was how the Attorney-General of the United Kingdom took up the position. Today, even the Attorney-Generals Department is under His Excellency the Presidents nomination. The Attorney-General of America and the Attorney-General of Britain are also political appointees. I do not deny that. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, your Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, went to the UN and justified the attack on Iraq. What do you say to that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am not talking about that now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You mentioned it. That is what he did. So, you ask your Leader at least now to withdraw what he said there.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I did not mention about my Leader justifying the attack on Iraq. That is quite irrelevant. [Interruption.] My position is that as far as the fundamental issues are concerned - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, I did not talk about whether Sri Lanka was for the intervention of Iraq or not. I only gave an example as to how the Attorney-General of Britain had said how he made a ruling against Mr. Tony Blair. That is my criterion. If the Sri Lankan Attorney-General or the Attorney-Generals Department can give a ruling of that nature, certainly, I will bow down to our Judiciary. [Interruption.] I hope so. At the moment, as far as the Judiciary of this country is concerned, it is politicized to a great extent. Therefore, we should now watch our situation; economically, we are down; otherwise also, politically we are down, in the sense that there is political interference in the Judiciary. If Judiciary fails, the entire fabric of society fails and that will be the end of Sri Lanka in one extent.

In the same way, we have to consider whether the economic growth of this country has been properly fulfilled. Today, a few minutes ago the EU countries have made a ruling to say that the GSP Plus is going to be withdrawn from the month of August. This has also been considered and debated in many forums. Ultimately, Sri Lanka is going to lose US Dollars 570 million as income to this country. Are we in a position to sacrifice this amount of money when our nation is in the threshold of poverty? I must say that we are in poverty. We might say that our GDP rate is high or you may bring many factors on paper. But, at the moment, we are in a strained situation. We cannot compare ourselves with Singapore. Singapore probably had closed down all the small industries at that stage, but they were in an economically strengthened position. But, Sri Lanka cannot do so. Therefore, we have to consider ourselves in a more practical manner. Even if the European Union wants to discuss certain issues or if the United Nations wants to have a Commission here, it is perfectly in order. The United Nations Commission is a Commission only to advise the UN Secretary-General about certain affairs; whether that Secretary-Generals ruling is going to be correct or not is not going to affect Sri Lanka. The Chief Justice, Hon. Sarath N. Silva, had made an order to say that foreign treaties signed in the international forum is not binding in this country unless that treaty is made a legislation in this country. So, then, why are we worried about this? If there is no serious function, if we have not done anything wrong which is unlawful or irregular as far as this country is concerned, why are we scared about it?

Certainly, we have to maintain the sovereignty of our country. I am not trying to say that we should give up the sovereignty of our country. The sovereignty of the country is important. Similarly, to safeguard the sovereignty and the interests of this country, the fundamental issues, the human rights should be safeguarded. Then, we will be provided and be looked upon. We are a minor nation in this country. I have mentioned this so many times. Our population is just 20 million. The population of Calcutta is 18 million. I mean, we are a small country. We are just trying to raise our heads and we must compliment His Excellency the President for winning the war. I have no objection to that. Winning the war had been done in a proper manner. Certainly, we all accept it. So, why are we scared about all these human rights issues?

Subject to that, I also wish to bring to your notice - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, you are a senior lawyer from an educated family. I admire that. But, do you acknowledge the fact that foreigners must come and intrude into this country and have inquiries? Why can you not have your own inquiry here?

197 198

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Azwer, even if a foreigner or anyone wants to come here from the moon and inquire from us, if we are okay, we let them inquire. There is nothing wrong. In no way is it going to affect the sovereignty of this country. [Interruption.] No, Sir. It is not the dignity. It is only a question of inquiry.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Do not betray the country like your leader. He is doing that day and night.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Will the USA allow us to go and make inquiries about them?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are a great Tamil. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) As far as the other issue is concerned -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Do not betray - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) As far as the Tamils of the Vanni are concerned, today resettlement has been accelerated. I must say that out of the 232,000 families who came from Vanni, about a thousand odd families are staying in social status; in the sense, they are being looked after by so many institutions and there are about another 230,000 families who are going to be taken off from Menik Farm. [Interruption.] I am going to Vanni on the 12th also. [Interruption.] I am running an institution in Vanni at the moment. I am running an institution and we are opening that institution on the 12th. That institution is looking after the people who have mentally affected by the war and we are having doctors to look after their interests. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Is it an NGO?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) It is not an NGO. It is a private organization. It is not an NGO, for your information. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Are you getting foreign funds? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am not getting foreign funds. It is from Sri Lankan funds. That is it. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, go ahead. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you. So, what I have to say is, as far as we are concerned, in Sri Lanka there are about 230,000 families yet to be looked after and they have to be given their shelter. Today, the United Nations Organization has said that they are going to give eight bags of cement and roofing sheets for building purposes. But, there again, once we get the cement, we are unable to get the sand. Buying sand in the Vanni District is very expensive. Therefore, we have to look into the matter. As far as the Vanni is concerned, there are about 4,000 business houses that have been totally affected after the war. Janashakthi Insurance was the only company that gave insurance at that stage. But, there are many others who have not insured themselves and they are in a very bad state of affairs. Therefore, even if the people who have been displaced are sent to their own traditional homes, we must look after their well-being. How are they going to live? There is no income for them to live; they are not sure of their next meal. Is the Government of Sri Lanka looking into these matters? This is very vital. These are the matters that we have to look into. We may have taken them out of the camps and sent them back to their own villages, but we must see whether they are in a position to live. Their documents have been lost and there is no schooling facility that is available. At present, out of the 239 schools, only about 195 schools have been re-opened. The rest of the schools have not yet been opened and no facilities have been given. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) No, no, we have opened enough schools for the children in those areas.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, Sir, but at the moment, as at 31st of May, out of the 239 schools that have been there in the Northern Province, only 195 schools are functioning, ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) No, more than that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Maybe. I am not trying to say, "no. I am happy that the Government of Sri Lanka has done that. I am not trying to criticize that, but I am only trying to say that we should expedite the process further. I want to bring this to your knowledge so that we can go ahead. In fact, Sir, as I told you earlier also, certain people have completely lost their documents. They have no documents of the deeds, they have no documents of identity cards, they have no documents whatsoever after the war. So, they are even unable to get back to their own lands. Therefore, the Government must think of some way to resettle these people in a humanitarian manner which can help the community at large.

These are little factors which I have to bring to your kind notice. As far as the Vanni District is concerned, the National Chamber of Commerce is also collecting certain particulars and these people have been registered there. The National Insurance Trust Fund should also accelerate the process of releasing money to the people who have been accordingly insured.

Therefore, I trust that the Government will look after the economy, the people of this country and also the human rights of this country will be upheld to the most.

Thank you very much, Sir, for giving me this opportunity.

, . 3 . . . Sir, I quote "The Island" of 3rd July, 2010: Matara District UNP parliamentarian Mangala Samaraweera yesterday charged in Parliament that some senior judges in the higher courts had compromised their independence and integrity of their profession in anticipation of perks, promotions and diplomatic postings on retirement.

This is totally wrong, because the Government has taken every step to safeguard the independence of the Judiciary. This Government has not taken any step to remove Judges of the Supreme Court like what the UNP Government did in 1978 when introducing the present Constitution. We all can remember what happened when the 1978 Constitution was introduced and how they removed the then Supreme Court Judges. During President J.R. Jayewardenes regime, after delivering judgments against the State the residences of the Judges of the Supreme Court were stoned at by thugs. He has forgotten that. For the first time in the history of the Judiciary, the Chief Justice and some Judges of the Supreme Court were appointed from the unofficial bar using political influence. We all know that.

The Member of Parliament for Matara District, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, has further mentioned about the promises given to the judges and suggested an Impeachment Motion to be brought in against some judges of the higher courts with the support of the Opposition Members of Parliament. This too is totally wrong. This is also an influence on the judges of the higher courts of our country. This is how the Hon. Member tried to express his views and in a way it is an influence on the judges. Not only that, he wants to send this message to the international community at this juncture because he knows very well that there is a three-member panel appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. On the other hand, there is a threat to remove the GSP Plus concession given to our country.

215 216

[ . ]

2010 05

So, that is why he tried to send this message to the international community by expressing those views on the 3rd of July, 2010.

I would like to quote againThe Island of 3rd July, 2010 where he has further stated:

He called upon his colleagues in the Opposition to bring an impeachment motion against such judges.

Now, see the extent he has gone into in expressing his views towards the judges of the higher courts in our country.

He goes on to say, I quote:

Such action, he said, would open up a national debate on their conduct.

As you know, this is also totally wrong. The Executive has never taken any step to remove judges like what the Executive did in 1978. Not only that, the Executive has never influenced the Judges of the Supreme Court or even the magistrates. The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara mentioned about the transfer of a magistrate in the Colombo District. It is not a transfer but a promotion from a magistrates court to a district court. That is the normal procedure followed by the JSC. So, at this junctire I wanted to express my views regarding the remarks made by the Hon. Member, Mangala Samaraweera, to clarify the position.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Chairman, it gives me pleasure to participate in this Committee Stage Discussion and also to speak a few words on the extension of the state of Emergency. The state of Emergency has been going on for years and today, it looks as if it will go on for many more years mainly because the Vote of the Ministry of Defence has been increased to Rs. 202 billion this year and it has been projected for the next three years as Rs. 202 billion, Rs. 203 billion and Rs. 199 billion respectively. The people in this country thought that the war has come to an end and there would be relief for them. But, if you are going to allocate 21 per cent of the Governments expenditure on defence for another four years, I do not know how people can expect any development or relief in this country. So, it is so unfortunate. - [Interruption.] It has been projected as Rs. 202 billion for the next four years. So, the reason for having a defence budget of Rs. 202 billion for the next four years, I do not understand.

If this is to be changed, then the expenditure on defence has to reduce and it can be reduced only if there is proper, lasting, sustainable peace in this country. To create sustainable peace, the Government always held out a peace proposal that was to be brought up by the All Party Representative Committee. The All Party Representative Committee, chaired by the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, sat for 128 sessions and brought out a document. But, unfortunately, the Chairman did not show

239 240

[ ]

2010 05

a copy of that document even to the members of that Committee. That is how this Government has handled the peace process. Every time a foreign leader comes here or when our President goes abroad, he always says that the All Party Representative Committee has been set up to bring permanent peace to this country. But, up to date, a copy of the report has not been shown even to the Members of the Committee. But, I have the verbatim report of every meeting of the APRC and we are, at the moment, working out or drawing up the draft of the Committee Report, as it should have been based on the deliberations of the APRC. So, unless there is sustainable peace in this country, we cannot reduce the defence budget. I think we should always try to reduce the defence budget and instead, increase the development budget.

Today, we are also discussing the development budget of this Government, which is under the Ministry of Economic Development. The Ministry of Economic Development has been allocated up to Rs. 60 billion. But, out of that Rs. 60 billion, only Rs. 250 million has been allocated for estate infrastructure. When we saw the structure of the Government - the Cabinet and the Ministries - we thought estate infrastructure has been abandoned by this Government. Fortunately, though they have not brought in a ministry, a line ministry or a department, the functions have been included under the Ministry of Economic Development and Rs. 250 million has been allocated under that Ministry for estate infrastructure.

In 2006, a National Action Plan for the plantation community was drawn up by Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas Government. Under that Plan, Rs. 100 billion was required for the development of the estate community. Out of that Rs. 100 billion, only Rs. 250 million has been allocated this time. So, maybe, it will take another 400 years for the development of this community to take place, which is very unfortunate.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Do not mislead the House. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is very unfortunate - [Interruption.] The National Action Plan, which was proposed in 2006, has not been even presented to a single donor for donations or donor funds for the development of this community. So, it is so unfortunate that this community has been left high and dry by this Government. ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Do not worry. The Government will look after the estate sector. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, the Government is not allowing him to do that. - [Interruption.] We can see that. When the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake was the Minister of Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development, he was given Rs. 2.5 billion as his allocation. But, now, when that subject is under the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa as the Minister of Economic Development, he gets only Rs. 250 million. Why is that? The reason is this. In 2005, the "Mahinda Chintana" promised 50,000 houses in three years. In 2006, 4,500 houses were started to be built, but up to date, even those 4,500 houses have not been completed.

( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This, I am telling you because the former Deputy Minister of Estate Infrastructure Development himself told me that he could not finish those 4,500 houses. But, today -

( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) I think you are misleading the House. -[Interruption.]

) (The Chairman) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, it is not a point of Order; it is not an explanation. - [Interruption.] Sir, I have to continue. - [Interruption.] ) (The Chairman) . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, the former Deputy Minister of Estate Infrastructure Development comes to this House today and says that he built 11,500 houses. He confessed to me that when he was Deputy Minister, he could not complete those 4,500 houses because the Government did not give him the funds. - [Interruption.] Today, he comes and tells this House that he built 11,500 houses, which is not true. - [Interruption.]

) (The Chairman) . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) You were the Chairman of the Trust at that time and the allocation of the funds was made to you. You did not fully utilize those funds. Ultimately, you are blaming the Government and the Ministry. You should have done it at that time. Funds were given to you. - [Interruption.]

) (The Chairman) , . [ ]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Hon. Deputy Minister who spoke now is trying to put the blame on me. If the Hon. Deputy Minister could not get the funds, how could a Chairman function? He failed and because of that the whole thing failed. - [Interruption.]

Sir, I spoke about the APRC earlier. Today, the Government is trying to amend certain parts of the Constitution. ( ) (An Hon. Member) ? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) , interpretation .

They propose that the Presidency should be extended for unlimited periods; the Constitutional Council should be abolished and the electoral system should be changed. But, Sir, at the APRC, which was constituted by this Government with 11 parties from the Government and two parties from the Opposition, decided unanimously, by consensus that the Presidency should be abolished. They said that a parliamentary system of government must be restored. The APRC also recommended that the Constitutional Council should exist and that after the recommendations of persons to the Constitutional Council, they should be appointed without any question by the President. It also suggested that a Proportional Representation system should continue with two ballot papers so that the overall representation in any body would be on a proportionate basis. Considering the recommendations of the APRC, which was appointed by the Government, it is unfair today for this Government to

try to smuggle in Constitutional amendments through this House. We should be given the opportunity to challenge it in court. So, it should not be brought in as an urgent Bill. That is what I urge in this House.

Thank you, Sir. [. . 8.43]
