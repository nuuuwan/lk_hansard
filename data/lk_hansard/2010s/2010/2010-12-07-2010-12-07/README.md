( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I think today is the ideal day to discuss the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs, particularly after the visit of His Excellency the President to London. There are so many questions that are being asked in this regard in the country today. So, I hope the Hon. Minister will answer those questions to the best of his ability.

I would like to know from the Hon. Minister whether the decision to visit London by His Excellency the President was taken by the Ministry of External Affairs or was it supported by political catchers of the President? Because, Hon. Chairman, we have information that the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in London had faxed a message asking the President not to visit London. He had also submitted a legal opinion given by Mr. Desmond de Silva, son of the former MP for Kandy Mr. Fred de Silva, that if the President visits London, it will trigger off a judicial inquiry. So, the High Commissioner, supported by legal opinion, informed the President not to visit London. Then the President of the London Branch of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party also sent a fax message asking the President not to visit London. So, why did you select this particular moment? Because, Hon. Minister, you went to London in October and you got the taste of what was to come. When you went to London in October, you met Mr. Hague. I do not want to elaborate on what happened at that meeting. You got a clear message that the President is not going to be welcomed. You could not even get an appointment for the President to meet the British Prime Minister in November. Therefore, you came back. What did Mr. Hague tell you? He said, We

1443 1444

want an internal inquiry about the events in Sri Lanka, particularly during the last month of the war. That was what he told you and for the first time in the history of the Ministry of External Affairs, before you issued a statement on what happened, they issued a statement because it has been the practice to misreport and misrepresent facts in the Government communications. Mr. Hague was careful enough to immediately issue a statement so that there was no room for misreporting. So, I want to know why His Excellency the President visited London at this time. The whole problem is, you think that London is like Colombo. The judicial system and the Government are separate. Unlike here, the British Government has no control over the judicial system. So, I want to know why you embarrassed our President. He is our President. We have no personal problems with him. He is the President of all of us. We fought with each other; we criticized each other but after the election the winner was considered to be His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa and we respect him. We have no problems with him personally. Why did you embarrass him? Is there a conspiracy on the part of the Government to embarrass him? Soon after the war ended, Mr. David Brown wanted to visit Sri Lanka as an all-party representative. You did not give him visa to visit Sri Lanka after the win. Then, Mr. David Miliband came here. What did you do? There was a demonstration opposite the British High Commission when Mr. David Miliband was here. So, now it is payback time. You should have known that. It is payback time for the British Government and that is exactly what happened. What is the earthly hurry to address this Oxford Sri Lanka Society? It is a Sri Lankan society. It is not strictly the Oxford Union. It is a Sri Lankan society with 13 people. That is the truth; you know that. Even casino owners in Sri Lanka have addressed the Oxford Sri Lanka Society. It is nothing unusual. So, as a former Oxford graduate, you should have advised His Excellency the President accordingly and told him that this is a Sri Lankan society. You know that; your heart knows it. So, these are the questions that people are asking. Why was our President embarrassed? You should have advised him properly. You are the Minister of External Affairs. The High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in London sent a fax message asking the President not to come.

Now, I would like to refer briefly to the allegations made against the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya. When you went abroad what did you say? You were trying to suppress all these facts in Sri Lanka and mislead the Sri Lankan people.You are trying to say that there is nothing internationally. Is that the correct position? We have a serious problem. You had better address that. Without suppressing the media, without suppressing the comments of the Opposition, we have to face this situation bluntly. There might be a UNP Government in the future. Even then, we have to face this. Even though, there is a change

in the government, it is a government. Even that Government will have to answer these charges, not only you. So, if you want our support, we are prepared to give.

Now, you were questioned in London - I have the newspaper article with me, but I do not have time to read it - and they asked you about what happened in the last stages of the war. What did you say? Hon, Minister, you said that the LLRC is in place to investigate what happened during the last stages of the war. But, if you refer to the Terms of Reference of the LLRC, it has no reference to what happened in the last stages of war. You know that. So, when you go abroad you say one thing; you say LLRC can investigate. But, does it have a mandate? I am asking you to be honest. Does it have a mandate? It does not have. So, when someone like our Deputy Leader refers to what happened in the last stages of the war, you say that he is waking up war crimes. We are saying what you said abroad. . , LLRC ; . . - [Interruption.] You can reply later. For how long can you go on like that? I told you last time that it is not easy to go round the world with the baggage of this Government. I told you that point bluntly. When you were with Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, you went abroad peacefully. There were no problems because she, to some extent, worked with the international community. Then, with the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, it was much easier for you. You know that. But, I told you that you are carrying a big pottaniya now; a burden; a burden of war crimes; human rights violations; disappearances and abductions. These are the allegations. Are these false? How many MPs have been shot and killed? Thirty media personnel have been killed and journalists too have been killed. Are you denying all these? Hon. Minister, you may be the most educated person in the Cabinet but you cannot answer these questions when you go abroad, and that is why we are in this predicament. So, what are you going to do? For how long can you say that nothing happened in Sri Lanka? For one and a half years you have been telling that nothing happened in Sri Lanka. You are just marking time. Why did the President appoint the LLRC? It is to mark time. He wanted to get time. He wanted to show the world that he is investigating into the situation in Sri Lanka. Therefore -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) A point of Order is being raised.

1445 1446

[ ]

2010 07

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is referring to the conduct of the President. ( ) (An Hon. Member) He is becoming a joker. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He cannot do that under Standing Order No. 78. He is making an inference on the conduct of the President. He must withdraw that or it must be expunged. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Speaker will give a Ruling. ( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . [ ] . ( ) (An Hon. Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We all like the President. We have nothing personal against him. We are ashamed that he was embarrassed by the wrong advice given by the Ministry of External Affairs. That is our allegation.

The Ministry of External Affairs is spending one million pounds a year on media campaign but the product cannot be marketed. That is the problem. You cannot market Sri Lanka today because of the policies that you adopt. I told you last time that I do not blame the Minister of External Affairs but I blame the policies of the Government. Did I not say that? So, change the policies. You, as the Minister of External Affairs, must tell the President, This is what has to be done honestly. That is what Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar told the former President Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Mr. Kadirgamar did not stay like a puppet. When Jaffna was to be invaded - I was his Deputy Minister then - he told her in my presence, "You can conduct the war but no

casualties". Leaflets were dropped all over Jaffna; civilians were moved out; Jaffna was captured without a single casualty. That should be the duty of the Foreign Minister. If the leaders of our country violate the international law, how can you travel around the world? It is not only you, yesterday the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen went to India and there was a demonstration.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, that is all wrong. The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen did not leave the Island. That is wrong. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Okay, please - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He did not go. It is wrong. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) So, it is your duty to advise the Government correctly and if you cannot save the foreign policy of this Government, there is no point in staying. If you just stay silent, the President gets advice from catchers and hangers-on. That is what happened this time. The High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in London has told him not to come; the President of the London Branch of Sri Lanka Freedom Party has told him not to come. I want to know what you said. Did you advise the President to go? - [Interruption.] How can you get out of this situation? It is not only you but we are also worried about Sri Lanka. How can you come out of this problem? Can you say that nothing happened in Sri Lanka and everything is fine?

Since Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran is here, I would like to - [Interruption.] When you go abroad, you say that Sri Lanka is fine. But, what does the evidence before the LLRC reveal? I am grateful to "LAKBIMAnews" for publishing this news item. Mr. Chairman, page 9 of the "LAKBIMAnews" of 05th December, 2010, states, I quote:

"Karuna group behind more abductions, cash demands for release"

, , . . , , ? ; ; . . ? .

1447 1448

Sir, coming on to the payment of one million pounds per year to an advertising firm, is it worth it? What have you achieved by paying one million pounds? Nothing. So, what I say is, even if you hire an advertising firm, the product has to be good, Sri Lanka's policies must be in place. If the product is good, you can market it and if the product is bad, you cannot market it. So, advise the President correctly. Whether we like it or not, there are allegations against us internationally. You know that. So, there has to be an engagement, there has to be a dialogue with the international community; not to say Sri Lanka is fine, Sri Lanka is perfect, law and order is perfect, there is rule of law, et cetera. There is no point in uttering that in Sri Lanka. We have to satisfy the international community. So, why do you not start a dialogue with them? We will help you because we also want a solution to this problem. So, I would tell you that the best way to start is to introduce a political solution. If you genuinely work on a political solution, we are there to help you. With that political solution, you can start a dialogue with the Western world. Mr. David Cameron said in Parliament that there has to be accountability for the last two months of the war, and at the same time there has to be devolution of powers to the minor communities in Sri Lanka. So, if you start a devolution process genuinely, we will help you. We are for devolution. We support the Tamil parties and their rights. We are for devolution. There is nothing to hide. The President speaks of the Thirteenth Plus. Thirteenth Plus , , , . It is a bundle of contradictions. So, I would advise you to start a dialogue immediately with the international community. By not having a dialogue, you have lost the GSP. Then, a UN Committee was appointed against Sri Lanka and its report is coming in January. When that report comes, the situation will be worse.

Then, Hon. Minister, you have made a statement in Parliament about Nepal. Your statement has been flatly denied. You have made a statement in this Parliament that the Nepalese President asked for help from our President to solve the problems in their country. But, the Nepalese Government has totally rejected that saying that no such help was asked for. Why is this? So, no one knows what is happening in Sri Lanka; no one knows what is happening in the Foreign Ministry. Then, Sir, you invite the Pakistan President and the Indian Foreign Minister to visit Sri Lanka on the same day. Both are in the country on the same day. It is well-known what the relationship between Pakistan and India is. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is very good.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You invite both countries on the same day and when the Pakistani President is here, our President leaves. It is not protocol. If you invite a President here, before he leaves he has to go and say good-bye to the President of the host country. But, no one was there to see the Pakistani President off, not even the Prime Minister. Therefore, I would urge the Minister of External Affairs to tell us whose decision it was for the President to visit Britain and what happened actually during that time.

Then Sir, I would like to know whether people are still taken to the External Affairs Ministry on exams or through other means, because we get information that people are being taken through the back door. There was one First Secretary who came and worked for the President for two months during the last Presidential Election; because he is married to the daughter of a senior judge, he came and worked for the President for two months during the campaign. So, all those are really not expected of the External Affairs Ministry.

I got the information that the British High Commission in Sri Lanka might even close down. I would urge the Minister to reply on that because Sweden, one of the Western countries, closed down its Embassy in June this year and now, there is a reliable story that even the British Government might close down its High Commission in Sri Lanka. So, how are you going to face this situation? The American Ambassador in Sri Lanka has confirmed to "WikiLeaks" that Sri Lanka is responsible for certain human rights violations of a very serious nature.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Do you agree with that? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) This is what the Ambassador has said. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are making allegations against the Government. Do you agree with that statement?

( ) (The Chairman) . .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Member, I stated that to show the trend. This is the trend. You must understand the trend. The Swedish

1449 1450

[ ]

2010 07

Government closed down its Embassy in Sri Lanka and the British Government might close down its High Commission in Sri Lanka. The American Ambassadors thinking is all on the websites. So, this is the thinking. You must understand the thinking. So, the External Affairs Ministry is not doing anything. Hon. Minister, what is important is not what we think of our country, what is important is what the international community thinks of our country. You are losing the international war, I am telling you quite frankly. Day by day, you are losing it. We also want to help you, because as I said earlier, even a future UNP Government will have to face this situation; your baggage will have to be carried by us. So, we, the Opposition, are willing to support you. If you bring in a political solution, we will back you. I have always held the view that it is the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that can give a solution to this problem. I have always held the view, though I am a UNP Member, that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will come with a solution that will be acceptable to the Sinhalese people of this country. So, that is why we want you to solve this problem. We will support it and I wish you well. I hope you have recovered and will state whose decision it was for the President to visit London at this time.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Mr. Chairman, when we look at the challenges faced by Sri Lanka in the arena of foreign policy today, this is by far the most challenging time period in the history of our country. We fought a war that claimed thousands of lives, both military and civilian, over a gruesome period spanning over 30 long years. We won the battle, we won the war, we won the people and most of all, we won Sri Lanka. We won Sri Lanka back. Instead of now supporting the people of Sri Lanka for her development efforts and reconciliation process, the Opposition today is on a witch-hunt to topple the Government by conniving with foreign forces.

Let me go into a little detail as to what exactly transpired during the last visit to the United Kingdom by his Excellency the President. Mr. Chairman, I wish to bring to your notice an extremely dangerous trend that is developing in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, by and large, in relation to the existence of the LTTE. It was only last week that His Excellency the President visited the United Kingdom for an official programme which consisted with the meeting of around 25 Members of Parliament of the House of Commons, meeting with the Foreign Advisory Committee of the House of Commons and also the much now debated address to the Oxford Union. The controversy about the media reporting and the Opposition pointing fingers at, which exists around the cancellation of the Oxford Union address is a matter that needs to be cleared in its proper perspective.

As you are quite aware, His Excellency the President addressed the Oxford Union early last year on the invitation of the then President of the Oxford Union. As perhaps most of the Members would know, the term of the Presidency of the Oxford Union changes every three months as per every term. The first address was made during the height of the battle between the Sri Lankan Armed forces and the LTTE. Even at that time, the LTTE and its supporters staged demonstrations and protests in Oxford on the same day. Simultaneously, when his Excellency was delivering his first speech to the Oxford Union, there were protests. Tight security was provided for the event, even to the extent that the security authorities providing helicopters for surveillance purposes. It was a much successful address by the President to a fully packed union.

For the first time in the history of the Oxford Union, a Head of State was invited for the second time to address the Union. I quote from the letter signed by the President of the Oxford Union, Mr. James Kingston on the 1st of December, 2010. I quote:

"As President of Sri Lanka, you would have given us the unique honour of being the only serving Head of State to have twice visited the

1473 1474

[ ]

2010 07

Union. As was the case in your previous visit, we were hoping to once again learn from you your views on the future of your country.

This, Mr. Chairman, was the view of the Oxford Union. The same letter further states, I quote:

While the Union maintains a deep commitment to the principles of free speech and debate, we also have a responsibility to those who live and work in the city of Oxford. The disruption and danger that residents and citizens would face is by far too great to justify hosting the speech. This is to say nothing of our Members who, similarly could be directly placed in danger should the expected protests turn violent.

Mr. Chairman, this is what the President of the Oxford Union, Mr. James Kingston, in his letter to His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa is conveying. Now, Sir, the President of the Oxford Union speaks of disruption; the President of the Oxford Union speaks of danger to the citizens. From whom is this disruption and danger? It is from the LTTE. This, Sir, is the gravity of the situation. This is the gravity of the situation that is not properly understood by the likes of the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. Today, the LTTE has grown itself to a large-scale organization that has the power to disrupt and endanger civilians living in the United Kingdom. The City of Oxford, the University of Oxford, the Oxford Union has its time-lasting traditions with its existence all compromised - let me reiterate - all compromised and dismissed by the threat posed by the LTTE.

Mr. Chairman, I wish to quote from the statement issued by the Oxford Union on the 2nd of December, 2010, which is published in their official website:

The Union holds a politically neutral stance with regard to speakers and the decision was not made in relation to any aspect of Mr. Rajapaksas political position, the polices of his administration or any allegations against his government.

As the President of Sri Lanka for the last five years, the Union felt that Mr. Rajapaksa would provide a unique insight into the political climate of the region in his speech.

Therefore, Sir, it is evident and clear that the Oxford Union had to succumb to the threats and the sheer strength of the LTTE in not proceeding with the address. Today, the so-called transnational government purportedly established by the LTTE is indeed quite strong in the United Kingdom. It has spread its tentacles to the House of Commons, individual Members of Parliament and all other apparatus of Her Majestys Government in many forms in giving false information.

The challenges facing us as a country today far exceeds the efforts that we have taken so far to mitigate these threats. It is my view, Sir, that we have to now very aggressively launch a campaign to show the world that the LTTE today is raising its ugly head once again to propagate terrorism in the world through this fictional transnational government.

The United Kingdom must be wary of these facts. It is no secret that today the LTTE wields quite an influence in

the respective constituencies that is represented by many Members of the House of Commons and this has become evident through WikiLeaks, that even the former British Foreign Secretary spent 60 per cent of his time on Sri Lanka for the want of votes. Sir, this is a very grave situation. Here is a terrorist organization legally banned by the Government of the United Kingdom and it is wielding so much power and influence so as to make the then Foreign Secretary, David Miliband spend 60 per cent of his time on Sri Lanka, working against Sri Lanka. We can see the influence and the power of what is left of the LTTE. Such is the magnitude of the threat to the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. Such are the challenges faced by us in the international arena today.

It is in this environment that it is despicable to the least to see the likes of the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya wanting war crime investigations in Sri Lanka. The Hon. Sajith Premadasa has stated - I am very happy to see him in the House today - "the LTTE is the only perpetrator of war crimes in Sri Lanka". Sir, I wish to quote from the statement made by the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya to the "Sunday Island" newspaper on 5th December, 2010. This is said in reference to His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa. I quote:

"playing constantly to the sensibilities of its hawkish support base"

"Hawkish support base?" Hon. Member, to whom are you referring? It is the polity of Sri Lanka. It is the very same people who voted in excess of 1.8 million votes for His Excellency the President and it is over 60 per cent of the people in this country. Is then the Sri Lankan polity hawkish? Is the general public of this country hawkish? If they want to protect their sovereignty, their country and their territorial integrity, are they hawkish? Is that the view of the UNP? It is evident and clear, Sir, that the UNP today is on a path to destruct Sri Lanka and its hawkish polity as per the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya. It is not only the Government that he has found fault with, but the people of Sri Lanka as well.

It is in this context, Sir, that we need to strengthen the Ministry of External Affairs and lend all possible support to the Hon. G.L. Peiris, who is one of the most best suited to implement our policies and to mitigate the threats that are before us. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I wish to conclude with an epigraph which I would like to quote from Sir. Winston Churchill:

In war: Resolution

In defeat: Defiance

In victory: Magnanimity

In peace : Goodwill".

Learn Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, learn from the wise words of Sir Winston Churchill.

Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I am glad to speak after the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. He said, "Magnanimity in Victory". This is what is lacking in your Government. [Interruption.] Why? Where have you been magnanimous? Your intolerance in this House, your intolerance in everything you do is a reflection of your arrogance. [Interruption.] You have not been magnanimous. This is the whole problem. [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please let me speak. This also shows that you have no magnanimity. You are not allowing us to speak. That is the whole problem. [Interruption.] Do not disturb. Allow us to speak in this House. You have now stated that you are going to bring in a No-confidence Motion against the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya. You have also stated that you are going to take action against the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. This is the intolerance we are talking about; this is the arrogance we are talking about. That is not magnanimity. You must listen to others. You have an Opposition to point out your faults. You first listen to them and then correct. You are saying that the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya has asked for an investigation into the so-called war crimes. You have already admitted that you are willing to investigate into the war crimes. How did it happen? You have appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. Why did you appoint that Commission? The whole world said that they are going to investigate into the war crimes in this country. When the United Nations appointed a Committee to advise Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General, on the war crimes or the war itself in this country, what did you say? You said, No, there is no need for a foreign investigation into the war crimes, You said that you would appoint your own commission to probe into what happened during the period 2001 to 2009. So, you have admitted it. You have already said that the accusations of the foreign countries and the Tamil diaspora have to be met with a probe. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was accused of being in London taking part in the demonstration that took place at the Airport. [Interruption.] What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said, We must have a probe, investigate into the whole matter and clear him of this charge.

It is the same principle that the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya placed before you saying that if the world is accusing us, the best way to clear ourselves is to investigate and prove that nothing like that happened in this country.

You have now put General Sarath Fonseka in prison. What does General Sarath Fonseka say? He has said that no war crimes took place at all under his command. But, what happens with your arrogance and the resulting intolerance? The first thing you do when you win the Presidential Election is to incarcerate the man who delivered all the victories that you are enjoying today.

How did you win the Presidential Election? Why did you hold the Presidential Election within eight months of the end of the war? Because you thought the people were hawkish. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Not at all. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Because you thought the people were hawkish, you thought you must cash in on the war victory and that is why you held the election so early. So your hawkishness made you depend on the people whom you thought were hawkish and you relied on that and held the election early. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You are insulting the people of Sri Lanka. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not insulting. What I am saying is what you thought. Please do not interrupt me, Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. I am speaking. You had a chance to speak. Let me speak. Do not be intolerant. Do not show your arrogance in this House. You thought the people were hawkish. I do not say the people are hawkish. I know that the Sinhalese people are good people. In 1983 when I was in danger, they protected me and you know, I am married to a Sinhalese. I live with a Sinhalese. I know that the Sinhalese people are not hawkish but you believe that they are hawkish. That is why you held the election before they forget the victory in the war. But, who delivered the victory in the war? It was General Sarath Fonseka. He played a big role. He asked for certain things which you provided but he did the war. He was in the forefront and he won the war for you. What did you do to him? You put him in prison.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Why do you not talk about the Navy, why do you not talk about the Air Force?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) They also contributed. But, who conceded that General Sarath Fonseka was in the forefront of winning the war? You, yourself. Right? You, yourself. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera showed me a photograph which appeared in the newspapers before. - [Interruption.]

1477 1478

2010 07

Please listen. At least, build some tolerance in yourself if you believe in democracy. In that photograph, Sarath Fonseka was cutting a cake to celebrate the victory of the war and who was standing behind him? The President, the Prime Minister, the Defence Secretary and the Heads of all other forces were standing behind him. So, you conceded that he won the war for you. You are now carrying on with your political victories based on this victory in the war believing that the people were hawkish.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only two minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I want to tell you, do not try to silence the Opposition by bringing in Motions in this House against our Members. They were elected by people. They have the right to speak for the people and for the country. Therefore, they are speaking to safeguard the honour of this country in the world and not to do anything harmful to anybody. -[Interruption.] We feel confident as Sarath Fonseka has said that there had not been war crimes. Okay. Then, why do you not prove that there were no war crimes by having a probe? This is what the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya said. You cannot decide whether he can remain in Parliament or not. There is no provision in the law for Parliament to move a No-Confidence Motion against a Member of Parliament and remove him from the House. You cannot move a No-Confidence Motion against the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana because he has shown in this House that he was not in London on the day that incident took place. So we ask you - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Give me one more minute, Sir. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, you say that you are the authority on Parliamentary practice but you have not been honoured with even a post of Deputy Minister. - [Interruption.] We kept you as a Cabinet Minister. Today, you are sitting in the fifth row. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Thank you very much, Hon. Member. The next speaker is the Hon. Neomal Perera.

[. . 12.13]

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Minister, you can start your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The speakers before me spoke about the article which appeared in the "Sunday Island" of 5th December, 2010. Anyway, I am ashamed to read this article appearing with the Hon. Karu Jayasuriyas face, and he is now denying what the newspaper says. That is up to him to agree or disagree. It appeared in the newspaper. The whole world has seen what was published in the newspaper with his face appearing. So, I am ashamed. I am sure he would have swallowed a gundu from the leader and he has signed without even reading the article. If he had read it, I am sure he would not have got it published.

Many speakers referred to the same question that the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella asked. That shows that they were not attentive or listening to the Discussion on the Votes of the Foreign Ministry today. So, I am not going to talk about it because the Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris answered all the very same questions asked by the Hon. Kiriella as well as all other Members of Parliament.

I would like to talk about what we have done. The year under review has been an eventful and active period in terms of our external relations. The year 2010 opened with those hostile to us alleging that there has been very little progress in the resettlement of IDPs; that the LTTE who surrendered themselves continue to languish and that the reconciliation effort is weak. Today, the false propaganda behind these claims have been exposed.

Of the 297,000 IDPs at the end of the conflict, a little over 10,000 remain in transit camps and welfare centres. Only 5,200 out of 11,696 LTTE cadres who surrendered have been given counselling and vocational training for them to be re-integrated to the society. By the end of 2011, all of them would be released to rejoin the society, except for those who have committed serious crimes because they have to face indictment and trial. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - LLRC - is purposefully going ahead with its work since its establishment in May 2010. The large numbers coming

1479 1480

forward to testify before it indicates the trust that the people have in its functioning.

The Ministry of External Affairs has sensitized the world of these significant achievements. Even those who were once critical, today commend Sri Lanka on its diligence and rapidity of the resettlement effort. Information has been shared with the UN system on the important work done by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. The UN on its part, has been very careful to repeatedly say that the panel set up by the Secretary-General is only advisory in nature and that it has no investigative role.

The Ministry also works with the NGO secretariat on issues of access for humanitarian assistance. Wherever NGO organizations are clearly contributing positively and productively, the Government stands committed to facilitate their work. Just last morning, I was invited by the UN in Colombo to represent the Government at a ceremony marking the successful conclusion of rehabilitation projects jointly implemented by the European Union and the United Nations for which they contributed Euros 122 million for resettlement and development of the country.

The Ministry of External Affairs is guided by the policy of Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the future. The vision of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is to cultivate and develop new friendship while appreciating our established relationships with all other countries. Our long-established relationships are what we inherited from colonialism. We continue to foster our ties with the developed nations. Our President has made several visits and met several CEOs of the United States while he was attending the General Assembly in New York.

Another significant meeting His Excellency the President had was with the Editorial Board of the highly influential Wall Street Journal. Then, in October this year, we had yet another round of trade and investment facilitation consultations with the US in Colombo. Significantly, the US officials were accompanied by a strong business delegation. Last May in London, we assumed the Chairmanship of the Board of Governors of the Commonwealth Secretariat. Last August, an important visit to Japan was made by two senior Ministers of the Government, namely, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. This visit enabled high level contact between our side and senior personalities of the Democratic Party of Japan, which leads the current administration.

With the developing world, our relationships continue to grow from strength to strength. We have just had very successful visits by two senior Statesmen of our region.

The first to come was the Indian External Affairs Minister and then came President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan. If both of them wished to come at the same time, it is their wish and we accommodate them whether they are at loggerheads or not. I wish to state that to the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella also. With India we have deepened and widened even further, our engagement cutting across a range of sectors. We value the assistance India is extending to us for the rehabilitation of the Northern Railway and other development and construction works ,including the building of 50,000 houses in the conflict-affected areas in the North. With Pakistan, we are resolved to leverage our close and firm ties, to build up an economic and trade collaboration, worthy of the friendship between us.

Similarly, there are many aspects of development that we have done and we are going forward. We are not closing our doors to the western world. We have to be grateful to those who helped us in the war to liberate this country and the people from the clutches of the LTTE. I would like to state that although we have got rid of the LTTE terrorism in this country, it has not stopped internationally. The President made it a point to visit London despite advices, to show the world that we still have to be united as a nation because we yet have to face the LTTE terrorists who are still collecting money to fight against this democratically-elected country. So, I expect you all, to not only talk but also support us physically. Do not go behind closed doors and bring disrepute to this country.

Finally, I request you to follow a young leader like the Hon. Sajith Premadasa. If you are going to follow leaders like the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Hon. Jayalath Jayawardana, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and so on and so forth, you are not going to support the Government and the people of this country to come up, but to destroy this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Chairman) . ... .

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. In discussing the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs, we should look at the situation in which we were five years ago and compare it with now. Then, we were wholly dependent on what called itself the international community, so much so, that representatives of that community thought they held the balance between conflicting forces in Sri Lanka. Sadly, so deep had the rot sunk that it was outsiders who had to make the position clear, while some of those who represented Sri Lanka in those days spoke slightingly of military solution to the terrorist problem, and thought it their duty to keep what they thought the international community satisfied.

The United Nations then provided funds to a terrorist movement and made excuses for child soldiers. Ambassadors to Sri Lanka preached to us, High Commissioners felt free to denigrate Government officials and funds intended to assist the Sri Lankan people were not given to Government.

All that, Sir, has now changed but there is more work to be done, for instance, to ensure that our national institutions are built up instead of international funding continuing to go to external agencies and we have to register clearly that any country will base its foreign policy on the interests of its own citizens. Less acceptably, we must understand that some politicians will confuse the interests of their country with their own personal electoral considerations. Unfortunately, in having relied so heavily on what the Opposition thought of as the Western safety net, we laid ourselves open to abuse when those holding the safety net put their own safety first.

We had then, Sir, to rethink our foreign policy or rather to return to the roots that had held us in such good stead for the first quarter century after Independence, before the adventurism of the Jayewardene government caused us such humiliation. Instead of putting all our eggs into one frail basket and alienating all others, we reverted

to the principle that, I like to think, Mahinda Thero had suggested when he brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka.

In telling the King or testing his capacity then, he asked him some simple questions, beginning by pointing out a mango tree. He asked him first whether there were other mango trees, which the King pointed them out. He then asked if there were trees other than those mango trees, and the King assented and pointed them out. He then asked if, apart from those mango trees and those other trees that were not mango trees, whether there were any other trees. The King thought hard and pointed to the first mango tree and it was then that the Mahinda Thero thought him fit to be taught the new religion.

Taking that story as a parable, Sir, we need, in our interactions with the world, to think in circles, beginning with those closest to us. Ultimately, we have to register the centrality of the self, which with regard to foreign policy means the supremacy of the interests of this country. But, we should think in terms of our kinship to those that surround us, and then of our kinship with those further away.

This Government, Sir, has achieved much by following that principle. We have concentrated first on our relations with the SAARC region, and then with Asia, all of which were neglected in the dangerous flirtation with strange gods that began in 1977 and was then reintroduced in 2002. We have to look further afield, as our most successful Ambassador at a time of difficulty, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, did in Geneva, when he built up a coalition of the principled, not just those willing, to do anything or use anyone, to achieve their own personal or national goals. Our coalition, Sir, included countries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America to overcome the threat of renewed terrorism that we now know clearly was being encouraged by extraneous electoral considerations.

We need, Sir, to build on those early principles. We have achieved much, but we can do more with the association of South East Asian nations. We should work harder to build up contacts in South America following the tremendous impact Ambassador Kunanayagam had in that area. In Europe, we should diversify, building on the goodwill that the new crop of ambassadors here has evinced, to promote solid trade relations with countries where mature politicians will ignore trivial electoral considerations. Tragically, as we move towards a more mature understanding of the actual shape of the world, we find people who complain childishly of ambassadors when they are positive about Sri Lanka claiming that our standing in the modern world has been eroded. I refer to the report of the last "Sunday Island" and these are the people who are doing their best to erode that standing further.

But, with the habits these dinosaurs in the UNP inculcated diehard, we should engage in more rounded training so that members of our foreign service can deal

1487 1488

with the wide range of problems the contemporary world throws up. We should look at relationships through the prism suggested over 2,000 years ago, as a philosophical principle rather than a reaction, to see where our real interests lie and how we can promote those while not upsetting others and not allowing others to upset us unnecessarily.

Sadly, some of this impropriety has been encouraged by some Members of the Opposition. I am glad that others have now begun to speak out against denigration of this country by its citizens for parochial electoral considerations or other more insidious ways of achieving power or other creature comforts. But, it is truly pitiful to see senior leaders of the Opposition jumping on or even trying to create a bandwagon in the belief that this will win them favour. To claim that it is correct to assume that the West expects a higher standard of governance while denigrating Asian nations, including it seems India and China, shows wholesale ignorance of not just recent revelations but the whole shoddy history of patronage for dictators provided they were clients. We saw what happened in the '80s, when India was treated so shabbily, with President Jayewardene trying to sell tank farms and facilities for broadcasting, with an obsequiousness that even the West had to reject, when it advised him to recognize Asian realities.

But, the era of assuming that Western patronage was all that was required for success is now at an end, Mr. Presiding Member, in the new thinking that may breathe life again into the United National Party. I hope that the elected Government, whilst benefiting from constructive criticism, will in future get all the assistance it requires from all Sri Lankans to promote the goals of this country in harmony with our neighbours, as well as the world at large.

Our Minister of External Affairs is well-equipped to take us forward in practice and in principle, and we should all support the Ministry to work consistently in pursuit of the vision he and His Excellency the President have so effectively sketched out.

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

[. . 12.39]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How many minutes have I got, Sir?

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have 17 minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you. Hon. Presiding Member, at this particular moment, I would like to speak a few words on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs, which is a very important Ministry and I am even more delighted to speak at a time when the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. Neomal Perera are at the helm of the Ministry. But, the disposition of the amiable and generous Minister gets perturbed at times when we awake matters that are relevant to the Ministry. So, we ensure that we speak of the incompetent Government and not necessarily of the Minister, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris himself. But, at times it is your actions that help to ensure that the Governments activities are being probed and spoken.

Hon. Minister, as you know, the Ministry of External Affairs is the Ministry that basically reflects the foreign policy of the country, which is an extension of the domestic interest. It should be richly and realistically projected against the backdrop of an ever-changing international scenario. It should be with malice to none and magnanimity to all. We must adopt the policy of friendship to all, but alliance with none. But, this does not seem to be the policy of the Government and you must also realize that little Sri Lanka is inside the world and the world is not inside Sri Lanka. That has been the attitude of the Peoples Alliance Government, Hon. Minister. If this first step is realized, corrected, rectified and taken forward, I think there will be a vast change. It was mentioned earlier that in victory we have got to be magnanimous. Where is the magnanimity being shown? Where is the sense of humanity that is shown? You take victory from one side and you use the same people who brought victory and put them into incarceration. Then you have problems.

Hon. Minister, at this particular moment, you are basically having an international problem. Unfortunately, in order to cover that sin, you take innocent, active, live Members of the UNP. This started four or five days ago. As soon as there was a problem with the Oxford Union, you bash up our UNP MPs; the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana and now the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya. For what apparent reason? For no sins committed. Sometimes it is our own MPs who oxygenize, used by the Government and then used as defence in order to pop up the incompetent Government. Hon. Minister, ensure that you have the competence, I mean, you are able to speak to the entire world. Ensure that the words and the actions speak louder than just battering the Opposition. This has been the new trend of the Government. You have a two-thirds majority. You have all what you want. You have taken people from us, but you still keep bashing because

1489 1490

[ () ]

2010 07

you do not want the UNP to handle three different areas. One is, when we refer to the handling the economy, you are petrified. You hammer us. You say, "how can you do this that and the other?" If we touch on the international arena - when we tryto bring all the forces together, to bring the country together, like you and I tried to protect the Labour GSP - then you keep hammering us because you know the strength of the UNP. If we try to bring in national reconciliation, then again there is a problem. These are the areas that the UNP has been delivering and can deliver and will deliver when the Government is defeated before too long.

Hon. Minister, we are saying all this not just because we are in the Opposition. It is the stark reality that is there. Like the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said; "It is not what we think of the world; it is what the world thinks of us" and I also say, Sri Lanka is inside the world, not the world inside Sri Lanka. . . .

Then, you think that the latest trend is, if you basically drum up and support and speak for the President and the Government, you are a patriot. If you go and hoot before the British High Commission or you go and hold placards before the American Embassy or you go and tickle the Indians, or you fast unto death before the UN, that is a patriotic act. But, if we say that your Government has brought disrepute to the country or something like that, we all will be roundly condemned.

Now, what happened when the President was in the United Kingdom, at the Oxford Union? Wherever it is, he is the President of our country. He is not the UNPs or the SLFPs President, he is the President of our country. But, what led to that? The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella very pointedly asked, "who told you to go to the United Kingdom". The High Commissioner had said, Do not come. I am made to understand that even you have been saying so or may be otherwise. But, you had some other people saying, No, let us go, or did Bell Pottinger want you to go? You put the entire country at risk. More than that, there were also various stories that criminal acts could have been done et cetera. These are matters that you all have to check as a sensitive Government with the sensitive world that is outside there. What if such action has been taken? What a constitutional crisis this could have led into? That is what is expected of a responsible government.

Patriotism is the last resort of the scoundrel they say. This is best displayed by some of the Ministers here. They go, shout, hoot, jump, hold placards and they think that that is defending Sri Lanka. Little know how many Ministers have been rejected visas to go to Europe. Hon. Minister, that comes under your purview. It is sad because there are 225 Members here. But, how many languish outside because of the Governments dogmatic stand,

uncompassionate stand that has been taken? Because of that, what happens is, innocent people lose out their visas. You know on this particular issue, there were two Ministers who had got to go and they were rejected. That is a clear reflection on the Ministry of External Affairs. It is part of your problem. You need to ensure that the rest of the foreign countries accept us in good stead.

Hon. Minister, I think there was a clarion call by Prof. Rohan Gunaratna, which was published as a headline in The Nation newspaper on the 5th of December. You all are very sensitive to headlines these days. It states, I quote:

Wake-up call for foreign office' "

This is said by Prof. Rohan Gunaratna. I think there is a lot of information that is available there.

When you have defeated a brutal terrorist organization in the world, you have got to reconcile yourselves and market yourselves in order to accept certain things that would automatically come in from the defeated forces. Now, what is expected at this particular moment is to ensure that all these things are put together. Now, you have Bell Pottinger on one side in the United Kingdom. What a disastrous activity! I am informed that they have been issuing statements to the press there. If this is correct, if that is the case, they have relegated the Ministry of External Affairs or the Foreign Embassy that is there. They have issued statements by a gentleman called Mr. Suresh Chao of Bell Pottinger, which I do not know, and may be subject to correction. Now, if that is the case, what is the High Commissioner in the United Kingdom doing? Hon. Minister, you have Lexicon Public Relations in India and you have Qorvis Communications in the USA. Are all these doing the same nonsense that Bell Pottinger is doing in the UK? What is the case? If you are trying to outsource these activities, that means you do not have confidence in the Ambassadors and the High Commissioners that you place overseas. Ensure that these are rectified. This is why we have called this Oxford Union episode a single disaster. We, as the United National Party roundly condemned what has happened to the President. But, at the same instance, who led him into that particular situation? We have a right to ask. We are the alternate government. You are not spending your money; you are spending the Governments money. This is the Vote on the Ministry of External Affairs that we are discussing. So, ensure that these culprits are held responsible.

We heard the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena speaking in this House a little while ago. All what he did was endorse on what the Opposition had been saying. What we have been saying is that you have not been able to outdo these people internationally. Hon. Minister, have you been able to basically give leadership to the problems that are there? Earlier, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe said that you will be suing Channel 4.

1491 1492

Now, Channel 4 is showing various things more and more. We, as the United National Party, ask, "why have you not sued them?" The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, when he was the Minister of Human Rights, basically said that they will sue Channel 4 if they do not rectify. Now, they are showing more and more day by day. Why is the Government not doing this? Then, whose inefficiency is that? Is the United National Party to be blamed for that also? The Rupavahini may say that we said this. This is not what we are saying. We are saying what the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe has said. As the Minister of External Affairs, ensure that you basically get an answer to this particular issue. , , . . ? , , . , .

He is a product of the Ceasefire Agreement. While telling him that, I will also say that there are certain problems when you accuse Mr. Sarath Fonseka; when you accuse the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya; when you accuse the Hon. Dr. Jayalath Jayawardana and other UNP Members of Parliament. It hurts us because it is our party and our people. None of us are traitors in this country. You all can have various tags on to that, but none of us are traitors. But, Hon. Minister, you were the one who was leading the Ceasefire Agreement; you were the one who went for special discussions. Now, you are the same person who says not to speak. Likewise, you were the same person who said that the Executive Presidency should be abolished.; you must do that. Then, the same Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris says No, you cannot, let us go to the third term. Likewise, you basically took the same position when it came to the "package". You were one of the people who was pushing Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga as much as possible. Well and good! But, the same person now says that there is no need to go beyond the Thirteenth Amendment.

When we mention these actions, you basically say that the Opposition is bashing you. No, it is not the case. We are only showing that the Governments position has changed day by day, unlike the United National Party which talks for the nation. We are the ones who got freedom for this country; we are the ones who have developed this country so we have a right to speak on the funds that are before us, Hon. Minister. But, we are saying it with good spirit. That is the spirit that we need to go forward.

Now, look at what happened in the Maldives. You mentioned there that there was an issue where the Cabinet was going to be appointed et cetera. The Maldivian Government issued a statement saying something against the Sri Lankan Government. Look at what has happened in Nepal. The Government of Nepal said the same thing :

We never asked the Government of Sri Lanka to do anything. Now, Hon. Minister, these are the matters. Let us get together. We may have internal problems, but ensure that we will have a strong Sri Lanka externally. That is what is expected. You basically do not need to hammer or character-assassinate our Members of the United National Party.

This is what you have been doing. We have been protecting the countrys interest. But, the inefficiency of the Government put that onto the people who are taking the Government on. It is not fair; it is not necessary. You were also in the Opposition at the time we took over the Government. If it is a fair degree of comment, then there is no problem at all. You say that this Government is not taking the terrorists on. What have you done about the transnational government? Has there been any statement made by the Government, roundly condemning the transnational government? There has been no such statement issued by any of you regarding the transnational government.

If you look at the issue of KPs arrest - you are taking up issues of people holding placards, being there and et cetera - what have you done to him? He is caught in Government possession. He is in custody. The Indian Government wants him for Rajiv Gandhis assassination. What have you, as the Minister of External Affairs, done about this particular issue? What action have you taken? Nothing at all has been done on this particular issue. Government information came out in the national newspapers stating that he robbed a bank in 1982; public funds have been robbed. What action have you taken in that regard? But, the person who eradicated terrorism in this country - the Hon. Sarath Fonseka - is a political prisoner after the magnanimous victory. So, external factors have got to be looked at on internal actions. So, Hon. Minister, please ensure that these are corrected.

Look at the Indian connection. You basically say that you need to have a strong Asian preference. Absolutely correct. But, does that mean that you have got to offend Europe; that you have got to basically work against the United States of America? Does that mean that you have got to sidestep Japan? Does that mean that you have to play China against India? India is our regional neighbour and we are fighting an economic war. That is something again which we have got to look at.

When it comes to Buddhism; this is a Buddhist country. We have got to protect it. When the Taliban attacked the Bamiyan Buddha statues in Afghanistan, what a noise was made by the Government of Sri Lanka? But, what has happened now? When the Dalada Maligawa was bombed, what happened? You had one chief minister saying against another chief minister. I am not being personal. But, when you are trying to accuse the United National Party of doing these type of things, what action are you going to take against your own

1493 1494

[ ]

2010 07

executive officers? This is hypocrisy. You run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. You try to put your inefficiency on the United National Party. We, as Members of the Opposition roundly condemn this type of action.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have three more minutes left.

( ) (The Presiding Member) No.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) All what we want to say is, ensure that we have a sound foreign policy. We have together ensured that terrorism is eradicated. Very good! We applaud the President and the Government for doing so. But,we as the Opposition also ensured that full support was there as much for international issues. The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena very aptly mentioned what is on. Hon. Minister this is the biggest task before you. There is no point in whatever you do internally, if externally these people are not allowing us to carry out trade and go overseas. Do you want our country to become another Myanmar; another Cuba; another North Korea or another Venezuela? This is not what the United National Party wants at this particular moment.

Then, the next issue is regarding the Oxford Union. Do not externalize this to the fact that this was something done by the United National Party; never. It happened due to your inefficiency. Who told you to go? Because of Bell Pottinger, you have fallen into this mess. Is the same thing happening in the US with regard to Lexicon or Qorvis companies? All these things have got to be looked at.

Hon. Minister, look at what has happened to the Labour GSP. What action have you taken in this regard? When you were the Minister of Export Development and International Trade, we ensured you that we will protect this together. But, we have lost that out. We wanted to work with you. But, you said, No need. Let us even at this late stage work together and protect the external interests of our country. That completely depends on your efficiency. Ensure that that is done. I know time is a factor against us.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Minister has to reply.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, ensure that these deficiencies are corrected the next time we come. If you cannot do so, ensure that it is handed over to the United National Party. We will ensure that we have a safe and sound Sri Lanka and go forward.

Thank you. [. . 12.56]

( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare) Mr. Presiding Member, first I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words on the Votes of my new Ministry. I will not be dealing much with matters relating to the Ministry of External Affairs because the Minister, the Deputy Minister as well as the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena spoke about that. So, I would basically try to touch upon some of the issues that were raised with regard to the new Ministry that has been created, which is the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. You have been given five minutes.

[. . 4.13] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, this is a Ministry that is very close to my heart, because I had been heading this Ministry from 2001 to 2004.

"Let lose everything but do not lose Parliamentary Democracy". That is the axiom we follow. Not only that, let us strengthen Parliamentary Democracy. In order to strengthen Parliamentary Democracy, this Ministry is doing a yeoman service. Sir, you may remember so many ministers who were in charge of this Ministry earlier. The Hon. (Mrs.) Sumedha G. Jayasena is the 12th Minister.

The Hon. K.B. Ratnayake, the Hon. M. Vincent Perera, the Hon. (Dr.) Wimal Wickremasinghe, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, the Hon. Milroy Fernando, the Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala and the Hon. M.H. Mohamed were the former Ministers who were in charge of this Ministry and the present Minister is thus the 12th Minister in charge of this Ministry. There is, before us, a lovely copy of the Performance Report issued by the Ministry with a pretty picture of the Minister. I want to hand over a bouquet to her for the efficient manner in which she is executing the functions of this Ministry. The Secretary, Ms. Princy Jayatunga assists the Minister and earlier, the former Secretary, Ms. Sita Withanaarachchi was there to assist her.

Sir, during my time I had officials of high calibre, namely, the Secretary, Mr. Y.R. de Silva and the Additional Secretary, Mrs. R.M.C.G. Pali Udugampola. Now, the Senior Assistant Secretary, Mr. Vajira Kamburugamuwa and the Director, of Members of Parliament Services Branch, Mr. R.A.D.C. Gunasekara are doing a great job. Then, I must also maintain the names of Mr. Nimal Kalutota who is a very able and talented computer graphic designer, for getting this Performance Report printed impressively.

Sir, Research Officers are detailed to the Members of Parliament. But, we have to pick them up from the Government Service. I would request - I have raised this matter at the Consultative Committee also - that these

officers be selected from outside the Government Service in the manner the Private Secretaries and the Co-ordinating Secretaries are selected. Then you can have the Research Officers of your own.

Sir, when I was the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, I came up with some innovative ideas and initiated action to start several schemes. One such scheme was providing computers and laptops to the Members of Parliament. A Souvenir Shop was also started in Parliament at my request at that time. Today we have to expand the Souvenir Shop as a large number of students visit Parliament these days. Therefore, I would request the Minister to explore the possibility of establishing a Parliamentary Archives, so that democracy, democratic values and history of our Parliament can be studied by thousands of students who come to see the Parliamentary proceedings at every Sitting. We shall do well to remember that this is our Ministry. , . . . . .

I must thank Mr. K.W. Sunil of the Members Services Office in Parliament and his able staff. Sir, I initiated action at that time to issue passes for the ex-Members of Parliament. I am very happy to state that one such distinguished Parliamentarian is the Hon. Buddhika Kurukularatne. He is making maximum use of the Parliamentary pass. He used to visit Parliament almost daily. He told me the other day that he is going to Singapore for medical treatment. We wish him well and hope that he would come back and be useful to the Parliament and all of us.

Sir, I have no more time but, at this moment I must pay my tribute to the people who are immensely helping for the smooth running of Parliament. In this respect I must thank the Secretary to the Leader of the House, Mr. Sumith Wijesinghe, the Assistant Secretary, Mr. B.K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi, the Secretary to the Chief Government Whip, Mr. Tilak Devagiribandara and the Assistant Secretary, Mr. P. Wanniarachchi. As we are very grateful people, we must not forget the Opposition side too. So, I must thank the Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Naufel Abdul Rahman who is an able and studious person, the Senior Assistant Secretary, Mr. G.C. Saman Lalitha, and also people like Mr. D.P. de Zoysa and all the others who are working in the office of the Leader of the Opposition.

Speaking about the Ministry of Resettlement, I appreciate that a redevelopment programme is going on in Jaffna. I went there recently and I saw the ancestral home occupied by the great scholar and philosopher,

1563 1564

Dr. A.M.A. Azeez. This house had been sold to some outsiders. It is a pity; it is a tragedy. That house should have been maintained as a national monument. Also, the house of Justice M.M. Abdul Cader at Moor Street, who hailed from Jaffna is no more. I do not know what has happened to the house of Quazi M.M. Sulthan. There was a broadcasting station operated from the Air Force premises in Palali, Jaffna. Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, after assuming duty as the Chairman of the SLBC has established broadcasting transmitters and centres all over the country. There is now a transmission centre coming up at Kondavil. Also, I would like to pay tribute to Mrs. Gnei Raheem Shaheed who was working for nearly two decades in the SLBC, Jaffna and other senior broadcasters like Mr. Joachim Fernando.

Concluding my speech, Sir, I would like to convey this happy message to you. News has just reached that His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz has suspended the death sentence imposed on Rizana Nafeek, at the request of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Thank you. [. . 4.20]
