. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in this Debate. We, the TNA, fully appreciate and support these Amendments. I want to request the Hon. Minister to consider the possibility of continuing the pension paid to an orphan, if it happens to be a lady, throughout her lifetime. Now, the pension is paid till her 26th year.

At this juncture, I also wish to bring to the notice of this House, the plight of the foreign pensioners. The pension due to the foreigners has been stopped from January this year. The Director-General of Pensions has issued Circular No. 16 of 2009. According to that Circular, a foreign pensioner has to open a special account at the Queens Branch of the Peoples Bank, if he wants the pension paid continuously. The pension due to him is his own money. He can afford to do anything with that money and he has got the freedom to open any account in any bank.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Member, I do not want to disturb you. But, since you raised this matter that day at the Consultative Committee - some temporary remedial measures were also discussed that day - I would like to say that we are now trying to take the temporary remedial measures while also trying to implement the new Circular. So, immediate steps have been taken to temporarily implement the remedial measures that we discussed at the Consultative Committee.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Why can you not allow the foreign pensioners to continue to take the pension the way they were drawing it before the issue of this Circular? What is the difficulty? ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Member, the only thing is, as we discussed the other day, there are instances where the present system had been misused by people. That is why a new system was introduced. But, we agreed that there was a delay on the part of the Department of Pensions and we said that temporary measures would be taken to see that the delay would not be there anymore.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) You cannot expect a foreign pensioner to open an account in a particular bank. That is his freedom; you cannot ask him to open an account only in a particular bank. If he has a bank account and the pension goes to that bank account, why can that procedure not continue? So, I am asking the Hon. Minister to consider the possibility of allowing these pensioners to draw their pensions from their chosen banks without asking them to open a special account at the Queens Branch of the Peoples Bank because until such time, they are not being paid their pension. I want the Hon. Minister to reconsider this; I want the Director-General of Pensions to cancel Circular No. 16 of 2009. With the introduction of this system, according to the Circular, he is compelling a person to open a special account at the Queens Branch of the Peoples Bank, Colombo 10. As a pensioner, a person is entitled to draw his pension from the bank he chooses. Why does this Circular say that he should open a special account at the Queens Branch of the Peoples Bank? They will have to take several steps - ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) The Circular says that they can open an account in any Government bank. It does not specifically say that it should be at the Queen's Branch of the People's Bank.

73 74

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No, no. I have got the Circular here.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) That is the information I got from the Director-General of Pensions. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) It states the following under Payment of pension through approved special bank account": "The special account may be opened only at Peoples Bank - Queens Branch. Facilities are available for pensioners to open this bank account having arrived in Sri Lanka or while overseas. So, it specifies that you have to open this account at the Queen's Branch of the Peoples Bank. You are interfering with the freedom of a pensioner. He can keep his money in any bank he chooses. So, I want the Director-General of Pensions to cancel that Circular and allow them to continue to draw the pension the way they were drawing it earlier.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Member, the original Circular that was issued, which stated that the particular account should be opened at the Queen's Branch of the Peoples Bank, has been amended and now they can open an account in any Government bank. That is the present position. - [Interruption.] No, I am only explaining the present position. Now, they can open an account in any Government bank. [. . 3.08]

[. . 4.08] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am glad to speak today on the Widows and Orphans Pension Fund (Amendment) Bill and the Widowers and Orphans Pension (Amendment) Bill. I am grateful to the Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs for giving us the opportunity to discuss the Bill extensively at the Consultative Committee, where we raised many issues. The Hon. Minister, the Hon. Deputy Minister and the officials were good enough to explain to us the motive and how this Bill would affect the Public servants concerned. Further, the former Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya has expressed his fullest support and appreciation to place this Bill before the House today. This Bill has been designed to eradicate certain anomalies that existed in the pension laws which affected those widows and widowers who lost their spouses during the war. We welcome this and we appreciate the action taken by the Hon. Minister.

Sir, there is one issue which I would like to raise here. This is regarding the widows who were punished when they remarry. You have eradicated that issue here by granting them half the pension. So, when you grant them half the pension when they get married, if they have children, I suggest that the balance half of the pension be given to the children of the first marriage so that there will be harmony in the family. If a woman with children marries a new person, then there could be differences that occur due to the maltreatment of the children of the first marriage. If the children of the first marriage have their own sustenance, that would help to build family harmony. So, if half of that money could be paid -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The balance half of the pension would be given for the children of the first marriage.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Sir. That is very good.

Talking further on this issue, the pension is a social security arrangement available to the Public servant. As a social security, an employee in a private organization has provisions of EPF and ETF for his sustenance after retirement. Sir, it is seen mostly in the Plantation Sector where when a person retires, he draws his EPF or ETF and spends it for his own children on their marriages, on other requirements such as finding an employment or to pay for something. So, once that money has been spent

they are left without any means of sustenance and they become destitute. Therefore, Sir, this Government should look into the possibilities of holding a part of the EPF in a fund so that the private sector employees are able to draw a pension, after their retirement. So, this is a necessary social security measure that I would suggest for your consideration. Recently, the interest rates on deposits at banks have been reduced and many of those who are depositing their savings which they receive through their Provident Fund or Trust Fund contributions are finding it difficult to survive because interest rates have been almost halved. The finance companies and financial institutions like Golden Key Company were able to survive because they paid high interest rates. People deposited money with them for high interest rates and now, they have lost all their money.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) People went for the higher interest rates. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, Sir. Because of the lack of income for them to live from the savings, they went to places where they were paid higher interest rates and finally they have lost everything. So, if they have a scheme where the Government can use the EPF - it may be on an optional basis, the option of the employee - if they can hold it and if a pension can be paid, it would be a very positive thing for those retired persons.

I also wish to take this opportunity today, to table* in this House the "Proposals made by the All Party Representative Committee to form the basis of a New Constitution".

Maybe, you would consider this as not so relevant to this issue. But, today, you are trying to correct a situation that has been caused by the war where many have been rendered widows. Similarly, there is another fallout of the war. The war has ended, but there has been no political solution to the issues that created the war.

So, because of that, His Excellency the President on 11th of July, 2006 appointed the All Party Conference and decided to appoint a Committee of Representatives of the Parties at the All Party Conference and this was called the All Party Representative Committee. His Excellency the President mandated this Committee to formulate a draft proposal for constitutional reform. The President mandated the APRC to evolve a home-grown new Constitution which will provide a comprehensive approach to the resolution of the national question. Sir,

93 94

- * . * . *Document not tabled on the order of the Chair.

the national question has still not been resolved. The initial Members of this Committee are listed in this Report, which I wish to table in this House for inclusion in Hansard.

The All Party Representative Committee in its first meeting unanimously selected the Hon. Prof. Tissa Vitarana as its Chairman. We are grateful and we appreciate the great service done by the Chairman who was able to bring a consensus among the 14 Parties who participated in the All Party Representative Committee. It is his ability, his persuasiveness and his good leadership that evolved into a consensus of the All Party Representative Committee. Since July 2006, the All Party Representative Committee met almost every week, deliberating more than three to four hours each time. A panel of experts were also constituted - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) There is a point of Order being raised. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. [Interruption.] He is a very good Friend of mine. Do not worry about those things. We will settle it among ourselves. Sir, my question is, has the Hon. Member got the authority of the Chairman? This has been appointed, as you say, by the President and also there was a Chairman - the Hon. Prof. Tissa Vitarana was the Chairman of the Committee. What is the - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Alhaj Azwer, that is not a point of Order. Please sit down. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, Sir. I ask - [Interruption.] ) (An Hon. Member) You go ahead. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) A panel of experts, Sir, were also constituted by His

Excellency the President to facilitate the APRC process. This panel of experts, after deliberating among themselves, produced two reports which were made available to the APRC in December 2006. - [Interruption.] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena- Minister of Water Supply and Drainage and Chief Government Whip) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. As pointed out by Hon. Azwer, is the Member trying to place before this House a document purported to be the final document of the APRC? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do not say that it is purported to be the final document, Sir, because - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Is it signed by all the representatives? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Is it not a document of the APRC - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, I am simply asking the question whether - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is not signed by all the Members of the APRC. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You cannot just bring a document and say, "this document is a document of all the parties attending", if they have not signed it. - [Interruption.] It is not a document, if so. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is not. I do not say it is. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Then, the Hon. Member, what are you trying to read? If the APRC has no final document so far signed by the

95 96

2010 20

representatives, what are you trying to read? I do not think that this can be allowed if it is so.- [Interruption.] What are you trying to read? You just now mentioned about a document of the APRC, which was attended by so many political parties - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. R. Yogarajan, do you take responsibility for that document? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, I take full responsibility. - [Interruption.] This is a signed document I am placing before the House. Sir, this draft contain 21 chapters. - [Interruption.]

Based on these two reports the Chairman of the APRC - [Interruption.] presented a draft containing the main features to form the basis of a new Constitution. This draft contained 21 chapters of various aspects of a new Constitution and since August 2007, for almost two years, the APRC discussed each of the chapters separately seeking inputs from political parties through their representatives at the APRC.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) He cannot be allowed to read this document. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) These discussions finally came to a conclusion in June 2009 after completing 128 meetings. - [Interruption.] by which time, the Committee reached consensus in respect of almost all the chapters and it was agreed based on this consensus - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, please - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You cannot read like that. How can you read a document which the members have not signed? [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please raise your point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) How can you read a document that the members have not signed? [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) If the Chairman is not objecting, why are you objecting? [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You can ask the Chairman if you want. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Besides that, a point of Order has now been raised and he cannot read it. You have to give a ruling on that. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You must give a ruling, Sir. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) It cannot be read until you give an Order. Sir, you will have to give an Order. [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I am not reading from the APRC Report. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) You cannot read it now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am reading from a document - [Interruption.] I have a right to speak in this House. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, what is your authority for that?

97 98

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I have signed the document. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Is it only you or -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I take full responsibility for it. ( ) (An Hon. Member) He has signed the document. So what more authority do you need? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is my document that I am placing before this House. It is a document of - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It does not become the document of the APRC. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is up to the public to decide whether it is authentic or not. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You cannot read a document on behalf of the CWC. You are no more a Member of the CWC. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, I am not a Member of the CWC now. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It was the CWC that you represented. Do not try to smuggle documents into this House. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will read from that document. "Though it was reported in the media ...."

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, have you signed it on behalf of the CWC or otherwise? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, he is trying to smuggle a document into this House. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) "Though it was reported in the Media a final report was submitted to the President by the Chairman, we found there had not been a release of this final report either to the members of the APRC, main opposition political party, the United National Party or the Tamil National Alliance or to the public." ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . ? . . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I will not allow that document to be tabled or to be included in Hansard. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) "It is in these circumstances, we R. Yogarajan (presently a Member of Parliament representing United National Party) who represented the Ceylon Workers' Congress at the APRC till its conclusion and M. Nizam Kariapper who represented the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress in the APRC decided to compile the final report based on the final draft discussion papers on each subject presented by the Chairman and amendments made by the APRC at the final APRC meetings with theh elp of the proceedings that were made available. The final report is attached in Annexure 2. We are confident that this final report comiled by us reflects correctly the decisions taken by the APRC..." ( )

( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Sir, he has no right to submit a document on behalf of the Ceylon Workers Congress. He is not a Member of the CWC now. He was a member long ago, not now. - [ Interruption.] No, you cannot do that. You are not permitted by the CWC to do so. Sir, he is not a member of the CWC. So he has no right to do so. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! The Hon. Minister is on a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Sir, Hon. Yogarajan is not a member of the CWC now. He cannot submit a document here on behalf of the CWC. He was appointed as the CWC representative at that time to watch the interests of the CWC and report to the party. He has never done it. Now, he comes before Parliament and submits a document on behalf of the CWC. He has no business with the CWC. He has no right to do so. So, my point of Order is, since he is not a member of the CWC, he cannot submit a report here on behalf of the CWC. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, you have to expunge the whole thing. ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) If it is on behalf of the CWC, you have to expunge the entire thing. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If that document or his speech contains anything against the Standing Orders, those will be expunged. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is fine. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) "We are confident that this final report compiled by us reflects correctly the decisions taken by the APRC and should be in conformity with the final report submitted by Prof. Tissa Vitarana Chairman of the APRC."

Sir, I wish to place this document before this House and request that this be included in Hansard.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, why do you not speak on the subject? This is out of subject. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. I will come back to the subject.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I certify that this document I am placing is a proper reflection of the discussions and the consensus reached at the APRC.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Yogarajan, what is the relevancy of this document to the subject matter? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will explain. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is over.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Please give me a minute. I will explain. Sir, I started by telling you the connection between my speech and this document. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, please wind up. Your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, as a fallout of the war, there were widows and widowers and there is a need to address the aspirations of the Tamil people of the North and the East. That is why I place this Report before the House. I request that this be included in Hansard and also -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) No, no, it cannot be done.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I cannot do that, I am sorry.

101 102

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I want to tell you Sir, that this Government is scared to release this Report. Why is the Government scared to release this Report? The President has said that they will base it to formulate a new Constitution for this country. He has said that and we have done it. So, why are they scared about it now? Do they think that by ending the war, they have solved the problem? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. You also have to speak to the subject.

[. . 4.26] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

I am very sorry - [Interruption.] Sit down, Hon. Yogarajan, sit down. You have a self-respect. Do not sell it to the UNP.

Sir, today, I am very sorry to see a good Friend of mine being shamelessly made a scapegoat by the United National Party. The jubilation expressed by the Hon. John Amaratunga and the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera proved it very well to the House. Sir, Erskine May, who is the authority on "Parliamentary Practice", is very clear on this matter.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. R. Yogarajan is on a point of Order. Yes, what is your point of Order, Hon. Yogarajan? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Hon. Member is casting aspersions on my conduct. I request him to withdraw that. I cannot be bought by anybody. They tried to buy me for Rs. 50 million. I did not sell myself; I refused to be sold. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Here, he is going from "May" to hay-haywire. This is

what is happening. I am very much ashamed of you. You should not have done that. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please make your speech to the subject. Do not go beyond that. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am speaking now. I am on my feet. I have to respond to what he said. Sir, in a Parliamentary democracy - Erskine May is very clear on that - a Committee can be set up, it can be a Select Committee or it can be a Commission. As the Hon. Yogarajan said, this Committee was appointed by His Excellency the President and he has appointed Minister, Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana as the Chairman of that Committee. So, I am asking, what is the propriety in your coming here and presenting this document? The others are making you a scapegoat. . , . community . Sir, in keeping with the Parliamentary procedures and in keeping with the opinion of Erskine May, the greatest authority on "Parliamentary Practice", I would request you that whatever the Hon. Member said on this matter be completely expunged from Hansard.

Now, Sir, coming on to the Widows and Orphans Pension Fund (Amendment) Bill- [Interruption.] You have no right. Sit down. Hon. John Amaratunga, do not give him anymore dead ropes. . - Widows and Orphans - . . . . , . ! - - -[ ] . . . . ( ) (An Hon. Member) .

2010 20

know how much he disregarded President Ranasinghe Premadasa at that time. Sir, I have a story which should be told to the country. There was the Premadasa Foundation established by the Hon. B. Sirisena Cooray. It was in Hulftsdorp - President Premadasa's worthy son, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa is before me - and there was a press belonging to the United National Party, the Chairman of which was Mr. Razik Zarook, who was the then Chairman of the CWE. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe told him to remove that board. Mr. Razik Zarook refused it flatly. He said, I will never remove that". That is the amount of respect and regard Mr. Wickremasinghe had shown the late Premadasa Now what is happening? What has happened in May he forgets in June. Now, Sir, my good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva tried to say this because this should be said in this House. There was a very famous journalist called Lionel Sarath Edirisinghe. He died on 16.08.2009 and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, worthy of his name, sent a on 30.04.2010 on his birthday saying, " !" ? . , . widows and orphans . . - ,

This was established on 20th January, 1971 by the then regime in Sweden. There was no Ombudsman in the world prior to the system that was introduced by Sweden. It was done to ensure that the higher standard would be obtained in the administration of the country in which they live. That is the reason, because administratively, you come into a lot of problems; obstacles. People who work in a Pradeshiya Sabha or a Government office in remote areas in the country have to come to Colombo. They have to spend a lot of money for cases in courts.

How did it happen in Sweden? It happened due to the serious limitations in that country. Sir, according to the traditions and democracy they followed, Ministers had serious limitations in their country. Administratively, they were not able to do anything. Ministers were not responsible to Parliament in a country like Sweden. At that time, Sir, when we were having free democracy, they did not have the powers even to administer. Ministers were not responsible to Parliament and the administration was not responsible to a Minister.

Not allowing administration to go haywire, like what the Hon. R. Yogarajan tried to do today, this system was introduced. Until then, this system or experience, of a tradition was not known to other countries.

Modern governments recognized this system, Sir. Denmark and Norway followed Sweden and subsequently it was introduced in New Zealand, United Kingdom and Australia. We sought to do the same thing in Sri Lanka in 1971. At that time Sir, it was a well-thought out system. They deliberated upon it, the judges, the intelligentsia; the political leaders of this country. A working paper was prepared by the Sri Lanka Law Commission.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, please wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Article 156 of the Constitution imposed on Parliament, an obligation to enact a law for the creation of this office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration called Ombudsman. Article 156 of the Constitution spelt it out in that form, Sir. Then, Sir, the petitions sent to Ombudsman - this must be clear. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, please wind up. Your time is over.

105 106

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, please, give me two more minutes. The Ombudsman's Report is sent to the Committee on Public Petitions. Now, the public can even directly send the petitions to the Ombudsman. The first Ombudsman of this country was one of our distinguished Secretaries-General of Parliament, the first Secretary-General, Mr. S.S. Wijesinha. Sir, he had been the Ombudsman from 1981 to 1991. The person who holds the office of the Ombudsman at present is Mr. L.A. Tissa Ekanayake. When I consulted him, he said that there were about 700 petitions. What is causing concern among the Government servants who seek redress, is the delay. He also said that for the three weeks he worked there, he could dispose seven to eight petitions a day. Sir, the office of the Ombudsman is an essential ingredient and part of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. I would commend the salary increase to the Ombudsman and also wish to mention how the other countries like the UK do it. In India, I saw for myself as to how they do it.

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) Sir, on behalf of the Hon. Prime Minister, Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, I move, That this Parliament hereby resolves that the salary of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) should be as follows with effect from 01.01.2009, in terms of the Article 156(3) of the Constitution of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) Rs. 65,000.00 And this Parliament further resolves that Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) is not entitled to any other allowances in addition to monthly salary of Rs. 65,000/=, with effect from 01.01.2009 since the aforesaid monthly salary is also inclusive of the rent allowance that was previously approved by Parliament."

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , '' '' . . . Question proposed. NON-PUBLICATION OF NEW REGISTER OF ELECTORS ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for permitting me to move the Adjournment Motion which is of great importance especially for the people who basically control the political future; the franchise. Sir, can I table the Adjornment Motion in order to save time?

The essence of the Adjournment Motion that is to be moved today is for the very reason that the register of electors which should have been done on the 1st of July 2010 with the intended voters being promulgated has not been done this time. The reason for that register not being done is not known and many questions have been asked. For the same period, we have been able to obtain information that there has been a reduction of around hundred thousand voters in the Colombo District and overall, about three to four hundred thousand in the country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please read the Motion first and enumerate. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am sorry.

I move, "The population of the country keeps increasing every year. Resultantly, the election list which is updated every year on the 1st of July should show a corresponding increase.

However, quite to the contrary, we are informed the new list which is still not made public, (but should have been done on the 1st of July

137 138

2010) is having a decrease of around 12 per cent in many electorates in the Colombo District.

This is corroborated with the claim that many voters say that they have been deprived of the voting rights so will the Hon. Minister please inform this House when is the new register being made public and has it got an increase in keeping with the population growth."

Sir, as per your instructions, I have read it out. My intention is to make it very clear because this is regarding the voting right of everybody. It may be a green, red, blue, yellow, or a person who may not be voting. But, the very right that he has to go and vote should not be deprived in any way. During election times, election fever sets in and then, the voting fever sets in. Now, the present situation is - 01 . . . . . . open list , . . . .
