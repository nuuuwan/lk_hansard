( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, firstly, I must thank you and the members of the staff of Parliament for the wonderful

work they have done in restoring this House so that we could function today. When we met on Thursday, this House was under water; we had to come in by boats and amphibious vehicles. The effort that was put in by the members of the staff of this Parliament together with the outside agencies that helped them, the drivers of the Sri Lanka Army who brought us all here, should be appreciated and they should all be commended.

So, I join you, Sir, in expressing our thanks to the Secretary-General and his staff. I think we have come to a point where we have to look at how the rain water drains from this area, what is the plan for retention and how we can ensure that the Parliament will not be flooded again.

When this House was first constructed here, the lands here were not built on, and the original UDA plans made provision to reserve certain areas to be used as water retention areas, in case of floods. But, that did not happen. You have to summon the Party Leaders and we have to discuss it. We may even have to present a Bill to this House where the Parliament can have a say over the area which is essential to ensure that Parliament and the Diyawanna Oya are free from floods and the water can be drained out. I would suggest that you take this matter up; maybe you could ask the Chief Government Whip who is also handling a part of this subject to give us a paper on which we can discuss the issues.

On Thursday, you suggested that we do meet here for a short time and we did that to show that Parliament continues and we passed some of the Businesses proposed by the Government, especially the Supplementary Estimate on the understanding that it will be taken up for debate today and that is what we are faced with.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to refer in this House to the release of Myanmar's democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. I hope this will be a permanent release and she can work on the restoration of democracy in Myanmar. I have no doubt that the Government of Myanmar influenced by other friendly Governments will also take an initiative on the issue of restoring Parliamentary democracy with free and fair elections. This will ensure that in all areas of the South and South-East Asia, you would have a Parliamentary democracy, though I have a question about Sri Lanka. The release of Aung San Suu Kyi is proof that no country can build a fortress and shield itself from democratic values.

Democracy is the right of the people and we cannot take it away from them and then use the argument of sovereignty to suppress the people. These are global values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Fundamental Values of the

1335 1336

Commonwealth. These are rights which were enjoyed by our people, but which are denied to us today.

Mr. Speaker, we have referred in this House to one case, that of General Sarath Fonseka's. I speak not only in the context of the case of General Sarath Fonseka, but the denial of our fundamental values applies to the suppression of democratic rights in our country, especially the media, the internally displaced persons in the Vanni and there is a need for a genuine national reconciliation. This cannot be done by Commissions; it requires all the parties in Parliament. This is what His Excellency the President agreed with the Secretary General of the UN when he visited Sri Lanka in May, 2009 : to consult all the political parties, instead of which they have appointed a Commission to go into the question of national reconciliation. Your predecessor, Sir, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaikes landmark Ruling of 20th June, 2001 held, "The exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Courts to exercise any control over the acts of the Speaker and the officers of the Legislature has been recognized in our own law, for well over half a century.

His Ruling is based on principles which have found expression in Articles 4 and 67 of our Constitution and the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. Article 4 of our Constitution not only vests the judicial powers of the Republic in Parliament but also states that it shall be directly exercised by Parliament in regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament. Article 67 of the Constitution states that the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its Members shall be governed by the provisions of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.

This is why the courts including the Supreme Court have no say over the affairs of Parliament.

It was in this background that when two courts martial purported to make orders in respect of one of our Members, Sarath Fonseka, that I raised questions relating to the violation of the powers of Parliament. On the 24th of September, I asked you, Mr. Speaker, to rule on these issues when you replied that this matter was decided by the court martial. My position then was that, you as the Hon. Speaker, had complete and exclusive jurisdiction to decide on it. You agreed with us and said that you will look into it and give a Ruling.

Subsequently, it came to our notice that the Secretary-General of Parliament had written to the Commissioner of Elections informing him that Sarath Fonseka had vacated his seat as a Member of Parliament. I then questioned the right of the Secretary-General of Parliament to so address the Commissioner of Elections since you had yet to rule on this matter.

On Wednesday, 10th November, during the course of my speech, you remarked that we may have to await the ruling of the courts. This raises a fundamental issue because at the time I raised the matter, the applications on behalf of Sarath Fonseka to the Court of Appeal in respect of the courts martial and his membership of the House had not even been filed. You, Mr. Speaker, naturally wanted time to study the issue. That does not in any way prevent you from giving a Ruling even now because it is only subsequently that the cases were filed in courts. Therefore, the matters raised by me takes precedence over the decision of the courts. I have acted under the Standing Orders and Articles 4 and 67 of the Constitution. The actions in court are under Article 105 of the Constitution. Furthermore, the power of the Supreme Court is restricted to inferior courts and tribunals and does not extend to Parliament. Parliament is the only body that can decide on matters relating to itself. The Supreme Court itself is a creature of the Constitution and it must be remembered that, "However the court may interpret the provisions of the Constitution, it is still the Constitution which is the law and not the decision of the court. It is not necessarily so, that the Constitution is preserved in the court's reading of it".

I raised several matters. Firstly, that the two courts martial pertaining to Sarath Fonseka, which deprived him of his pension, his rank and sentenced him to 30 years in jail, have violated the powers and privileges of this House. This included the failure to uphold the ICCPR, giving mala fide decisions contrary to evidence including the failure to summon relevant witnesses, violating the rights of this House by bringing non-existent charges against a Member of this House.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This is totally irrelevant to the subject that has been taken up for Debate. Do not do this. Everyday you all are doing this. . . .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am not raising on the courts. I am raising on the Supplementary Estimates. I will explain that to you. If you listen to me, you will see that. I am not quoting what is happening in the Supreme Court. That is irrelevant to me.

Then, there is also the question of the communication by the Secretary-General of Parliament to the Commissioner of Elections stating that Sarath Fonseka had vacated his membership of the House even before the Hon. Speaker had ruled on this matter.

These are fundamental issues which you have to decide.

I have not talked about the courts here. You can see that. Whatever the Hon. Members may talk about, I have only referred to this matter, which is regarding the Parliament and its powers to decide. What the courts have said I am not taking up because there, I bow to your Ruling and I will tell you what I would suggest instead.

The conventions and practices of the House are based - as the late Speaker Hon. Anura Bandaranaikes Ruling pointed out - on the conventions and practices of the Parliament of the United Kingdom together with those of the Commonwealth Parliaments which are heirs to these traditions, which include the control of finance and the passing of supplementary estimates because it is through finance that Parliamentary democracy and its values were upheld. Sri Lanka is a Member of the Commonwealth, which is a voluntary association committed to upholding the values of democracy, good governance, human rights and the sovereignty of Parliament. The values of the Commonwealth were laid down in the Singapore Declaration of 1971, the Harare Declaration of 1995 and was recently reaffirmed in the Trinidad and Tobago Declaration. Sri Lanka is a party to this Declaration which reaffirms a strong and abiding commitment to the Commonwealths fundamental values and principles. These are, democracy including promoting democratic culture and practice, human rights, tolerance, respect and understanding, separation of powers, rule of law - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order please! There is a point of Order being raised. . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Leader of the Opposition always flouts the Standing Orders. Standing Order No. 84(v) states, I quote:

Every member must confine his observations to the subject under discussion.

Today we are discussing the Cess. If the Hon. Leader of the House wants to put a Cess on Hon. Sarath Fonseka, he is completely out of order. . . , . . He cannot challenge the Order of the Hon. Speaker.

Sir, I want an Order from the Chair in keeping with the Standing Orders. We have to respect the Standing Orders. All the Hon. Members of Parliament including the Hon. Leader of the Opposition are obliged and duty-bound to respect the Standing Orders. He is flouting the Standing Orders, word by word. Sir, you have already given an Order. What we are discussing is the Cess. Standing Order No. 84 (v) is not being observed. He has lost his power of thinking. He has left the brain behind the Parakrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa. He wants to built a harbour there. Shame! - [Interruption .] Therefore, Sir, I request you to stop that.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) - [ ] . . . . . . - the Supplementary Estimate, the Regulations under the Finance Act, all these come under Finance and Planning. The Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Meeting will be covered by me in this discussion, and what has to be done. - [Interruption.]

Furthermore, at Trinidad and Tobago, Sri Lanka together with other members of the Commonwealth expressed its continuing support for the secretariat's work on strengthening democratic institutions, processes and culture and the Secretariat's collaboration with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to promote democratic culture. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have to decide whether we continue to subscribe and uphold these values. I would presume, since we are members of both the Commonwealth and the Commonealth Parliamentary Association, that we are committed to these values. If so, we have to accept that Parliament has its own sphere of jurisdiction as the guarantor of the rule of law, upholder of the financial control over public funds, promoter of human rights and the architect of good governance. This includes the ability of the legislators to carry out their functions free from threat and interference either direct or indirect by the executive; the responsibility of the executive to the House on financial matters. These are principles which underline the issues I have raised in this House.

We cannot uphold these best practices by seeking the advice of the Attorney-General. He is defending the Government, which is his duty. Even in the cases filed by Sarath Fonseka, anyone else or any of us, he has to defend the Government.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

1343 1344

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I am not talking about the case. I am talking of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is not a matter that is out of discussion. All I am saying is, the Attorney-General's duty is to defend the Government. Whether Mr. Sarath Fonseka files a case or I file a case or anyone else files a case, he has to defend the Government. There is no argument in it. All I say is, since we are passing so much of money in this House it requires independent legal and financial advice, not only legal advice but also financial advice. What is the impact of it and what is the legal impact of the decisions that we are taking? This is why we say that you cannot depend on the Attorney-General or the Secretary to the Treasury to give us advice. This is why independent advice is necessary. We have also subscribed to the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, which specifically empowers the Secretariat to provide advice, training and other forms of technical assistance to the Government in promoting fundamental political values, including activities in collaboration with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, to strengthen the democratic culture and effective practices. Requesting the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to help in this matter does not derogate from our sovereignty. It amounts to strengthening democratic processes and culture with the collaboration of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Secretariat. As long as we elect to remain as Members of the Commonwealth, we, as Members can seek their advice and their assistance. If we are not willing to do so, then we are refusing to uphold the Commonwealth values. Then, we have no business to be Members of the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. We cannot blow hot and cold and only pay lip service to these principles and values. If we are Members of the Commonwealth, we should adhere to these principles. If we are unable to do so, we must leave. If that be the case, we cannot host the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Meeting in 2012. ..... ( )

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I think this House must have independent financial and legal advice on all these matters; whether it be legal issues on powers of Parliament or financial issues, we are being asked to pass so much of money.- [Interruption.] But, this House has no independent advice and when I asked for that, you are opposing it. So, then tell me - [Interruption.] Are you opposing me because I am asking you to get assistance from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association? Do you want to have this conference in 2012? Therefore, the best course of action in the circumstances, would be to request the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to nominate a panel of three experts from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to advise you regarding these matters. This is not without precedent. You know what happened in Guyana when the Opposition and the Government could not agree. You asked the Commonwealth and the Secretariat to advice them on how the Parliament should function.

Finally, we must remember that we are dealing here not only with the rights and privileges of an individual Member but also the rights and the privileges of the whole House and the fundamental values and principles of the Commonwealth. What you are faced with today, Mr. Speaker, is an important decision. Is this House prepared to uphold these values? Do we subscribe to the fundamental values and principles of the Commonwealth? If you do so, Mr. Speaker, you have only one option and I urge you to take it.

There is also another matter, Mr. Speaker, that I must raise and I must protest in this House as to what has happened to one of our honourable Members, the Hon.

Sunil Handunnetti. He was assaulted in Jaffna together with the journalists of the Lanka newspaper and the police questioned these people and let them go. Now, how can you do that? Here is a Member who has been assaulted. I think, Hon. Speaker, it is a matter for you to inquire into and take action. [Interruption.] Then, I am sorry the Hon. Members do not know their history but from time immemorial, Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee and Gokanna, as they know, had harbours. The Kingdom of Anuradhapura had three harbours, Gokanna, Thiriyaya and Manthota. Then, Horawpatana and Gokanna - [Interruption.] - The Hon.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, before I comment on the proposed amendment in re-imposing a Cess of Rs. 18 per unit on the importation of incandescent bulbs to Sri Lanka, let me briefly explain how our Government, under the dynamic leadership of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of Sri Lanka, creates a conducive

environment to expand the local manufacture and also ensure their competitiveness.

Today, our industrialists are very confident that our Government is on the correct track to improve necessary infrastructure facilities, which are essential elements for an accelerated and sustainable industrial development in any country. I am happy to inform that the ambitious development projects such as the Port of Hambantota, the Colombo South Harbour, the second International Airport at Mattala, highway network and hydro projects launched by our Government under the stewardship of His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka will soon change the economic landscape of this beautiful Island in a remarkable manner. These development projects and their peripherals will generate a wide range of opportunities for foreign and local investors.

In this process, my Ministry will continue to ensure that the SME sector, which is the backbone of our economy is well looked after. Several policy measures have been introduced to help the local industries especially the Small and Medium Enterprises - SMEs.

Hon. Speaker, we all are aware that the SMEs play a significant role in our economy, contributing to the growth of the GDP, embarking innovations and stimulating other economic activities.

There is a greater potential and need for the development of the SMEs in Sri Lanka to generate maximum socio-economic benefits to its people. Furthermore, the development of SMEs can also be defined as a significant tool to balance the regional development of the country. The importance of SMEs remains valid as it plays a complementary role to large industries through sub-contracting. That is why the Government has given its high priority for the development of SMEs.

Hon. Speaker, accordingly, many programmes have been implemented island wide to facilitate the SME sector through the National Enterprise Development Authority - NEDA. It is important to note that the NEDA has planned to establish a SME University with the support of the Japanese International Co-operation Agency for the skill development of our entrepreneurs. I am confident that with the support extended by our Government to encourage the SME sector, the economic growth of Sri Lanka will certainly be accelerated.

Hon. Speaker, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already taken steps to prepare a policy document which addresses the issues faced by our industrialists including the SME sector in particular. Further, the Ministry has established a number of advisory councils for almost every industrial sector, with the active participation of all stakeholders including the private sector.

1347 1348

Hon. Speaker, let me highlight an industry which has benefited from the recent policy measures initiated by our Government. Today, the local footwear manufacturers have become beneficiaries with the introduction of the revised import cess from Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 on a pair of shoes to safeguard the interests of the local footwear industry. It was later increased to Rs. 400. An additional cess of Rs. 30 for a footwear sole was also introduced, to encourage the backward linkage, for the footwear industry. Sir, it was 10 days ago that my Ministry hosted a very successful exhibition, Footwear and Leather Fair 2010 from 5th November to 7th November, 2010 at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre with the participation of 160 stalls, by both local and foreign exhibitors. I was very impressed with the quality footwear and leather goods produced by our manufacturers for the local and export markets. Currently, 75 per cent of the demand of the domestic market is supplied by local manufacturers. The industry champions were hopeful of achieving 90 to 95 per cent of the supply with the right policies adopted by our Government.

Hon. Speaker, moving on to the other successful initiatives taken by my Ministry, I am pleased to state, that in close collaboration with the University of Moratuwa, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has embarked on a number of projects to introduce new technology and designs for our industrialists. I am happy to announce that one of such initiatives taken by the Ministry and the University is the inauguration of the Dye and Mould Facilitation and Development Centre at the University of Moratuwa on the 4th of November, 2010. This is a good news for industrialists, especially to SMEs.

While the Government under the able leadership of His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, is in a process of transforming Sri Lanka to a Wonder of Asia, this collaborative initiative of the University of Moratuwa, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Mould and Dye Makers Association of Sri Lanka to set up a Dye and Mould Facilitation and Development Centre at the University of Moratuwa, will certainly strengthen the Governments move towards sustainable development of the country. Sir, you will be happy to note that this centre will generate more and more career opportunities to Sri Lankan youth in the manufacturing sector helping the Government to accomplish its target of eradicating youth unemployment from the country.

Sir, the five-year strategic plan for 2011-2016 developed by my Ministry has been incorporated with the proposals submitted by the stakeholders. I am sure that the strategic plan prepared by my Ministry, in consultation with the relevant line Ministries and the private sector stakeholders, will provide the necessary framework to achieve cohesion, not only within the

institutions but also among all relevant stakeholders. This approach is utmost important to realize the projected export targets.

Sir, I would like to mention that we will soon establish new industrial zones in Vavuniya, Mannar and Kilinochchi. We are in the process of taking steps to promote our exports as well. Despite external shocks this year, our export will show a positive growth compared to last year. Our Government is contemplating to introduce a Single Electronic Window System to simplify the export documentation process. This initiative will certainly reduce the transaction cost of our exports and it will be an effective tool for true trade facilitation.

Hon. Speaker, let me now explain to this House regarding the cess re-imposed on incandescent bulbs. With the objective of encouraging local industrialists, the cess imposed on some selected imported inputs used by the local industrialists in their industries was removed by the Gazette No. 1656/4 dated 31st May, 2010. Through the same Gazette, the cess imposed on incandescent bulbs to protect the industry was also removed inadvertently. However, attention was later drawn to the threat posed to the local incandescent bulb industry from imported bulbs by the removal of this cess. As the local industry could not compete with imported incandescent bulbs, the Government decided to re-impose a cess of Rs. 18 on imported bulbs through the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1661/36 dated 9th July, 2010.

The cess imposed under the Export Development Board Act, shows the desire on the part of the Government to provide relief to local manufacturers by discouraging the import of similar items which are manufactured locally. Furthermore, the Government has not imposed cess on items such as raw materials, investment goods, which are used in the local manufacturing process and on pharmaceutical items.

Sir, according to the Central Bank Report of 2009, the usage of CFL bulbs has increased from 26 per cent in 2005 to 51 per cent by the end of 2009. This means that there is a substantial number of people in the country who still depend on incandescent bulbs. According to import statistics and local production figures, the demand for incandescent bulbs can be estimated at 20 million units per year. The local bulb industrialists provide a substantial number of employment opportunities and the import of cheap goods can pose a threat to their livelihood. Incandescent bulb manufacturers are in the process of diversifying into the manufacture of CFL bulbs and hence it is the duty of the Government to give them some breathing space during their transition period.

The safeguards received by local manufacturers and farmers against the import of cheap, low quality goods, which pose unfair competition to them, will no doubt

1349 1350

[ ]

2010 16

support to strengthen the local industries in the country. With the imposition of cess, prices of imported bulbs will be high and that will provide sufficient protection for the local manufacturers. It means the local companies involved in producing these bulbs, will be competitive in the market. The discouragement of the import of similar items, which are locally manufactured through the introduction of the cess, will reduce imports of such items. With this initiative, the local industry can survive and continue providing employment opportunities. Further, it will save valuable foreign exchange and lead to easing of balance of payment difficulties faced by the country.

Thank you very much.

It states, I quote:

"Fears of a global food crisis swept the world's commodity markets as prices for staples such as corn, rice and wheat spiralled after the US government warned of 'dramatically' lower supplies.

An especially hot summer in the US, droughts in countries including Russia and Brazil and heavy rain in Canada and Europe have hit many grain and oilseed crops this year. This has raised concern of a severe squeeze in food supplies and a repeat of the 2007-08 food crisis".

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It states, I quote:

The fall in supplies has prompted countries such as Russia and Ukraine to impose export restrictions on grains.

. . .

It further states, I quote:

Big importers in the Middle East and North Africa have started to hoard supplies, which has further tightened the market.

I will table* a research report put out by a licensed stockbroker called, "Capital Trust", which is sent to hundreds and thousands of people.

I will read a part of it and wind up my speech. It states, I quote:

We must never forget the fact that the war against the deadly terrorists was won in early 2009 but the war against saboteurs, traitors and subversive elements is continuing. The Governments noble goal of making our motherland the Financial Hub of South Asia and the Economic Miracle of Asia will remain as empty slogans unless these disruptive elements who are perched comfortably on the horns and devouring up the ears are identified immediately and eliminated early.

It states, ..identified immediately and eliminated early. Is this what we want? Where is the security for people to speak out? In a democracy, we should have the right to be critical. I am not talking about the war, I am not talking about killing people, I am only talking about the economic management of this country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. You can conclude now.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Therefore, I think some action must be taken to

They are talking of a transnational government. Why has this Government not spoken a word about these guys? Who are they to make such a statement and why has the Government that has been contradicting everything been so soft and so silent? I must admit that I did see the Minister, Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella speaking about it in one instance but that has been only by reference and not by a headline news. Normally, it will be there for three or four days as to who they are et cetera. But, we have not seen that type of thing at all. We, as the principal Opposition would like to get the Government categorically tell us what this transnational Government that they are talking of is. Who are they? What is it for? Why has the Government not taken action? Why have the embassies overseas not taken action to deport those guys saying, "Who are they to ask such a thing?". I did speak to my Tamil Colleagues in Parliament and asked them what their feelings are. They said that they do not know who these bandits are. Normally, it would have been them asking us why we are not commenting. Now, we are asking why the Government is so silent about it. These are matters that are affecting the ingrained Sri Lankan social fabric. The Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Burghers, the Muslims, the

1417 1418

[ ]

2010 16

Malays, all live as one Sri Lankan community. The large-heartedness of the Sinhalese, the industriousness of the Tamils and the business procurement of the Muslims are all put together to make the Sri Lankan society and that is what Sri Lanka has been. By trying to break them into different compartments, we have only become chauvinistic in nature and every time that has been tried, it has only ended up in bringing racial disharmony to this country and I guess, we need to change this.

We have been talking of estate development. But, what has happened? Our Friend, the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman is there. As a Minister what has he done to the community? - [Interruption.]Yes, I mean his right hand. I know what amount of things he did to for the benefit of his people. Nothing has happened. It is same with the Muslim community. At one time the Muslim MPs said that you have one lot here, one lot there and because this lot is here, we are on that side. So, we are fighting for the Muslims. Now, all the Muslims are together. Now we are asking, "What is on?"

( ) (An Hon. Member) They are not talking about the electoral reforms also. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, nothing at all. When the Local Authorities Bill is there, we speak about that. About the Muslims having their early morning prayers - I think you call it, "Subah", - I am the one who asked about this.

When the Tamils were sent to Vanni, we were the ones who questioned in Parliament. So, these are matters that we ask. We basically ensure that we have an export drive, which is necessary and I see the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is on the ball on certain areas. The credit is due to him. We will certainly speak of it. But, one solitary cylinder working does not mean that the entire engine is functioning. That is what is necessary to go forward. At this particular moment, we have got the Minister of Industry and Commerce here. You would know what the exporters are telling you and the problems that they are faced with. Today the BOI is in an absolute state of difficulty in getting the investments approved. It is not that the people are incompetent but there are too many hands being poked into one particular area. You must give freedom to them. You must give licence within seven days. It has to be yes or no. You are talking as if the exports have grown. I am telling you the rupee value in a dollar component is not the improvement. The quantity that is going out of the country is reducing. That is the problem. If you just happen to go to the Free Trade Zone in Katunayake or Biyagama, factually we are working with them. You would know the problems that they have. Unfortunately, I do not think the MPs here have ever seen what the Free Trade Zones are and when

they try to profess the problems which they think the exporters have, it will only end up in these factories being closed. Today you go to a bank and borrow at 11 per cent. How can you compete with the region which is borrowing at 1 per cent? You are automatically at a 10 per cent disadvantage. So, what is the Government doing there?

You are talking about 11 per cent GSP loss. So, it is a 21 per cent loss. You are saying that you will give salary increases. The Minister of Labour Relations and Productivity Improvement says that they will increase the salary by Rs. 1,000 from January . That is another 15 per cent. So, who is going to pay for this? We know your problems. After all, we all are Sri Lankans. Let us put the problem on the table and say that this is the problem. It is not one party that has created it and it is not one party that can solve it. So, that is the necessity. You have got to get all sitting together and ensure that we have this problem solved. If one person thinks that he can solve all the problems, that is the beginning of the end. Time has come now that we work in plurality. We will work together with a common national interest and that is what we said before we lost the Labour GSP. So, it is high time we work; get up from our slumber. Talk to the people and say, "Yes, we have a problem", instead of saying everything is perfect and expect the benefit tomorrow when nothing happens.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

I wholeheartedly support the Order moved by the Hon. Leader of the House relating to cess that had been

published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1661/36 of 9th July, 2010 and presented in Parliament on 20th October, 2010.

Sir, I must pay tribute to our young and ebullient Minister of Industry and Commerce, Hon. Risad Badhiutheen for making a very sensible coherent, and well balanced speech in English today in this House. He has done well in the House and is doing well in the country. Our prayers are with him. And, also with the Government, with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, for leading this country towards peace and prosperity. My Friend who spoke before me said that though the war has ended, there is no peace. In order to achieve peace, the war must end and this Government has very ably, courageously and successfully accomplished it. As a result of this, even the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is able to come to this House freely without facing any disturbances on the way, and without being pierced by bullets, and is being able to make a speech in a very peaceful atmosphere in this House.

Now, Sir, there was reference made at the commencement of Business regarding the floods that threatened to wash away this beautiful edifice. The Hon. Speaker paid tribute to all the officers from the Secretary-General down to the lowest officer working in Parliament for saving the Parliamentary building. It was almost a great deluge that we used to read in biblical stories. I would like to take your mind back to what the then Leader of the Opposition, the present President of the country, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, said on 18th December, 1989 in this Parliament. He foresaw this danger and said the following, which are almost prophetic words, ringing in our ears even now:

"..... . 75 . , . . . . . . .." Mark these words, Sir. ".. . " 1989 .

" . ."

I do not want to quote the whole thing of what His

1421 1422

Excellency the President said at that time. I will table* this to be included in Hansard.

This is a very laudable act; not only the people of this country but the whole world will endorse it. But, what did the Hon. Leader of the Opposition say the other day in this Parliament? He was opposing it; he was critical about the steps that have been taken to build a new Parliament. This is the way the

Hon. Leader of the Opposition behaves. He comes here in the morning to get something published in the media. He does not know what he says.

. . "" ocean. , . Leader of the Opposition , , . He is called in by the British Parliament as the alternate Prime Minister of the country. I have with me the 22nd edition of the famous Parliamentary Practice & Procedure book of Erskine May. On page 211, under the caption, " The Official Opposition" it states, I quote: The importance of the Opposition in the system of parliamentary government has long received practical recognition in the procedure of Parliament. Even before the first Reform Act, the phrase 'His Majesty's Opposition', had been coined by John Cam Hobhouse. In 1937, statutory recognition was accorded through the grant of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition. Now, as for our Leader of the Opposition, we have given him recognition not only through the grant of a salary but also by recognizing him on a ministerial status even more - he enjoys all the privileges. He has vehicles; he has enough security; he has an official residence and when foreign leaders come to this country, after calling on His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the other Ministers, they call on him also. That is the recognition given by this Parliament to the Leader of the Opposition. So, a person who holds that post must have dignity; must earn the respect of others. Now, what did he say in the morning, Sir? During his speech today, I raised a point of Order under Standing Order No. 84(v) which states that every Member must confine his observations to the subject under discussion. Sir, on the 8th of October and 23rd September, he had made two speeches; I have the relevant Hansards with me, where the speeches are identical to that of today. On the 8th of October also, I raised a point of Order.

1423 1424

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition was always talking about Sarath Fonseka; he has a love for him. In spite of whatever sins he has committed against Sarath Fonseka, he is trying to wash off such sins through Parliament perhaps to tell the country. On the 23rd of September, he made a similar speech to that of today. Perhaps, he does not know what he is speaking. He may have the copies of the speeches he made earlier on his table, so he brings them and reads them over and over again, in this House. Is this what is expected from a responsible Leader of the Opposition, I ask? At that moment also, I was on a point of Order. Today also, Mr. Speaker warned him like on previous occasions. He said, "You are repeating. I have given an Order. Do not challenge my Order". If he wants to speak about Sarath Fonseka - he is always talking about the Commonwealth, we are talking about the common man - he can bring in a substantive Motion according to the Standing Orders. Instead of that, . . , . . , . ; , , . , . . . ( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Today, Sir, our country has been taken to Himalayan heights socially, politically and economically by His Excellency the President. The Island of 15th November, 2010 states, I quote: Sri Lanka the fastest growing Asian economy after China

Who says that? It is none of us. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) The Island! ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Your hotpot! It is in The Island. The Singapore Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister says this. Have you read this? He has said -

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) The Island is your newspaper.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Island is our newspaper? Thank you very much for reminding us about it. We like The Island; we like all the other newspapers, including the Daily Mirror.

The Island newspaper of Monday, 15th November, 2010 states, I quote:

In the run-up to commencement of President Mahinda Rajapaksas second term, Sri Lankas contemporary achievement received a glowing testimonial from an important political personality in the East Asian region, the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister of Singapore, Teo Chee Hean.

What does he say? He says that Sri Lanka is the fastest growing Asian economy after China!

The Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who made wonders, and the Ministers there like Teo Chee have acknowledged the fact not only in Sri Lanka but also in the international arena, that though Sri Lanka has suffered under the clutches of the gruesome terrorists for 30 long years, it is now the fastest growing Asian economy after China.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you will have to wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir. What a great tribute the leaders of Singapore are paying to this country and to our Leader, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.

If this Government wants to continue with the Emergency Regulations anymore, certainly we can give our support to a certain extent. Mr. Presiding Member, we need Emergency Law only for two purposes: one is to prosecute against the terrorists who have been apprehended and whose litigations are pending. Secondly, to apprehend and prosecute the terrorists who are still engaged in terrorist activities or who have committed serious offences in the past. If not for those two, for what other purpose do we need the Emergency Law?

Abdul Khalam left the Presidential Palace with only two cardboard suitcases. That was the only asset he owned at the time of his retirement. When he first entered the Presidential Palace, he distributed all his personal assets among his kith and kin and came there as a free man. When he left the Presidential Palace also, he left as a free man with only two cardboard suitcases which contained only his clothes. He was the happiest man to leave the Palace. What an example we can get from our own region? Our closest neighbouring country has given that kind of example to the world. Have we given that kind of example? Here, political power is not being used to give that kind of example but it is used just to accumulate wealth. Sir, you would know that after 1977, some Members of Parliament who had nothing when they came to Parliament became billionaires. They became billionaires not by doing any business or any kind of employment. That is the system. That is a bad precedent we have set in this country.

[. . 3.57]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I rise to speak on the cess imposed through the Sri Lanka Export Development Act. But, before I go into the core speech, I would like to speak a few minutes on the other matter that was talked about in this House today. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said that the war is over, but peace has not come. Sir, when you spoke you said, The war is over, peace has come and the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake can walk into this Parliament without any fear. You took it so simple but fortunately for us, the next speaker, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti, placed before us the problems that we face in this country. The war is over but there is no peace. The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti who went to Jaffna, maybe for political reasons but also to hear the grievances of the people in the North, mentioned to me - it has been published in newspapers - that he shed tears when he listened to the wailing cries of the mothers in Jaffna. These mothers who do not have any political affiliation to the JVP came in hoards. Why? Because they are so desperate. They want to cling on to any possible straw so that they could reach their family members who are now missing, not knowing whether they are alive or dead.

It is unfortunate that my Friend, the Hon. Shantha Bandara, who spoke a few minutes before me stated that there are also so many soldiers who went missing and asked that if their mothers come and demonstrate in front of the JVP, what they would say. My Colleague, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who spoke a few minutes ago said: Do not celebrate revenge. This is not a question of those in the army who went missing or the youth in the North who went missing. We have to look at it with humane eyes to see the suffering of those people. Like the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti shed tears in Jaffna, when I attended an Independence Day celebration and when the march past was taking place at the end of it, a few soldiers who had lost their limbs came on wheelchairs. I shed tears that day though being a Tamil. Maybe most of those soldiers or all those soldiers were Sinhalese, but seeing the suffering of those men, I shed tears. This is the feeling that people in this country, as Sri Lankans, have to develop so that there can be national unity and peace in the real sense, and not in the sense that the war has ended and peace has come. Real peace will come only when people like the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti understands the suffering of the Northern people. Others in this Government also should go and feel the suffering of the people who have lost their children, lost their homes, lost their properties and lost their kith and kin. It is only in that way, we can bring real peace to this country. Though this is not connected to the Sri Lanka Export Development Act or the cess, I think it is necessary for me to speak in this House on this issue.

1455 1456

Unfortunately, the Hon. Minister is not here. The Export Development Cess is a cess that is imposed on imports. Why do we impose a cess on imports and put it under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act? Because this cess is supposed to support our exports. Imports from other countries are taxed or a cess is imposed so that that money can be utilized for supporting exports from this country. But, unfortunately this Government looks at cess not for a special purpose like exports. It looks at it only as a means of revenue to the Government. This is a bankrupt way of looking at an export promotion cess. Sir, as my Colleague, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said, this Government is not using the cess that they collect from the export of tea. Rs. 4.50 is imposed as cess on tea. There is a cess on all rubber that is exported from this country. This cess is supposed to support the Tea Board and the Department of Rubber Development. But is it happening? In the case of tea, the cess collected is in the region of Rs. 1,300 million. But, the Chairman of the Tea Board confessed at a debate that he receives only Rs. 200 million out of the Rs. 1,300 million. This Rs. 200 million is just to maintain the Tea Board and the institutions that do research on tea; that is for the recurrent expenditure only, not for development expenditure.

The Tea Board is supposed to promote the export of tea, the export of value added tea and new products that can be made from tea. But, Rs. 1,100 million goes to the Government coffers as revenue for other purposes. Is this fair? I remember the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam, when he was the Minister for Estate Infrastructure put up a Cabinet Paper, when tea cess was increased from Rs. 3 to Rs. 4.50, which proposed that at least one rupee from the cess be paid back to the welfare of the workers. That money was diverted to the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure for providing welfare for the people who produce tea. But, the Cabinet refused that amendment to the Cabinet Paper and today, we see the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure has been totally abolished leaving those people without development. This is the same case with the rubber cess too. It is so unfortunate.

Some people are underestimating the effect of GSP. GSP means a concession of 12 per cent on the export value of products to the European Union countries. When you have an advantage of 12 per cent on exports, where the profit margin for the manufacturer especially in garments, is in the region of 4 to 5 per cent only, that means with a 12 per cent difference in price between another exporter who has the advantage of GSP Plus, we are left uncompetitive. With a 12 per cent advantage we are able to compete with those other countries that do not have this GSP Plus advantage by being able to sell 12 per cent less. We are a country that exports garments as the largest export, but we are a country that does not have backward integration in the garment industry. We do not produce our own raw materials; we do not have textiles;

we do not have cotton grown in this country; we do not have yarn produced in this country. We have to import our yarn even to weave. But, most of the fabric used in the export of garments is imported fabric, which also means that there is a greater lead time between an exporter with their own raw material and us. With all these disadvantages, this 12 per cent GSP Plus concession was an advantage that many others did not have and gave us a competitive edge. That being removed is definitely a loss to this country and the Government should not underestimate this or take it easy. After all, honouring the commitments under human rights is not a loss of sovereignty, but is really placing back the sovereignty of the people by giving them their human rights in the manner it should be done.

This Government is talking so much about exports, about foreign investment in large amounts coming into this country. But, all that can come only if the investor has confidence in the Government that is running this country today. In 2008, with the world economic crisis, there was expectation that we would lose out on our exports to many of the developing countries that were faced with the economic crisis. In fact, our exports have dropped during the last two years in real terms. In September 2008, this Government announced a scheme of rewards for exporters. It was called the Export Development Rebate Scheme. This scheme was announced because there was a crisis and there was an expectation that there would be a drop in exports from this country. So, the Government announced that if a company can maintain the same number of workers, can export up to 90 per cent of the exports they did in the previous year, quarter by quarter, calculating first quarter of 2008 to first quarter of 2009 and so on and if they had maintained 90 per cent of exports, they would be granted 3 per cent incentive on their FOB value for their exports.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to conclude your speech within one minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, please give me two more minutes. Further, this export development rebate scheme also offered 5 per cent to those who could maintain the exports at the levels that prevailed in the previous year without any loss of employment. Many of the companies thought that because they were going to get this rebate, they could grant concessions on the prices they offered to their buyers so that they would be able to maintain the same quantity of exports in the year 2009 and onwards. On that expectation, they gave discounts between 3 to 5 per cent to their buyers and did maintain the 90 per cent or the 100 per cent exports that should be achieved in the year 2009.

1457 1458

[ . ]

2010 16

Today, none of those exporters have been paid the export development reward of 3 per cent or 5 per cent. There are seven companies who have to receive more than Rs. 300 million from this Government. There are several others with smaller amounts totalling to about Rs. 2 million to be paid to these exporters. After that, the Government makes a promise with advertisements in newspapers calling for applications, receiving them, processing them and notifying them that the export development rebate is due, if the Government does not pay. Are they not letting down those exporters? This is treachery by the Government. It is cheating by the Government and this is not going to support exports. Therefore, the Export Development Board and the BOI should look into this issue that is before you. They should restore the trust and the expectations of investors to sustain investment and exports in this country.

Thank you.
