[. . 3.18] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I wish to state right at the outset that we agree with the Motion that has been placed before the House to revise the salaries of the Judges of the Superior Courts.

The salaries of Judges are an important component that ensures independence of the Judiciary. In any functioning democracy, independence of the judiciary is an important feature and it is for that reason that even Standing Order No. 78 which deals with the Rules of Debate states that the conduct of Judges shall not be raised except upon a substantive Motion. The Parliament which is supreme in the realm of law-making has provided fetters for itself so that the other arm of the Government, namely the judiciary, must be independent. But, Standing Order No. 78 is often misunderstood as can be seen. It is only the conduct of the Judges, the conduct of the President that cannot be raised. Judgments of courts do not fall under this Standing Order. Judgments of courts can be criticized not only within the confines of this House but also outside because justice is not a cloistered virtue. It must suffer the scrutiny of men; it must stand the test that is applied to it. So, in any functioning democracy, as I said, that is another feature that shows up the independence of the judiciary, the ability to subject judgments of courts for fair scrutiny before the people. Today is an opportunity that we have to reflect upon the history or the performance of the independence of our judiciary; it is an opportunity to evaluate how independent our judiciary has been. That is not a matter that comes within the purview of conduct of any particular judge, it is a judiciary as a whole.

I agree with most of the speakers of the Government side as to how under the 1978 Constitution the independence of the judiciary was interfered with constantly by the Executive. It started with the promulgation of the Constitution itself. Judges of the Superior Courts were shut out; they could not enter even their Chambers. In a decided case - Visvalingam vs. Liyanage - the former Chief Justice, Mr. Neville Samarakoon had hoped that such a dark day, as what happened on that particular day, would not happen in the future in this country. But, that was not to be. Very soon houses of judges were stoned. Judges who had given judgments against the State on certain Fundamental Right matters that came up before the Supreme court were stoned. But, that is not to say that this trend of the Executive interfering, threatening and seeking to subjugate the other supposedly independent arm of the Government, which is the judiciary, ceases with the change of administration. No, it does not. We see that sad spectacle even today. To this day, the Executives interference in the judiciary continues, and that is there for all to see. The Hon. Members of this House can trade

763 764

allegations one against the other. Every time the main Opposition, the UNP, points out to the Government Benches that the independence of the judiciary is being interfered with, one sees the sad spectacle of the Ministers and Members of the Government responding only with the history of what the UNP did. What the UNP did is no justification for what happens today. What the UNP did is no yardstick by which one decides whether it is right or wrong or to what degree the interference in the judiciary can be tolerated. If it was wrong for the UNP to have done that, it is wrong today for the UPFA to be doing the same thing. That is the test. They condemn themselves by their own words. When they respond by saying, Well, you did the same thing, they bring judgment on themselves saying, We are doing the same thing; we are doing the unacceptable; we are doing what the democracy should not condone, and, that is the Executive to be interfering with the Judiciary.

Appointment of Judges is an important aspect of the independence of the judiciary. I was saddened to see the Hon. Susil Premajayantha justifying the Eighteenth Amendment that has taken away whatever independence that was brought in through the Seventeenth Amendment. The very fact that the Executive appoints without untrammelled powers, Judges of the Superior Courts, itself is a severe blow to the independence of the judiciary. We have had this sad spectacle in this country. If one were to look behind and evaluate, under the Soulbury Constitution, there was a protective mechanism. Article 29(2) and (4) prohibited any passage of legislation that conferred any benefit on one community that was not conferred on another community or subjected one community to some disability that the other community was not subjected to. At the time the Constitution was promulgated, if anyone was to ask to give an example of what may have been in their minds, an easy example would have been given that the Sinhala language cannot be made the only official language. That could have been the example that could have been given under Article 29(2). But, that very Act was passed in 1956 and the judiciary could not do anything. There were legal challenges to that; at least two. That is the sad history of this country. It is not only that. In 1972, when a new Republican Constitution was to be brought in, Mr. C. Sundaralingam, former Member of this House, went before the Supreme Court to stop the promulgation of the new Constitution. The judgment that has been reported states, It is too early. This has not happened yet. So, you cannot challenge this. As soon as the 1972 Constitution, the first Republican Constitution was adopted by the then National State Assembly, Mr. C. Sundaralingam went back to the Supreme Court again and said, Okay, now it has happened. Then, he was told by the very same judges, Now, it is too late. That is the Constitution under which we ourselves derived the authority. Such a sad joke it was. When you seek to do

it first, you are told it is too early and when you seek to do it just after, you are told it is too late. The first several Amendments to the 1978 Constitution - I agree entirely with what the Hon. Susil Premajayantha said - took away the independence of the judiciary. Even judgments of the judiciary that functioned independently were sought to be quashed by Constitutional Amendments - as the Hon. Minister himself said - utilizing the five-sixth majority in this House. The situation now is no different. Using a majority, any majority beyond two-thirds majority, to achieve its own purposes and to stultify the judiciary from functioning independently is a negative step for any government. There was reference made to international law. When Sepala Ekanayake hijacked the Alitalia aircraft in Bangkok, this Parliament hurriedly passed an act dealing with air piracy and sought to make air piracy a retroactive offence. At the time when that was challenged that you cannot make that offence retroactive, the argument was that air piracy is already recognized as an offence by the international community of civilized nations and therefore, it was an offence even though there was no enabling legislation that had been passed in this country. When that was favourable, international law was self-executing in this country. You did not even need an enabling Municipal Law to have been passed by this legislature; only to prescribe sentences subsequently it was said that an Act had to be passed and that passed muster. That is good law. But, what has happened now? Now, there is so much worry about international law applying to this country. We boast and say that we are one of the senior members of the United Nations. We participate in the affairs of the United Nations, most notably when a flotilla of boats which was sent to Gaza Strip was attacked and bombed by the State of Israel, although white flags were raised in that ship. The UN investigation into that is led by our own Ambassador Palitha Kohone. We participate in that process to investigate into the conduct of another sovereign nation on the basis that we are a responsible member of the international community. That is all well and good! That is most welcome. But, what is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander as well. International law has developed over the years and if we do not keep step with those developments, we will be left behind. We will not be able to claim that we are part of that international community of civilized nations. If we are to proudly call ourselves a member of the international community of civilized nations, we must behave in that civilized fashion.

When there was a massacre that happened in Ruwanda and if a journalist from Ruwanda reported that massacre, the question is not whether such a thing happened or somebody said that such a thing happened. If there is a grave violation of human rights and somebody says that, the question is not, "Did somebody say that such a thing happened?" No, the question ought to be, "Did such a thing happen?" Somebody saying that a grave violation of human rights occurred is not so

765 766

[ .. ]

2010 20

important as to find out whether in fact such a grave violation of human rights occurred or not and unless we change our mindset to that civilized conduct, we cannot continue to boast that we are part of the international community of civilized nations.

Our own Supreme Court has functioned independently to a great extent. Even this morning, the Supreme Court granted bail and was disgusted and said, We are becoming a bail court, because they were granting bail to somebody who was in remand for seven years. So, they step into that lacuna. That is most welcome. But, as I said, they function independently to an extent, to the extent that the Executive permits them to function. We see more and more such permission being denied to the judiciary. So, it is not enough merely to increase the salary of judges, but a conducive and independent atmosphere must be created for the judges to function independently.

Last May, 282,000 people were interned in camps in and around Vavuniya. To this day, no judicial order was given for their detention; to this day, not even a detention order given administratively by the Secretary of Defence was issued in respect of any one of those 282,000 people. Where is the rule of law? There is a reported case, Mahinda Rajapaksa vs. Kudahetti. That says, "An arrest is when a person is stopped moving from one place to another". That is an arrest. That was decided in favour of the person who complained of his freedom of movement - Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Katunayake Airport. But, here are our people who have been confined in camps without any judicial order, without even an administrative detention order, not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, but for over one and a half years. Several of them have now been released. But, still there are about 30,000 people remaining. It is not the numbers; even if it was an individual, where is the rule of law? It is not that people did not have recourse to courts. A case was filed in the Supreme Court - S/C F/R 457/09 - on 18th, June last year. To this day, no order has been made with regard to leave to proceed. Where is the independence of the judiciary? To this day, no order has been made. Ordinarily, an order either granting leave to proceed or refusal, is given on the very first day of support. It does not take more than a day. But, when it concerns Tamil civilians, who in numbers exceed 250,000 are forced in detention camps, even the highest court has not made an order.

Now, we are for increasing the salary of judges, but, the judges also must perform their duties properly. That is a reciprocal duty of these judges. Another application was filed by the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah in 2007 - S/C F/R 646/07 - with regard to access to his house. No order with regard to leave to proceed has been made even to this day.

Take the case of General Sarath Fonseka. It is not the individual who matters, but the principle. Not one citizen of this country believes that he would have been prosecuted either before military tribunals or otherwise, if he had retired and gone home without contesting the Presidential Election. Not one single person in this country believes that. So, where is the system of justice? If that can be done to General Sarath Fonseka, the ordinary Tamil civilians in this country shudder what their plight might be before such a judicial system. If the former Commander of the Sri Lankan Army, who is hailed to be the one who led the Army to victory against the Tiger terrorists, is dealt with in this fashion, what is the plight of ordinary Tamil people, and I dare say, ordinary Sinhala persons, in this country?

Independence of the judiciary is absolutely essential for any democracy because it is the judiciary that not only arbiters the disputes between two private persons, but in todays world more and more, it is the judiciary that arbiters the disputes between the State and the citizens and the judiciary is expected to play a neutral role in that matter, and particularly when we have entrenched provisions in the Constitution that accord with the international law, it is the duty of the court that has been vested with that kind of jurisdiction, to exercise that power to the fullest, so that we can continue to say that we are proud to be a member of the international community of civilized nations.

Thank you. [. . 3.41]

(Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, and our Ambassador for Cuba was also there together with several Ministers and Members of Parliament. When we speak about Human Rights, Sir, I think people have forgotten about the sanctions imposed on Cuba and the threat extended even to other countries for sanctions to be imposed. That is why His Excellency the President - I think somebody commented about it - wanted the whole situation reviewed because the law must apply not only to individual citizens and nations but also country to country.

Yesterday, Sir, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited Vavuniya. What is the message he gave? He said," !" When interpreted, it is, " ". . . . , " , " . , . kangaroo court . . . . Banners , " " . , ; ; " !"

is. Sir, the Sri Lanka Parliament is a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

are not aware of the Inter-Parliamentary Union or its procedures. Any Member whose country is a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union could go before the Inter-Parliamentary Union and make representations. That is the procedure and the

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, by raising a point of Order, I do not want to insult the donkeys in this country. They are very happy, particularly, in Kalpitiya. But, Sir, even the donkeys are national-minded, not this

- [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Sir, you have to give me my time. The donkeys will not take the and go home. The four-legged donkeys will not take the which was given for the respected Muslim community in this country and make personal use of it. This is a betrayal to the Muslim community; this is a betrayal to Allah. So, the four-

legged donkeys will not do it, only the [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

will take the dates to their houses for personal use. - [Interruption.]

So, Sir, let me explain to you about the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

The Inter-Parliamentary Union is a world body of Parliaments. There are 159 countries and with your permission I would like to table* a book titled, "Activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 2009".

Now, Sri Lanka Parliament is also a Member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Any Member who feels that his fundamental rights or human rights are being violated, has every right to go and make representation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union - IPU. In 1989, President Mahinda Rajapaksa, when he was an Opposition Member like me, went before the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva; he went before the UN Human Rights Committee; he went all over the world and took up cases of all violations of human rights. Likewise, Sir, as an Opposition Member I have every right to go before the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I am telling the Government Members not to insult the Inter-Parliamentary Union, not to ridicule the Inter-Parliamentary Union. It is a world body of Parliaments. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, please sit down.

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) So, Sir, I have every right to go before the IPU and I have been invited by the Secretary-General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Mr. Anders B. Johnsson. I made a complaint on behalf of General Sarath Fonseka along with the Hon. Tiran Allas. Our complaint was taken as an admissible case by the Inter-Parliamentary Union Human Rights Committee and I was asked to be present before the Inter-Parliamentary Union Human Rights Committee on the 2nd of October, 2010. As Assistant Secretary of the United National Party in charge of Human Rights, I went before the Human Rights Committee of the IPU, I was there for two hours and presented my complaint in detail. The IPU being an independent, impartial body gave the same opportunity to the Government Ministers.

The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe and the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva were given the opportunity on the 5th of October, 2010, to give the Government side of the story. But, what happened, Sir? The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, when he was a UNP Parliamentarian - thanks to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the late Hon. A.C.S. Hameed - contested against the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa - and became the President of the Human Rights Committee of the IPU. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, please sit down. Take your seat please.

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Sir, the Emergency Regulations are on, the PTA is on. If I have done anything with the LTTE, take me into custody, apply the law of this country and do the investigations. But, they do not do it. Why are they not doing it? They are only making false and baseless allegations just because I stayed with the Tamils. That does not mean that I am a LTTEer. Just because you happened to be a Tamil person, are you a LTTEer, Sir? Sir, this is what the racist elements of this country who are trying to burn this country; who are trying to create communal riots in this country, are saying. As a Sinhalese, Sir, I am proud to be associated with the Tamil people. The Tamil people are my brothers and sisters; the Muslim people are my brothers and sisters. Therefore, Sir, I do not take these things into consideration. Just because you are a Tamil, do you become a Tiger, Sir? If anybody makes an allegation to say that you are a Tiger, is it true, Sir? This is what they are doing. These are the racist elements who are trying to break, who are trying to burn this country again. This is the problem.

The IPU Human Rights Committee has accepted my complaint. They have started investigations according to the confidential procedures of the IPU Human Rights Committee. But, Sir, they have not rejected. I am tabling* the reply sent by the IPU Human Rights Committee. I am tabling it here, Sir. - [Interruption.]

The Secretary of the Human Rights Committee of the IPU, Mrs. Ingeborg Schwarz has sent me a reply saying that the IPU Human Rights Committee has not rejected the complaint. They have started investigations. They do not go public with one hearing, Sir. This is an international organization. This is a very impartial independent organization. Jayalath Jayawardana cannot

influence. Mahinda Samarasinghe cannot influence. Nimal Siripala de Silva cannot influence. They will go independently . They will investigate independently. They will do independent investigations. They will write to the Attorney-General, they will write to the Secretary of Defence, they will write to the Hon. Speaker, they will write to the Secretary-General of Parliament and they will even write to His Excellency the President. There is a procedure to be followed. You see, Sir, even in a court of law in Sri Lanka, after the first hearing, no judge will give a judgment. There should be a considerable time period. Sir, we are not ridiculing the image of this country. People like

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

have gone and ruined the reputation of this country. They have embarrassed the IPU Human Rights Committee. They have insulted the IPU Human Rights Committee by making false allegations saying that the IPU has rejected my complaint, Sir, which is a false and diabolical untruth.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of order being raised.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is referring to the personal conduct of a Minister in this House. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is a very great patriot. He has gone and defended the country. Therefore, he must withdraw. [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] the image [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Let me quote the reply I got from the Human Rights Committee. It says, I quote:

"The Committee has indeed received a communication concerning Mr. Sarath Fonseka and is at present examining this case under its confidential procedure. ... "

which means, it has not rejected this case. This is signed by Mrs. Ingeborg Schwarz, Secretary to the Human Rights Committee of the IPU.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) , .

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Therefore, I am challenging the Government as to whether they can challenge these documents which have been released by the IPU. I am challenging the Government. I take full responsibility for this document. Sir, therefore, . . You cannot hide the truth forever, Sir. The truth will come out. -[Interruption.] We are not traitors of the country. But, we as the Opposition Members of Parliament, have the democratic right to go and make a complaint on behalf of our Colleague, whose fundamental rights and human rights have been violated. Therefore, Sir, we have every right to do it. Sir, we are not traitors. We are really patriotic people. We are working for the people. We are against dictatorship. We want the rule of law in this country to be protected. - [Interruption.] We want human rights to be protected irrespective of caste, creed or religion of the people of this country. Especially, when the fundamental rights of the elected representatives have been violated, what will the position of the ordinary citizen of this country be? - [Interruption.]

Sir, during the last 16 years, as a Member of Parliament and an Assistant Secretary of the United National Party in charge of human rights, I have taken up the cases of all Parliamentarians, not only the cases of the UNP Parliamentarians, but also the cases of TNA Parliamentarians; I have taken up the cases of the SLFP Parliamentarians; I have taken up the cases of SLMC Parliamentarians. - [Interruption.] This time, I have even taken up the case of the late Hon. D.M.Dasanayaka, a Minister of the Government who was brutally assassinated. I have also taken up the cases of the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj, and the Hon. T. Maheswaran. - [Interruption.] Sir, I am still following up these cases. Even when the lives of nine TNA Parliamentarians of the previous Parliament were under threat, I took up their cases as well. Therefore, Sir, as a human rights defender, I have no differences - no political differences; no ethnic differences; no religious

differences, and whether they are white or black, irrespective of their caste, creed or religion, I have taken up their cases.

Therefore, I feel that this is my fundamental right.- [Interruption.] As a Parliamentarian, I have my right to take up those cases, Sir. When President Mahinda Rajapaksa was an Opposition Member like me, he too went up to the IPU Human Rights Committee. He went up to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and made the same type of allegation against the then Government, the UNP Government. We did not ridicule him, Sir. We gave the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as an Opposition Member, the democratic right to take up those cases. What is the difference today?

The Opposition Members are being ridiculed; the Opposition Members are being insulted; the Opposition Members are being oppressed; - [Interruption.] The Opposition Members are being called traitors. - [Interruption.] Sir, is this democracy? - [Interruption.] You are the ruling party. We are the Opposition and you say kotiya - kotiya - kotiya, Sir. - [Interruption.] He does not know about Kattankudy. Sir, when the innocent Muslim people were massacred, it was I who went there and gave them the siren. - [Interruption.] Sir, then he was with us and he thanked me profusely. He thanked me profusely for trying to protect the Muslim people of Kattankudy. -[Interruption.] His conscience is aware of this. - [Interruption.] But, Sir, what does he say now? This is the attitude of the

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

The Muslims are aware of it. The Muslims of the Eastern Province are aware of how I tried to protect the lives of the innocent Muslim people. - [Interruption.] In Sittandy, the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana and myself were there. The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulanas brother-in-law was killed. We were shot at by the LTTE. But, we did not stop. The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana is now with the Government. [Interruption.] Sir, this is the way - [Interruption.] Only Allah will give him the due place. - [Interruption.]

Therefore, Sir, I am telling you, there is no rule of law. The rule of law has to be implemented. It has to be implemented in such a way that the human rights and fundamental rights of the people and the elected representatives of the people, who are Members of Parliament - whether they are in the ruling party or whether they are in the Opposition - are protected and we will fight for that. I will fight for them. I have done it, Sir, not only for the UNP Parliamentarians, but also for the SLFP, SLMC and TNA Parliamentarians. I have taken up all their cases. Therefore, I am telling you, Sir, this is the problem. When I take up the cases of the TNA Tamil Parliamentarians, I am branded as a kotiya. Sir, you are a

781 782

2010 20

Tamil man, but are you a kotiya? Sir, are you a kotiya? Just because you happen to be a Tamil, can you be considered or treated as a kotiya, Sir? This is the plight of the people. There are racists who are trying to burn this country. Are they behaving in a responsible manner? Are they going to be patriotic to this country, Sir? We have to bring in ever-lasting peace to this country and irrespective of caste, creed, religion and politics, all the citizens of this country should have equal rights, equal opportunities, equal status as respected citizens of this country whether they live in the North or whether they live in the South.

Sir, there is no point in going to Vavuniya and saying some nice words. All these words are very nice, very good, but you must put those words into practice. This is the problem, Sir. The Sri Lanka Parliament is a very active member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Today, by making these types of false, malicious and fabricated allegations, the Sri Lankan Government has embarrassed the IPU. This is a blessing in disguise. The IPU Human Rights Committee will take serious note of this.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Yes, thank you, Sir.

Therefore, I am telling you, Sir, we have to be very responsible.

We cannot tell a lie, Sir. I do not say that I have won my complaint at the IPU. What I say is that my case has been considered as an admissible case. That is why, Sir, I am tabling* the invitation which I got from Mr. Anders B. Johnsson, Secretary-General to the IPU, to come before the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians of the IPU.

If my case was not admitted, Mr. Anders B. Johnsson, the Secretary-General to the IPU, who is a very honourable and internationally recognized person, would not send me an invitation, which I have produced even to the Swiss Embassy in Sri Lanka, and even to the Hon. Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. The Secretary-General of Parliament is here, Sir. He is fully aware of the situation.

I want to state one more matter, Sir. I request the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs to come to this House and make an announcement about this

case because the Minister of External Affairs is the correct person. He is the Minister responsible for foreign affairs; he is a Professor of Law; he is an educated gentleman and he is not a donkey. I am requesting the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris to come to this House and make a statement about the IPU complaint.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Your time is over. Please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I can give 10 minutes of my time to the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Are you going to give 10 minutes of your time to him?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Yes, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana, you can carry on with your speech.

, . . . . , . . . . Even to disagree, you have to agree. That is democracy; that is the principle of democracy. Therefore, Sir, I am telling you again and again that there should be Parliamentary democracy. There is no point of talking about the Ministry of Justice; there is no point of talking about the judges. We are the law-makers; we are the legislators. We have to set an example to the judges; we have to set an example to the judiciary. By denying the rights of the Opposition Members, what is the message you are sending to the judges? What is the message you are sending to the Ministry of Justice? What is the message you are sending to the media and what is the message you are sending to the people? Sir, I am talking about the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I went to London and met Dr. William F. Shija, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. He welcomed me as an Opposition Member. Likewise he will welcome any of the Government Ministers or any of the backbenchers. That is the practice; that is the tradition of the Commonwealth.

We are members of the Commonwealth. We are also Members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, not only Members of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. We have every right to go to the Commonwealth if we feel -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . . [Interruption.] ( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Sir, donkeys do not drink water. Donkeys drink toddy, human urine and eat rata indi. Human beings drink water. Sir, I am telling you that this is not a joke. Some [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] are trying to make this House, the most respected and highly dignified Legislature in this country, a joking place. Sir, he is making mockery of himself. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) . ? [Interruption.]

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Sir, I am telling you that the Government should take a very serious note of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, its Human Rights Committee of Parliamentarians and the CPA - Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The Government has every right to go to the IPU and the CPA. The Government should know that the Opposition also has the same right to go before the Human Rights Committee of the IPU. We have every right to go to the CPA. They cannot deny our privileges, our human rights, if they are law-abiding people. If they want an independent judiciary in this country, if they want to protect the human rights of this country and if they want to protect the fundamental rights of this country which are embedded in the Constitution of our country; they cannot deny the rights of the Opposition Members of Parliament. They should not do that. They are trying to ridicule us by bringing false and malicious allegations through the media. Today, the Government Ministers through the media say that the case before the Human Rights Committee of the IPU on behalf of General Sarath Fonseka has been rejected. The Inter-Parliamentary Union is the official authority who is hearing this case. Sir, the Secretary-General of our Parliament is fully aware of it. He has been to the IPU General Assembly and he is a good witness; the Secretary-General is an eyewitness. He knows it very well. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Minister of External Affairs is also well aware of these facts. There are some people who are looking forward to the Cabinet reshuffle in November to get new portfolios. Some people are trying to become the foreign minister by cutting the neck of the innocent (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. I feel very sorry for him. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) ? ( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) I do not know who is doing that but by doing these type of things, they have ridiculed and ruined the image of Sri Lanka. Today, the Sri Lankan Government, the Sri Lankan Parliament has become a laughing stock before the IPU Human Rights Committee. The IPU Human Rights Committee has been insulted; the IPU Human Rights Committee has been embarrassed. You know, Sir, there is a procedure when a case is pending. They have accepted my case.
