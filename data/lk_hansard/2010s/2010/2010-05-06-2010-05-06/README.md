. "Full support" -" "- . , . . . . , . , . , , . , 16 . , . , . . , . . , . , , . , - - . ; . , , . , . . , , . . , . , . Mr. Speaker, this is an Agreement which will have enormous beneficial consequences for Sri Lanka. It is an Agreement that we are signing with the Shanghai Co-operation Organization. Russia is a member; China is a member. The Ambassadors of Russia and China will join me when I sign this Agreement on behalf of the

Government of Sri Lanka in a couple of hours' time. It is a very far-reaching Agreement. It encompasses the whole range of co-operation with regard to security matters, the economy, exchange of technology, co-operation in the field of health with particular reference to infectious diseases and cultural programmes. A whole range of activities are envisaged by the provisions of this Agreement which the Government of Sri Lanka will sign very shortly. I would like to say a word, Mr. Speaker, about Russia because Russia is a key member of this Organization. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa paid an official visit to Moscow a few months ago. I accompanied him on that visit. On that occasion, the President of the Russian Federation, President Dmitry Medvedev, had a one-hour discussion with President Rajapaksa. That is unusual, Mr. Speaker. It was not merely a ceremonial discussion; it was a substantive discussion, in the course of which the Russian Federation pledged herself to close and far-reaching co-operation with the Government of Sri Lanka. Mr. Speaker, there is a particular aspect of that visit which is exceedingly satisfying. Within one month of that visit by President Rajapaksa to Moscow, 12 large companies of Russia, which had discussions with me on that occasion in Moscow, sent their representatives to Colombo to explore ways and means of those companies coming directly into Sri Lanka and making very substantial investments in the Sri Lankan economy. The activities engaged in by these companies are of particular relevance and significance for Sri Lanka. These activities include, Mr. Speaker, the tourism sector and pre-fabricated housing, which we are particularly interested in for government officials. This is low-cost housing, particularly in the urban areas. Russian companies are prepared to come here for fish processing. After nearly 12 years, we are now able to exploit the abundant resources of the northern seas of Sri Lanka. There are also Russian companies which are committed to investments here in the energy sector. These Russian companies sent their representatives here within one month of the President's visit to Moscow, and we are now engaged in discussions with the Russian Ambassador in Colombo with regard to implementation of some of the ideas that these Russian companies have. Then, Mr. Speaker, I need also to inform this House about another event which will take place towards the end of next week, which will also have beneficial consequences for Sri Lankas economy. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa will be visiting Tehran in order to take over the leadership of the G-15 group in Tehran. This will take place within the next ten days. On that occasion in Iran, His Excellency the President will have a series of bilateral meetings. One of those meetings will be with President Lula of Brazil. One of the challenges that we face at this moment, Mr. Speaker, is to expand our markets. We are not giving up our traditional

279 280

friends. But, it makes sense, situated as we are with regard to the Sri Lankan economy, at the present time to consolidate traditional relationships and at the same time to make an assiduous search for new markets. In South America, Brazil is a rapidly developing economy. Brazil has particularly an energetic Ambassador in Sri Lanka and the bilateral meeting which will take place within the next ten days between President Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka and President Lula of Brazil will be the precursor to a whole range of very beneficial developments with regard to the economy of Sri Lanka at this moment. Mr. Speaker, you are aware that little as we are, this little Island produces 80 per cent of the worlds cinnamon and it is cinnamon of the highest quality. Sri Lankas markets with regard to cinnamon consists largely of Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries; Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and so on. We now propose to strengthen these markets, and the bilateral meeting that will take place in Teheran very shortly, will lay the foundation for these developments. I would also like to pay tribute to the Government of Australia for a very timely initiative on their part at this time. In Thimphu, I had discussions with the representative of the Government of Australia, and on the Governments behalf I expressed appreciation of something that Australia had done. The Government of Australia has announced a three-month freeze with regard to applications for political asylum from Sri Lanka. The Government of Australia, Mr. Speaker, has adopted the view that things are moving ahead in Sri Lanka. The Government of Australia, their representative, in the discussions they had with me, expressed satisfaction with the progress which had been achieved by the Government of Sri Lanka with regard to the resettlement of internally displaced persons. We started with a figure of 297,000 and it is now down to about 53,000. Of that 53,000, about 20,000 people keep moving out of these camps. Although their names are in the books, they are at liberty to visit their relatives, to go out and come in as they wish. Having regard to the magnitude of this task and the fact that we have to cope with this unexpectedly, the Government of Australia was of the view that they must give Sri Lanka a chance. What they are seeing is encouraging. Therefore, they proposed to review this situation during the next three months and within that period they will not be entertaining applications for political asylum from Sri Lanka. I told the Government of Australia that we find this exceedingly encouraging and we hope that other governments will adopt a similar approach to this matter. Mr. Speaker, I said earlier that we are not forsaking or abandoning traditional markets. We are therefore, taking

seriously our relationship with the European Commission. The Government of Sri Lanka at this moment is engaged in a series of discussions with the European Commission with regard to the GSP Plus concession. On the 15th and the 16th of March, four senior officials were sent to Brussels to discuss matters pertaining to the GSP Plus concessions. That delegation consisted of Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance; Mr. Romesh Jayasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs; Mr. Suhada Gamlath, Secretary to the Ministry of Justice and Law Reforms and the Hon. Mohan Peiris, Presidents Counsel, Attorney-General of Sri Lanka. Those discussions were very fruitful. The Government has every reason to be satisfied with this start that was made on that occasion. There was a meeting of myriad. We were able to identify the issues that need to be addressed and the trajectory for future discussions in order to reduce the areas of divergence between the European Commission and the Government of Sri Lanka. Mr. Speaker, in a few days time, on the 20th and the 21st of this month, these officials will visit Brussels for a second round of talks and our expectation is that these talks will move forward. The Government of Sri Lanka derives satisfaction from our initiatives during the last few days. Yesterday, this House by an overwhelming majority endorsed the Governments proposal that the Emergency Regulations under which we have been governed for as long a period as four years and eight months should be significantly scaled down. We do not believe that Emergency should be resorted to in perpetuity. At the same time we make no apology, Mr. Speaker, for the residue of Emergency Regulations which the Government has chosen to retain. I do not think that any rational person in this country would challenge the proposition that the military action against the LTTE could have been successful without the support of these Emergency Regulations. They were absolutely indispensable at that time. However, as circumstances change, as the ground situation is transformed, the Government is under a duty to keep the situation under constant review and to make changes which are opportune at any particular moment. This is the matter of balancing different interests. Dean Roscoe Pound, one of the most distinguished Deans of the Harvard Law School, once said that social engineering is involved in these decisions. You have to balance competing interests and arrive at an equilibrium. So, we now believe, Mr. Speaker, that the vast majority of Emergency Regulations can be swept away and what is retained is absolutely essential to ensure that the Government continues to have the strength to combat very vicious propaganda that is being engaged in against the Government by groups that are friendly with the LTTE. We are all aware of what is happening -

( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Hon. Minister, can you give me just one minute?

[ . . ]

2010 06 281 282

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, of course. ( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Can you tell us when the state of Emergency will be done away totally? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) With respect, I think the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya is asking a very unfair question. I do not have a crystal ball to gaze at. How can I possibly anticipate the events for the future? Would it not be an act of irresponsibility on my part to commit the Government to a time frame with regard to the total abolition of the Emergency Regulations when situations are unpredictable? All I can say is that it is not the wish of the Government to keep the Emergency for one moment longer than is necessary. There was no compulsion on the Government of Sri Lanka to take the action that was taken yesterday. We took that action because of the honest conviction that these Regulations are no longer necessary and we take great pride in restoring the body of ordinary law in this country. However, I would like to tell the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, I am sure he is aware of it, right now as we debate in this Chamber, there is a campaign in many Western countries for certain groups to elect Members to a Provisional Transnational Government in Exile. That is a very dangerous development. We are now instructing our Ambassadors and High Commissioners in the relevant capitals to engage vigorously with those governments, to bring to the notice of those governments the dangers inherent in this course of action. I would like to emphasize, Mr. Speaker, that the risk is wherefore not over. The military action is over. There is no military threat to Sri Lanka, but these groups are transferring their attention from the field of battle to the field of diplomacy. They are engaging with the governments of the world, the corridors of power, multilateral institutions; the whole complexion of their campaign is undergoing a significant change. The Government of Sri Lanka therefore must demonstrate the resilience to be able to deal with that threat. It is a different kind of threat. It is not the threat that we had while the military action was going on. But, it is a threat, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya would, I am sure appreciate, which is as inimical to the interests of this country as the military action that was engaged in by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam some months ago. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, no foreign government has told us, Abolish this immediately. That is unreasonable. You cannot go from hundred to zero. You cannot go from one end of the spectrum to the other. Nobody is proposing such a practical course of action. All the messages that I received during the last 72 hours indicate that there is very

substantial appreciation of the initiative by the Government of Sri Lanka to scale down these Emergency Regulations as much as possible and we are proud that our President has been able to take that decision. Then, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to tell you about the Reconciliation Commission which we are going to establish. That is going to happen. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has made that decision. Sri Lanka has gone through a period of great pain and anguish. Countries in similar post-conflict situations have taken action to reconcile the different groups of the community when all the pain is over. It is a period of healing and we have to put in place the institutions that will buttress and fortify that healing process. There is no need, Mr. Speaker, to reinvent the wheel. We can certainly benefit from the experience of other nations. But, we must have the creativity to adapt those solutions to suit the circumstances of Sri Lanka at this time. Mr. Speaker, we have drawn inspiration from the experience of the Chilcot Committee in the United Kingdom which had to deal with some residual problems after the defeat of the IRA. When this was happening, I was a distinguished fellow of All Souls College in the University of Oxford and I had frequent discussions with the late Lord Diplock who had a great deal to do with the establishment of what were called, Diplock Courts. So we have looked at the Chilcot Committee. We have also taken a close look at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa in which Desmond Tutu, Nobel laureate played such a magnificent role. It is a wish of President Mahinda Rajapaksa to reach out to all sections of our community, to heal the wounds of the war and in a spirit of amity and brotherhood to take the nation forward. We have almost finalized the Terms of Reference of the Commission. We are now in the process of finalizing the personnel of that Commission and we will be appointing that Commission very shortly. That is a very salutary development. It is something that is necessary to heal the wounds of this nation. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Mr. Speaker, is the Hon. Minister moving the Regulations in the Gazette or is it a statement on foreign affairs or external affairs? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I have moved the Regulations. I do not think that there is any need to debate the taxes on these ten commodities.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

There are three Regulations that are in the Order Paper.

283 284

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

Yes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

I mean, first of all, to enlighten the House you will have to give an explanation as to what those two notifications are. We are completely in the dark because I see in one gazette, there are some dangerous chemicals that you are trying to release on licences.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

No, no. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

We would like to know something on that. Hillary Clinton and all that is very good. We are very happy that you have been congratulated but that is not the point. The important thing is the subject of the day. [Interruption.] We know that you are quite knowledgeable. All that is conceded but then, this is something that we are interested in and we would like to know. [Interruption.] There are some gazettes referring to food prices, there are some gazettes referring to chemicals and there are imports of scrap metal. All that is there. So give us some explanation as to what are you trying to do with this gazette notification? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

Mr. Speaker, in most Parliaments in the world the Opposition would welcome the opportunity to take a look at the Governments plans for the future; where we stand today; what is the state of the economy; what is the state of our external relations and how does the Government - after all it is a new government - propose to deal with these matters? I say without fear of contradiction that most legislatures - I would say all legislatures in the world - the Opposition would welcome the opportunity to be given information with regard to these matters. It is very strange and indeed bizarre, Mr. Speaker for the Chief Opposition Whip to get up and say, We are not interested in these matters. We do not want to know about that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

We are interested in the subject of the day. First of all, give a clean explanation on the three gazettes. After that you can talk about your knowledge - [Interruption.] I know that you are quite knowledgeable.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, I have already said that this is a process which we have resorted to without interruption for the last several years. That is, from time to time we have been adjusting these rates. [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker - ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti)

Hon. Minister, we have a problem on one set of Regulations with regard to chemicals and we have asked the Government either to tell us in full today what those

287 288

chemicals are or to leave that aside. We can send it to the Consultative Committee. That issue -[Interruption.] I am sorry but we have already informed the Government of that issue. That is the one that has been troubling us. I know, privately also the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake did inform. On Monday night, I think he met the Leader of the House. This is one issue that is troubling us. I know that he informed. The Gazette No. is 1627/1. What you are putting down here is something that has been prohibited and why do you not - [Interruption.] We did inform the Leader of the House that we want an explanation on that on Monday night when we all met him at a social function. Otherwise, leave it aside. We will put it to the Consultative Committee and take up the others. [Interruption.] This is the issue that the Chief Opposition Whip has taken up. It is nothing else. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

No, no. We are not - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

. . . ( () ... ) (The Hon. (Alhaj) A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Speaker, according to the Business of the House, you have already recognized the Leader of the Opposition. He is holding the Floor without speaking.

( ) (An Hon. Member) That is pointless. - [Interruption.] Pointless! . . . ( () ... ) (The Hon. (Alhaj) A.H.M. Azwer) But, according to the Standing Orders, he must be given, whatever said, the freedom of speech; the freedom of speech must be honoured by the Speaker. It is very clear. A student of Erskine May , J.A. Pettifer, says when the Speaker calls a Member to speak, he must be allowed to speak. But, what is happening today is, a gang of rabble-rousers . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . - [ ] , Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969 Section 20(4) : " Every regulation made by the Minister shall be brought before Parliament within a period of one month from the date of the publication of that regulation under subsection (3), or, if no meeting is held within that period, at the first meeting after the expiry of that period, by a motion that such regulation shall be approved.." ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Mr. Speaker, you must also look into the fact that this was gazetted in November, 2009. Then, the whole process was brought to a halt by the Parliament being dissolved. All that is over. This is a new Parliament. There should be a new gazette and it should be presented as a result - [Interruption.] Yes. Look at the result over the dissolution of Parliament on legislation. It has to be introduced a new. The Leader of the House has put many Acts back for the passage in Parliament. That you can do. But, for this, a new gazette should be brought in. What

299 300

Document A * : * : * Article tabled:

Budget deficit expands 15.75% year-on-year in January At 1.15 percent of GDP, deficit could meet interim target of 4.5 percent of GDP By Devan Daniel Sri Lankas budget deficit for the month of January 2010 reached 1.15 percent of GDP, expanding 15.75 percent to Rs. 63.2 billion from Rs. 54 billion in January 2009, as total expenditure increased by 10.48 percent while total revenues grew 5.45 percent on better tax collections which increased 7.92 percent. According to latest datea released by the Central Bank, tax revenue in January amounted to Rs. 46.3 billion compared to Rs. 42.9 billion in January 2009. Total revenue during the month increased 5.45 percent to Rs. 48.3 billion from Rs. 45.8 billion in the corresponding period last year. Total expenditure increased 10.48 percent to Rs. 111.7 billion from Rs. 101.1 billion year-on-year:Recurrent expenditure increased 7.88 percent to Rs. 94.4 billion from Rs. 87.5 billion. Capital expenditure including long term investments on infrastructure development amounted increased 27.2 percent to Rs.17.3 billion from Rs. 13.6 billion. The overall budget deficit in January 2010 amounted to Rs. 63.2 billion which was 15.75 percent higher than in January 2009. The deficit in January amounted to about 1.15 percent of GDP and seems to be on track to achieving Treasury estimates, a shade over 25 percent of total estimated deficit for the first four months of 2010. According to the interim budget, the estimated budget deficit for the first four months of the year is Rs. 245.2 billion or 4.5 percent of GDP. The estimated GDP for 2010 is about Rs. 5,448.8 billion and the deficit for January is divided by the GDP estimate for the entire year and economist avoid dividing GDP into 12 (to gauge the GDP value for a single month) because fiscal seasonality results in an uneven spread of revenues and expenditure throughout the year.

According to the Treasurys Pre-election Budgetary Position report, the deficit for the entire year is estimated at 7.5 percent, reaching Rs. 414.7 billion but it could be a challenge with the Central Bank warning against reckless spending if the government was to successfully meet priority expenses without expanding the deficit further as it could put considerable pressure on the economy.

In 2009, the estimated deficit was 7 percent of GDP but the government overshot this target reaching 9.7 percent of GDP, in a year the Central Bank described as the most difficult in Sri Lankas economic history.

If 2009 was a bad year due to external pressures caused by the global financial crisis, the Central Bank also warned the government in 2008 that fiscal consolidation and reforms to public institutions would be important steps to be taken going into 2009.

During the latter part of 2009 the Central Bank again warned that the fiscal position of the government looked precarious and is it turned out, that was exactly how it was when the year ended.

While acknowledging the need for government spending it infrastructure development, rehabilitation of once war-torn areas, public welfare and poverty alleviation, the Central Bank continues to warn the government against recklessness and inefficiency which could jeopardize the macro-economic gains having low inflation and low interest rates and threaten welfare and poverty alleviation programmes.

The IMF has delayed the third tranche of the US$ 2.6 billion standby facility programme until the government shows it was committed to fiscal consolidation through its policies when the next budget is presented and approved by parliament.

That is what I said and that is what I continue to say. There needs to be a certain expansion of money. There needs to be a certain amount of money that will ensure that the economy will carry on without friction. However, - [Interruption.] Exactly. It is the same principle. Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. This is what Milton

Friedman said a long time back. But, it is the truth. When you print more money than that is required, what happens is, prices go up. So, now what has happened, Hon. Member, is that the Central Bank has actually stopped printing money beyond the necessary requirement and that is the reason why inflation has come down. That is precisely why I said that I hope the Central Bank will have this monetary discipline into the future. It is good that inflation has come down. Inflation is the greatest enemy of the society. What happens to the money that people have in their pockets? It becomes worthless. Now you need Rs. 2,000 to buy what we used to buy with Rs. 1,000. Also let me tell you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that during the period of the previous Government - April, 2004 to March, 2010 - inflation increased by 97 per cent. If you look at the Colombo Consumer Price Index and compare the two figures for those two periods, you will see that inflation has increased by 97 per cent. You get the same figure if you cumulate inflation year over year. That is why I say, that inflation is the greatest enemy of society and it hurts the poor more than it hurts the rich. ? , . ; . , . . supermarket . . .

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, after an absence of six years, I am very happy to be able to enter this Chamber and enjoy the lights of it. I like this place and would continue to love this place, particularly with a lot of fair Members who have also entered this august Assembly representing their respective electorates. Sir, I speak in this Parliament at a time when people are afraid to see the light at the end of the tunnel at Sirikotha, the headquarters of the party which I served for 49 odd years, in which if I remained for a few months - the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake knows it well - I would have been given a gold medal for 50 years of uninterrupted services. That was not to be, very unfortunate for them, but not for me. It is in this context, Sir, that I rise in this House to pay my eternal tribute to His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa for spotting me somewhere, may be because of my talent, my ability or may be because he realized the importance for it, and nominated me to this House. As a Muslim, I believe, Sir, all the blessings are showered on us by our Creator, Allahu ta'ala. I would like to quote Surat An-Nahl, Ayat 18: "FA-INTHA UDDOO NIHMATHALLAHI LA THUHZUHA - INNALLAHA LA GHA FOORUR RAHEEM"

If ye would count up The favours of Allah, Never would ye be able To number them: for Allah Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

So, I have come here once again to help steer this country towards development, as the President had envisaged. During the election campaign, I always carried these two books - " , "

SUSPENSION OF IMF LOAN FACILITY ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . . . . "The IMF lent to the Government of Sri Lanka 2.6 billion US Dollars and in return, the Government of Sri Lanka agreed to conditions that have been imposed by the IMF on the 16th of June 2009. The Budget of 2010 was supposed to reflect some of these requirements. However, owing to the Presidential Election, the budget was not submitted and substituted with a Vote on Account. Now, the IMF has stopped providing the agreed loan facility. The Government has increased the prices of flour, bread, gas, milk powder in the last couple of days. The IMF is calling upon the Government to carry out reforms and submit the Budget if they are to continue with the lending. Please advice the present status and how can we alleviate the hardships imposed on the people." , . . . ? ; . . . ? ? . ; . . .. . . . . telegram ; . . .

Hon. Minister, all we want to know is whether they have said that it is conditioned upon a budget being presented? When you said that the budget will come in November, are you not going to rely on the IMF? That is all what we ask. That is why we asked a very innocuous - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Hon. Member, I can understand your anxiety. But, the fact of the matter is that these are matters which are mutually discussed. They are not saying, You must do this, you must do that." Never! Even at the worst of times, I must say, as my good Friend, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara mentioned, they have never said like that. They never talked about bringing a vote on account or a budget. You know, the instrumentality of this -

( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Minister, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

I will take just one minute. The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera is giving me his time, because I want to give a full answer.

( ) (The Presiding Member)

Do you intend to take his entire time? ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Yes. So, the instrumentality is never discussed with them. They never came and said that. Of course, we said that whatever changes we want to make, whatever progressive measures we want to make, for example through the Taxation Commission, will be incorporated in the budget. But, you have to think of the external environment. We have had elections. We have had the need to have an election for electing Members of Parliament. A new Parliament has come. A new Government is in power. We have to bring a new budget. All these matters have to be considered. The pledges made to the public have to be taken into account. The global economic scenario has to be taken into account. So, this is not a matter to be taken lightly. The IMF is never telling us to take these matters lightly. Whether we are to have a vote on account or whether we are to have a budget, it is all a matter for the local host country to decide. The IMF, you know very well, has been disengaging itself very much from trying to impose conditionalities. In fact, the idea of conditionalities is a very old concept. I can remember, when I was the Director of Information and Dr. N.M. Perera presented his Budget, Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike came and told me - I was in the Officials' Box here - Why do you not explain to the UNP that we are also partners in the World Bank. Please, explain to the UNP that there is no menace in this. At that time also they were saying the same thing. Dr. N.M. Perera even went to the IMF and borrowed from the IMF. I can very well remember that he got up and thanked the IMF. The officials had a lot of difficulty in persuading Dr. N.M. Perera to get up and thank the IMF. But, he did it. So we have to be- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara)

We are not going to be enslaved by any - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Exactly. He is quite right. [Interruption.] Sir, let us not talk about that. This is not a dictionary office, Sir. This is Parliament. We are not bothered about what words we use from the dictionary. But, the point is, please appreciate. This is something that this Parliament must understand. These financial institutions are undergoing a severe change in attitude, in leadership, in ownership and all that. What are the basic functions of the IMF? That is to maintain a certain degree of discipline in the global economy. The IMF is there to monitor if countries start crashing left, right and centre because then it begins to affect the other countries as well. In this globalized world, one of their main functions is what is called, "surveillance" - global economic surveillance. They have to be constantly studying. When you go for IMF meetings, the very first day the top IMF economists come and give you what is called, "The state of the global economy". It is a whole-day presentation with facts and figures. I can say as a former participant, that long before the American economy crashed, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, the IMF economists said, that this housing business is going to crash. It is going to lead to further complications in the global economy. Of course, they may not have measured the total strength of the debacle. I think, like the American Government and like western governments, they could not understand the depth of this collapse. But, they were the first to point out in the global report that they were heading towards a collapse because of this debt situation particularly in the housing sector. Ultimately, there was a big crash in the American economy and that led to further crashes in the other countries that are related to the American economy.

So, I want to say very sincerely on behalf of the Government that there is no question of being subservient to the IMF. We are having talks with them. One thing that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has clearly told the negotiating team is, You cannot concede things which are not earlier discussed and which form the bedrock of our policy. We have discussed like that. The exchange rate, the interest rate and all these have been mutually discussed. So, please let us not give what I would call a "hysterical picture" of the global and domestic economic situation. - [Interruption.] Now you accept what I say. So, I want to thank you for raising this issue because let us not take this debate outside. I want to give the authoritative position, that there is no question of giving into conditionality. These are all mutually discussed and there is absolutely no case of giving into conditionality. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Why are you not presenting Budget? After an election that is customary and that is where your policy is presented. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Hon. Amaratunga, [Interruption.] No, no. That is a different matter. That has nothing to do with what the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake raised. That is an internal matter. We have to decide. I can give you a straight answer. We have just had an Election; we have a new Government. We have a manifesto and according to that various new policies have to be converted into various economic and other actions. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

But, the Country Manager, Mr. Koshy Mathai has said that the third tranche depended on the Budget being presented. That is why we raised this issue, because subsequently there have been three or four price increases. I do not know whether it is relevant or not. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Mr. Mathai may have said that, but during this year and at the end of last year, the procedures were determined largely by external factors such as elections; such as formation of a Government; such as a new manifesto and the need to present a budget which is in keeping with what we pledged the people of this country. Is that not so, Hon. Nanayakkara? So, we have to be patient and we have to be realistic. We cannot bring a budget that was formulated for last year. I will give you

some facts. We had to change the date of the Election. With regard to the Presidential Election, the dates were brought forward. So, naturally with that, various other economic and social policy matters had to be adjusted. Then, soon after that we went to the Parliamentary Election on the due date. That is why we have the new Government. ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Minister you have only one more minute. We have to adjourn the House.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

So, please believe me when I say the following things. The first is, we are not subject to any conditionality as far as the IMF is concerned. These are all mutually discussed and mutually agreed. Secondly, the changes from a vote on account to a possible budget, to a vote on account again and another budget, is determined by extraneous factors such as elections and the change of the calendar. That is the reason. The third reason I want to mention is that, we will be bringing in a fully-fledged budget proposal at the proper time which will incorporate all the promises made to the public. Lastly, I want to say that we do not have to hide anything. As far as we are concerned, we are a perfectly transparent Government. Now, everything I mentioned to you is based on documentation which is

freely available. In fact, I want to tell you that the Sri Lanka Central Bank has a website which gives all these data. It is www. cbsl.government.lk. So, please check these facts.

( ) (The Presiding Member)

With that note you can conclude, Hon. Deputy Minister.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

So that is what I want to say. Those are the four points. I am glad you raised this matter and I am also glad that I got the opportunity to answer it. Thank you. . . 4.30 . , 2010 07 . . 9.30 . , .. 4.30 ., 2010 07, ..9.30 It being 4.30 p.m., MR. PRESIDING MEMBER adjourned Parliament without Question put.
