Sir, I have here with me a fax message dated 1st December, 2010 sent by the Presidential Secretariat. In that it is said, I quote:

"For security reasons the speech by His Excellency the President Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka at the Oxford Union, the home of free speech, has been cancelled. This is a decision that has been made unilaterally by the Oxford Union, reportedly as a result of pressure applied by pro-LTTE activists".

- including the Members of this Parliament.

It further states, I quote:

"His Excellency President Rajapaksa said:

'I am very sorry this has had to be cancelled but I will continue to seek venues in the UK and elsewhere where I can talk about

my future vision for Sri Lanka ".

"His Excellency went on to say, ' I will also continue in my efforts to unite all the people of our country whether they live

in Sri Lanka or overseas. As a united country we have a great future. If we allow divisions to dominate, we will not realize

our true potential. We have had thirty years of division and conflict. We must now secure peace and harmony for all Sri Lankans.' "

"Since 1931 we have enjoyed an adult franchise and today, our Government is as democratic as any in the world.

We believe in liberty and brotherhood and we seek justice for all. Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Worship are

integral features of our way of life. Without them we cannot be a true Democracy.

To justify our Freedom we must work hard, work patiently, and work with a strong faith in our destiny.

A New Constitution cannot by itself secure or ensure Freedom. Above all we want honest Government and clean administration."

The Politician and Public Servant are but trustees of the people, for the majority of whom life is still a grim struggle.

Those who are called to positions of leadership must dedicate themselves anew to the service of our fellow men.

We have a Public Administration that has earned a high reputation and is considered to be as good as any in the world.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Hon. Presiding Member, before I start my speech, may I ask one question from the Hon. Minister? It is not that I am accusing you. You know very recently, in Vavuniya, 21 Karyala Karya Sahayakas - peons - have been appointed. Out of those 21 employees, I heard that 19 are Sinhalese. [Interruption.] Sir, I will finish my question first and you can answer to that later. Likewise in Batticaloa also, 21 appointments have been given and about 19 of them are Sinhalese. The same thing happened in Ampara. At the same time, in Batticaloa, Sir, although there are 18 employees who have been working there temporarily for years, they have not been given appointments yet. In Vavuniya, I heard that 1,200 people had been called for interviews, but none of them were given employment. Most of the employees that you sent to these areas do not belong to that particular district; they are from outside. I do not know why these types of things are happening and I would like to know whether this position is correct or what is happening to these appointments? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) May I reply to that question? Now, it is not correct to say that in Vavuniya, 22 employees have been recruited and they are from outside the district.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) I am talking about the minor employees; peons or "Karyala Karya Sahayakas."

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The total number of employees who had been recruited is 18. Out of these 18, there are nine people from Vavuniya, three from Puttalam, two from Ratnapura, then another two from Batticaloa and one person from Anuradhapura. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) But, Sir, these are minor employees. Now, from Vavuniya itself, about 1,200 people have sent their applications for these jobs. I cannot understand the reason why you are recruiting minor employees from outside the district. These things are happening not only in Vavuniya, but also in Batticaloa, Ampara and in various other places. Even in Batticaloa, 18 minor employees have been working there for a long time on a temporary basis, but you did not make them permanent. Why is that? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The situation in Batticaloa is not exactly such. In any case, since I came to know the situation there, I informed the officials that those employees who have been posted from outside be taken out from Batticaloa and Ampara Districts.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Thank you, very much, Sir.

Sir, there is another question. Very recently 247 applicants had been called for interviews for the post of SLAS officers and almost all the applicants are Sinhalese; not the Tamil-speaking people - no Muslims or Tamils. Out of 247 applicants, I heard that you are going to recruit about 198, but no Tamil-speaking people had been called for interviews. Why, is that Sir?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Now, the basis for selection of SLAS officers is a written examination and based on the results of that written examination, they are called for interviews. I must say that not a single Tamil or a Muslim has passed in that written examination. That is clear. So, now we have decided to hold a separate examination to recruit SLAS officers in Tamil medium. Then, your problem will be solved.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Thank you very much, Sir.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, I rise today, in this House with a deep sense of grief over the death of our very close Colleague, the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor. He was with us the day before yesterday. That day, he gave me a lift in his jeep to my house in Bathiya Mawatha, Dehiwela, as my car was in the garage. He has been named by the Hon. Speaker the other day as one of the Members of the Chairman's Panel of this House. He was also elected as the Treasurer of the Sri Lanka-Pakistan Parliamentary Friendship Association the other day - on the eve of the visit of the President of Pakistan, Mr. Asif Ali Zardari to Sri Lanka. So, Sir, we have many things to talk about him, but today, I only wish to convey my deep condolences, and say, "Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi Rajioon! "

Let me, Sir, congratulate, first of all, the new Minister in the Sri Lankan political firmament, the Hon. Comrade Vasudeva Nanayakkara. He was described those days as a firebrand politician. I have seen him addressing Hyde Park meetings under the shadow of Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R. de. Silva and a host of leaders of Lanka Sama Samaja Party at that time. For over five decades of hard labour towards the toiling masses and the working class at last somebody has recognized his talents, what he possesses in himself, the personality he is, and for the future good of the country, His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa has honoured him by appointing him as a Cabinet Minister to handle National Languages and Social Integration. Now, Sir, we would not find a better person than him to preside over this Ministry. He is absolutely patriotic sans any sort of communal or religious feelings. He stands for a united Sri Lanka. That has been his political philosophy and forte. We are very happy about him.

I want to only tell the new Minister that there is a dearth of Tamil officials in most of the offices not only in Colombo, not only in North and the East, but even in the Sinhala-speaking areas. We need Tamil officials over there. Even in the Ministries, Sir, we do not find sufficient Tamil officials to handle the work in Tamil. I would only request him as the new Minister to draw up a

679 680

scheme so that every Minister would have somebody who can work in Tamil also. I think the Hon. Dilan Perera, another firebrand of his age, would also help the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara to implement such a socialistic and progressive programme in this country. He has a very big and important task to perform. In keeping with the "Mahinda Chintana", he has to bring all the races together. That is national integration.

Now, Sir, in Sri Lanka, we mostly do emotional politics. Here is a literary giant, Mr. K.S. Sivakumaran, a veteran and prolific writer, who writes Tamil correctly as "Thamil" in English. He says this in an article appearing in the "Daily News" of 29th June, 2010. It states, I quote:

One of the stumbling blocks for congenial development in all spheres in this country is over enthusiasm

in bowing down to extreme emotionalism by some agitators, genuine though their intentions are supposed to be...

It further states, I quote:

But it may be argued that few numbers of contributors competent in more than one language are available to do this job. It is true, but why cannot we rectify this shortcoming by trying to familiarize and understand each others culture without taking a mono stance?.This needs an attitudinal change."

We have to change as Mr. Sivakumaran quite rightly says. I further quote:

Thats why President Mahinda Rajapaksa is liked by many for his statesmans demeanour and pronouncements treating everybody

as not majority and minority but as Lankans in true spirit. One wishes he hastens his ideals in double quick time before possible

chaos invades us over again. But again everything depends on everybody concerned to support him to achieve the ideals. Unity in

diversity is strength no doubt. All religions teach us that LOVE is the key factor in understanding the Almighty.

So, in this respect, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara can play major and vital roles as the Minister in charge of this subject now.

Then Sir, talking about the Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva, he has been given a new portfolio, . Now, everybody says he has no function and has no department. . , ? . . . . . According to Gazette Extraordinary of 22nd November, 2010, duties and

functions of the Minister of Public Relations and Public Affairs are, "Implementation of a relief provision.... " Sir, I table* this document to be included in Hansard because I have no time to read out the complete list of duties and functions of the Minister.

. .

, SriLankan Airlines , water . , . . . There is a Sri Lankan Catering Company. Everything in the aircraft is Sri Lankan, I should state emphatically.

Then again, talking about Lake House, . . . 2009 3, profit before tax Rs. 82.4 million. supplements . supplements . , news-stand, . . "Daily News" ; . . . Mr. Seelaratne Senarath has been appointed as Director Editorials and Mr. S.Shanmuganathan, Director Finance. They are doing wonderfully well. Mr. S. Thillainathan is the new Chief Editor of the "Thinakaran" newspaper, Mr. T. Senthilvelan is the Editor of the "Sunday Thinakaran", Mr. Jayatilleke de Silva, the Editor of CDN - that is the "Daily News" and Mr. Dinesh Weerawansa is the Editor of the "Sunday Observer". They are all doing a wonderful job of work to improve the Lake House publications.

Then in the broadcasting field, Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, Chairman of the SLBC is one of the most experienced personalities who is daring in his performance. , . . , he is a man of history and literature. He is heading the Rupavahini Corporation. Mr. Rosmand Senarathne, a very suave, calm and cool personality, conducts the affairs of the ITN. The ITN is the number one TV channel.

We must adopt a similar scheme so that people of the calibre of Mr. Casinader can be felicitated appropriately by the whole nation.

We have spoken enough of the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne. He is a man of action. I know about his activities. So, Sir, the Public Service is in safe hands. Thank you very much

With regard to providing Tamil translations to bank accounts et cetera, which he referred to and the names of development projects, I must mention that these issues are being addressed and dealt with as an ongoing activity of our Ministry. There is a Cabinet decision with regard to this matter. Taking note of this, we will take follow-up action and bring about the necessary translations and formulate the necessary words in respect of the matters that he referred to.

Then, with regard to the social integration policy, again we are formulating an ongoing exercise which is not the complete and final position. We hope to have discussions with organizations concerned and obtain views from people and peoples representatives in working out these programmes. Therefore, it will be necessary for us to visit the Tamil-speaking areas as well in order to get a better input for our work.

Another matter that he raised was that the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs had not provided enough translators. That is true. There is a dearth of translators. The Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs held an examination and had interviews to recruit translators. But, since many applicants did not turn up and some did not comply with the required standards, the next move is to consider lowering the expected standard of the applicants, thus helping to get the required number of translators recruited as soon as we can.

. In fact, we admit that there is no clear-cut division of power-sharing between the centre and the Provincial Councils. With the concurrent list being presented, these issues are being addressed. Now, the TNA is not voting against the Government and they are having discussions with the President. We all hope and pray that this will lead us towards achieving a solution in the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment with the

necessary amendments and with the necessary adjustments in order that neither the Provincial Councils nor the Central Government would find it difficult to accept one another.

At this point of time, I should like to remind the Hon. Suresh Premachandran of the national question, and resolving the national question has been a roller-coaster ride up to now. But, now we have arrived at a time and space where possibilities are open up. Let us hope that we can join hands and go towards in achieving a solution without making it difficult either for the Provincial Councils or for the Central Government. He referred to the police powers held by the Government. Almost all the powers envisaged will come to the Provincial Councils. But, there are the trepidations and concerns that the Central Government has regarding some of the powers that need to be devolved.

He also referred to the Parliament itself as a place where we can start the implementation of national languages. I fully endorse what he said. But, he stated the facts wrong. He said that the Public Accounts Committee has no facility of translation. Now, we have a simultaneous translation process put in place. Therefore, he was factually wrong. Then in other Consultative Committees, including the Public Petitions Committee - which I attended today - there is a simultaneous translation being given by an interpreter who sits next to the Tamil Members of Parliament or the Members of Parliament who would not understand Sinhala that is spoken in the deliberations of the Committee. So, these are matters which need to be looked at as an ongoing process. Certainly, we have a long way to go.

[. . 6.06] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs and the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration. Sir, the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs and the Public Service in this country are there to provide a satisfactory service to the people. But, we see that the Tamil-speaking people are not getting a satisfactory service from the Public Service because they are not being serviced in their own language. This issue has become more serious since only 8 per cent of the Public servants speak the Tamil language whereas the percentage of the Tamil-speaking is 25 per cent. Sir, this has to be corrected. For the last six to seven months, we have not had a Department of Official Languages but now we have a whole ministry for national languages. There is the Official Languages Commission under this Ministry, but the Official Languages Commission and Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration cannot do anything unless the Public Service itself is geared and has the knowledge and capacity to serve the public in their languages.

Sir, in 1990, following the Report of the Presidential Commission on Youth, that was set up under Prof. Jayathilake of which the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was also a Member, the then UNP Government under His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa brought in a special Circular, No. 15/90. That was brought in to meet the aspirations of the youth of that day who were frustrated for not receiving Public sector jobs based on their merits. They were able to receive Public sector jobs only through political patronage and this was desisted by the youth of that day. So, the Presidential Commission on Youth recommended that all appointments to the Public Service should be done on a merit, based on competitive exams to be held. Circular No. 15/90, while stipulating that all appointments and promotions be made on a competitive basis, also suggested that appointments be made on ethnic ratio. The reason why the ethnic ratio was brought in was because the educational standards of the different communities at that time were not of an equal status. By bringing only merit, it may favour the more advantaged races who have better access to education and other facilities. Circular No. 15/90 stated that all recruitments must be on competitive exams and the appointments should be proportionate to the different communities in the country. This was a very positive and affirmative action to support the communities who were not properly represented in the Public Service. Hence, this was welcomed by all communities because it was fair by everyone. However, in 1995, a Tamil officer in the Customs service, who did not receive his promotion went before the Supreme Court and said that he was treated in

an unequal manner violating his fundamental rights. Thus, the Supreme Court held that promotions should not be made based on Circular No: 15/90 because it discriminated against the races. At that time, the Government did not put forward the argument of affirmative action which this circular was really based on. The Supreme Court, going on the basis of the raw law, stated that it was unequal treatment on this particular officer and it stopped, not recruitment but only promotions, based on ethnic ratio. [Interruption.] Yes, but equality, subject to affirmative action can be different. Though the Supreme Court ruled only on promotions, the Government of the day in 1995 took advantage of this ruling to even stop recruitment on ethnic ratio. If this had continued from 1990, now after 20 years' time, the ratio of the minority Tamil-speaking people in the Public Service would have been improved, not to the 25 per cent that is desirable but at least to 15 or 20 per cent. Then, there would have been a sufficient number of officers in the Public Service who know the Tamil language and could have served the Tamil public in their own language. It is unfortunate that this did not take place.

Hence, we are even today having the need for a special Ministry of Official Languages to attend to this issue. The Ministry of Official Languages should not only confine itself to teach spoken English to a few officers to get a certificate, which enables them to get an additional increment or two. [Interruption.] Yes, you should move towards that. But, practically it has not happened yet. These officers are being taught - I happened to see the books and the notes of a public officer who attended one of these courses and sat the examination. The quality of that teaching, the level of teaching, is not sufficient for them to deal with the public in their language. Just because they get one increment, they somehow manage to sit that paper, get pass marks and get their increments and thereafter, they do not bother to practice the language and be of service to the people.

Hence, I suggest that you go back to Circular No. 15/90, so that you can be fair to the Tamil-speaking public, not only in providing services but also providing opportunities in the Public Service. As an interim measure, during the time of the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam when he was Cabinet Minister of Estate Infrastructure, he put forward a Cabinet Paper. He said that until the Public Service is able to serve our people in their language, at least in the plantation areas or in the areas of upcountry, appoint persons who know both Tamil and Sinhala to serve the public by sitting at front desks, so that when a person who does not understand Sinhala comes to an office, this person in the front desk can speak to him in the Tamil language, find out what is required and go with that person to the other officers who do not understand the Tamil language and get them to do the service that is required. Today, there are people in Government offices who are brokers. They charge you money; take you in

697 698

2010 02

and get things done. They will also tell that a particular officer asked for a bribe and they would additionally charge these people. If you had an officer at the front desk who is paid by the Government, that person could provide the necessary service, free of charg,e to the satisfaction of the public. So, the Cabinet approved this.

In 2006, the Hon. C.B. Ratnayake appointed 500 persons. They were all posted to police stations, divisional secretaries' divisions and other public offices. They provided a good service. Recently in 2008, when teacher appointments were made, many of these young people who knew both languages and were providing a service, opted to become teachers and left the service and there are only about 250 serving today. There is provision to appoint a further 2,250 persons according to the Cabinet approval. Immediately you have the authority to appoint 250 persons to fill those vacancies that have arisen. If you do that, you will be doing a great service to the people who need this service in the Tamil language.

Meanwhile in 2003, when the then UNP Government was in place, we made representations to the Government, and the Government wrote to the then Attorney-General, Mr. Kamalasabayson, asking him whether the Government could move the Supreme Court to review the decision made on the basis of the Public Administration Circular No. 15/90 on Mr. Ramuppillai - the Customs Officers case, so that the Government may pursue Circular No. 15/90 as an affirmative action to provide the services in the language and provide opportunities for Tamil youth to join the Public Service. Even today in the Public Service, 92 per cent are Sinhala-speaking, only 8 per cent are Tamil-speaking and they need more opportunities.

However, this Government has recognized the value of this circular. The Government today has instructed the Governor of the North and East Provinces to recruit to the Eastern Province alone, based on this Circular 15/90, on an ethnic ratio because in the Eastern Provincial Council, there are more Tamils proportionately than the Tamil population. So, to correct that situation this circular is being implemented in the Eastern Province alone. This

is very unfair. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Member, your time is up.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, please give me one more minute. I am just finishing. So, I request that this circular be applied across the country and if the Government can do it in the Eastern Province, why not make it applicable to the rest the country? This is what I wish to state.

Sir, I want one more minute because I have to speak on the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils. Sir, there is the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, No. 15, of 1987. Under this Act, you cannot do any development work in a private property and the estate lands are recognized as private properties, which is not true. They are owned by the Government. They are managed by private companies and the people living there are voters of Pradesiya Sabha elections. If they are entitled to vote, they should also be entitled to the services of the Pradeshiya Sabha, otherwise it is unfair. So, one thing you can do is to amend the law - the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act - to permit services inside the estates or get the Land Reform Commission to declare the lands where the people are living inside an estate, as townships or villages, so that they come within the purview of the Pradeshiya Sabha. Having Pradeshiya Sabha elections and getting people from the plantations to elect them is of no value if they cannot serve the people who are living inside the plantations. I request the Hon. Minister to pay attention to this matter and do the needful.

Thank you. [. . 6.23] ( )

2010 02

That this Parliament moves that arrangements be made by the Ministry of Higher Education to create a system of Universities suitable for creating an intelligent future generation through the expansion of the field of Higher Education and contributing immensely to the progress and prosperity of this country and for making available to our students the progress in higher education achieved by the other countries of the Asian Continent.

I will table*, to be included in Hansard, the Sinhala and Tamil versions of my Motion, which are short, to save time.

Sir, the establishment of non-State universities in Sri Lanka can positively contribute towards its development. We should take an example from our close neighbours such as Malaysia, Singapore, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, South Korea, Japan and even Australia. Every year, valuable foreign exchange is being expended to educate children at tertiary level in foreign universities in these countries, let alone the UK and the USA. If non-State universities are established in this Isle, not only will our children enter them but also, they will attract foreign students especially from neighbouring countries such as several former States of Russia like Azerbaijan, Turkistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia, Armenia and even from China, Burma, Vietnam and countries in the SAARC region, which will bring in valuable foreign exchange that is needed so much over here.

I know the Government has taken a firm stand in this regard. It had always been a negative step that had been followed earlier, I should say. People who are famous for destruction and not for construction, did not want to have universities of this nature, because they do not want to see a progressive Sri Lanka that opens its vistas to the world. As the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake is in UK today - actually I wanted to take up this Motion earlier when he was here - his worthy lieutenant, the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayake will reply. So, what happened was, it was a negative policy that was adopted government after government. We could not go with the progressive ideal of establishing these universities much earlier. But, there was always opposition. So, this matter is long overdue which has been postponed by successive governments owing to the retrogressive and disastrous politics of the JVP elements, in particular, in contrast with the "Mahinda Chintana" concept of building, constructing and developing. That is the difference. The Government should steamroll over any and all impediments created by forces opposing the establishment of non-State universities in Sri Lanka. It is a dire need today to ensure that we develop highly educated students at tertiary level to meet the higher level challenges ahead outlined in the "Mahinda Chintana" keeping pace with other progressive nations.

We used to meet several people whose children are being educated in other countries. Even a country like Bangladesh has advanced to such an extent that our students are sent there. Our students are studying in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and in several other countries as well. Earlier, Sir, our students were sent to the Lumumba University in Russia. I can remember during the time of the Hon. A.C.S. Hameed, doctors were sent to Cuba and they got their degrees from the university in that country. I know one or two cases. There was a girl called Riyaza in Oddamavadi, a remote village in the Eastern Province. She has gone abroad, educated herself, returned here as a doctor, married a doctor and doing well.

Then, Sir, I met a team of Malaysians recently in Colombo led by Mr. Ja'afer Sultan, a well-known academician. This team comprised of some capable, intelligent students from Sri Lanka, obtaining higher education in Malaysia. There was Nazeefa Fowzer Farook, then, Fathima Sarah Niyas and Zainab; then, Sundoos from Uganda and more importantly, Begum Hameeda Nachchiyar Banu, who claims descency from the Mogul Royal Dynasty. They were all in this intellectual team. This team was taken around the City by two enthusiastic persons, Rishad and Jeham Hamid, to see and enjoy the Wonder of Asia - the beauty of this resplendent Isle They had a lengthy interaction with Mr. Feroze Sameer Effendi - whose family was decorated by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire - a brilliant writer of repute who wields his pen to portray the richness of arts, culture and classics in this country, sometimes exposing the criminal tendencies in the human breast like the Ossie Corea episode. After discussion and going around, the team had expressed the opinion that the climate in Sri lanka is very opportune - ripe - to set up private and foreign universities in Sri Lanka. Then, Sir, there is an appeal for -

- this is what the upcountry estate population needs.

We can have even an international private university in Jaffna, Batticaloa, perhaps in Trincomalee or in the South East - somewhere like Oluvil. We must not trifle away our foreign exchange to the foreign countries by sending our students. I know a girl from Maligawatta named Anjana. She went to Bangladesh, graduated as a doctor, came here and married a doctor. If these students remained here to get higher education, how much of foreign exchange could be saved? Not only the foreigners I told you, but also our Minister used to say " " . ' ' ? ! There are certain countries like India which banned student repatriates from going to certain foreign countries. As I told you earlier, students from countries like Burma, Vietnam, Korea can come to Sri Lanka. They will bring along with them the much needed foreign exchange to our country. This is a progressive step taken under the direction and guidance by the Mahinda Chintana concept.

Therefore, Sir, regulating non-state universities by the Minister of Higher Education is in order, but, at the same time attempts should be made to upgrade and improve the standards and conditions of the existing State universities too. We are not neglecting them. The existing universities will not suffer. Our educational institutions will not suffer; we must strive to bring them to some appreciable extent on par with the private universities. Sir, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has appointed the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake as the Minister of Higher Education for the second time. He is bold, he is courageous, he is progressive, he is intelligent, he is daring and he goes ahead facing any challenge. Sir, when he went to the North, Trincomalee and to the universities in Batticaloa and Oluvil, I accompanied him. He is not frightened of any threat from any source. He goes forward in doing what is right for the country and for the future welfare of education, towards building a nation of intellectuals and men of knowledge. He does not flinch an inch.

He has got an able lieutenant from Matale Aluvihare - a historic place - the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayake, Deputy Minister of Higher Education and also an able and eminent Secretary, Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawaratne.

The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education is a man of foresight. He is non-communal. When he spoke in Jaffna, he spoke as a "Jaffnese". Everybody began to like him. When he spoke in Batticaloa, he spoke like a Batticaline, if may I term it that way. He is like that. He captured the hearts of the people of the North and the East.

Therefore, Sir, I commend this Motion, and very soon we will see in wonder Sri Lanka, a wonderful system of

higher education marshalled through the universities of this country, capably handled and directed by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Thank you, Sir. * : : Motion tabled:

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha to second the Motion.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am grateful for giving me an opportunity to second this very timely Motion. It deals with the subject of University Education and I believe it expresses principles that no one in this House can disagree with. We have had an excellent system of basic education in this country, but over the last few decades we have fallen back sadly in the field of tertiary education and training - the numbers obtaining such training are comparatively small and the quality of those who obtain degrees, has in some cases, contributed to under-employment, with the Government having to create jobs for many of them.

The problem lies, Sir, in us continuing with an outdated model of education, based on the British one, when the British too have long changed course. We have failed to understand the need to diversify courses, which for instance Harvard University did a century ago, when it realized that American schools were not delivering students with a similar range of knowledge that the elite British system did. This was the origin of Core-courses and, as recently as a decade or two back, Harvard University revised their Core-courses, to ensure that students also obtained what we now call, soft skills and competencies. Communication capacity, critical thinking, multicultural awareness and cooperation were

757 758

[ ... ]

2010 02

also inculcated in students. We tried to do this and some of our universities have done well, but many have failed to move sufficiently, secure in the knowledge that they will continue to be funded, whatever the quality of the graduates they produce.

We have done little to promote excellence and diversity, which are both essential if our youngsters are to take advantage of the opportunities being opened up so rapidly by the development policies of the Government. The proof of this is that once again the Government has had, in the Budget, to announce special provisions to absorb more graduates into the Public sector. On this occasion, however, I hope that employment will be on probation, with clear targets that graduates should aim at to develop the additional skills that they might be lacking in at present. Their potential cannot be questioned, given the tough competition they went through to get into university - but the absence of competition after that led to them not developing themselves as thoroughly as their potential warranted.

We must therefore, Sir, hasten on the path the Hon. Minister of Higher Education has sketched out. Without changing the principle of free education for those who qualify, we must also open up educational opportunities for others, and keep within this country much of the talent that now goes away because of the lack of facilities here. We must also encourage cross-disciplinary courses that will develop flexibility and initiative. Indeed, we should encourage higher education also for those who follow vocational courses. We made a start on this with the introduction of degree courses for people who are following technical training, but this should be developed further with the addition of soft skills that will enhance the earning opportunity of many of those who contribute to the national economy while working abroad.

Indeed, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my one objection to this Motion is that it does not go far enough. It should also have referred to the reforms being developed by the Hon. Minister of Education. There too, we should be thinking of opening up other areas for building up of institutions to promote excellence. For instance, when we complain of the paucity of English, Maths and Science teachers, a paucity that adversely affects our rural students, we are told that these shortages are inevitable but there are no mechanisms to increase numbers. We should, therefore, think of encouraging alternative institutes of teacher training, provided their products are subject to testing and validation in accordance with State norms.

This should be encouraged also with regard to the production of textbooks. It is all very well to claim, each year that textbooks are found wanting, that in the future we will do better. As the great Economist Hayek pointed out, the problem with the State monopoly is that there are no defences against its ill-effects. On the contrary, instead of having just one institution producing and evaluating, the State should concentrate on monitoring,

and allow a diversity of production, which will promote excellence.

In fact, Sir, we should encourage the Vice-Chancellors of our universities to outline the reasons for difficulties they have with students and recommend remedies within the education system so that our very bright young people who go through the system of education now and get through their O/Levels and A/Levels, will also have the additional skills that will help them to cope, both with advanced excellent university education and also the requirements of the modern world.

In this respect, we must congratulate His Excellency the President for appointing Senior Ministers to coordinate work in particular areas. As the Hon. Ministers of Higher Education and of Youth Affairs told us in a Consultative Committee, all Ministers concerned with education and training would meet regularly with the Senior Minister of Human Resources Development, to coordinate their efforts. I trust this will also include the Minister in charge of Public Service training, for we need to ensure high level training there to equip administrators with the skills that will enable them to deal on equal terms with their counterparts in other countries.

We have the capacity, Sir, to develop further and with enhanced cooperation between the Ministries, as this new Cabinet envisages, we will be able to move further. Sir, I am very happy to second this Motion and I hope we will move forward in the way outlined.

Thank you. ( )
