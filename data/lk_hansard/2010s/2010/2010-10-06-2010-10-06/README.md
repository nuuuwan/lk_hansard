( )(The Hon. Noordeen Mashoor) Hon.

According to the Answer, if both partners are from internally dispalced families, you are giving Rs. 25,000. But, last year they gave such a couple only Rs. 12,500 at marriage. How has this happened?

( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) If one partner is from an internally displaced family, we give him or her Rs. 12,500 and if both partners are from internally displaced families we give them Rs. 25,000. ( )(The Hon. Noordeen Mashoor) But, last year they have given only Rs. 12,500 for such a couple. ( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) Hon. Member, let me know the details. All the lists are tabled.

The Government is trying to have an ambitious plan on tourism and I guess that is the correct thing. Peace dividend is obviously related to foreign business interactions and one of the prime benefits of that is tourism. Being an island nation, obviously we have to get the tourists coming here either by air or by ship. There is no other source. So, travel by air is obvious. But, Mr. Speaker, this Civil Aviation Bill that has been presented is not a fully comprehensive Bill. It is a Bill that has been presented just to satisfy certain officials who are supposed to do audit check. If that is the reason why bills are presented in Parliament, we look stupid in approving them and allowing such things to get through because the people who come here will obviously know that it is not done with zeal or conviction but for the sake of getting

215 216

the international wizkids legalized. So, Sir, I am sure, you being a keen person in this field, will take the necessary liberty to call upon and ask what happened then, what is happening now, and how we have got to go forward.

Let me take this opportunity to mention about the tourism growth factor. I think they are targeting 2.5 million tourists by 2013 and 5 million tourists in the next couple of years. First of all, has there been a discussion with the airline or the Board of Airline Representatives - the BAR, as they call it - and have they given any concurrent approval to such a thing? SriLankan Airlines is there. Then, you have Mihin Air that is being floated around losing heavily and you have the other airlines that basically support this. The majority of them, at this particular moment, have addressed that the information put into the Bill does not help them to provide the service that is expected of them in Sri Lanka. First, is the competitiveness. Just because you have got a Civil Aviation Bill, that does not mean that airlines will come in here. There must be a competitive edge. There must be certain safeguards. I do not mean to take it as a political point. But, what has happened to Gen. Sarath Fonseka who is also a Member of Parliament? Sir, look at Clause 92(2), if by chance a foreign airline assumes on a pet destination but the Government wants the industry to have a growth factor which is not conducive to the Government, this authority can call in those people and ensure that they be liable to a fine as well as a jail sentence, which will basically impact on decision-making of foreign airlines in this country. The reason for putting these type of things are obnoxious. There is a law and let the law take its place. But, bringing this into a bill and trying to impose it at this particular moment does not help to make a conducive climate. This is against the backdrop of what went on Gen. Sarath Fonseka. He was held before a court martial and was stalled on a thing that there was no involvement. The court martial says so. That is why I am referring to Clause 92(2) because the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was also there at the Consultative Committee yesterday. I am just trying to draw attention to say that these type of things are not healthy.

Next, what I would like to point out is, the country is obviously on an export promotional drive. That means, you need to have tourists on one side and you need to export the goods from Sri Lanka, on the other. When you talk about the cargo that comes in, it can be textile, footwear, fruits, flowers and so on. But, this particular Civil Aviation Bill does not cover any of those things. They do not cover the areas which have a growth factor. That is why I say that this is a sub-optimized Civil Aviation Bill. Sir, I mentioned the same thing one year ago when you were at the Consultative Committee. So, please ensure that the industries call and open it out. We legislate laws for the benefit of the industry but not for the benefit of the Government. The Government has to have

its policies in the process. So, I would say that there needs to be an interaction between the industry and the relevant authorities led by the Ministry. We have fruits and flowers in the country grown in abundance and the cost is relatively competitive in Sri Lanka. But, when you add the air freight component, it is uncompetitive. That is where the Government policy needs to be created. The Government policy needs to go through the Civil Aviation Bill. But, this does not touch any of those. That is why I say this Bill is sub-optimized. There is only one aspect of it. Last time, the officials did tell us that this is in relation to certain requirements only which are there for international obligation. That is precisely what I am trying to say. In that case, it does not cover the entire industry by itself. Now, if you look at the Civil Aviation Bill of Thailand which has capitalized on the ability of trying to market their destination as a tourist destination, I guess that is a country that you must emulate. Singapore sometimes has gone a little overboard but those are the countries that we must follow. Hong Kong is another standing example. Even though there is no legislation in Maldives, the implementation process is so great that today they have more tourists in that small country than we, in Sri Lanka. So, Hon. Minister, let us ensure that we take this from a completely different point of view.

Then, the other is the consumer aspect of it. The passengers are, I am sure, whom the Government wanted to protect at one time. Obviously, it is so because this is a Government that talks of the consumer even though they do not look after the consumer. But, there is no relevance if the Airlines get together and cartelize themselves and charge rates that are exorbitant. Today, rates in Sri Lanka - I am sure the Sri Lankan Airlines will agree - are absolutely exorbitant. It is cheaper buying tickets out of Singapore; its cheaper buying tickets out of India which was much higher earlier; sometimes it is cheaper buying out of Dubai than buying out of Sri Lanka. So, then, what is the purpose? The captive market is from Sri Lanka and when you try to take undue advantage here, it does not take too long for the passengers to buy tickets from outside and get it transferred in here. You cannot stop that. So, these are the matters that need to be looked into and has not been addressed.

Now, for example, a popular destination to Europe is London. A ticket on Economy Class costs roughly Rs. 105,000 from Qatar Airways, Rs. 110,000 from Air Lanka, Rs. 85,000 from Gulf Air and from Kuwait Airways maybe Rs. 65,000. But, the majority is Rs.105,000. Business Class is Rs. 208,000 to Rs. 408,000. Now, you can buy the same thing out of Dubai; you can buy the same thing out of India for almost Rs. 65,000 to Rs. 70,000. Look at Maldives. It does not take 55 minutes. Before you fasten your seat belts, you can land at the destination. Basically, you have to pay a cost of around Rs. 30,000 per ticket. But, you can go to Thailand at Rs. 20,000 because there is competition in

217 218

2010 06

that area. So, basically you do not have any rationality in doing such a thing. Now, this is why in 1995 - I guess Hon. Speaker, you were in the House - I opposed the privatization of the AirLanka in the way it was done. I told them it was a calamity, it is a great negligence and corruption that is taking place and at the end of the day you get Air Lanka in a much more worse situation than what it was. It was nobody else out of the persons who challenged, but my Friend, the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle who said Yes, we have made a mistake. So, I think especially in a driven knowledge-oriented area, there must be much bigger interaction between the industry and the relevant people, not just for the sake of legislating but for international obligation.

So, where is the Consumer Affairs Authority that could be linked to civil aviation in order to protect the consumer? This is obviously the area that has to be looked at.

Even though we may be having different policies, I must appreciate that the President himself was astounded as to why it was not there. Even the officials were unable to respond to certain questions that were posed. Now, the next one that would come in, is the areas that come under Clause 92. I will take it a little further. Hon. Speaker, the Civil Aviation Authority is one of the authorities that are supposed to be protecting civil aviation in the country. I will read from the Performance Report 2009 of the Ministry of Ports and Aviation and in that they say that their vision is to be a prime catalyst to the growth of the National Economy. Then, there are policies and objectives. In page 122, it states, I quote: " Policies & Objectives

a. Achieve or exceed safety outcome target

b. Be appropriately resourced

c. Be professional and competent

d. Attain wide credibility and recognition

e. Sustain its achievements, and

f. Be a strong facilitator for planning and development of civil aviation"

Hon. Speaker, it was an institution that was under your purview. Would you tell us, that out of the six or seven policies and objectives that are there, have they been able to provide the necessary strategy to any of these? "No" is the answer. So, then, what is the purpose of having these in Statute books or in their Corporate Plans if they are not implementing them? That is why there is a degradation. As we say this from Opposition, you look as if we are trying to ridicule this. Obviously, if it is inefficiency, incompetence and corruption, we are going to tell it. We are not here to prop up the Government. We are here to prop up the country and in the process to wake up the sleeping Government and tell them that there is a reality and check that this needs to be done. I am sure the young Deputy Minister will be made a Minister before too long and then will be able to respond to some of

these questions. But, the policies and objectives have not been achieved. If I go further, the key functions are, I quote:

Communicating with the Minister

Setting policies and goals in the field of civil aviation ..

Those are things of course I must say are happening because it has got to happen. Where the credit is due I need to give that but those things are not the most important things. It must be industry-driven.

Now, Sir, the next important institution is the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited which is the one that provides the services. There again, there is a monopoly. It may be having different intentions and expectations but the Government says they want to do it themselves. Well and good! But, there must be a sense of competition so that you can expect the best of services. If it is just the Government's monopoly and you give them the right to operate, you only bring absolute lethargy into the system. Then, what you can do out of Rs.100, you will not be able to get it done out of even Rs. 1,000. That is what needs to be done. I am sure even some of the Sri Lankan officials will agree that competition is the best way to ensure that the best of services come out. In the same Performance Report that I referred to, the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited states that their vision is, "To be the friendliest and best airport service provider in the Asia Region". Then, you look at the objectives. In page 126, it states, I quote:

" a. To increase passenger numbers to 8 million by 2013.

b. Make BIA a passenger Transit Hub of Asia Region by 2013".

Are these just put for the sake of adding on objectives or is it practically obtainable?

"c. To achieve a 40% Transit cargo out of total Aviation cargo of 600,000 MT by 2013.

d. To become the regional aviation training Centre.

e. Be the leader in airport services in the SAARC Region by 2013.

f. Minimize contribution towards aircraft incidents in 2013.

g. Manage all civil airports in Sri Lanka.

h. To provide an efficient and effective security service, to ensure the safety of international civil aviation as specified in ICAO document 8973".

They are trying to bring in a sub-aspect of that.

"i. Pursue service, value and operational excellence in corporation with all airport partners.

j. Maximization of Stakeholders value."

It has not even spoken of the stakeholders. The stakeholder would be the consumer. The stakeholder would be in the Airlines, the Board of Airline Representatives. The stakeholder would be in the cargo agents. None of them are brought into the system. Now, without that, what is the purpose of getting these type of things?

219 220

I am only mentioning this for the simple reason that while there is a great expectation on what to do, that does not match with practical, implementable proposition. For example, you take the Mattala International Airport which is coming as the second international airport in the country. Both Hambantota, where Mattala International Airport is coming up and Katunayake, where the Bandaranaike International Airport is located have the same weather pattern. But, nobody has told the Government about that; they do not have the courage of conviction to say that. So, if there is a weather problem, whether it is in Katunayake or Mattala, one airport will not be able to help the other. That is the reason why there should have been a much closer study. I am sure the Hon. Dayasritha Thissera as the Deputy Minister may have gone through this. For political reasons, you would have got to do that, but there should be a national policy on these matters. The then United National Party Government was looking at Moneragala because the weather patterns of the two locations are different. If you have a problem at Katunayake and if you ask the IATA, I am sure they will say that the next point of landing would be Chennai or Male and not Mattala. So, I would greatly appreciate if you look into that. I may be subject to correction because things get changed dramatically. But, professionals who are not political in nature say that there is a colossal duplication of capital investment.

I am going through the Performance Report 2009 published by the Ministry of Ports and Aviation. It states that there was a Rs. 24 billion investment in 2009. By the time you have the real investment, it will be about Rs. 30 billion. Of that, they say US Dollars 209 million is coming from China as the initial cost. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena answered me when I asked a Question about the aid that had been given by China to Sri Lanka. If you take this amount at 8 per cent interest rate, at the end of the day you will have to pay - I am not talking about the capital cost because you need to invest capital expenditure - an interest cost of Rs. 3.5 billion a year. Now, to pay such a large sum of money as interest, you will have to have a lot of passengers going through that airport; you will have to have billions of tons of cargo going through the cargo villages. Without that, you are going to pay Rs. 3.5 billion as interest. I am not talking about the total Rs. 24 billion investment, I am talking about the US Dollars 209 million initial cost coming from China. So, can we afford it? That is why I am saying that this Civil Aviation Bill should have been looked at in a completely deep-oriented way. Certainly, it is the right thing to be done; you have got to do that.

Sir, at this moment I would like to say this for record. When AirLanka was to be privatized, we told them not to do it that way. It was the same Government that accepted and said, Yes, we did it wrong" and it was the same Government that took it back. Today we are in the same unable, ill-capitalized position. You have Mihin

Air and SriLankan Airlines. What is the purpose of having two airlines if both are losing? Now, that I am on the subject, let me take Mihin Air as an example. We should have a national airline, there is no question about it, but how we run it may be in two different ways. Efficiency, competitiveness and good rates to the passengers are essential components, but just because you have Mihin Air, it does not mean that that gives better service to the people.

Hon. Speaker, I am now reading from page 133 of the Performance Report 2009 published by the Ministry of Ports and Aviation which had come under your purview. There, it is stated that the overall load factor of the Mihin Air is maintained at 75 per cent; more than 100,000 passengers have flown with Mihin Air during 2009.

Now you go to page 134. There, they have spoken about profit and loss. The loss is US Dollars 8,095,147. Hon. Speaker, if you take that in Sri Lankan Rupee terms, the loss is Rs. 930 million. You say 100,000 people have flown and if you divide that loss of Rs. 930 million by 100,000 people, then each passenger who has flown with Mihin Air has cost the Government Rs. 10,000 loss. So, what is the purpose of charging Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000 by Mihin Air to go to Dubai if you have lost Rs. 10,000 by flying? What is the logic behind that? I stated this on the Floor of this House. It was not political, it was national. I have a knowledge on this area because we have been commercially involved in this and that is the reason why I passionately want to take it up. After all, this is our national economy, this is not a SLFP economy or a UNP economy. I am just taking the accounts of Mihin Air from this Report. According to that, 100,000 people have flown and there is a Rs. 930 million loss. If you divide 100,000 people by Rs. 930 million, each passenger who has flown has cost a loss of Rs. 9,500. So, if you tell them, "We will give you Rs. 9,500 and you fly SriLankan Airlines", then SriLankan Airlines would have got Rs. 939 million more. I am sure they would have been happy. Today, they are trying to buy an aircraft. What nonsense is this? I can see the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena here and I would like to remind about the introduction he gave when I appeared on "Derana TV" about three years ago. " . . " . , , 930 . . . -

" " . . , . . . " " " " . - I would like to mention, Sir, that Clause 92 basically states the manner it has got to be operative in regard to holders of airline licences and foreign airline owners. I quote Clause 92 (1)(a), (b) and (c), which states:

92. (1) (a) charging fares and rates on any particular routes which are, in the aggregate, insufficient to cover the cost of providing the services to which they relate;

(b) the addition of excessive capacity or frequency of service;

(c) the practices in question are of a permanent nature rather than temporary;"

All these are just theoretical. Nothing relevant is there in order to bring the industry together and get what is required out of that. Then, the conviction that I mentioned about could take place. These are obnoxious. These are things that have got to be looked at.

225 226

2010 06

Yesterday, ? 1950 . . 1950, 1948, 1930 . 1950 ? . . , Consultative Committee .

Then, Clause 92 gets overridden when you read Clause 121. ? 121 , , . Clause 121 states, I quote:

121 The Minister in charge of the subject of Finance may in consultation with the Minister, make regulations for and in respect of all or any of the following matters:-

(a) the sale of passenger tickets for travel by aircraft and the booking of passage for travel by aircraft;

(b) the collection of freight charges by on exports aircraft;

(c) the collection of freight charges on imports by aircraft, where contract for such carriage of freight is made in Sri Lanka;"

The benefit that is intended to get accrued through Clause 92 is completely offloaded by Clause 121 because you have got obnoxious clauses coming back, where you have one Minister going into the next Ministers activity. In a country, where we are looking at a delegating authority and decentralizing functions, you do not need to centralize it back again to the Minister of Finance. If so, you do not need a Minister of Aviation. These are things that need to be done. I appreciate that the Consultative Committee on Ports and Aviation was held yesterday but I am sure the President himself was stunned with disbelief that the officials were unable to comprehend certain questions that were posed to them. I am sure the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena who was there was basically trying to defend but at the end of the day, he saw that there were certain realities.

Likewise, Clause 94 has another area which I highlighted because Clause 94 brings in the Computer Reservation System. This is certainly an area that has got to be looked at. But, I do not understand the overemphasis to have such a computer system, to have a licence which is operated every year. That is for nothing else but for the officials who play around. If it is an open system and if you accept the cargo system reservations or passenger system reservations, then you can give a licence that will be good enough to operate. But, if you say it is for one year, the huge capital cost that is going to be put, needs to be amortized in one year. Then, your cost per unit goes up. So, if you give it for five years, then you amortize it over five years. That was not understood by the officials and I am sure that was not something to be retained by the Government but it was only to give the competitive edge for the passengers who are there. This happened when Air Lanka was privatized. They made it "SriLankan".

They changed the passenger computer system and gave the Emirates system. They brought in a huge capital and that is what they showed as capital infusion which was brought into the airline. Today, you are going to change all that.

Sir, Clause 94(3) states, I quote:

A permit issued under subsection (1) shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of its issue and may be renewed at the end of that period on application made in that behalf and on the payment of the prescribed renewal fee.

Hon. Minister, I am sure you would take up these matters in the Cabinet. If you do not want anybody else to come in, it is well and good but ensure that there is a sense of competitiveness which finally gives the benefit to the consumer.

Look at Clause 94. I think the officials gave a response which was acceptable at the Consultative Committee, and I appreciate that. That needs to be spelt out in this. Now, e-ticketing is very common and you do not have a ticket that is bought. You just get a piece of paper that comes out. So, that is the paperless system that we are going into. If that is going to be the computer system in future, and if this piece of obnoxious law that has been brought in stops that, then where are you going to go? Are you going to tell -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is the practice followed. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) For God's sake, please listen, Hon. Member. Hon. Speaker, I would like to see Members who are responsive in listening. They jump like a jack-in-the-box not knowing what I have been explaining to a Minister who was there yesterday. [Interruption.] What I am telling is universal. Then, your laws should be universal in nature, not only a subsection which is applicable in Colombo. So, on that basis, you must ensure that e-ticketing is also gazetted and legislated so that it will be part and parcel of this.

Sir, then the next matter is, ensure that we basically have a shipping fund. It was started about five or six years ago, if I am not wrong, or maybe seven or eight years ago. Today, we do not know what has happened to the shipping fund. In Clause 113, you have basically said that you are going to start a Civil Aviation Development Fund. Clause 113 (1) states, I quote:

There shall be established a Fund called the Civil Aviation Development Fund, which shall consist of all monies credited to such Fund by the Director General under Section 104 and Section 114 of this Act.

Now, when I mentioned it, the Hon. Minister was there and what did the President say? Why do we need to have these funds under the Director-General? Now, that is precisely what I am saying. If you have a Government policy, you do not need to have a fund which is at the beck and call of some Director-General. What is he developing? He is going to develop and provide civil aviation infrastructure in the country. That is none of his business. That is part of his action but he does not need to use the Civil Aviation Development Fund to do that. Then, Sir, Clause 113 (b) states, I quote:

"developing human resources needed for the provision of an efficient and safe aeronautical service within the country in accordance with the standards required under the Convention ;"

So, you do not need to use the Civil Aviation Development Fund. That is why the President told you to ensure that these funds come under one corporate fund or one compounded fund.

Sir, Clause 113 (c) states, I quote:

"any other function or activity which the Authority considers necessary to further the development of the civil aviation industry in the country."

I guess that is the only acceptable fact because if certain things are not accepted, then how can this fund be looked at? But, invariably this civil aviation funds are there in order to develop the industry per se. But, here what you are trying to do is infrastructure development. That has no relevance at all. That is Government policy. If the Government wants to have 10 airports, you do need not to have the Civil Aviation Development Fund to do that. Even if you have a fund, you will never be able to complete the capital expenditure through this fund. So, what is the purpose of having it at somebodys beck and call. Instead of two vehicles he will use three vehicles and he will say that it was used for Civil Aviation Development Fund activity. So, Hon. Speaker, I wanted these matters to be further highlighted for these reasons. Now, I am happy that at least it has gone into a Standing Committee, which I proposed, instead of going to the Consultative Committee where it will be the same old thing that will be going on. Therefore, we can rectify ourselves.

Then, I must appreciate and I was also happy with certain things that were brought up by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa under Section 88, which I thought was relevant. But, the issue that was there under Section 88 (3) that they should ensure that once a Government asset is bestowed on to a company through this basis that is spelt out, there should not be subletting anymore. Clause 88 (3) (c), states, I quote:

grant a lease of any such property to any other person, without the prior written approval of the Authority.

So, instead of that, you coulc say "no subletting" and that solves the problem. So, these are matters that need to be done and I am sure it had immediate reaction yesterday.

Hon. Speaker, all I could basically say is that we have taken all this time on a matter that officials should be resolving. If they consulted the industry - I do not say that we know it all. We also know only the hands-on experience of the relevant areas that we are dealing with. You have to develop the cargo area. The Hon. Arundika Fernando, Member of Parliament, contributed yesterday in this regard. We have got to develop in order to ensure that the industry is driven. Today, the industrialists say that they have never been consulted in this area.

Furthermore, under the salient legal provision of the draft Civil Aviation Bill which they have given as an attachment to us in order to enhance some knowledge, it states:

Safeguarding airlines is against unfair state practices.

Now, this very Government that is talking of protecting the consumer does not have any reference to that. That is what I mentioned yesterday. Now, in general, your hobby-horse was hammering the UNP, saying that we are for the businessmen. We are for the people. They are the ones who keep the thing going on. Our difference is that when you have a lot of consumers who have money, then you can get the business running. But, this Government feels that if you have the business, money will come in. No, it will not. That is what is happening now. Where is the cash? It is absolutely cash-strapped these days. You have businesses that are there. They are talking but nothing is moving because money does not come in. It only revolves round two to three per cent of the society. That is the difference.

So, Hon. Speaker, all I could basically say is that I touched on the areas of consumer affairs. Then, the other one is that you have lots of aircraft. I want to be a little political. There are many aircraft lined there at the airport. union , aircraft . . . aircraft . ? airport . aircraft "K" . "P" . KP . .

So, what are all these people who are saying that they have got to be licensed doing? Ensure that these aircraft are properly licensed. They are mushrooming and coming up all over not knowing that there are companies utilizing funds and basically buying aircraft instead of being commercially able. There are certain companies absolutely trying to develop the industry. I must say that there are some young talented teams that are there. This

country can basically make itself as the cargo hub for the Indian subcontinent. That is for sure. Even though we might not be able to make it for the passengers, our geographical location helps us. The port is well located. The country is well located. But, owing to the mismanagement and misdirection of the policies of the Government, we have not been able to do so. These are the areas that we should have been looking at when privatizing SriLankan Airlines. These were the things that should have been looked at. We looked at the correct partner but not the correct policy. That was the problem. Now, we have an aviation policy that should have been put in place 10 years ago. So, we are beginning today what should have been done 10 years ago. The laws that should be enacted in 2010, is not even being looked at.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Are you talking for this Bill or against this Bill? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you cannot understand what I say, probably in the Debate we can listen and see who knows what the industry is.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is what I am asking, are you talking for this Bill or against this Bill? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa - Minister of Environment) You can take only one stand. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you have not understood, you can take it from the debate that is there. I am sure the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena could understand and even the President understood in one hour what we basically said. I do not need to relate to a backbencher Member of Parliament, who basically goes carrying bags for the President where ever he goes. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Do not forget that you too were a backbencher sometime back. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Where is the Sathosa asset? [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) All I have got to say is that you have been a part and parcel of the economy losing Rs. 900 million in 2009, Rs. 2,500 million in 2008, Rs. 190 million in 2006 and I cannot remember what your loss was in 2007. If all these were put together, you do not need to increase the price of bread. 50 , " " . . . . . . , -

We also have ground handling. I spoke to the decision-makers of the Sri Lankan Airlines today. They themselves like challenges and competition. Hon. Speaker, you mentioned during your term that you would like to ensure that nobody will be able to get a cartelization or a monopoly of a particular thing. But, do not let two Government institutions compete. Ensure that there is a private partnership so that competition takes place. Then, you can download certain capital cost that is there. That should be put to the benefit of the consumer.

The airport does not reflect that the entire system goes well. You need to do something. You can bring down the cost of the ticket by at least 35 per cent. That could be done if a proper policy is there; if competition is there. You have budget airlines, but you must ensure that they are budget airlines. By Air Asia, you are able to go to Thailand at Rs. 7,000. By Thai Airways, you are able to go at Rs. 30,000. By SriLankan Airlines, it will cost Rs. 35,000. That is what a budget airline is. You do not need to have a budget airline that goes to Maldives at Rs. 28,000 when SriLankan Airlines goes at Rs. 31,000. What is the "budget" in that? That is, you are trying to exist as an airline just for the sake of its survival. Those are policy-oriented. Air Asia is not losing money. That is a private company. That is what you should basically have if you want to have Mihin Lanka also in the Sri Lankan aviation industry.

So, Hon. Minister, all we can basically say is, ensure that this is looked at. Ground handling is necessary. Likewise, I think the Hon. Arundika Fernando mentioned about catering. I think the Hon. Sarath Kumara Gunaratne from Gampaha also mentioned about the competitive element that was there. You must have catering that takes place there because these are cash cows. Catering makes

231 232

Rs. 980 million, I think. Ground handling makes Rs. 1.5 billion. If both are put together, the loss of the SriLankan Airlines can be reduced because of the group handling of these two items.

So, these are the things that need to be included in this particular Bill and ensure that those are basically strengthened and fortified, so that you are able to have an industry, which we can proudly say, has legislation to ensure that the industry can go forward. Today, this is one of the biggest problems that is there. You do not know at what moment you have legislative changes coming in. You must have coherent, consistent, crisp and clear policies in place. Then only you can take the Government forward. Just because you pick a UNPer from here who works well in the UNP machinery, do not think that the machine works well at that end. It proves that just because you take a nut, that does not mean that the machine works. The machine is here. That is the difference.

So, Hon. Speaker, I do not want to take much of your time because we agreed that we will try to reduce the time. But, I only hope that we go on record that next time when this is corrected and rectified and when we bring in those amendments, - I am sure you will have to send it to the Attorney-Generals Department and the Department of Legal Draftsman again - we will be able to speak again because we need to ensure that this is perfected and let us bring something on national interest. That is what we, from the Opposition, are saying. Just because we are in the Opposition, it does not mean that all what we recommend should be ridiculed. What we give in is sometimes more essential than just basically approving the Government proposals. So, Sir, we would like to ensure that this is rectified and brought in line with international compliances; we are not standing in that way. But, ensure that it is done so that it stands with the growth of the industry rather than being a roadblock to the development of the industry.

Thank you, Sir. [. . 2.52]

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, air transport is critical to our global society. It represents some eight per cent of the world's GDP and is an economic lifeline for many developing countries like Sri Lanka. So, in order to actively participate in international civil aviation without impediments, it is vital that Sri Lanka shall effectively implement and enforce international standards and recommended practices adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. I am happy to note that the Civil Aviation Bill has laid a good foundation for this purpose.

The International Civil Aviation Organization - ICAO - is a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with the subject of civil aviation. It was created in 1944 to promote the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation throughout the world. The ICAO has 190 Member States to date.

Safety is paramount for the growth of civil aviation as people will place confidence on air transportation if and only safety is guaranteed.

Sri Lanka should also be mindful of the impact of civil aviation on environment. We should align ourselves with the ICAO environment programme for addressing carbon dioxide emissions in aviation. It will not only reduce emissions but also will contribute to fuel efficiency which is the key to reduce the cost of air travel. Also, Sri Lanka should implement the ICAO standards on aircraft noise so that the airports will be much quieter.

Beyond safety, security and environmental sustainability aspects of aviation, great strides have been made globally for improving the efficiency of air transport operations, in technological and operational terms. This in turn will make it possible to further reduce fuel burn, and hence emissions lower the risks associated with accidents and improve customer service. Airlines prefer flying on user defined trajectories for cost saving. Sri Lanka should get ready to implement the Performance-Based Navigation - PBN - giving benefits to the airport users.

The Bill presented before you today does that in order to develop the civil aviation as it gives provision for developing or providing the civil aviation infrastructure and human resources in the country and many other development activities in air transportation.

Most importantly, Sri Lanka, being a signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, is bound to implement the standards given by 18 Annexes to the Convention as the minimum standard in the identified area of aviation. For example, Annex 6 (Operations) describes the minimum standards that require to be met in the operation of aircraft.

This being the primary aviation legislation, it could be said is the foundation of aviation in our motherland. Development in civil aviation would not only make air travel more accessible to the public, but also would increase safety, efficiency, availability, frequency, reliability and lower cost.

Some of the economic benefits anticipated are, developing new aircraft maintenance facilities whereby we would be able to cater to international markets in maintaining a varied range of aircraft and its components and opening of a new civil aviation training centre to provide skilled staff to serve in aviation. That will be needed not only to cater to local civil aviation requirements but also can be used as a good source for earning foreign exchange by sending our youths for employment abroad. There is a good demand in the Middle East for skilled workers in aviation. If we train our youths in such areas and send them there for employment, it will be far better than sending housemaids there.

By giving priority to the youths of the country and harnessing the intellect of the returning aviation experts, we would be able to design and manufacture light aircraft in our country. By doing all this, we would be able to increase the Gross Domestic Product and reduce unemployment rates and improve the international trade. As per the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future", by carrying out the above activities, we would be able to create great enterprises to conquer the world.
