( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, as the custodian of this House, you have to safeguard the rights and privileges of the Members at any moment. Sir, we are bound by the Constitution of Sri Lanka and also the Standing Orders for the conduct of the day-to-day Business of the House. Now, what does the Constitution say? It is very clear. Chapter VIII, Article 42 of the Constitution states, I quote: "The President shall be responsible to Parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers......

[ ]

2010 11 523 524

And it goes on. I do not want to read it because it is not relevant to my argument. Then, Article 43 states, I quote; "(1) There shall be a Cabinet of Ministers charged with the direction and control of the Government of the Republic, which shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament. (2) The President shall be a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, and shall be the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. (3) The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament who in his opinion is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. Then, Sir, Article 44 is the most relevant article. It states, I quote; "(1) The President shall, from time to time, in consultation with the Prime Minister, where he consideres such consultation to be necessary - (a) determine the number of Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministries and the assignment of subjects and functions to such Ministers; and (b) appoint from among the Members of Parliament, Ministers to be in charge of the Ministries so determined. " (2) The President may assign to himself any subject or function and shall remain in charge of any subject or function not assigned to any Minister under the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article or the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article 45, and may for that purpose determine the number of Ministries to be in his charge, and accordingly, any reference in the Constitution or any written law to the Minister to whom such subject or function is assigned, shall be read and construed as a reference to the President."

Now, it is very clear, Sir. The President has the power as the Executive to appoint Ministers, assign portfolios and he is the Head of the Cabinet. When there is no minister appointed to any subject, he assigns the responsibility to himself. The Constitution states that very clearly. Now, Sir, he shall appoint Ministers. Then, what does this Motion seek to present to this House? The Motion states, I quote:

":...prevented from holding any Cabinet portfolio..." Sir, if you say that the President should be prevented from holding any portfolios, that contravenes Article 44 and the following articles in the Constitution. [Interruption.] Wait, wait, I will finish. Hon. John Amaratunga, you join your Leader and have the game. Therefore, I would say - [Interruption.] Do not disturb me like that. Therefore, Sir, this Motion itself contravenes the Constitution. What does the Sinhala version state? It is also very clear. I think one should read it ..... You are violating the Constitution. It is a basic fact. It is a very simply thing, Sir. Even a montessori child would know this. But, I do not know whether the Hon. John Amaratunga knows it. quote , . But, I do not want to deviate, Sir. They should not disturb me. Sir, the Tamil translation is very clear for the Tamil media and others. It states:

.

,

..

. . [ ] . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , - . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) All three languages are allowed in the Sri Lanka Parliament unlike the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha still does not allow one to speak in Tamil. But, the Sri Lanka Parliament allows it.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, if you want to bring in an amendment to the Constitution, then as the Hon. Leader of the House correctly pointed out, it should be by way of a Bill, without which we have no power to discuss this in Parliament. You have no power to allow this, Sir. Then, Sir, what does Erskine May state? With regard to a change in the Standing Orders and the conduct of the day-to-day Business of Parliament, the 22nd Edition of Erskine May, in page 366 states, I quote: The House regularly repeals certain of its Standing orders when it has resolved to alter its own procedures, often following a recommendation of a Select Committee I would commend the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to read this. Eskine May, Sir, is the authority on Parliamentary Practice and Procedure in the whole world. Parliaments the world over respect Erskine May. So, Sir, then you have to appoint a Select Committee or you have to follow the normal procedure. Now, Sir, what follows which? Which follows what? Now, you bring in an amendment to the Constitution and it follows that you have to include that in the Standing Orders. We are following the democratic procedure, Sir, as taught to

525 526

us by the British masters at that time and we are still conducting the Business of Parliament according to the Westminster System. Then again, Ekrskine May states, I quote: Such repeals are normally made as part of an order creating a new Standing Order to embody the new procedure. Erskine May says this. What more than that? - [Interruption.] . . . - [Interruption.] No, Sir, there is time. We have to deal once and for all and finish this. Otherwise, they will be moving Motions of this nature always in this House. In some cases Standing Orders are varied for an experimental period to test the working of a new procedure.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

. . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . . . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Therefore Sir,

,

. . Very good, Sir. This Parliament is a unique Parliament. This is the only Parliament in the whole world where Tamil language is spoken. Not even in the Lok Sabha, India. Ms. Kanimozhi, daughter of Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi has said that she will move a Motion in Lok Sabha to seek permission to speak in Tamil. Hon. Vinayagamoorthy and other Tamil Members of this House, I would like to point out to you that this is a unique and the most significant Parliament in the whole world, which allows -Mr. Yogarajan you know it- speeches to be made in all three languages including the ! ,

.

I am simply asking you this question, Sir. I am posing this question to the Opposition also. Now, there are Tamil Members in this House who only understand

Tamil. They are both in this and that side of the House. Now, when a Tamil Member reads "

", that is "prohibit". In English, Sir, the

meaning of " " is, "prohibit from holding portfolios". So, how are they going to place their arguments? This Motion contravenes the basic requirements that are ingrained in the Constitution. Sir, if you allow this today, it will set a very bad example. We cannot allow this because they may move Motions of this nature always contravening the Constitution of this country.

Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to elucidate this matter.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, Standing Order No. 78 has been debated and ruled upon in this House earlier. So, there are precedents to follow. In this House, not merely under a substantive Motion, but, I remember in ordinary debates also, the issue of abolishing the Executive Presidency itself has come up and been debated. No one has objected. When you take the Budget Debate and when you take the Vote on His Excellency the President, it had been customary on many occasions for the Members to debate the whole issue of the abolition of the Executive Presidency, because that is not a matter which can be called "the conduct of a President". The conduct of a President has certain aspects of it but certainly not this. This is a matter of policy in this country. From the day the Executive Presidency was introduced in 1978, whether it should be retained or whether it should be abolished, has been debated. So, there is enough of precedents. If you say this, then how did we appoint a Select Committee in 1994/1995 headed by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the then Minister, - [Interruption.] no, please listen to me - where the Committee recommended that the Executive Presidency be abolished. Now, if you go by this point of Order, that could not have been discussed. In Parliament, on every occasion we have discussed it. You have to distinguish the Executive Presidency and the concept of the Presidency or the Prime Ministership from the holders. We are not discussing anything concerning the conduct of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the President or for that matter, his act or, the previous Presidents. But, all that we are discussing here is whether the Presidency should be there or not. So, I do not think you require a substantive Motion in this instance. But, if you want a substantive Motion, well this is the Motion. This is by Standing Order - [Interruption.] - You can reply to me

[ . . . ]

2010 11 527 528

later. This is a Motion under Standing Order No. 23, and therefore you have the Motion here in this House. So you have both. Then, of course I must thank the Leader of the House for conceding that you do not require a substantive Motion. He says, even under a Constitutional amendment you can just discuss it in Parliament. So, why can you not discuss it here? And, if this Motion is passed by the House, the next step is to appoint a Select Committee to go into it. If it is rejected, you need not proceed or you can ask the Government to bring in legislation to that effect. In this instance, the Member is not even asking for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. He is only asking that we conform to the Executive Presidency like in France, Finland or South Korea, where the President does not hold any Ministry and where the Prime Minister does not hold any Ministry. There are different types of Presidencies. For instance, you have one in South Africa where the President is elected by Parliament. But, that is all. It is a matter of policy. Why it is that we cannot discuss this? Erskine May has no relevance, because Erskine May deals with the royalty. Now, even in this instance, it is not relevant because there is no provision in Erskine May dealing with the Presidency. [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) In the Lok Sabha, even with all the Standing Orders regarding the President, the Presidents imposition of Presidential Rule on different States have been questioned in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha without any Motion. So, then, what are you asking for? What the Hon. Member of the Government wants is that this should be treated like royalty -not even like the British Royalty, like the Thai Royalty- where you cannot mention the royalty. You cannot look at the royalty; if you come before the royalty you have to bow down and stay. I mean we cannot give up the rights of the House. If you make this Ruling, you are only trying to hold that the President is equal to royalty. [Interruption.] You have to agree with me. It is the right of the House to discuss whether to have the Executive Presidency or not. I do not think even the present President wants that situation. There are others who may want it. But, as far as the House is concerned, I ask, what is wrong in saying that the President should be like the President of France or the President of South Korea or the President of Finland? There is nothing wrong in saying that. This has nothing to do with the conduct of the President. The "conduct" is the conduct of the President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. But, here it is not so. These are matters coming from the time of the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, the Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa, the Hon. D.B. Wijetunge, the Hon. (Mrs.)

Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and the present President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) The "Mahinda Chintana" has committed itself to abolish the Executive Presidency. Now, all of a sudden you are saying that you cannot do this. The next step would be for the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake to be taken away in a white van in his white suit. Is this not what you want like all the journalists? I mean, now anyway we have started a debate on the Presidency; we are now debating the Presidency. That is all what we are doing now. Okay, if this is the way of debating, we will debate it. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? .

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) , - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , ? ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Environment ) Hon. Speaker, firstly, I would like to ask whether you can bring in a motion when you are trying to amend a substantive provision of the Constitution? Secondly, the English translation clearly states prevents. How can you prevent the President when the provisions of the Constitution provide for it? This is in the Constitution. There is this inconsistency between the English and the Sinhala versions of the Constitution. Firstly, you cannot amend a substantive provision of the Constitution. You cannot debate it here.

This is only a proposal put before this House to consider as to why we should incorporate the provisions that are referred to in this Motion. It is a matter for discussion, Sir, not that we are going to do anything with the Presidents powers. There is nothing wrong in it. This House must discuss what is best for this country. This is a proposal that has been brought before this House. It can be rejected but we have to discuss it. Our opinion has not been sought when the Cabinet took the decision. That is what we are saying. This is the place where the Opposition can make its ideas known to the Government.

Get the Secretariat to get you all the Debates from 1978 where you can see all the unbroken precedences; study every instance where there is a reference to the Executive Presidency and then give a Ruling.

The "Daily Mirror" of 4th June, 2010, on the front page states, I quote:

The survey on illegal small firearms in Sri Lanka had recommended a apolitically independent commission

The survey recommends appointing an independent commission to go into this matter as most of the problems, most of the terror tactics and most of the underworld elements have originated owing to the fact of unli Censed weapons being used in a gun culture in Sri Lanka.

2010 11 539 540

So, Hon. Speaker, I take the essence of what the Defence Secretary has mentioned and I want to propose to this House together with all the Members of this august Assembly to ensure that we license every single weapon in this country. If there is an x amount of weapons, give them official licences. I do not know why people want to have weapons. But, if they want to have weapons, a reason must be given so that the Government could consider that and issue a licence. But, remember, if a person is caught without a licence and not with introduced weapons - , - - . , bail . , . . . , . ? ? , . . . . ? , . . . , . . . 15,000 , . . . , . - - . , , . . , . , ? , ,

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Motion moved by my good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake brings to mind the fact that this House should pay a debt of gratitude and offer bouquets to His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa for completely eradicating this menace of terrorism from the society. He has also cleared the City of Colombo from the underworld elements and also started to seize unlawful arms. Sir, it is already there in the law books that nobody can own a gun. So, this Motion is irrelevant in that effect. You have to have a licence. Now, in certain areas guns were given to Grama Sevakas to protect human lives from marauding elephants. Elephants have gone from Sirikotha to the wild, threatening the lives of the people! Therefore, Sir, His Excellency the President has taken adequate steps in this direction.

My good Friend, the Hon. Hasen Ali, a very good friend of mine indeed, told us that body search of Members of Parliament is still going on in Parliament and this should not be done anymore. Body search is done on every Member of Parliament including yourself, Sir. All this is done because the danger is not wholly removed from the society and the country. Moving the Motion on the extension of the State of Emergency, the Hon. Prime

Minister confessed that information has been received that most of the condominiums that are coming up in this country are owned by the LTTEers. What a dangerous thing! Harmlessly people will go in and what will be the ultimate result? We have to take precautions in this regard.

Furthermore, when talking about this relaxation of security, I remember, Mr. S.K. Shaul Hameed, a scholar and a good friend of mine, came from Kayalpatnam, India and, Sir, we went for a meeting addressed by the then President, His Excellency R. Premadasa at Station Road, Dehiwala. We could see a large crowd gathered there and saw how close people were to the stage. My friend, Mr. Shaul Hameed was also carrying a bag with him. He was so close to the stage. Later when he met His Excellency the President, he said, Sir, at that meeting, I was so close to you that I could hear your breath. Therefore, do not relax these security measures, because still there are dangerous elements operating around.

Then, Sir, I will tell you another incident. In India, there is a town called Pondy Bazaar, in T. Nagar. Lots of Sri Lankan people go there to buy sarees and all other things. I think the Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara, who is seated across the Floor, would also have visited that place. Sir, there was infighting recently and our people who went from here to India - ;

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) In fact, the decision on Private Members Motions was agreed upon in your presence. We agreed for 60 minutes for the proponents and 30 minutes for the opponents. So, on that score, Sir, the Members of the Government have already spoken for more than 32 minutes. . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) When the Debate started, the Hon. Speaker was in the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When the Debate started, I asked the Hon. Speaker about the time allocation. He said it is 60 minutes for the proponents and 30 minutes for the opponents. But, 35 minutes have been used by them on that side. So, I brought to your attention that the time has been overspent because the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran wanted to speak. Her husband was killed by a holder of an unlicensed weapon.

For that, the time allocation is, 10 minutes for the Mover to move the Motion, five minutes for each Hon. Member who would take part in the Debate, 10 minutes for the Minister to reply and then the last five minutes are given again for the Mover of the Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You and I are not at cross purposes.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The 10 minutes is part of the 30 minutes. You have four speakers who are each given five minutes and one speaker who is given 10 minutes. That is how the 30 minutes is divided. Proposing five minutes for the -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have five minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As agreed at the Party Leaders' Meeting, this is the way we have to move forward. We cannot give away our rights like this. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the winding up speech is yours and you have five minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, it is not five minutes. There is a requirement of 10 minutes. The Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran has got to speak. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) This is what was agreed at the Party Leaders' Meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran has got to speak first and thereafter I will speak. She has lost her husband who was an Hon. Member in this House. She has a right to speak.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry, I cannot give her time. The time allotted for winding up the Debate is five minutes. You can take those five minutes.

Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, he has already finished his speech. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is the meaning of this, Sir? We discussed this matter at the Party Leaders' Meeting. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Finally I say this. You have five minutes for winding up. Use that time and wind up the Debate. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, we cannot. It has to be corrected on the basis of what was agreed upon. The Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran has to speak and thereafter I have got to speak. Please get it corrected, Sir, otherwise it is very unfair. Firstly, I was not allowed to take up my first Motion. As regards my second Motion, we have the question of the overrun of time. The Hon. (Mrs) Vijayakala Maheswaran has to speak. I have to look after

the interests of our Members as well. Her husband was killed by a holder of an unlicensed weapon. The Hon. Maheswaran was killed in a Kovil, not in Jaffna or in Galle.

For the first time you have come here and sat on this Chair. You must realize that. We are Members here listening and deciding what to do. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Sit down, please. Your conduct must be proper. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am telling you with all due respect.

( ) (An Hon. Member) There cannot be a bias conduct. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You cannot be bias, Sir. When you sit on the Chair, you cannot take either the Government side or the Opposition side. You have only got to look after the interests of the Members. - [Interruption.] I must get the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran to speak. She has lost her husband. I am bringing this Motion because we have lost a number of Colleagues in the Sixth Parliament. We have lost the Hon.

, . . 1.00 .

, .. 1.00 . Sitting accordingly suspended till 1.00 p.m. and then resumed.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Members, times for the Debate are allotted in the following manner: ten minutes for the Mover of the Motion; five minutes for the Seconder of the Motion; five minutes for each Hon. Member taking part in the Debate and five minutes for the Mover of the Motion for winding up. This has to be followed. Therefore, I can give you three to four minutes to wind up your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we discussed this matter two weeks ago when you were also present. I have the Minutes with me which very categorically states that the Private Members' Motions will hereafter be held once a month, every alternate week. Owing to the fact that there are quite a lot of Private Members' Motions, each one will be looked at and reduced to 90 minutes. Ninety minutes means, 60 minutes for the proponents and 30 minutes for the opponents. That was discussed in the manner that you have said. That is perfectly okay. But, what was discussed and minuted with which we are bound by, and what we have discussed at our Group Meeting was on that basis. So, I was basically drawing attention to a matter that we discussed at the Speakers Chambers. I have got the Minutes of that and it is not contrary to what you stated, Sir. But, what is different is that the Government has got 35 minutes and we have got five minutes less. That was the only point I was trying to labour on. I appreciate you, Sir, and on that score, we will give the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran three to four minutes. Thereafter, I will take five minutes and then we will put this matter to rest. When we discuss it next time, we will move forward from there onwards. If you do not mind, I would request you to give the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran another five minutes to speak.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry, Hon. Member. I cannot give her more time and I will give you three minutes to wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When I raised the point of Order, it was 12.22 p.m. So, I had eight minutes to speak and then you suspended the Sittings. I have still eight minutes to speak. So, the three minutes is not a bargain that you give. I had eight minutes to speak. I only want to look after the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran who also wanted to speak. So, I what say is, give three minutes to her and give me six minutes. I leave it in your hands. Sir, please ensure some sanity prevails in this House and give her the due respect. Sir, let us not harp on this. It is just a matter of giving her three minutes and my taking six minutes. There is loss of only one minute, Sir.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. I can give three minutes for the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran.

EXTENSION OF BANKING HOURS [. . 1.13]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I move, "That this Parliament is of the opinion that Banking hours should be extended from 0900 hours till 1600 hours in order to increase the economic activities in the country." Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Motion No. 3 is with regard to the extension of the banking hours. That is, this Parliament is of the opinion that the banking hours should be extended from 9 o' clock to 4 o clock in order to increase the economic activities of the country. First of all, let me apprise you of the reason behind bringing such a Private Members' Motion. Economic activities are the most important aspect in a country. I am a great believer that if you win the economic war, you have won all other wars. In short, the resultant factor in the lack of a strong economy leads to various other concomitant problems and one of them is that people taking to arms, undergoing unwanted pressures. So, my intention is to divert the full attention to the countrys economy and to stress that the more you strengthen the economy, the better it would be for the country to get back into proper gear. Sir, can I have a clarification? Since we have 90 minutes, can I speak a little longer than 10 minutes? Is that okay, Sir?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes.

Then, it is okay. As long as we are within that one-and-a-half hours, we can do that. So, if we are able to strengthen the economy, then we can take the country into a new era.

. . . . , we always mention about the financial discipline of this country. The financial discipline is of paramount importance in order to ensure that the country moves forward. So, this is why we have been basically saying the Central Bank, which is an independent authority, should ensure that the financial discipline starts from the Bank itself. If the Central Bank, which is supposed to be a non-political organization is talking about politics, what more do you expect? When the Central Banker has gone and had breakfast with actors who came from India, instead of having breakfast, lunch and dinner with our local investors who know the problems, how can you move forward? So, these are some of the issues for which we have got to take remedial action in order to develop the country for a better tomorrow. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You spoke about the interest rates and suddenly you switched on to the breakfast with the artistes, which I do not think is quite in place; it is not relevantly connected. How do we bring down the interest rates? That is the most important question. So, it is better if you can give a suggestion to that. Why are interest rates kept high? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are a respectable Member of Parliament. So, I will respond to that, for sure. Hon. Member, why I brought the breakfast matter into this is, because when you pay a breakfast bill, that also comes into the Central Bank account. In order to ensure that that is covered, you increase your cost. Then, the cost goes up and you have to recover it. So, why I mentioned this is because, when you have one breakfast today and if you have 365 breakfasts like that, that creates costs. That is the problem. There is no disrespect or malice. All I want to say is that you basically bring that to the domestic economy. You should have breakfast, lunch and dinner with our local investors and ask whether they can run a hotel with 21 per cent interest. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Artistes are potential investors. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Artistes are potential investors if they are actual Bollywood artistes. But, if they are the secondary level artists, then, what will happen? Anyway that has no relevance to the interest rates.

Indias interest rate is, 3 to 4 per cent and in Pakistan it is 9 to 10 per cent. With the support of the government, Bangladesh has an interest rate of 3 to 4 per cent. We, Sri Lanka has an interest rate of 18 to 19 per cent.

( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara) Japan has an interest rate of 0.5 per cent. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, Japan has an interest rate of 0.5 per cent. These are developed countries. Korea has an interest rate of 1 per cent. Even the European countries, such as Britain, Germany have an interest rate of 3 per cent. So where is Sri Lanka? We are off the mark. We have an interest rate of 18 to 20 per cent. We have thrust industries for which loans are given. They give Rs. 3 million and say, Our interest rate is 12 per cent, but they charge 14 per cent. That happens because our inflation is high. It is rational when you have lending rates higher than inflation rates. Now, why do you not bring the inflation rate down? - [Interruption.] It is because the inflation is theoretically low. If the inflation rate is 1 per cent, then, why are you lending at 18 per cent? That is because you know that it is not genuine. That is the problem. You are lending at 18 per cent, because you know that the perception is that inflation would be 15 to 16 per cent. ( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara) The actual inflation is high. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is right. So, on that score, you have got to bring it down. Otherwise, you have hyperinflation like what was there in 2007 and 2008, which was at 32 to 34 per cent. When it was at 32 to 34 per cent, you had real inflation at 40 to 45 per cent. That is why you had Sakvithies; that is why you had Golden Key and that is why you had Danduwam Mudalalis paying an interest rate of 60 to 70 per cent. You cannot blame those people because they respond to the need of the depositors. Depositors had money. They wanted to deposit their money. If they deposit their money in banks, they get a negative return. So, they went to somebody who gave them a fanciful return. When the Sri Lankan economy and the world economy started shredding, then what happened was, they could not basically return the amounts that they borrowed. So, this was the crash-down that impacted on the economy. That was the financial meltdown that took place. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) What is the inflation rate in India?

[ ]

2010 11 579 580

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The inflation rate in India is 3 to 4 per cent as of today. But, they keep it as 6 to 7 per cent. So, on that particular basis, their lending rate is virtually low. Sometimes the thrust industries are supported by the governments, for example, China. China has now become the second biggest economy and it is artificially manipulated. Even though they talk of various things - they say, communists are on one side and capitalists on the other side - at the end of the day they get the economy running. So that is what we should be doing. There is no point in what the Central Bankers or the rural bankers are telling us to do. We have got to do for the benefit of the people and the country. That is, to have low interest rates. Low interest rates spark investment. Investments spark creation of jobs. Creation of jobs brings down the cost of production, and productivity is high. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) That is, when there are markets.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is why we say, Protect Labour GSP". You do not need the Europeans to come and tell us what to do. You do not need the Americans to tell us what to do. You cannot go after the Libyans, Venezuelans, North Koreans or Myanmarians and try to do this. That is where you have international diplomacy. You need all ends. At one time you are embracing them and at another time you are kicking them. You cannot do that. At one time you were bashing India. Then you go to India. Before you go to India, you bash other countries. You go and come back, and finish that. That is not diplomacy. That does not benefit Sri Lanka. All what we want to say is, do what is good for Sri Lanka. Your foreign policy must be based on the national requirements. Then you say, Okay, this country is required from this point. Hon. Member, two years ago we said, Let us work together to protect Labour GSP. I am telling this with all sincerity and honesty. After that, there was a concerted effort by the Government to witch-hunt and then hit the people who told that, saying these are treacherous statements that are being made. They said that the Leader of the Opposition went overseas and basically said untruths to them and tried to discredit the Government. What we told then has completely changed today. We said, Let us work together. At that time we said, If you do this, we will ensure Labour GSP and 300,000 jobs are protected. Today, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - at least I appreciate that he is making an effort - is dancing around the Europeans and trying to protect the EU. What happened when he went to Brussels last

week? He basically got a cold reception. They said, "The European Union is not there just to come at the time when you want". You correct one legislation, you disrespect 10 legislations and come and tell us what to do. They are a bunch of 24 countries getting together. It is the biggest economy in the world. America can be the single largest, but as a group, the European Union is the biggest. Today, you tell them to fly a kite. But, when you want to go and protect it, you come and say, Okay, I have released Tissainayagam. He was in jail for 18 months. He was languishing in jail when we told you to release him. Just because you are running after an election and you want the Labour GSP, you released him. He is technically still not free. He has still been given two months to come out. That is what is required. We need to get this corrected. It is the same with the Hon. General Sarath Fonseka. Likewise, all I am trying to say is, you have got to develop along with the international markets. Markets are there in Europe, markets are there in the USA and markets are there in India.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Markets are sinking - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Never mind. If they are sinking, then we will be non-existent. If the European Union and the USA markets are sinking, you cannot have Venezuela, Myanmar, North Korea and Libya increasing their markets. Sri Lanka will sink and they will also sink. So, why do you want to sink together? You might as well get a bigger share of a sinking market rather than lose the existing market. This is why I say, let us bring the ingredients that are needed to produce a low interest rate regime; the cost of production is low, it is highly competitive, ensured jobs are given to the jobless people to move from there. I still say that you need a national economy in order to take this forward. The national economy is the most important aspect. The national economy needs national policies. Now, today you have 41 Ministers. Thirty of your Ministers never come here and you give the laborious task for the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena to keep answering. But, if they come here and defend themselves, it is so much easier. If you have all the cylinders fire in the same way, then the engine functions. Today, one piston is functioning one way, the other piston is working another way and another piston is non-existent. So, how can you take the economy forward? Why I wanted to bring in this Motion today is to ensure that the President and the Prime Minister are watchdogs of the economy. The President is the President of the country. He has got to look after himself, the Parliament, the Provincial Councils and the Local Authorities. So, why do you need Cabinet portfolios for that? On that score, all I say is,

581 582

ensure that you give it to somebody else; give it to the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, give it to the Hon. Dr. Mervin Silva or whoever. Appoint another two Ministers. With regard to CEPA, the President has quite rightly said, "I will not sign CEPA for the sake of singing". I respect that. That is what we are also saying. Do not do what is told. Do what is good. Whether it is told by India or China or whoever, do not do that. But, if the Sri Lankans say, "We require this," then, go for it. Now, when we ask the Government to tell us their stand, instead of doing that, they want us in the Opposition to tell them our stand on the CEPA. You are asking your next door neighbour to do your homework. What is that situation? So, all what we are trying to say is, ensure that we develop a modern economy. During the election you said, "Let us make Sri Lanka the wonder in Asia." Nothing to wonder. When you have one hour rain, you have 10 feet of water. That is not a wonder. When you have houses to build and when you break down houses, that is not a wonder. All what we want to say is, we have our setbacks. Every country has its setbacks. But, if you want to look at it and try to create a setback, that is a national curse. That is a national cry. Let us forget that. I, as a member of the Opposition have been taken to courts 48 times because I stood against the Government. . . . . , moderate level . . . . . . . ; . . . . . interest rate . . . . - - . ? . . . . . - financial discipline - . That is what we have been saying all the time. So, ensure that you have a full-

time Finance Minister. As a matter of fact, if you want this particular Motion that I have brought up to come into operation, it can be made effective from the next term. It does not matter. But, all I want to say is, let us start from a particular point. Now, look at the British Cabinet. David Cameron came in and appointed one person. He had one charge. He left. Why did he leave? Because morally he could not guide. Why? All what he did was, he had taken Sterling Pounds 10,000 which was illegal or suspicious, or that suspicion led it to be illegal and he had to move out. But, do we have such persons? The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Member of Parliament went to courts and ensured that certain people were found fault with, but still they sit triumphantly. What happens? Why are you so silent on that? What about the hedging deal? Now, these are matters created by the banks. The Standard Chartered Bank is one of the biggest irresponsible banks. Wherever illegal actions have happened, have happened with the Standard Chartered Bank. I say so with all authority. They have made political mileage out of certain things that have come up and made us look as if we are criminals. We are trying to develop the countrys economy and never, not for one moment, we being in the Opposition, have ever taken a task on the national economy. We spoke about the SriLankan Airlines, then called Air Lanka. What happened? What we said in 1998 - ten years later - became absolutely correct. Nobody dared to question the system at that time. I must say my good Friend, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle - he is no more, so, it is my bounden duty to mention - challenged me. Subsequently, he came and said, I am sorry. I did not know what I was challenging. He withdrew it, apologized in public in a public court. But, at the end of the day what happened? At the end of the day what we said was what was good for the country. What we told then, 10 years later, became exactly true. Emirates used our licence to fly all over. They developed it and we became still a little airline and a regional player. So, what we said was what was good for the country. Likewise, today we say the national economy must be internationalized. That is what we did. In 2001, when the United National Party, under the leadership of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, led the economy, we basically looked at developing markets. We looked at Sri Lanka-India Free Trade Agreements. We developed that to a CEPA. We were not worried. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement was there to develop into a bigger market. But, at that time we ensured that we had more exports going from Sri Lanka to India and less coming from India to Sri Lanka. When I took over the Ministry, the export-import ratio was 1 : 10. When we left in 2004, it was 1 : 4. In 2006, it changed back and today it is 1: 9. India exports 9 and we export one in ratio terms. So, we must develop a CEPA which is in agreement with what the country wants. CEPA is good if we can get a bigger market share. We do not care what India gets out of it because they have got about two

[ ]

2010 11 583 584

billion people whereas we have got about 20 million. If they are going to invade into our 20 million, our service industry is going to suffer. Then we will have a big problem. We developed the America Free Trade Agreement. We would have definitely got that Free Trade Agreement if we won the Election in April 2004. Unfortunately, we lost all. What were we doing? We were looking at the SAARC Region making Sri Lanka a production point going to the USA on a duty- free basis. Then, you had India coming to Sri Lanka if they want to export duty-free. That was the way we wanted to develop the market. We went to the European Union because we wanted to develop the European market. What did we do? We ensured that we developed the European Union where there are about 320 million people. What did we utilize? The European Union Labour GSP of 11 per cent duty-free. Now what happened on 31st June ? I hope and pray that we do not lose it. I only want the Government to say, Yes, we have protected it. Otherwise, this Government will be held responsible for losing the Labour GSP. I still say if the Government and the Opposition can work together, go before European Union and say, Please protect this. We all have made mistakes. We are coming on a national call. Then it will be changed. But, do not pretend to be hypocrites by saying, We have done everything". And, when you lose everything, do not say, "The European Union is trying to teach Sri Lanka lessons. If you all do not wake up from this slumber to the international responsibilities, if you do not wake up to that call, then I am sorry, we are in a sorry state. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The European Union approving Labour GSP is one thing, and their seeking to regulate our conduct is another thing. We must have the national respectability maintained while we deal with our economy. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Absolutely right. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We cannot go to the European Union and say Please protect" or else say, " You are giving to your consumers at a lesser price due to the reduction of duty, and therefore you are also managing your economy, as far as your consumer is concerned". We are getting a benefit no doubt, but we cannot be going and pleading with them. It has to be on a level of equality that we deal with. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Honourable Member, if what you are saying is correct - for 16 years the SLFP Government has been basically

guiding this country. In 1994, when the UNP left, a worker in the Free Trade Zone was getting Rs. 3,200. Today the same person gets Rs. 5,800. You had 16 years of inflation, and if you really look at what Rs. 3,200 then was and what Rs. 5,800 is today, you have to pay each of these workers at least Rs. 20,000. So where is the guidance? We had not bent to them. But, we have not done what is good for the Sri Lankan workers. ? . . . , , , , , . . , . . ? . We increased the European Union 320 million market share. So likewise, then we had the Bangkok Agreement, we had the SAARC, which was meant for regional development.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you have already taken 28 minutes. Are you going to continue?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. I will wind up. Thank you very much for reminding me. We have the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva and others to speak. So all I want to say is, let us all work together and develop a national economy. That is the only aspect of my proposal. We have the Deputy Minister of Finance here, another keen energetic person - only sometimes he has blinkers and he goes off the political agenda - but if he sticks to his principle, I am sure he will take it in the correct direction. . , . .

[. . 1.43] . . ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake brought in a Motion for the Extension of Banking Hours in Sri Lanka, possibly to make it compulsory. But, at the moment, there are extended banking hours and it is at the discretion of the banks. Some banks do act in furthering their time limits for banking purposes. The extension of banking hours would be of great value to the masses at large, especially to the ordinary worker who has a small bank account and even the executives who work in companies can go to the banks and transact their business without much of a rush.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to the Chair?

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair. , . . Question put, and agreed to. , . . . .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Swaminathan, please carry on. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan)

Sir, presently all banks, according to the figures given in their annual reports, are making a colossal amount of profit. Therefore, you can utilize a certain amount of that money for the benefit of the majority of the people. Secondly, by extending the banking hours, you would also facilitate the business with the Western world, like the UK, the United States of America, the European Union and by that, many other facilities and benefits that can be reached to the Government. In the meantime, as the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake very correctly stated, we have to see that the banks of this country, the Government banks as well as the private banks bring down the interest rate to a single digit. It is an important factor. Bringing down of interest rate to a single digit will enhance the creditworthiness of this country and the economy will grow. It is very important that this factor is looked into. Thirdly, I want to bring to your kind notice, Sir, that the interest rate on credit cards is exorbitant. A credit card is really used by the ordinary citizen of this country to buy goods on credit for 30 days. But, all banks are charging very high interest rates, like 30 to 35 per cent, on credit cards. Really, that principle should be changed and the Government should take immediate steps to bring down the interest rate on credit cards to a single digit or close upon to two digits because this is a fundamental factor. By doing this, the purchasing power of the people will improve and the improved purchasing power will lead to a growth in the economy. It is like a cycle that

[ ]

2010 11 587 588

works round. So, there are so many factors that have been placed before this august Assembly and if we want to improve the economy of this country, we have to consider the basic fundamentals of economic policy. The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara raised an issue saying that the European Union cannot dictate terms to Sri Lanka. I totally agree with him but if a country does some acts which are not in accordance with the basic or fundamental principles or with the international law, I think any country is in a position at least to ascertain as to what has been done is right or wrong. We are not in a position to dictate terms to the Western world as they are the most powerful community in the world. They are the people who really control the economy of this world and a country like ours with a 20 million population cannot dictate terms to the major countries. Anyway, they cannot interfere with the basic running of this country. I totally agree with the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, because we have our own sovereignty, which we must always jealously guard. Unless we respect others, we are not going to earn respect from them. That is why at the moment, we are having this major issue with regard to the GSP. If we do respect, co-ordinate and work with the European Union, we may gain GSP benefit even now. As far as the Opposition is concerned, they have done their part to canvass that the GSP should not be removed from this country and that should be the principle that we should work through. We cannot be friends of only a few countries but maintain friendly relations with the international community as a whole. This will surely help to improve our economy. Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Private Member's Motion and reiterate that the interest rates charged by the Government and private banks and the interest rates charged on credit cards should be brought down and the banking hours be extended. We need your co-operation to do that. Thank you. [. . 1.50] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. In fact, I was not planning to speak on this Motion. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake asked me to say a few words so I thought I will utilize this time actually to add some more things to the Hon. Members Motion. Sir, rich people anyway have extended banking hours. You have privilege banking, premier banking, all kinds of banking, and they offer you coffee and you sit with them in air-conditioned rooms; you have relationship managers and you can go there at any time. It is only the ordinary person who is turned away at the door of the bank at 2.00

oclock or 3.00 o'clock or whatever time that may be. So, the UNP, as always, is fighting for the regular person of this country so that they can also benefit from this. extended banking hours. But, Sir, how many bank accounts are operative in this country? How many people have bank accounts? We have 20 million people, four and a half million households but bank accounts are still in the hundreds of thousands, if at all. It is true that there are some Samurdhi accounts but they are not operational accounts. So, what I want to add to this Motion, if possible, is to urgently bring in a regulation to enable mobile banking or Banking, as is commonly referred to in this world. There are progressive countries in this world. Even Kenya in Africa has a programme called M-PESA. Due to M-PESA, Sir, the number of people who have been included in the formal financial sector has grown exponentially because in Kenya the biggest problem was transport between the bank and the village. They take some money, get into a bus and get robbed. So, they needed some way to avoid losing money in transit. So, that was the reason for them to have such a programme. Then, look at countries like the Philippines. They have something called GCASH and SmartCash. Why is that? They had a need for that. What was the need, Sir? It was that there are so many Filipino people working around the world, in America, in Australia, in the Middle-East and so on. They needed a way to bring in their remittances at a low cost. Therefore, they started that. Now, look at Sri Lanka. What have we done? We have over one million people working in the Middle East and other places. Each of them is bringing in something like US Dollars 150 a month. Of course, they work very hard for it. Hundreds of people - I am not sure whether this statistic is right because I have not done any research on this. Hundreds of people, if not in dozens die every year in the Middle East. We have read reports of hundreds of people living under bridges in these countries. They go through enormous difficulty to make about US Dollars 400 - 500 a month. Why? Because they need to feed their families. Now, how do they send this money? They do not have bank accounts. Their households, their parents, their children living in very remote areas of this country do not have bank accounts. How do they send it? They send it either through Havala or Hundi system or they send it through relatives. They send it through Western Union and others. The transaction cost of remitting money is very high, Sir. It is very high. Sometimes, you send US Dollars 150 and only US Dollars 110 come to the country. US Dollars 40 go as service fees. Therefore, I think we have to be serious about having a banking system, Sir, so that the normal person of this country is also included. We have to bring in legislation so that mobile banking can take place. That is, banking through mobile phones. That is what M-PESA is. That is

589 590

what GCash is. That is what Smart Cash is. But, we have not done it. Yesterday, we were debating about mobile phones. We have 14 million plus mobile phones in this country, Sir. We have done research. LIRNEasia has done research. Over 80 per cent of the people in this country - what we call the bottom of the pyramid or the people who make less than US Dollars 2 per day - use mobile phones on a regular basis. So, everyone has a potential bank account in their wallets; whether they close it at 5.00 oclock; whether they close it at 3.00 oclock or whether they close it at 12.00 noon, it does not matter. You can do your banking through your phone. Therefore, I think it is very important that we look into it. Look at the small saver. You go to a rural area in Kurunegala and ask them, ? . " , 200 . 40 . 30 . 70 . 40 . 110 . 200 110 transaction cost . mobile phone SMS charge . , ." So, look at the benefit of bringing in regulations; people can save. I am going to wind up now because I do not think I have much time. The same case applies to the small businessmen, Sir. . , 40,000 , Excise Duty 25 . Treasury 25, 20 . " " . . ? mobile phone M-banking service . What happens then is, the transaction cost falls. That is what we want to do. We want to make this economy more efficient. We want to create a more productive economy. Given the technological improvements of today, what we can do is to utilize the technology that we already have. Ensure that people's phones become the remote branch of the bank. Then, we really do not need to talk too much about whether it is 4.00 o' clock or 5.00 o' clock. It will be 24/7 access to mobile banking. Sir, this is the first time I am speaking on such a Motion in Parliament. I do not know how it works. I apologize for that. But, if the proposals put forward by me could be accepted, I would appreciate it very much because that is really the way we need to move forward.

If we really want it, we need to ensure that the small businessmen and the small savers can also participate in the formal financial system. Thank you very much. [. . 1.59]

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , " " .

. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Now, the Adjournment Motion is to be moved by the Hon. Rauf Hakeem. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa - Minister of Environment) , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) , . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Presiding Member, in response to the Hon. Minister, I would like to say this. Of course there has been a practice in the past about considering matters before Court as sub judice and for us not to get - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Not only in the past , even now it is there. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But, in this case there is a qualification to what I am saying. For instance, in a Magistrate's Court, just for the reason that you have filed a B Report, it does not become a case. In this instance, a case has been filed, but no notice has been issued. The Court has to first hear the petitioner and issue notice. Then only, the case is entertained by the Court. But , this case has not been entertained.

2010 11 599 600

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Then, my argument is valid, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, your argument is not valid. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No. Even if notice has not been issued on them, still it is sub judice. We cannot debate it. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Now, what I am saying is, - Hon. Minister you misunderstood me - on a Fundamental Rights application before the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court rules are very clear. As an Attorney of the Supreme Court, you know it very well. When you present a petition, that petition is entertained by the Registrar to be supported before the Court. The Court has to give a date. The Registrar has to fix a date and then you have to support it before a bench; a specific bench which will issue notice. Only thereafter, the case is entertained. Until then, there does not appear to be a case. For some frivolous reason. Somebody can file an application. The Supreme Court does not entertain every application that comes before it. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I do not agree with my Friend. Once the case is filed, it will be entertained in the Supreme Court and it will be argued before a bench. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is right. I understand. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) So, now it is before the Court. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The argument takes place later. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) It is before the Court.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, not before the Court. It is before the Registrar. He will put it up to the bench. Only when the bench takes it up and issues notice, the Court is possessed of this matter. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) That is decided by the Court. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no it is still not being entertained. No notice has been issued because Court has to accept it. I think my learned Friend will be generous enough to allow this matter to be raised. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) You are not serious about my argument. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, with all respect, I have a fair knowledge of the - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Sir, he himself said that the case has been filed. My argument is that we cannot argue it here in this forum. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is a serious miscarriage of justice and also a serious violation of the practices of this House. If you are going to throw out an Adjournment Motion on a very topical and important subject of this nature, simply because a petition has been filed - [Interruption.] No, it is still not sub judice. My humble submission, Sir, is within the precincts of this House we had several occasions in the past where issues have been raised as sub judice and the Chair has given its Ruling. But, this is a unique instance. The matter has been filed before the Registrar of the Supreme Court. It has still not been taken up by the bench to issue notice. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Have their attorneys already appeared before the Court? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no, they have not, because the matter has to be entertained.

601 602

( ) (The Presiding Member) But, I think we will refrain from referring to any matter that will be taken up in the - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no definitely not, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No, I do not agree with you, Sir, because I will have to place certain facts before Parliament. But, I am also compelled not to place those facts before Parliament because there is a case. ( ) (The Presiding Member) In that case, you have to wait. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Sir, it is very unreasonable. The very reason that we, on the part of the Government - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is the very purpose of - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Then, you can raise it but I cannot answer it. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena knows that I am only going to raise issues of procedure.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) He can raise it, Sir, but I cannot answer it. Certain information that I have cannot be divulged here because of the case. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, the case is not there. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Why not? It is there. It will be taken up very soon.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) "It will be taken up very soon". There you are; there you are! Now, the cat has been let out of the bag! ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Then what about my facts? You can raise the issue, but I cannot place certain facts before Parliament. Please understand my position. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Minister, the case is - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I am answering on behalf of the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) My learned Friend is quite well aware of what I am saying. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) We will wait till the case is over. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But, then, it will take - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Then, we can have a full-day Adjournment Debate. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The question, Hon. Minister, is about the procedure that has been adopted. That is what I am going to raise. I am not going to -

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) But, I will not be able to answer. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) How can you say so?

2010 11

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) How can I do that? The lawyer who represents the Government will have to place certain facts before the Supreme Court. So, I will not be able to answer. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) This is a very serious question. People have been thrown out of their houses without any proper notice.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I must tell you that an action has been taken in regard to that. So do not talk like that. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Action is over. Now we want to bring this - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) The reason is not that. The case is now before the Supreme Court.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) How can you say so? ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I cannot answer certain - [Interruption.] How can I answer?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Adopting a tactic that - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No, I am not adopting a tactic. I am telling you - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You are trying to frustrate us from bringing in the Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No, no. I am not trying to do that. I am just trying to say that I cannot place certain facts before Parliament because the case is sub judice.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Both of you are lawyers. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Presiding Member, if the Government is going to hide behind the excuse of saying that they cannot take responsibility - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No, no. The answer, with the decisions taken by the Government, is ready.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Presiding Member, I want a Ruling on this, because there is no such case pending before the Court. This is a very preposterous suggestion.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) There is a case pending before the Court. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Yes, it is. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) How can you say so? Only when leave is granted, it becomes a case before the Court. The Court does not entertain every piece of paper that is sent up to the Registrar. It has to be in order. They have to examine whether the parties have been noticed; lawyers may not have signed; parties may not have signed; they may not have attached an affidavit. That is what happens. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I cannot divulge certain facts. As a Minister, I have that privilege.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But, that is very unfair. ( ) (The Presiding Member) You may not get a reply.

603 604

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Yes, you may not get a reply to this. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But, then, that is very unfair. I mean this is a matter - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) How can I answer? I cannot. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Minister, now you understand - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) The responsibility is mine now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The responsibility is yours. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) You can raise it but I cannot answer. That is my position.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You are saying that you will not answer. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I will not answer. The reason is, it is before a court of law.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is a violation of my privilege. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It is a Privilege issue. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No. You can raise it, but I will not answer.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Minister always has the right to reply or not. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I am very serious about it. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) According to the conventions and practices of this House - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) We will place the facts before the Court, not before Parliament. You can raise it, but I will not answer.

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) No. Let the Minister hold on to his position. Now, let me move this Motion. Let me at least be allowed to place this Motion before the House.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Since you want a reply from the Minister - ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) After I place this Motion and present my facts, let us have a debate on the question whether he should answer or not. That is a different matter.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me place the facts. The question of your answering is the issue. So, let us take it up later.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Now, we are waiting for the Ruling. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You have moved the Adjournment Motion. Now, let the Chair give a Ruling. What you wanted was done. But, if you want a Debate - that is what the Hon. Minister raised - let the Chair give a Ruling.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) On what? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) On the objection raised. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It is not on the Motion, but on the question whether the Minister has to answer or not.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The objection raised by the Minister is very serious. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Presiding Member, - [Interruption.] I am addressing the Chair. Let me address the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) We can debate, but the Chair has to give a Ruling on this.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me address the Chair. The Hon. Minister was very clear that he was not at cross purposes with my intention of presenting the Motion and placing the facts before the House. Though he raised this issue of sub judice, he finally agreed to the position that if I insisted on going ahead with the Motion, he would refrain from replying on behalf of the Government. That is the only issue. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No. What I said was that this particular issue is before the Court and it is sub judice. I still maintain my position.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) On that substantive issue, we can argue. But, let us now bring it down to a much more narrower issue of your right to reply and not go into the whole issue. Mr. Presiding Member, this Motion was handed in through the Secretary-General to the Government side yesterday. This morning they could have informed us about this. Then, we need not have come all the way getting ready for this Debate. Perhaps, at the last moment they read in the newspapers that somebody has filed an application. But,

607 608

[ ]

the issue of sub judice does not debar me from moving this Motion because there is no case before the Court. The Court has not entertained a case and how dare he say that there is a case pending? He knows it very well. The Hon. Minister can be a little more generous. His conscience knows this issue very well. He is a lawyer; he is quite an eminent practitioner in courts. All of us are losing a lot by coming into politics. But, then, the Hon. Minister is quite well aware of this particular issue that I am raising. Until and otherwise the Supreme Court entertains the matter by sitting and issuing a notice, they can in limine throw it out. Even the Registrar may not place it before the bench if it is not a proper application. We are unaware as to what the contents of the application is and who the petitioners are. In my opinion, this is a very preposterous suggestion that I cannot present this Motion just because somebody has gone and filed some papers before the Registrar. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I think I am sufficiently educated on the subject before the House. As the Mover of the Motion, you are almost demanding a reply from the Hon. Minister who has to reply on behalf of the Government. But, the Hon. Minister says that he will not reply. Since that is the bone of contention before the House, I would rule that the Hon. Rauff Hakeem moves this Motion on another day. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) But, that is very unfair, Mr. Presiding Member. I have already moved the Motion. The Motion is there; it has already been moved. You permitted me to move the Motion. Then, you have to expunge the Motion. Are you going to do that? This is very unfair.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) There is no point of Order when the Chair gives a Ruling. It is very clear in the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) But, the Chair should understand what the question was. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Since, you are demanding a reply from the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Minister categorically states to this House that he will not reply, I have to rule that you to bring in this Motion on another day. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) This is absolutely unfair. , . .
