    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to raise a matter of urgent public importance. A Parliamentary Delegation of the Tamil National Alliance comprising 12 Members of Parliament visited Vanni on 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th May, 2010. We visited 28 villages in the Districts of Vavuniya, Mannar, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi. In regard to food, the main items of food, rice, flour, dhal, sugar and coconut oil are presently distributed under the World Food Programme. This is a major relief for which the people are immensely grateful as the returnees would otherwise have probably starved. The returnees are in unison of the view that the World Food Programme should continue until they have harvested their Maha and Mari crop, which would be around April 2011. In regard to housing, 80 to 90 per cent of the houses in the villages we visited were destroyed or badly damaged beyond repair. Sixty to 90 per cent of the original houses in the villages we visited were brick-built, permanent-tiled houses. The rest were mud (wattle and daub) houses with cadjan roofs. The arrangements thus far made for both temporary and permanent housing are woefully inadequate. Unless effective remedial action is taken before the wet weather sets in, these returnees will probably virtually live in the open. What is provided by way of temporary housing material are 10 to 12 tin sheets, around six poles or one or two tarpaulins. In some areas eight bags of cement are given. A hovel 9 x 6 in size can hardly be constructed with this material. This temporary shelter is totally unsatisfactory and these returnees are already facing and will increasingly be exposed to the vagaries of the weather. Arrangements for permanent housing seem minimal and totally inadequate to meet the need. There seems to be no definite plan at present, to provide all the permanent housing required for all the returnees. Rupees 325,000 was being advanced in a few areas to the people in instalments to build houses. All returnees considered this amount as totally inadequate. Speedy action is required in regard to permanent housing and at least Rs. 500,000 should be provided to build a small permanent house.",

    "text": "With regard to occupation and livelihood, Sir, the occupation or livelihood of the returnees in most areas visited by us was paddy cultivation, growing vegetables, fishing in some areas and animal husbandry. Substantial income was generated through paddy cultivation and growing vegetables. Many small and medium tanks or irrigation resources are damaged due to the war and are in a state of disrepair. They need to be carefully identified in consultation with the farmers and a programme needs to be drawn out for the restoration of such tanks or irrigation resources. This is an urgent need and should be done on a priority basis. The other main source of income generation is the growth of vegetables. For this purpose they need the wells in their gardens to be in good order. Most wells are destroyed or damaged. Those need to be restored. The people need water pumps to irrigate their vegetable plants and they need insecticide and pesticide sprayers. In order to grow vegetables, they need to have their gardens fenced. Fence posts can be obtained locally provided authority is granted to cut same. Adequate barbed wire is required for secure fencing. Every vegetable grower would need a cash advance of around Rs. 50,000 to procure quality seed and other inputs. In our detailed report, there is reference to Animal Husbandry, Fishing, Education and Health. These are matters which require urgent attention. In regard to monetary assistance, in our detailed report, we have referred to the discrepancy prevalent. All returning families should receive the payment of Rs. 25,000 at the earliest. With regard to vehicles, agricultural and fishing equipment, while escaping, the internally displaced persons used whatever vehicle was available to get away. They used their vehicles to escape from place to place, during their multiple displacements abandoning them at their last destination, before going into a war-free territory and then the camps. None of them have been able to recover any of these vehicles. We would urge that at least a new bicycle be provided to every family to start with. This is a very essential requisite. Tractors and land masters could be made available on a collective basis and used as per requirements and needs through co-ordinated co-operation at the local level. All other agricultural and fishing equipment like water pumps, sprayers, boats and nets were abandoned, when people fled. To enable the returnees to commence their livelihood these would need to be replaced.",

    "text": "With regard to the detained, missing and killed, a distinction should be drawn between those against whom there is no evidence or whose involvement was purely peripheral, and others against whom there is evidence or who were seriously involved. Such persons should be treated with understanding and the Government should demonstrate its will to be sympathetic to the plight of these people. We would urge that the Government should take early action to release such people. The Government could grant a general amnesty to others, as has been done in the past. In regard to the missing, finality needs to be arrived at. There must be an acknowledgement of the truth in regard to missing persons so that the pain of the affected families could be mitigated. Such families should be compensated. Death certificates should be provided for those killed. War-affected families, widows and orphans need to be specially looked after. Resettlement at Santhapuram in the Kilinochchi District, Thiru Murugandy and Keppapulavu in the Mullaitivu District, Sannar, Periyamadu, Pulakkadu, Pallamadu and Mullikulam in the Mannar District have been delayed and the internally displaced persons who have been brought to the transit camps are not able to settle on their lands. These people should be resettled at the earliest. A Mobile Kachcheri in a cluster of villages or in each Divisional Secretary's Division would be immensely helpful. In regard to moral and legal obligation, these internally displaced returnees have lost their civilian kith and kin in large numbers. Their assets have been destroyed and they have been rendered destitute. These people lived in their own land, in their own houses, generated their own income and led honourable lives. They were the victims of a ruthless war, which was prosecuted totally regardless of the safety and security of the civilian population. All that happened to them is well-monitored and known to the whole world. These unfortunate people are now returning to nothing. They hope that they can restart and rebuild their lives. There is a moral and legal obligation cast on the Sri Lankan State to ensure that they will be successful in their efforts. These people would also appeal to the international community to help in this process. An appropriate scheme of compensation also needs to be considered. The resettlement and rehabilitation of these unfortunate people and the reconstruction of these areas is, I submit, Sir, one of the prerequisites to reconciliation and genuine peace. May I, Sir, with your permission, table* the detailed report which was handed over to His Excellency the President and other Ministers who were present with him when we met him on the 7th of this month . Sir, I will be grateful if the detailed report is incorporated in Hansard. I thank you, Sir.",

That is cumulatively earned by the bottom percentage of the population in a country. The Gini coefficient can range from zero to one. A low Gini coefficient indicates a more equal distribution with zero corresponding to complete equality, while higher Gini coefficients indicate more unequal distribution, with figure 1 corresponding to complete inequality. Worldwide, Gini coefficients for income range from approximately 0.25 in Denmark to 0.70 in Namibia.",

Sri Lanka with a Gini coefficient of 0.49 is more like a society in which 75 per cent of the people share 25 per cent of the income while the remaining 25 per cent of the people equally share the balance 75 per cent of the income. Now, this is what the \"Mahinda Chintana\"' has done. When translated into per capita GDP terms, for Sri Lanka, the GDP is estimated approximately at US Dollars 42 billion per year. Out of the US Dollars 42 billion, for 25 per cent of the population or five million people, the per capita is US Dollars 6,300. But, for the other 75 per cent of the population or 15 million people, the per capita is US Dollars 700. Now, a per capita of US Dollars 700 is one of the lowest you get in the most poorest countries. Therefore, even though the official per capita of Sri Lanka is over US Dollars 2,000, the reality is that the actual per capita obtained by more than 75 per cent of the population is under US Dollars 700. So, has the \"Mahinda Chintana\" achieved its goals? The poor masses cannot understand this.",

What we have to do is what is good for the country. So, all that we can basically do is to ensure that we get our principles into proper order; that we put the economy into proper order.

On three occasions, they have bestowed their trust on me: in 2000, 2001 and again in 2010. Today, we are discussing some Regulations and Orders brought under certain financial Acts and an Ordinance, and I consider it appropriate here to forthrightly express my views on certain aspects of the economy as well as those financial Regulations and Orders. When talking about those financial Regulations - as they are monetary issues, they have to come to Parliament - certain Hon. Members from the Opposition expressed their overall concerns and views about certain aspects of the economy as well. , . - - . . . , , . , . . Tandon Lanka (Pvt.)

    "text": ". , . . . , , , . How do we take this country forward? That is the main criteria, the main vision and the challenge the Government has. So, I would say that the main foundation of the economy will be the economic growth. Economic growth of this country has to be sustained and we have to target at least an 8 to 10 per cent growth over a period of 10 years. Then, the second and the most important question is, once you get economic growth, how do you take it to the villages, how do you get that into the rural economy? That is the most important question. There is one aspect of the Hon. Kabir Hashims speech which I agree with. That is, he mentioned about the Lorenz Curve. In the Lorenz Curve, you get the proportionate income levels of the whole country. What is really relevant is, although the per capita income is US Dollars 2,000 as shown by the Lorenz Curve, in the rural sector this per capita income is much lower. I accept that; I concede that point. What we have to ensure now is that the economic growth that is in the Western Province is taken to the rural areas. So, how does the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government do this? I think that is the biggest challenge we will face in the future. Then, I will take up the Regulations, Orders and the Rules that are being debated today. 1969 1 () , 1999 8 21 , , ( ) . Today we are discussing six Regulations. Two of those contain price control. So, here we find another important point : does a modern economy require price control? When I was young, I used to wonder why an economy needs price control. ? . \"\" - - 900. 900 , 9. , 20, 30 . .

Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to start, first by making a few comments on what the Hon. Navin Dissanayake said this morning about the economic vision and the goals of the country. I like the manner in which he spoke. He said that there is so much in common between both sides that if we could get together on the economic vision, this country could actually progress. I agree with what he said in terms of the goal. This Government is certainly not short of goals and visions. I think what it is short of is actually a credible programme to achieve those. I could explain that very quickly. Let us look at the ratio of investment to GDP when certain countries were developing very quickly. If you take China, from 1990 to the early 2000s, the ratio of investment to GDP was 40 per cent. In Japan, from 1960 to 1970, it was 32 per cent; in South Korea, from 1980 to the 1990s, it was 30 per cent and in India, it was around 34 per cent. Sri Lankas ratio of investment to GDP is only 27 per cent. I know that there are many reasons for that. But, the more worrying factor is, if you take the capital efficiency ratio, you would find that, in the same periods I mentioned earlier, in China, the ICOR was 3.3, in Japan, 3.1, in South Korea, 3.3 and even in India it was 3.8, but in Sri Lanka, it is 4.5. That is just to demonstrate the fact that we have a much less efficient economy.",

That is about US Dollars 3 billion of savings per annum. So, let us not fool ourselves. Good intentions are necessary. There is a lot of positivism and that is good.

These boats on an humanitarian mercy mission were forcibly halted by Israeli forces; the lead ship was stormed by Israeli Commandos killing at least 19 people of 581 people on board and many more were injured. The outcry has been universal. It is not only the Arab countries to varying degree hostile to Israel that are united in their indignation. Turkey was one of the Israel's few friends in the region; but relations, already deteriorating, are now at rock bottom. The Turkish Prime Minister described attack as 'state terrorism'. As a non-aligned country and a member of the UN, Sri Lanka has always condemned aggressions of all forms. The World Body should take appropriate actions to punish the culprits in this instance and without any further delay implement Resolution No. 242 and other connected resolutions theretofore and force the Jewish State to steadfastly adhere to them in the interest of world peace.\" Sir, this aggression is continuing in the land of Palestinians for over 60 years. How lucky and fortunate we are in that we have a very bold and able Leader, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ended the 30-year long war in our country, where people have been killed by the barbaric LTTE forces. This is not a new phenomenon as far as Israel Zionist State is concerned. This State was forcibly implanted in the heart of the Arab land by their masters, the colonial powers. In a macabre advertising campaign similar to their European tormentors, the Jews loaded 25 male villagers into trucks and paraded them through Jerusalem. They then took them to a stone quarry where they shot them to death in Nazi-like fashion. The message was very clear, \"leave Palestine or the same fate awaits you\". The massacre of Palestinians at Deir Yassin is one of the most significant events or disgraceful events in the 20th Century. This is not because of its size or its brutality, but because it stands as the starkest early warning of a calculated plan to depopulate over 400 Arab villages and the expulsion of over 700,000 Palestinians from their lands on which they had lived since time began. This expulsion was to make room for European Jews. There was the Protocol of Zionists, you know, Sir. They have chosen a land to settle the Jews who were scattered throughout the world by the Nazi tormentors in the Hitlers Army in the American soil and even in Africa. But, these powers saw to it that they came and planted these people forcibly in the land of the Arabs. Today, no trace of the villages exist. Those villages are no more. Its centre is now called, Givat Shaul Bet, which is inhabited by Jews from Poland, Romania and Slovakia. There was an interesting article, Sir, titled \"Naqba The Palestinian Catastrophe\" in the \"Daily News\" of 26.05.2010 written by a famous writer on International",

Now, Sir, there is a history behind the struggle on behalf of the Palestinians in our country. It did not begin yesterday or day before yesterday. During 1947-1948, when this land was bisected there were mass rallies in Sri Lanka organized under the leadership of a great national hero, Dr. T.B. Jayah. Page 87 of the Book titled \"A Life Serene, written by Enver C. Ahlip, states, I quote: The Khilafat Movement was the first important occasion, after the affair of the Fez, when Muslim solidarity was demonstrated in all its strength. It also brought the Sinhalese and the Muslims together on one platform . This is most significant, Sir. . revealing an identity of purpose in the pursuit of universal peace and justice. But when the Allies sought to partition Palestine under cover of the United Nations Organisation, the anger of the Sinhalese and the Muslims of Sri Lanka knew no bounds. The anger of the Sinhalese and the Muslims was rightly recorded by one of the most brilliant scholars and writers in this country, Mr. Enver C. Ahlip, a son-in-law of the late Dr. T.B. Jayah. This is very revealing, Sir. Then the meeting was held at the Maradana Mosque grounds. Sir, I again quote page 87: .Sir Mohamed Macan Markar presided. Jayah moved the Resolution: This Mass meeting of Muslims strongly condemns and rejects the Report of the Anglo American Commission on Palestine and emphatically demands the immediate establishment of Palestine as an independent Arab State. Ceylon Daily News of May 1946 reports; 'Mr. Donald Obeysekera.. \" He was another great Sinhalese, a nationalist and a Sri Lankan writer. \".... said that the Palestine question received the support and sympathy of not only the Muslims but of the entire Sinhalese population of Ceylon.' That has been because we were fighting for the oppressed masses internationally wherever they may live. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, when he was a back-bencher in Parliament, heeded to the call of Dr. Thilak Jayasinghe, and another prolific writer, Latheef Farook, and accepted the Chairmanship of the Sri Lanka-Palestine Solidarity Association in 1976 when others worthy of their names refused to accept that post. This is what Mr. Donald Obeysekera says, I quote:",

Haj Ameen-al-Hussaini was the Grand Mufti of Palestine. I had the privilege of meeting him in Beirut when he was living there. He was a great man, a great Mujahid in the cause of humanity. We were a colonial country at that time. But, that the money could be sent to new Grand Mufti appointed by the British Authorities in Palestine. We refused to do this and the Hon. D.S. Senanayake, compromised by agreeing to send lakhs of rupees to the Palestinian Refugee Fund and it was sent as a contribution from the Ceylon Government. That was the influencing factor of Dr. T. B.

There are various views expressed on this, ably by one of the erudite scholars, S.K. Shahul Hameed of Kayalpatinam in India. This is what this magazine states, Sir. I quote: JEWISH CONSPIRACIES UNEARTHED The website of Ove Sviden, 73, a Swedish politician describes the conspiracies of Jews. Who won the Second World War? The Jews! They got a state. A little remnant of a people gets a country. Its not a coincidence, Sviden asserted. On 9/11 the politician described on his website how the construction of the World Trade Centre was a project dear to the heart of banking mogul David Rockfeller. But in a bid to 'kill his darlings', the ageing patriarch had the iconic twin towers destroyed. 'As a Swede its hard to understand the Jewish belief that a victim is necessary if anything is to be gained. But for David Rockefeller this could serve as a diversion and alibi for the person who benefited most from the events of September 9th [sic]2001,' he writes. So both the Holocaust and 9/11 were Jewish conspiracies according to this Swedish politician.",

That much for the free world and the free thinking, Sir. We are far ahead of all the international communities and countries. Thank you very much. * : : Document tabled : Naqba The Palestinian catastrophe, Daily News 26-05-2010 It I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. There has been Anti - Samitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country why would they accept that? - David Ben Gurion Hameed Abdul Karim Holocaust is the word the Jews uses to describe Nazi Germanys incineration and expulsion of their people. Naqba or dispossession is the word the Palestinians have coined to describe the slaughter and expulsion of their people by the Zionist Jews in Occupied Palestine in 1948. Europes crimes against the Jewish people have ended. Israels atrocities against the Palestinian people continue unabated backed by the very same Western nations that committed the crimes against the Jews. The Jews who left Germany and parts of Europe have returned to their homes as it were. No such luck for the Palestinians though. Under Israels draconian and democratic Law of Return no Palestinian can come back to his land of birth. In technical terms this law is actually the Law of No Return for the Palestinians. The Palestinians have become terrorists or Islamic extremists - even though there are numerous Christians in the resistance movement - for daring to regain their lost land, This then is the strange quirk of fate that a miserable people are faced with and it stinks of hypocrisy. Taking a leaf from western nations the Zionist Jews occupying Palestine have done and continue to do the same thing to the Palestinians what Germany and other European nations did to them. But unlike the propaganda that has quite rightly condemned Germany for its crimes against the Jewish people, the Israeli white Washing Industry has converted its atrocities against the Palestinian people as an act of virtue especially in the West. Israel has become the Wests pet state an outpost of Western civilization as some Western leaders have put it. The Ethnic cleansing begins It all began 1948 when Israel declared its independence form nobody in particular. But the actual ethnic cleansing of Palestine had started much earlier though in small doses of terrorist acts by the various Jewish terror gangs which included the Haganah, the Irgun and the Stern Gang.",

    "text": "The campaign gathered momentum with the slaughter of the inhabitants of Deir Yassin on Friday April 18, 1948 where more than 254 men, women and children were gunned down by the terror gan headed by Menachem Begin who later went on to become Israels Prime Minister. He was also awarded the Nobel Peace prize! When Begin carried out this atrocity he was heeding Ben-Gurions advice who had said We must use terror, assassination, intimidation, land confiscation, and the cutting of all social services to rid the land of its Arab population. Today Ben Gurion, a polish citizen, is referred to as a statesman in the Western world. However, he didnt get the Nobel Peace prize. The Zionists agenda to expel Palestinians from their land came under Plan Dalet which was drawn up by David Ben Gurion. Blue print for ethnic cleansing On March 10, 1948 the plan was put into actions and the first targets were the urban centres of Palestine, which had all been occupied by the end of April of that year. In the first phase of the operation about 250,000 Palestinians were uprooted. All such expulsions were accompanied by massacres of which Deir Yassin was just one. Like the Nazis, the Zionist leaders made no bones about their wicked intentions and had declared their intention to take over Palestine and expel the indigenous population by sheer brute force. Weeks before the UN General Assembly Resolution, Ben Gurion had spelled out in the clearest possible terms that he wanted an exclusive Jewish state and to achieve that objective it was necessary to expel the indigenous Arab population both Christian and Muslim. Village of Sirin Sirin had a mixed population of Christians and Mulims like most other villages. The inhabitants there had hoped the Jews would spare them since they had not offered any resistance. They were being nave. Plan Dalet had envisioned the complete elimination of all Palestinians from their ancestral home be it Christian or Muslim. The Jews would not tolerate any presence of Goyim (gentiles) in Israel the state of Jews and jews alone. One day the Jews came, the same way the Nazis had come for them in Europe only about three years before, The villagers of Sirin didnt put up a fight. They had nothing to fight with. The Jewish terror gangs gathered the Muslims and Christians and ordered them to leave. They then demolished the mosque, the church and the Christian monastery together with all the houses. End of Sirin. Fifth column The Zionist Jews worried that if the Arabs were permitted to live in their homes in what was to become Israel, they might become a fifth column. Today the remaining Palestinians inside the UN declared Israel and Israeli Occupied Palestine Ben Gurions nightmare is fast beginning to take shape, The demographic bomb or the balance as Israel calls it, is ticking. This is why Israel continues to build more settlements in Occupied Palestine so as create more facts on the ground in its mad desire to get rid of the Palestinians from what they say is a land God gave them. Thats their Final Solution to the menace of Goyim in the land of their holy God. In particular it had very great significance for the Muslim commuity. The deep emotions and feeling of solidarity survived the failure of the Khilafat movement and were, as will appear later, the factor that contributed to the over - whelming support for a united Muslim demand for freedom. Had not Jayah built up this feeling of solidarity in the Khilafat movement, in anti partition of Palestine movement and in the support of Pakistan the Muslim community whould have broken up into mutually exclusive groups and in their disunity failed to make any lasting contribution to their country. The Khilafat Movement was the first important occasion, after the affair of the Fez, when Muslim solidarity was demonstrated in all its strength. It also brought the Sinhalese and the Muslims together on one platform revealing and identity of purpose in the pursuit of universal peace and justice. But when the Allies sought to partition Palestine under cover of the United Nations Organisation, the anger of the Sinhalese and the Muslims of Sri Lanka knew no bounds. It was a flagrant perversion of the very",

Mass meetings were held everywhere At the meeting held in the grounds of the Maradana Mosque Sir Mohamed Macan Markar presided. Jayah moved the Resolution: This Mass meeting of Muslims strongly condemns and rejects the Report of the Anglo American Commission on Palestine and emphatically demands the immediate establishment of Palestine as an independent Arab State. Ceylon Daily News of May 1946 reports; Mr. Donald Obeysekera said that the Palestine question received the support and sympathy of not only the Muslims but of the entire Sinhalese population of Ceylon. There was an organized attempt to throw the Jews into Palestine, Whether the Arabs wished it or not. He asked why the Jews could not be settled in the vast tract of country in Australia, Canada and South Africa. It was an obomimable injustice to keep those people in Palestine. Dr. M. C. M. Kaleel describes the Anti Partition protest thus; In 1942 when the U.N.O. decided to partition Palestine and hand over one portion to the Zionists and the other to the Palestine Arabs, the league organized an Anti partition protest Meeting at Maradana Mosque Grounds with sir Mohamed Macan Markar in the Chair. Telegrams were sent to the U.N.O., the British Government who held Palestine as a mandated territory and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem who had written to the League asking for assistance to purchase arms to fight the Jews who were massacreing the Muslims and driving them away from their hearth and home. We set about collecting funds immediately and applied to the Ceylon Government for permission to send the money to the Grand Mufti Mr. D. S. Senanayake, the Prime Minister, who also held the portfolio of the External Ministry, confidentially told us that the British High Commissioner had informed him that any money sent to Ameenul Hussaini would be considered and unfriendly act by the British Government, but that the money could be sent to the new Grand Mufti appointed by the British authorities in Palestine We refused to do this and D. S. Senanayake compromised by agreeing to send lakh of rupees to the Palestinian Refugee Fund and it was sent as a contribution from the Ceylon Government. An Anti Partition of Palestine Committee was formed with Jayah as Chairman, Dr. M. C. M. Kaleel as Hony. Secretary and T. Suby as Hony. Treasurer. Such indignation was caused by this act of brigandage that protest meetings were held all over the isaand. Some of the island wide meetings were held at Jumma Mosque, Aranayake, Dippitya Moors Association, Aranayake, Nawala Mosque, Avissawella, Jummah Mosque, Anuradhapura, Veyangale Muslim Association, Agalawatte, Jummah Mosque, Bandarawela, Muslim Youth League, Chilaw, Padinawela Jummah Mosque, Boragas, Muslim League, Dickwella, Jummah Mosque, Eheliyagoda, Muslim Youth League, Galle, Illawaura Jummah Mosque, Gampola, Mass Meeting of Muslims, Gampola, Muslim League, Galaha, Jummah Mosque, Hambantota, Muslim League, Hali Ella, Mass Meeting of Muslims, Haputale, New Jummah mosque, Jaffna, Thaika Mosque, Kandy, Market Jummah, Kandy, Hanafi Mosque, Kandy Katukelle Jummah Mosque, Kandy, Jummah, Mosque, Katugastota and at many other Mosques and society Headquarters. Of significance is the fact that Tall communities participated in denouncing the partition of Palestine. He said his two grandchildren had boarded the mercy vessel from a port in Istanbul as they were deeply concemed about the plight of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip which has been virtually cut-off from the rest of the world by Israel for the past three years. At least nine people were killed and more than hundred injured in the bloody raid which Israel justified saying it acted in self defence. But the United Nations and several countries severely condemned the attack. Australian newspapers quoted the youths father Luqman Talib, who rushed from Kuwait to his sons bedside, as saying that the lack of information about surgery performed in Israel was now complicating his sons treatment.",

    "text": "Mr. Presiding Member, in an interview she gave to the media, she has very categorically stated that Israelis must get out of Palestine and because of that, now the White House has asked for her resignation. It is not the first time in which perhaps somebody is resigning for having said something which is unpalatable to the Israelis or for the Jewish lobby but this is at a time when such a horrendous crime has happened in the high seas. At least, there are some conscientious US citizens, and particularly those conscientious people who are inside the White House working for the administration, are taking such steps. When she was asked, Is there any criticism that you want to level against the Israelis? she went to the extent of saying, Ask them to get out of Palestine, they are invaders and they have no right to remain there. This is the land of the Palestinians and this is not Germany or Poland. Then, the interviewer asked her, Where do you want the Israelis to go? She has said, Ask them to go anywhere. They can go to Poland, Germany or to America. They can go wherever. This is a very bold statement by a White House journalist and therefore I would like to pay my tribute to this grand old lady of 89 years. I do not know how she is serving the White House at this age. She must have been a clever woman to have got this appointment but yet, I must salute her for her courage of convictions. Having said that, Mr. Presiding Member, let us remember, of course, that the condemning of Israel we have done several times. But then, in this case, look at the attitude of the United States of America. Look at the history, the way in which they have backed the Israelis against all the barbaric actions they have been involved in. Since 1972, the United States has used its veto power in the UN Security Council on more than 40 occasions to protect Israel from international censure. Such is the protectionist attitude which gives patronage to State terrorism of the Israelis, to suppress the liberation struggle of the Palestinians. Now look at this instance. How can the United States be an honest broker in this conflict in",

All norms of international law were breached in the mid-seas by the Israeli Forces. This has happened. The parties involved are: one is Turkey, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - NATO - perhaps the only country in that region which had diplomatic relations with Israel. This incident has happened and the United States goes to the extent of watering down the Resolution in the Security Council and finally what has come out of it is virtually, sweet nothing; a virtual carte blanche for them to engage in some kind of an internal inquiry of all sorts. That has been criticized even by the Israeli press. At least because of the freedom of the press in Israel, some of the newspapers have been very forthright in condemning the Government and its action for having jeopardized at least the remaining remnants of the peace process. Now, just imagine if an attack of this nature was carried out by Iran or if it was the Iranian Navy that bordered the ship. If the Turkish ship was going somewhere and if the Iranian Navy bordered the ship and engaged in an act of this nature, what would the US do? Because it is a NATO country, under the rules of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it would have been enough justification for the Americans to invade Iran along with the NATO. That would have been the ultimate result, if at all, it happened. Now, all these sanctions are for countries like Iran. They have now passed sanctions on them for having dared the West about their right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes but, no such strictures or bans on Israel. As a matter of fact, several Resolutions of the Security Council had been vetoed by the United States and that is what that has resulted in this arrogance of the Israelis.",

Because of the fall-out of this incident, in order to avoid domestic uprisings, they have immediately announced that they are re-opening the Rafah Border Crossing but this is in order, just to placate the public sentiments for the time being. It will not be long before the Egyptians, again under pressure from the Americans and the Israelis, will go back to closing the borders, heaping the hardships and increasing the misery of these people in the Gaza Strip. Therefore, I am not for a moment willing to whitewash the attitude of countries like Egypt. I think they must bow down to public sentiment and begin to support a legitimate cause of the Palestinians. Turkey, having being a member country of the NATO of late, has taken a principle stand. I am very proud of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan who had a heated argument over Israels war on Gaza and he, in fact walked out sometime ago from a conference in protest, and thereon started the diplomatic turmoil with the Israelis. Since then, Turkey has been taking a very progressive and forthright attitude towards the barbaric actions of the Israelis as regards the occupied Palestine. Having said all this, I must also say a few things about the Sri Lankan policy. My good Friend, the Hon. A.H.M. Azwer did trace the historic happenings and involvement of individuals in the issue relating to the support for the Palestinian cause in this country. But, when you look at the Statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, it was a very brief one. And, subsequently at the UN Human Rights Council, the Hon. Attorney-General appeared to have condemned this attack and there was a news item. There are four limbs in that Statement. It states that the attack has caused grave distress to Sri Lanka and then it deeply regrets the loss of life and then there is a condemnation of the indiscriminate use of force to prevent humanitarian aid being delivered to these beleaguered people under occupation and finally there is an extension of sympathies to the grieving families. We have perhaps, joined the international chorus and have not said anything more or anything less. But, we must remember one thing, perhaps, the Hon. Azwer will know, that since 1989, we have unilaterally recognized the State of Palestine and we must thank the former President R. Premadasa for having extended this unilateral recognition of the State of Palestine. It is a fact that has now been established and we have also got our own Consulate in Ramallah. So, therefore, the Ministry of External Affairs is now following another four-tier approach which is also an established approach: the support for the two-state solution, call for end of occupation; to respect the right of return of all refugees; to respect and safeguard all places of worship and areas of habitation without any attempt to alter the demography by settlements. These are all principles which we have maintained in our diplomatic approach to the resolution of the issue of the stateless people of Palestine. But, then,",

    "text": "we appear to have forgotten when we talk about the two-state solution that we have long ago, in 1989, virtually recognized the State of Palestine unilaterally. That was a unique position, a very brave position that the late President Premadasa took, in extending that recognition. But, then the Ministry of External Affairs appears to have lost sight of that particular fact when it keeps talking about the support for the two-state solution. Well, it simply seemed to be synchronizing with the international sentiment regarding the two-state solution since the Americans are the main architects behind that solution. But, then see the attitude of the Obama Administration. He was due to take office on the 20th of January and the Israel started attacking the Gaza Strip and in cold blood, defenceless people of Gaza have been killed; 1,500 people have been killed, 500 infants have been killed, old and feeble people have been killed, hundreds of thousands of people had lost their livelihoods, their houses were reduced to rubble. President Obama was waiting to take his oaths on the 20th of January. He said sweet nothing. He simply waited until he takes oaths and what did he do after taking oaths? They just stood and watched when all these horrendous things were happening. They did not call for a ceasefire, nor did they rush to call a meeting of the Security Council as they would, if at all, it happened in other areas which are not too friendly towards them. Look at the UN report of the last year. The UN report last year confirmed that Israel had committed war crimes during the Gaza War. What did the Obama Administration do? The officials, including Mr. George Mitchell who is the Special Peace Envoy, they all got together and accused the UN of having prepared the Report which was one-sided. That was the attitude of the Americans towards their pet State, which had been created purely with an intention of dividing and ruling the Middle East and up to date, they have succeeded in their attempts and now despite mumbling certain platitudes on and off, they have been consistent in their attitude in supporting the Israelis to do whatever they wished.",

Well, they are again trying to divide the Hamas from the PLO, the fraction led by the President of Palestine. And then, they simply try to give the impression that it is because of the manner in which the Hamas is behaving and refusing to accept the State of Israel. How do we expect them to recognize the State of Israel when it is at war, when it is continuing to be involved in aggression against these innocent people? Therefore, I would join this House in commending this Motion and expect my good Friend, the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena to state his position on behalf of the Government. Thank you. ( )",

Mr. Presiding Member, the Israeli military attack on the flotilla of ships carrying aid to Gaza on 31st May, 2010 resulted in the killing of several people, injuries to many, and the arrest of hundreds of persons who had been on board by Israeli Security Forces. The international community has unreservedly condemned this incident, specially noting that it had taken place in the international waters. The UN Security Council issued a statement deploring this incident and urging, among other things, for consular assistance and access to those who were held in detention and for the release of those who were injured as well as detained by Israel. The Security Council also called for the amelioration of the conditions of life in Gaza which has been subjected to Israeli military blockade for over three years. The Government of Sri Lanka joins the international community in condemning these highly abominable attacks. A Statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs clearly stated that the attack had caused a grave distress to the Government and the people of Sri Lanka. The Government called for expeditious action by Israel to relieve the sufferings of those who were affected by the incident. In the meantime, the Leader of the Delegation of Sri Lanka to the Human Rights Council also made a Statement at the Special Debate of the Human Rights",

    "text": "Council in Geneva on 1st June, 2010. While condemning the attacks, the statement urged the international community to address the humanitarian situation in the occupied territories and to alleviate the sufferings of the Palestinian people. Today, I will table in this House, the text of the Statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of Sri Lanka and the text of the Statement delivered by the Leader of the Sri Lanka Delegation to the Human Rights Council. Sir, it is well-known that Sri Lankas position on the question of Palestine and on the Middle East peace process is one shared by countries within the Non-Aligned Movement and outside. We have strongly articulated and advocated the position that the resolution to the question of Palestine in all its aspects consisted in the recognition and realization of inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, which have been denied by Israel for well over six decades. Our position is consistent with \"Mahinda Chintana\", the vision of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is also reflective of our deep-rooted relationship with the people of the Middle East, which spans several centuries. Sri Lanka continues to maintain its principle stance, that sustained peace in the Middle East is achievable only through just and fair solution based on the two States, Israel and Palestine, co-existing with each other within secure and internationally recognized borders. Sir, the media has reported over the weekend that two persons of Sri Lankan origin holding Australian nationality had also come under Israeli attack while on board the ships bound for Gaza. One of the two has been severely injured in the attack and is reported to be receiving medical treatment in Istanbul. Sri Lanka is concerned about their welfare, being persons of Sri Lankan origin. The Ministry of External Affairs, through its representatives abroad as well as directly, remains in touch with the authorities of Turkey and Australia in order to ascertain their present condition. Sir, I take this opportunity to reiterate Sri Lankas outright rejection of the indiscriminate use of force to prevent the carriage of aid to the long- suffering people of Palestine. We urge the Government of Israel to work towards expeditious resumption of the dialogue process with the Palestinians. It is imperative now to actively pursue a just and fair solution aimed at bringing lasting peace and stability to the Middle East, on the basis of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side within secure and internationally-recognized borders. Such an enduring and peaceful solution will bring not only normalcy to the lives of the Palestinian people, but also peace and prosperity to all including the Israelis, as well as to the greater Middle-Eastern region.",
