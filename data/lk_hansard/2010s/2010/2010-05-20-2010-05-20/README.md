Mr. Speaker, let us look at the nature of the Question. He is not asking for the strength of every regiment.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

Why not?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) It states "the number of Air Force personnel in a regiment...." ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

No, no.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) He is asking for the number of Air Force personnel in a regiment.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) " ?" . (1) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . It states, the number of Air Force personnel in a regiment. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) " ?" . , you have anything between 700 to 900 personnel. I think our battalions are of strength and each regiment today seems to be having at least 10 or 12 battalions. That is nothing secret; that is well known. If you go and look at a parade, you get the first battalion, Sinha Regiment, second battalion, Sinha Regiment and so on.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , - . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised. . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, let us get this corrected. There are Standing Orders under which you are bound to conduct the Business of the House. I refer to Standing Order Nos. 26, 27 and 28 regarding Questions.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , .

2010 20 743 744

. . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) According to Standing Order No. 28(1), one Member can ask only three Supplementary Questions pertaining to the main Question. Now the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is setting a bad example by getting up and speaking on these matters. He should know what the Question is. Sir, let us get this matter cleared.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition should know better, that when an Hon. Member gets up to raise a point of Order- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I am raising a point of Order. . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Standing Orders that I have referred to are very clear. We are bound to conduct the Business of this House according to the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

What is the Standing Order?

. . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

I am referring to Standing Order Nos. 26, 27 and 28. The Standing Order No. 28 (1) states, I quote: not more than three supplementary questions shall be asked on any answer.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am not asking Supplementary Questions. I am raising only a point of Order.

. . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Standing Order No. 28(2) states, I quote : A supplementary question must not introduce matter not included in the original question. Sir, this is very clear and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition or any other Hon. Member does not have the right to speak on the Supplementary Questions asked by an Hon. Member. You are allowed to ask only three Supplementary Questions. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I want to mention one matter. The Hon. Leader of the House or the Hon. Leader of the Opposition or the officers of Parliament can assist you in conducting the Business of the House. So, I have just mentioned it here. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake did not ask about different regiments or battalions. - [ Interruption.] Then, the Hon. Minister should not answer because that is something related to security. But, this is a normal Question. These facts are known just as much as the distance from Colombo to Kandy is 72 miles. So, just answer that Question.

Hon. Speaker, I asked your permission to make a statement before the Vote of Condolence is taken up. In the meantime, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake got up and made a statement as if we are deaf and blind to this important issue.

749 750

Anyway, I must tell him that I had already asked for permission to make a Statement. - [Interruption.] We are already concerned about it. That is why I asked for special permission from you to make this statement so that the House will know exactly what is happening. Hon. Speaker, this is the first time that I have got the opportunity to speak in this House after your election as the Speaker. Let me, therefore, in the first instance, offer my heartiest congratulations to you on your election to the high office of Speaker of this august Assembly. I am well aware of your capacity to serve as the custodian of the Rights and Privileges of the Members of this House and be just by all Hon. Members. May I wish you, all success. As a senior Member of this House, I am proud and privileged to have been re-elected to sit together with the large number of newly-elected youthful and energetic Members, who, I am sure, will be the driving force of the revolutionary changes in the political structure of our land under the marvellous leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Let me also take this opportunity to thank the voters of the Colombo District who reaffirmed their confidence in me and re-elected me to this historic Parliament that has laid the foundation to usher in a golden era of development, prosperity and better living standards for all our people. However, I am deeply concerned about the adverse weather conditions that have caused havoc in the country. That is no political issue. I now wish to make a Statement on the prevailing situation in the country. Since I took over this Ministry, I called for a series of meetings from the 3rd to the 7th of May, 2010 to identify short as well as long-term measures required to mitigate floods in the Colombo District, especially in the Colombo Municipal Council area and the areas of the Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, the Maharagama UC, the Kesbewa UC, the Boralesgamuwa UC and the Kolonnawa Pradeshiya Sabha. During those meetings attended by grass-roots level politicians and officials of all relevant agencies, plans were made for short and long-term measures for the mitigation of floods as we were expecting a spell of heavy rain with the onset of the monsoon around the third week of May, 2010. It was noted that most of the canals and drainage lines were heavily silted due to the disposal of solid waste into these drainage paths. Short-term work plans were developed with the relevant officials and agreement was reached to meet on a fortnightly basis for monitoring. However, the unexpected rain spell started on the 16th due to the formation of a depression in the Bay of Bengal and continued. The rainfall varied from 200 mm to 330 mm in the affected areas, in Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara and Galle Districts and was very high compared to the previous records.

My intention, from the beginning, was to make as much effort as I can to mitigate the flood disaster rather than to provide food and relief services. I have already agreed to provide financial resources for mitigation activities such as cleaning of canals et cetera. I also have to state that my predecessor, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, had initiated a programme of cleaning canals in all the districts at a cost of approximately Rs. 300 million. However, it is noted that due to inadequate maintenance of canals and drains, the benefit of cleaning had not been properly felt by the people living in those districts. Today, there are 502,917 people from Colombo, Gamapaha and Kalutara Districts affected by floods. In Colombo, the number is 154, 121, in Gampaha, 179, 974, in Kalutara, 61, 755 and in Galle, 97, 343. Today, the highest number of affected people are in Gampaha. On the instructions of His Excellency the President, a total of Rs. 25.3 million has been released to the respective District Secretaries for relief services. Cooked meals are being provided to the victims. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa was able to arrange with the World Food Programme to supply dry rations. In addition, a further amount of Rs. 2.3 million was released to the District Secretaries for emergency response and to hire equipment and labour for the cleaning of blocked canals. A meeting was convened by His Excellency the President on 18th afternoon, just after he returned from a state visit to the Republic of Iran, to discuss the situation. Instructions were issued at that meeting for the District Secretaries to provide cooked food and dry rations to victims without any delay. My Ministry is also coordinating the distribution of other relief items required by all affected families. His Excellency the President has summoned all heads of departments and corporations responsible for maintaining canals and drains and has given instructions to take immediate action to clean blocked drains on a priority basis to drain off rainwater from severely affected areas within the next few days. His Excellency the President has also instructed the officials to closely monitor the progress of the work undertaken by various agencies. The RDA was given specific instructions to open canal outlets in the Seeduwa area to ensure access to the Bandaranaike International Airport. I visited with the officials of my Ministry, the flooded areas in Colombo such as, Mattakkuliya, Modera, Thotalanga, Mahawatta, Stace Road, Maligawatta and other areas yesterday. I came to know that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and quite a number of Ministers also had visited those areas. Some people have engaged in shramadanas. I have asked for the support of the communities living in those areas to clean out small drains and prevent dumping of waste into drains and canals. Those engaged in shramadana work will be provided with financial benefits including food items.

[ . . . )

2010 20 751 752

The Ministry has already made arrangements to provide gumboots and gloves to those engaged in cleaning operations. I hope with the support of all citizens of Colombo, I would be able to make the Colombo City a safe place, avoid disaster and create a pleasant environment. Todays latest weather forecast from the Met Department and the flood warning from the Irrigation Department indicate that the rain will continue in the Ratnapura and Kalutara Districts. In the Ratnapura and Kalutara Towns, water levels have reached minor flood level. Rain is also continuing in the Matara District and the water level of the Nilwala is reaching minor flood level. If the present weather continues, major floods could be expected in the Ratnapura and Kalutara Districts. The Ministry is making arrangements to face the situation with the assistance of the army, the police, government organizations, local authorities and relief services organizations. I must also thank the armed services for the assistance they have given up to now and all the citizens who have participated in looking after the interests of the flood victims. Thank you.

"We have a cordial relationship with the Sinhalese community in this area."

This relationship was built by the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana. "This unity is very important as day in day out all our dealings are with the majority community. Deep South is voicing this. Even in the gem industry the difficult part is performed by them in the gem pit. In order to strengthen our relationship, our Association is conducting a Dansal on Vesak days." Hon. Speaker, he told me even to invite you and all the Hon. Members including the Leader of the Opposition and the Chief Opposition Whip to the next Dansala. This is the relationship, the cordiality that the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana endeavoured to build in this country.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof) Rajiva Wijesinha) , . . Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was very much moved by the mention by our Hon. Member from Galle of the famous or rather infamous by-elections of 1983 when his father, the late Hon. Richard Pathirana, was one of the few to triumph against the juggernaut of the then Government. It was shocking, Mr. Deputy Chairman, to note that one of my new Fellow Members referred approvingly to our first Executive President, J.R. Jayewardene, as a model to be emulated. I hope that memories of what happened in the 1980s, when democracy was treated with contempt, will introduce a proper understanding of political principles and persuade all of us embarking on a political career of the dangers of authoritarianism. Those by-elections, Mr. Deputy Chairman, were selective, a travesty of the pledge of the then President to clear out the rotten elements of his Government. In fact, he worked out a formula that got rid of only one Minister, perhaps his most decent. The rest, realizing that Dr. Atapattu did not know how to win elections when the people wanted to vote for a different party, got together to ensure victory and they went down en masse to Beliatta to ensure the defeat of the candidate, the present President, whose victory they feared most in those dark days. It was in such a context that the Hon. Richard Pathirana managed to win the Akmeemana seat. Though new to Parliament, he succeeded with that wonderful voice and that commitment to make the sort of impact that a tiny opposition had failed to do over the preceding six years. This was more important, since after it had perpetrated the horrors of July 1983, the Government then punished the Opposition. It not only proscribed the JVP and sent it underground but it also drove the TULF out of Parliament. Thus it prevented democratic presentation of Tamil grievances which of course added to the appeal and therefore the strength of terrorists. It was in such a climate of repression, of the abuse of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Emergency Regulations against the democratic Opposition that the late Hon. Richard Pathirana was able to repeat his victory even more remarkably. In a further by-election in 1986, there were even fewer seats in which the UNP could concentrate its bulldozers. I recall visiting the area at that time, along with my friend, the late Richard de Zoysa, and indeed meeting the current Leader of the Opposition there at the Tisara Hotel. He

used to be a more aggressive campaigner in those days, and we must be grateful therefore for his transition since then to a more gentlemanly style of politics. The Hon. Richard Pathirana won that by-election. He became a future star of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. His first portfolio was that of Education, and it was because he established universities in previously neglected areas that I myself was able to work in perhaps our most beautiful campus, that of Sabaragamuwa University in Belihuloya. He encouraged a new approach to university curricula, to introduce soft skills, and it was perhaps because of that approach that even our Arts students have had a better record of employment, that products of many of the new universities which followed old and outdated colonial curricular could not manage. It was in his time too that a degree programme was started at the Sri Lanka Military Academy, against the wishes of some academics and some officers. Overcoming such prejudices on either side was not easy, but I believe the young officers who fought so bravely and so intelligently in the recent battles justified the determination of the Ministry under the Hon. Richard Pathirana to expand the reach of higher education. I sincerely hope the current Minister will follow that trend, as he indicated yesterday that he would do, and ensure not just degrees, but appropriate higher training, is made available to other professionals too, and in particular our Police Force. The first University Convocation I attended at Belihuloya was in 1998, and I am pleased that our university was able to show its gratitude to the Hon. Richard Pathirana for his vision by conferring an Honorary Degree on him. The Sabaragamuwa University has not had many politicians at its convocations, but I am pleased that another hero of 1983, the Chief Government Whip, also came, as did the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. As others have remarked, the Hon. Richard Pathirana was absolutely without any sense of racial prejudice, and he helped build up education in deprived areas all over the country. As my Friend, the irrepressible Honourable Member from the National List said, he was especially helpful to the Muslim community, and I was privileged to work for many years at the South Eastern University at Oluvil, where I found that many of the security guards came from Galle. I thought this strange, but they explained that the Galle Port was full of workers from Oluvil. I hope that the expansion in higher education that the Hon. Richard Pathirana initiated will be built on now, on a broader basis. I hope too, that the Public Sector reforms he was concerned with, as Minister of Public Administration, but did not have time to pursue, will be carried forward through the dedicated Ministry that we now have for that purpose headed by the Statesman in this

781 782

[ () ]

Chamber who is most experienced in public governance. Public servants like politicians must be judged on performance, and perhaps the introduction of performance agreements will help in achieving the desired goals. Liberalism is devoted to reform, continuing reform based on changing social realities. Let me take this opportunity, Mr. Deputy Chairman, to record on the Floor of this House my congratulations to the Liberal Democratic Party of the United Kingdom, for once more entering government, after almost a century. I hope its tradition of constant reform, without disruptive revolution, will be taken further in the near future. In pursuit of reform then, Mr. Deputy Chairman, as for allother reasons, it is an honour to speak today in memory of someone who was a symbol of reform, as a young Member of Parliament challenging the established authority, as a Minister enhancing opportunities for those who had been deprived. I join with my Colleagues in extending my condolences to the family, in expressing satisfaction that the tradition of the late Hon. Richard Pathirana will be continued in this House, and in honouring his memory. Thank you, Sir. [. . 11.59] ( )

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, since my computing skills are limited, I was able to prepare a speech only in English and, Sir, with your permission, I will read it out. When I suggested this Adjournment Motion a couple of weeks back, I was worried about the state of education in this country. I feel more optimistic now, after hearing the forceful suggestions of the Minister of Education and the Minister of Higher Education yesterday and in particular, the determination to ensure greater access to quality tertiary level education to all our people. My one regret is that we did not yesterday also pay attention to the role of the Ministry of Youth Affairs in ensuring that we develop a modern education system. We have to recognize that education means not just academic learning but also the development of professional and vocational skills and the soft skills that will allow these too to be used productively. We need to promote variety in education, Mr. Deputy Chairman, recognizing that the role of the State is to ensure that no one is deprived of quality education because of a lack of resources but that the State should also encourage other initiatives. As the Hon. Minister of Higher Education pointed out yesterday, the State should monitor such initiatives to prevent exploitation and also take advantage of the benefits they provide for those who need support. Unfortunately, our system so far has relied on monopolies, monopoly of supply and monopoly of attitude. We have relied on traditional systems, generally outdated British systems that even the British do not use any more, and have resisted change. Sadly, much of the resistance to that change has come from a few students. They have imposed their will on others so that often the system has been disrupted and necessary changes sabotaged. Mr. Deputy Chairman, ragging is not only an obvious example of the violation of individual rights, it is also a method of ensuring submission. It targets the weak and the vulnerable in particular, and batters them into obedience. Year after year at my university, I have seen students forced to wear clothes of a particular sort, walk in a particular fashion, forced to eat food from common plates, forced into practices that strip them of their individuality. Then, they are forced to demonstrate against the authorities, forced to take up causes that they are of little concern to them, on the grounds that they must function as a monolithic group. Mr. Deputy Chairman, we must get rid of all monopolies in order to ensure that the talents of all our individuals can flourish. The time that is wasted on ragging is another element that destroys education. The habit of focused study is destroyed in a few weeks as children are traumatized and we hear from parents repeatedly about the suffering they undergo and they are terrorized into not even admitting

791 792

[ () ]

this when they are questioned. We only get to hear of the worst when you have physical fatalities, physical problems. Mr. Deputy Chairman, those who are hardest hit are the students of the Arts Faculties and many of them resort then to rote learning which, as we were told yesterday, is also sometimes encouraged by the school examination system. This is sad because when students come to university, they are bright and eager to learn in an adult way. Reducing them to dependence on their seniors and on notes means that many do not fulfil their full potential. But, we must also recognize that our academics too are sometimes at fault. Often they do not respond swiftly to the real problems students face. Our counselling systems are weak. Appointments to positions that require training and sensitivity are given for personal reasons. There is insufficient attention to professional development, but promotions and in fact confirmations are not based on performance but rather on grace and favour or simple long service. We also perhaps created a problem when we expanded universities swiftly, which was a very positive measure, but it led to many appointments to academic and administrative positions of personnel who were not of the highest calibre. Sometimes, when they get entrenched, they resent those who are brighter and more able, and the brightest of our students are often not given a chance because innovation and individuality is not encouraged. With this and other such problems, we have moved more slowly than we should have done on curriculum reform. In many universities, we still rely on the British view that the Advanced Level examination provided enough of a general education, whereas even in Britain now educationists are moving to other systems. We can deal with this at university by insisting on communication skills, problem-solving, decision-making, leadership-training and role-plays. If we continue to stress outdated theories and reproduce old lecture notes, students sometimes ask us to read them out at dictation pace so they can copy them down, this actually prevents the education that our students deserve. Such practices are not true of many academics most of whom work very hard, but it should be true of none. We can also introduce a novel approach through pre-university courses that could be conducted on a regional basis. Such courses should introduce social service projects that allow for productive group work. This, rather than combative political demonstrations, would be a better first experience for university students for working together with their fellows. Mr. Deputy Chairman, some sort of national service is perhaps an ideal we should move towards, given the importance of developing in our students a sense of responsibilities as well as rights. But, if that is too

complicated, opportunities to work and learn together in a disciplined environment would be a helpful prelude to university courses. We need, Mr. Deputy Chairman, to move towards new models. We have an excellent system of basic education in this country - we should not be ashamed of it - but we need in todays world to fine tune it, to maximize opportunities for all youngsters and particularly for those whose own resources are limited. We should seek through focusing on what is essential to allow students to enter the world of work early, to finish courses in the three years that is normal in Britain which has a similar Advanced Level system or to take split courses with credit for project work and professional assignments. What we need is not just learning but also skills and not just abilities but also initiative. We know that our students who do so well in other systems in other countries, are amongst the best in the world. They can live up to challenges. We should ensure that they are challenged productively, not through ragging, and we should get rid of the dead ends represented by ragging and the copying of lecture notes rather than productive and innovative learning. Thank you, Sir.

Is there anyone to second the Motion? . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have great pleasure in seconding the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha whose father is well-known to Parliament - he was one our best known Secretaries-General who served the House well. In following the footsteps of that great personage, his worthy son, Rajiva, has today found his proper place in this august Assembly. As we listened to him, it was very clear how well he waxed eloquent on the subject and his speech should be read in Hansard by academicians, educationists and also the student population. We are very fortunate to have intellectual giants in this Parliament taking their proper places. What a great pleasure to be associated with such great men! The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha is a man of peace, who spread the message of peace and helped the Peace Council and the Humanitarian Mission of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in several spheres in this regard. The Motion he has moved today is very timely and it is worthy to be given the utmost consideration and attention by our worthy and very good Friend, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the new Minister of Higher Education. I too, speaking on the subject of Higher Education, wish to

793 794

2010 20

take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake for he has proved his mettle in every portfolio that he handled in this House. I think the future destiny of higher education is very safe under his tutelage and guidance. Sir, speaking on education, I would like to quote from a book written by Mr. Enver C. Ahlip under the title, A Life Serene. One of our illustrious Speakers, the Hon. Deshamanya Alhaj M. A. Bakeer Markar, Speaker of Parliament from 1978 to 1983. He was emphatic in his evaluation of his Guru, Dr. T.B. Jayahs work, as teacher and educationist. He says, I quote: Dr. Jayah was not just a teacher, teaching class subjects with a view to success at examinations. His success in preparing students for examinations was extraordinary because of his absolute mastery of his subjects, his knowledge of teaching techniques to ensure quick and easy comprehension of his lessons, and his unfailing ability to achieve instant 'rapport' with his students'. 'What struck me as being the outstanding feature of his teaching was his insistence that the mind must be free to think for itself and not be conditioned by others.' That is the objective of education and that is very well written by Mr. Enver C. Ahlip in a fine book titled A Life Serene, A Life Sketch of Al Haj Dr. T.B. Jayah. It is worth quoting that passage here and I also want to quote another paragraph from the book. That he was......." That is, Dr. Jayah was. "............... the Guru of such outstanding revolutionary leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera, Phillip Gunawardena,...." And also of Mr. Robert Gunawardena - the Lion of Kotte - and Dr. S.A. Wickremasinghe. ".......while himself being a conservative in politics is ample evidence of his basic liberalism and humanism. I will not go into the rest of the paragraphs, Sir, due to lack of time. On the first day the Hon. S. B. Dissanayake came to Parliament after assuming duties as Minister, I discussed with him the condition of higher education, particularly in the Eastern Province. I discussed with him the present position of the South-Eastern University in Oluvil. The credit must go to the great man, Mr. M. H. M. Ashraff, for establishing that seat of learning in the East. He helped a great deal not only the Muslims, but also the Sinhalese and Tamil student population in the field of higher education. I requested that the Hon. S. B. Dissanayake visit the Oluvil University, the Eastern University at

Vantharumoolai in Batticaloa and also the Technical College in Samanthurai established by another great illustrious leader who adorned this House for 32 years, Mr. M. A. Abdul Majeed of Samanthurai. Then, there is also the Hardy Technical College in Ampara. It is a very important institution. I think with the establishment or the founding of the Galoya Scheme, the Britishers at that time found it fit to establish the Hardy Technical College in Ampara. The site of the University of Peradeniya was first identified by that great man Justice M. T. Akbar. He was the person who showed the site when Lord Soulbury who was heading that commission, visited the place. Then, there are other fields although those do not come under the purview of the Hon. Minister himself. There is a letter in my hand, written by the School Development Society of Zahira College, Kalmunai. Hon. Minister, I handed over a copy of that to your other half, the Minister of Education, Hon. Bandula Gunawardane. Sir, in this country there is a vacuum, a big gap, a yawning gap between female education and the availability of female principals. In the past, there were great women educationists in our country like Mrs. Jezima Ismail of Bambalapitiya Muslim Ladies' College, fame. Before that, Mrs. Aysesha Rauff, who established that at the premises donated by that great man, Sir Razik Fareed, a great philanthropist, a great Parliamentarian and a Statesman. He was in the National State Council. She was the first Muslim lady Deputy Mayor of Colombo. Then, there was Mrs. N. G Dain, Mrs. Mohideen, Hajiani Fathimuthu Halaldeen. The Khairiya School, Dematagoda, was established by three great ladies - Khalifa Thatha, Jennath Thatha and Oseela Thatha. Then, there was Mrs. Mariam Jayah, Mrs. Khalid, Mrs. Z. L. M. Fathima Mohamed, who was the Principal of Fathima College, at Bandaranaike Mawatha. Now, we have a dearth of such Principals. Sir, this lady, Mrs. S. H. M. M. A. Cader, who was an SLEAS - II officer, of Zahira College, Kalmunai is now on extension of service and the College is going through its great occasion, celebrations, anniversaries, and there is a request by the people of the Eastern Province, particularly by the SDS and others to get her service extended again because she has done a wonderful service to the Zahira College, Kalmunai, promoting even cricket there. This type of ladies are not found in common in our society. So, I would even ask the Hon. Minister of Higher Education to take this case up, and give the extension of service to her. Then, Sir, a large number of Muslim girls have found their way into the University of Sri Jayewardenepura and the other universities in Colombo and other areas. This phenomenon, the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha should know, marks the opening up of a new chapter in the Muslim female education of the country. They need certain facilities. When there are hundreds of Muslim female undergraduates, they need certain facilities for their prayers in the university premises. They have gone

795 796

even to the University of Ruhuna. There was a time not only the Muslims, but also the Tamils and the Sinhalese were scared to go to the University of Jaffna. But, they are all there following various degree courses. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) ! ! . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for granting me this time although I had not indicated early in the day that I wish to speak. I am glad that the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha has moved this Adjournment Motion with regard to ragging which, I also think is a serious indicator of the disease that has engulfed our country. It is an indicator that shows us that the student community, the future intelligentsia of this country, can go down to, stoop to levels unimaginable. Various things were described in this House today that in the process of what is described as ragging, very serious things are done; people are forced to do things against their will and their dignity is stripped. It is a very serious matter; it is not a matter of enjoyment. It is an indicator that we, as a society, as a whole, have a very serious problem. In July 1983, one afternoon, while I was preparing for my Advanced Level examination, mobs suddenly came to my house to attack us. I wondered how persons who lived down our road, persons who played cricket with us and persons whom we acquainted with so freely could come with weapons to attack us like that. I do not believe that good people can be provoked to such actions all of a sudden without a background and it is similar with university students who engage in ragging. There is something very radically wrong in the whole psyche of the country that manifests itself in actions like this. So, now that there is a Commission being appointed for reconciliation, I believe we need to search inwardly at our own psyches, our own beliefs and our own ethics to see how we allow ourselves to go down to levels such as this.

But, in this little time that is allotted to me, I would just like to flag one suggestion. That is, although we are so proud that there is a very rare opportunity in this country to go up to tertiary level of education, free of charge, it has its own negatives and one of those is that the students at tertiary level particularly, take it for granted that this is their right. They do not value what is given to them. My suggestion is that there must be some way of valuing, even in terms of money, what is given to them in university education. Even if no cash is transacted, there must be a sum of money that is set to be the cost to the State for a person to go through university education and that must be recovered in some way, either by pay-back system or by their efforts to the State so that they know that this has monetary value; without which they treat it very lightly. Too many strikes, too many demonstrations, too many staying-away from lectures and indulgence in this kind of heinous activity displays the serious flaw in character that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. So, I would just flag this and since my time is up, I will conclude thanking you again for the opportunity that was given to me this afternoon. Thank you very much. . . ( )
