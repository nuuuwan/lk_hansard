(iii) the amount paid for a family; and

(iv) the manner in which they are, at present, earning a living income?

(iii) who is in-charge of its safety;

(iv) whether any family has been returned with the gold items; and

(v) if so, their names?

(c) If not, why?

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement)

(a) (i) As at today, the total number of IDPs is 165,755.

(ii) The number of resettled persons is 544,494.

(iii) A sum of Rs. 25,000 is paid for a family.

(iv) Their livelihood or income sources are; self employment, fisheries and agriculture and some of them work as casual labourers.

The summary of resettled families and total IDP population is as follows:

(b) Not available.

(c) Not available.

(c) Not available.

The answers are not available because after they came to the IDP camps, we opened banks in the IDP camps. We cannot check their personal accounts. I think you have to ask that Question from the Ministry of Finance and Planning.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, is your Answer in reference to Question No. 10 (a), (b) or (c)? You just said that it is not possible to answer a part of the Question. Is it related to Question No. 10 (b) and (c)?

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Yes. Those things do not come under our purview. That is not our subject. We are only resettling these people. If you want to find out about their properties and other things, I think it is better to ask the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defence.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay. I appreciate the part of the Answer you have given. In your Answer, you say that there are 165,755 families still in IDP camps.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Yes. They are still in various places. There are 24,280 IDPs in Menik Farm. There are 67,428 IDPs in the Puttalam Camp. We are now resettling them. They are going to Jaffna now. Twenty years ago they came from that area. There are 64,924 people in the Jaffna Camp, who came from the High Security Zone area. We have also negotiated that matter with the Ministry of Defence. Now, they have allowed these people to go back. As soon as possible, we are going to resettle those people also.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I wish to ask my first Supplementary Question. These 165,755 people, when do you expect them to get into their normal livelihood and go back to the houses that they possessed before? You have hands-on experience on that. So, as a Tamil especially, when will these innocent people - whether it is Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims - be able to get back to their houses and live with dignity?

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) I think by the end of this year we are going to resettle 90 per cent of those people. There is no problem with regard to that. We will resettle the others also as soon as possible.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I will ask my second Supplementary Question. I will leave the third Supplementary Question to my Colleague, the Hon. A.Vinayagamoorthy.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . You said Rs. 25,000 was paid to a family. Is Rs. 25,000 given for a family on the day they go into the camp, and is that a flat figure or are they given Rs. 25,000 on a monthly basis?

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) No, no. Initially we give them Rs. 25,000. At the same time we coordinate with the other line Ministries. We have given self-employment facilities like fishery equipment. We are coordinating with other Ministries and have already started vocational training centres.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is a lump sum amount that is given to a family once and for all?

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) It is altogether Rs. 75,000. We have given them Rs. 25,000 and for the balance Rs. 50,000 we coordinate with other NGOs. We are issuing tin sheets and cement bags and other such assistance and equipment.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Can they live with that, Hon. Minister? I mean, the persons who have lost all their possessions, can they get back to their livelihood with just Rs. 25,000?

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) It is altogether Rs. 75,000, that includes their temporary shelter as well.

425 426

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is not by the Government, but by the NGOs?

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) No, we give them Rs. 25,000 and for the other things we coordinate with the NGOs.

Sir, the Constitution is very clear. The President can hold portfolios and he is the Executive. He appoints Ministers, Deputy Ministers and the nomenclature can get changed from time to time as Project Ministers, State Ministers et cetera.

So, Sir, this Motion that has been inveigled once again into the Order Book, I should submit, is unconstitutional because what is happening here is, you are challenging the Constitution. Sir, tomorrow the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake can bring in a Motion to say that there should not be a Leader of the Opposition.

. . -- . 91 (1) . , , . 66 , 89 91 . .

The meaning of those provisions is apparent on the face of the legal provisions. There is no discretion vested in the Speaker. There is no controversy with regard to this. On a clear construction of the provision contained in these Articles of the Sri Lankan Constitution, there is no conceivable doubt that the seat of General Sarath Fonseka has fallen vacant. Consequently, a communication to the Commissioner of Elections has to

take place. That is a mandatory requirement of the law. Any failure to comply with that provision of law, will be a direct contravention, a direct violation of provisions contained in the Constitution of the Republic. I, therefore, respectfully submit, Sir, that there is nothing to debate, there is nothing to decide upon, whether with or without the advice of the Attorney-General, the Constitution has to be given effect. That is the clear position under the laws of this country and the letter which has been sent is a perfectly lawful and proper letter and there is no legal basis whatsoever for rescinding or in any way modifying that letter. That is my respectful submission to you, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Government.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) , .

Sri Lankas legal system, Mr. Speaker, operates on the basis of an allocation of functions to different bodies. There are functions assigned to Courts Martial, there are functions assigned to Courts of the Republic and there are functions assigned to the sovereign legislature. We cannot cross those dividing lines. Those dividing lines cannot be blurred. If that happens, we have an anarchical situation. In this case, we are dealing with a sentence imposed by a Court Martial. The Court Martial has been deemed to be a court in terms of the Constitution. So, we have a sentence imposed by a body - ( ) (An Hon. Member) An illegal Court Martial.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Whether it is legal or illegal is not a question that can be examined here, Mr. Speaker. We are not exercising judicial powers as judges here to decide whether that is lawful or unlawful. That is completely outside our function and if we take on functions belonging to other organs of the State, then we are heading for a situation of total anarchy, a total breakdown of the Constitutional structure of this country. That cannot be allowed to happen. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, our clear duty is to give effect to the clearly expressed provisions of the Constitution of our country. There is a sentence which has been imposed by a Court Martial. There are certain legal consequences stemming from that sentence and those legal consequences are explicitly spelt out in Article 89 (d) of Sri Lankas Constitution. Consequently, Mr. Speaker, my respectful submission to you on behalf of the Government is that there is nothing to go into here, the situation is crystal clear, there is no discretion to be exercised, there is no question of law to be independently examined in this Chamber and therefore, the communication that was sent yesterday by the Acting Secretary-General of Parliament to the Commissioner of

Elections is an entirely lawful and proper communication. It must stand, it cannot be withdrawn, it cannot be changed, in any manner whatsoever.

Thank you, Sir. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to Article 170 of the Constitution which states that a judicial officer is a Judge of the Supreme Court, a Judge of the Court of Appeal, any Judge of the High Court, or whether a person is a judicial officer is a matter to be determined by the Judicial Service Commission. So, you must ask the Judicial Service Commission whether this is so.

Secondly, in regard to the position of the Hon. Members of Parliament, I would like to quote from the Hansard of 9th December, 2004, Colomns 1432 and 1433:

.where we are dealing with a matter relating to the privileges, the powers and the immunities of Members of this august Assembly, Parliament has exclusive judicial power, it exercises that power directly

and not obliquely through tribunals and courts established by the legal system of this country. It is therefore not necessary for me to take this argument before the courts of the Republic. I have every right to

present that argument for consideration by Members of this august Assembly."

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Speaker, this House normally goes by precedents. We had a precedent in this House earlier, when the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake was convicted and given a sentence of two years. On that occasion, the Secretary-General of Parliament did not notify the Commissioner of Elections of the vacation of seat for a period of nine months though the sentence was for two years. But, subsequently, when an Hon. Member of this House raised the issue that the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake had not attended this House for more than three months without leave, only then the issue came up and the Secretary-General of Parliament was ordered to notify the Commissioner of Elections. Sir, why is that precedent being broken today and why is the Secretary-General in such a hurry to notify that the Hon. Member is deemed to have vacated post. This is a question that we have to ask. Sir, why is this different attitude being taken in the case of Sarath Fonseka when it was not done for the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake? There has been a precedent and that precedent has to be practised throughout. There is no reason to do it and we do not see why there is today, a different attitude being taken. Further, Sir, the Hon. Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities, yesterday stated in this House that Mrs. Fonseka or one of their children should make an appeal for pardon. Sir, His Excellency the President has been given powers under Article 34(1) to pardon any person he thinks fit. Sir, today in this Parliament, several of us have raised the issue of granting pardon to Mr. Sarath Fonseka. But, this is not being heeded by His Excellency the President. Further, the four Mahanayaka Theras have also appealed and yesterday, the Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero had a Satyagraha in front of the Dalada Maligawa appealing that General Sarath Fonseka be pardoned. There is no procedure for anyone to plead for pardon and that is not necessary. So, why is the President not granting the pardon if he wishes to grant it? Why is the Government today asking the family members to ask for pardon when the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has in this House openly said - [Interruption.] Well, it does not say anybody has to ask for pardon. You read the Constitution, Hon. Azwer. Please read it again if you did not understand it last time.

(Prof.) G.L. Peiris when he was fighting on behalf of the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake. I remember vividly having heard that if a court cannot pass a sentence which is not more than two years, then a problem would arise. Now, as regards the Court Martial, they even give a one-day sentence. That is a court that passes sentences which are not more than two years. So, keeping that in mind, Sir, -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] . . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I would like to put forward my views as well because I am sure the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris cannot give a contradictory statement because this was something which was fought virulently on behalf of the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake a couple of years ago.
