asked the Minister of Re-settlement and Disaster Relief Services:

(a) Will he inform this House-

(i) the number of IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) in the country as at date including tsunami and war victims;

(ii) the number of such persons living in camps along with the cost to run such camps per month and per person basis;

(iii) the date on which they were displaced along with the cost per month, per year and per camp basis, for the last two years; and

(iv) the number of people or families been re-settled from 2005 to 2009 and to-date on per month, per year and per district basis? (b) Will he state the age factor of the IDP camps as of to -date? (c) If not, why? Hon. Minister, I ask the Question from you. I am sure you would give a suitable answer to that. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services) 20,666 . , 92,052 . 102,893 .

, , , , , . , , - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, I would appreciate if you could tell me at least how many IDPs are there as of this moment.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No. I do not want you to read out all the details. If you could tell me how many IDPs are there as of this moment - [Interrruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

You tell me only what is relevant; how many IDPs are there as of this moment and the amount of money allocated to them. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen )

I will say that in English. Last year, we spent Rs. 2,460 million for maintaining the IDP camps.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What about 2009? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen )

A sum of Rs. 2,490 million. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

That Rs. 2,490 million was for how many camps and how many people?

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen )

280,000 . Altogether

280,000 Internally Displaced Persons were there. But, now only 102,893 people are there in the camps.

2010 05 1879 1880

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

So, Hon. Minister, as per your information, each of these people has been allocated only Rs. 10 a day. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen )

I am sorry, I did not get you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When Rs. 2,460 million is divided by the number of people, the cost allocation by the Government to each of these people is only Rs. 10.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) , - - . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay. Hon. Minister, the other Supplementary Question is, at this particular moment, how many Internally Displaced Persons are there in the camps? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) The total number is 102,893. The number of IDPs in the Vavuniya District is 99,867. The number in the Trincomalee District is 2,336 and in the Jaffna District, the number is 3,050. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, when will they be resettled? Because, the Hon. Minister of Disaster Relief Services has gone on record to say something different to the United Nations Representative who came here. So, you say one thing to the foreigners and a different thing to the local people. You said that by the end of 2009, which is already over, there would not be any Internally Displaced Persons; maximum, there will be only a couple of hundred people. But, now you are saying it is about 102,000.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) . , , . , . 31 . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, according to the interpretation of your explanation which came through, you mentioned of a presidential candidate who had taken these people to IDP camps. Who is the Commander you were talking of? The President is the one who takes it; the President is the one who brings it. Up to the time General Sarath Fonseka was going to be appointed the presidential candidate, all 300,000 people were in IDP camps; within one week of he being appointed the presidential candidate, all the people were sent out. That is what your Government said. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) - ( ) (The Hon.

Venerable Presiding Member, I want to speak.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . - [Interruption.] .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Venerable Presiding Member, I was waiting until there was some order in this House before I could commence my speech.

The state of Emergency, Venerable Presiding Member, is a very extraordinary situation in any country. A country should be governed according to the normal laws of the country. But, here, we have a prolonged Emergency which continues for years and years and when the Debate on the extension of state of Emergency takes place in Parliament, we do not hear the Members of Parliament talking about the need for the Emergency or why this Emergency is being proclaimed, or why this state of Emergency is being extended. On the other hand, what we see is, Members of Parliament trading personal charges against each other in regard to either corruption or violence or something like that without considering the question of what impact the Emergency has on the country.

I think, Venerable Presiding Member, the Emergency being prolonged in this country in this way is destroying democracy. The fundamental rights of people, the human rights of people are gravely prejudiced when the country is ruled under Emergency for a long period of time and when the Emergency of the country is continuously prolonged, when there is an Emergency rule, the reality is that the normal laws of the country are suspended and when the normal laws of the country are suspended, the freedom of people is affected, the liberty of people is affected and people can become the victims of violations that take place as a result of the state of Emergency, of their fundamental rights, of their human rights.

So, I must commence my speech, Venerable Presiding Member, by stating that we are opposed to the state of Emergency being continued because there is no need for the Emergency to be continued in the country any longer. When people are victimized in the country, generally the minorities are the most victimized and in this instance the most victimized under the Emergency would be the Tamil people. I do not know, Venerable Presiding Member, whether there is any other country in the world where Emergency is prolonged in this indefinite way as it happens in our country. That does not seem the matter of concern to are Members of Parliament. They are not concerned about the fact that the country is being ruled under Emergency; they are only concerned about trading charges against one another and that too, of a personal nature.

Now, I want to ask this question. We will be having in this country the Presidential Election. Can a truly free and fair election be held in the country under the state of Emergency? Can democracy flourish under the state of Emergency? Can the Emergency not be used to abuse the electoral process? These are questions that you should be concerned about if you want to preserve democracy in this country, if you want to preserve fundamental rights in this country and if you want to preserve human rights in this country. But, these are not the concerns of Members. They utilize the Emergency Debate to talk about corruption charges against each other or about violence. Having said that, Venerable Presiding Member, I want to refer to the provisions in the Constitutions of some other countries in regard to the Proclamation of Emergency. I would refer to, firstly, the South African Constitution which has been recently promulgated which states that an Emergency can be declared in the first instance for no more than 21 days and in any event for not more than three months at a time. The first extension of the state of Emergency after a period of 21 days must be passed by a resolution adopted with a vote of the majority of members of the Assembly. Any subsequent extension must be passed and adopted with a vote of at least 60 per cent of the Members of the Assembly. So, it cannot be there for more than three months; not more than 21 days in the first instance and if you want an extension of more than 21 days, it must be passed by a vote of 60 per cent of the Members of the Assembly. The Emergency is justiciable; you can go to court and challenge the Emergency; you can challenge the regulations made under the Emergency. Venerable Presiding Member, I am referring to the Chapter on States of emergency contained in Section 37 of the South African Constitution. Venerable Presiding Member, I would also like to refer to the Indian Constitution in regard to the state of Emergency in the country. Initially, unless the Proclamation of Emergency is approved by both Houses of Parliament, it will expire at the end of one month. In any event, an Emergency cannot continue for more than six months. But, it must be approved at least once a month in the House. At the maximum, the Emergency can continue for a further period of six months subject to the Emergency being approved every month in the House, which means that in any event, subject to the Emergency being approved every month in the House, the Emergency cannot continue for a maximum of more than 12 months or one year. Here, we have an Emergency going on in this country for several years, succeeding for almost a decade and nobody is concerned about this. Under Article 352(6), the Indian Constitution on the Proclamation of emergency states, I quote: ..... a resolution may be passed by either House of Parliament only by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.

So, you can see how it is done in many countries in the world. I quote our neighbouring country India and South Africa, a democracy that is progressing, to show that an Emergency is looked upon by the people in the country with a certain measure of opprobrium, distaste and the continuance of an Emergency, a Proclamation pertaining to the Emergency is made difficult. It cannot go on for more than a certain period of time and even for that to happen, it must be passed by a special majority not applicable to normal laws before the Parliament. But, in our case, Venerable Presiding Member, the persons who rule the country seem to think that they are entitled to use the Emergency as they please. We have Members of Parliament who come here and trade charges of corruption or violence against each other during the Emergency Debate completely unmindful of whether Emergency rule is required in this country and what the impact of an Emergency is on the normal people of the country, those who rule, whoever they maybe - I am not talking of any one particular party or any one particular government - continue to use the Emergency in the way they like. Having said that, Venerable Presiding Member, I wish to refer to certain matters pertaining to the North-East and some of the matters that we are gravely concerned about. We had an Adjournment Debate in Parliament on 23rd of October, 2009, where I raised questions in regard to three matters primarily. I might classify them very broadly as one relating to unlawful occupation of State land by certain persons of the majority community, apparently with the approval of the Government or at least, the Government officials in the districts, which must reflect that the Government also was not inclined to enforce the law against these persons illegally occupying State land. The second issue was in regard to the attempts being made to evict persons of the minority communities from land that they were legitimately entitled to through various devices, sometimes by force, sometimes by cancelling or revoking the permits issued to these people and thirdly, Venerable Presiding Member, in regard to 1,486 Tamil families from the Grama Sevaka Divisions of Sampur East, Sampur West, Koonithivu, Nawarathnapuram, Soodaikuda, Kadatkaraichanai and Sampurkali not being able to resettle on their lands as a result of that area being declared a High Security Zone, of the need to ensure that these people would be resettled on their lands as early as possible and to ensure that this High Security Zone was dismantled so that the people could return to their lands. I, in fact, raised this matter with the President when I had a meeting with him, at which meeting the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Adviser to the President, was also present. I was informed by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa that a meeting would be held, to which he was summoning the relevant officials: the Land Commissioner in Colombo, the Government Agent, Trincomalee, the Governor of the Eastern Province, the Provincial Land Commissioner, the

[ . ]

2010 05 1959 1960

District Land Officer and the Divisional Secretaries of the different concerned Divisional Secretaries' Divisions. I was told that a meeting would take place on a certain day, but at the last moment the meeting was cancelled and it was not held and we were unable to raise these questions with these officials at that meeting and find a solution to these problems because these are grave problems that affect the rights of people, where the Government, if I might say so, is not acting justly, impartially and treating all citizens equally. But, unfortunately, that meeting was not held and these matters were not looked into and I am disappointed that that meeting was not held because now it is more than two months since I raised this matter in Parliament and the Government does not seem to be concerned about going into this question.

What is more alarming, Ven. Presiding Member, is that while I have raised these matters to which the Government has not responded, this process is continuing. Recently, there has been a proposal to give a businessman in Colombo 1,805 acres of land in Periya Karaichchi at Kuchchaveli for the purpose of commencing and running a factory, a saltern. It is called the Raigam Saltern and all this is being done in complete secrecy and a complete lack of transparency. There is no consultation with anybody. There is no publicity whatever given to a proposal to commence the running of a saltern in this area. Somebody goes and meets the Government Agent, a military official who has been there for the past four years and we have asked that that man be removed. But, the man is being kept there and he initiates action to give land, 1,805 acres of land, not five or ten acres. The Provincial Council has got minimum power in regard to land, very little power in regard to land. The hand of the Chief Minister of the Provincial Council is twisted and he is compelled to give his assent. This is an area in which people have been displaced, people are just returning, people are just settling on their lands, they are just commencing their occupation and when the people are returning and commencing their occupation and commencing residing on the land, they find that about 1,805 acres of land where they carried on their occupation, fishing and so on and where they were living is being taken over in this way, surreptitiously, secretly, with no transparency and given to some businessmen from some other area and these people are very agitated. They have made representations; they have made complaints, but nobody takes any notice of it. I raised this matter with the President and the Senior Presidential Adviser, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament. I was told that there was no such project. But, here I have got a file with the papers showing that the Government Agent has spoken to this gentleman and the Government Agent has decided that land can be given and he has initiated action in regard to the matter with the Provincial Council. That gentleman is in touch with me. He is writing to me and asking me for

my cooperation after I raised this matter in the media. You will see, Venerable Presiding Member, while, on the one hand, issues have been raised in Parliament on the 23rd of October, 2009, in regard to which issues there must be a meeting where these officials were due to come and we were expected to thrash these things out at that meeting, that has not taken place. Those matters have not been looked into. The process of trying to alienate State land, even large extents as large as 1,805 acres, for one single project is continuing. There are some people who think that they can do what they like regardless of Members of Parliament, regardless of the people, that they can go wherever they like and do what they like. This, I think is totally unacceptable and I must state that it is with a lack of transparency and secrecy that such activities have been carried out to the grave prejudice of local people. In this area 2,000 families - Tamil families, Muslim families and maybe a few Sinhalese families - will be gravely affected if this land is taken over. I want to impress upon the Government that as they have told me there is no such project, no such allocation - your own documents would suggest the contrary - this must not be pursued; this must be abandoned; this must be stopped immediately and that land must be reserved for the residence of those people living in that area. In fact, there was a proposal to construct a large housing scheme in that area for the fisherfolk in that area and from other areas in the Trincomalee Town and North of Trincomalee who did not have proper residential and housing facilities. This proposal by which a land is given to some person in Colombo on very beneficial terms, on long lease must be abandoned. In fact, the President and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Presidents Adviser told me that there is no such project. I would kindly ask them to ensure that the assurance they gave me is kept and that this project is not continued with or that no further action is taken in regard to this project because people think that this is an effort to commence colonization of their areas through industrialization.

I refer to another incident of an apparel factory being constructed, a factory called Tri-Star Apparels in Tampalakamam where there was grave discrimination in the matter of employment. I was told that my information was not correct, but I have checked on that again and I find that the facts I stated in Parliament were quite correct. We raised these questions, Venerable Presiding Member, because we want to ensure that people are not adversely affected in regard to their occupation and their right to residence in areas in which they have lived for generations and centuries and within which they hope to live. If there is some development in those areas, the beneficiaries will be the people of that area, not others. I would think that if there is some project being done in Hambantota, the people of Hambantota would have had the right to expect that the beneficiaries will be the people of Hambantota and not the people of Jaffna, not the

1961 1962

people of Batticaloa. So, this is why we think it necessary to raise this matter on the Floor of the House. I am also told that there is a substantial extent of land, each plot of five acres or ten acres, that has been approved for tourist projects in the North of Trincomalee, particularly in Kamburupitiya - Kuchchaveli areas. I have no detailed information, but we are told that this is happening. A similar allocation of land has been made in Arugam Bay, in Pottuvil and Passikudah in Batticaloa. Again no transparency; a total lack of transparency - being done in secrecy. If you want to develop tourism you can insert an advertisement in the newspapers, or over the media. Persons who want to apply for land can apply for land. That is not being done. Some individuals go and quietly get land. They may not even be interested in tourist development and after some time they would use the land for something else or probably dispose of the land. These are very serious concerns of ours. Valuable land in some of these areas are being given away in a secret way without any transparency whatever, without consultation with the local people, without consultation with the democratically elected representatives of the local people to people from outside. This, I think is something which I must put on record because this is a very serious question, gravely affecting the rights of the people of that area to ensure that the resources of that area are used in a manner that is advantageous to them and beneficial to them and that they are not deprived of these resources. I also have information, Venerable Presiding Member, that large containers with pre-fabricated material are moving into the Vanni quite frequently and that the Chinese are engaged in constructing camps and cantonments in the Vanni - in areas beyond the vision of the people, where people cannot see these camps and cantonments coming up. This is a matter in regard to which I have got information from people in that area, people who are re-settling and they are raising the question as to why these containers with pre-fabricated material are being moved to distant places that they cannot see. It appears that police stations and army camps are being constructed and further, large extents of lands are being reserved for police stations, army camps and cantonments. But, I do not think this type of activity should be allowed to continue because after all, the war has come to an end and we want normalcy to return to these areas and for the people to be able to lead normal lives. If this type of further militarization of these areas is to continue, I think that would be very bad for reconciliation, for peace and harmony to prevail amongst the people in this country and for people who want to live in peace and be able to live without any sense of being inferior or unequal. I think, Venerable Presiding Member, these are matters that the Government will have to address. We have raised these questions with the Government, both on the Floor of this House and at meetings that we have

had with the President and his Adviser, but very unfortunately their response has not been encouraging and their response seems to indicate that they have a programme which they will continue with if not openly, secretly. I thank you, Venerable Presiding Member. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

Sharing of Antenna Structures 1.1 Antenna structures should be used on sharing basis for which the tariff schedule will be determined by TRCSL in consultation with the TISPs. The minimum number of antenna structures that conform to the technical requirements will be approved for an identified Antenna Structure Farm. 1.2 The TRCSL will initiate the formation of a new Antenna Structure Farm when the necessity arises. TISPs may propose such locations to TRCSL. 1.3 The antenna structure shall be designed and constructed to accommodate a minimum of 20 square meters of additional design antenna area (from the top portion) for at least two other TSPs. Physical space required for fixing of the additional antenna shall be reserved at top portion. This allocation of additional design antenna area will be encouraged through incentive schemes. 1.4 Initially up to three requests will be considered to construct separate antenna structures within the Antenna Structure Farm. Subsequent applicants should share one of the available antenna structures. Applications for additional antenna structures will be considered only under special circumstances and such applications will be referred to the TAC with justification for such request. 1.5 The Antenna Structure Farm will be confined to a minimum feasible area by the TRCSL, subject to a maximum radius of 250 m. 1.6 The distance between Antenna Structure Farms will be kept at a minimum separation of 4 km. 1.7 Both TSPs and TISPs may obtain approval to erect roof top masts of height not exceeding 20 meters from the roof top within or in between Antenna Structure Farms. 1.8 Broadcasting antenna structures are exempted from the clauses 1.3 and 1.4 provided that application is initially forwarded for an Antenna Structure to be used only for broadcasting purposes.

Electromagnetic Interference and Health Concerns 4.1 Base Station equipment shall comply with the EMC standards acceptable to TRCSL. 4.2 TRCSL will enforce and monitor maximum RF power density criteria defined by ICNIRP and adopted by TRCSL as per Annexure I. 4.3 Verification of compliance with stipulated standards will be carried out by TRCSL or a recognized institution to ensure public safety. 5. Environmental Concerns 5.1 Natural environment of the area shall be protected from any potential adverse impacts in accordance with CEA or PEA approval. 6. Construction of Antenna Structures 6.1 The Antenna structure and other related infrastructure should be designed and constructed in conformity with BS 8100, TIA/EIA 222F (or latest) or other equivalent international standard accepted by TRCSL. 6.2 All antenna structures with heights exceeding 30m should be designed and detailed as post - disaster type structures. 6.3 All the structural designs, construction drawings and proposals are required to be certified by a chartered civil engineer who is specialized in structural design. 6.4 Institutes and individuals who do the certification should be registered with TRC. 6.5 Minimum of third-party insurance coverage of the risk of physical damage and injury should be taken during the construction of antenna structure. A copy of the same should be submitted to TRCSL before commencement of the development. 6.6 During the construction, the antenna structure should be installed with an aircraft warning light, as per CAASL recommendations.

6.7 TISPs should obtain development permits from respective Local Authorities. All the approving agencies are encouraged to establish electronic document transfer in order to expedite the approval process. 6.8 TISP who has received approval is required to complete the construction of the new antenna structure within six months from the date of granting the approval. Failure to meet this requirement without a valid reason acceptable to TRCSL will result in cancellation of the approval. The new antenna structure should be available for sharing within 03 months from the date of completion. 6.9 No Telecommunication Antenna Structure should be constructed without written approval of TRCSL. 7. Installation of Antenna Structures on Buildings 7.1 The structural stability of the buildings, which are primarily designed for purposes other than facilitating antenna structures, should be certified by a chartered civil engineer who is specialized in structural design, prior to the approval for the construction of the Antenna Structure. 7.2 The TISP should obtain the planning clearance from UDA within the areas declared under UDA Low. 7.3 Antenna structure outside the areas declared under UDA Law will be considered for approval with the consent of relevant Local Authorities. 7.4 Antenna structures less than 5m in height above roof top level are required to obtain clearance only from the MOD and CAASL. 7.5 A lightning protection system should be installed as per the Annexure II (b), to ensure the safety of occupants. 7.6 All antenna structures on buildings with total height exceeding 30m above ground level should be designed and detailed as post-disaster type structures.
