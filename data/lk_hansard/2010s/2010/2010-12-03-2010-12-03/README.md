If someone gave you information saying that he was there, we are more than prepared to have an inquiry.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I appreciate what the Leader of the Opposition is saying. We will move a substantive Motion and then inquire. If you are agreeable for an inquiry, we will move it. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Can I tell you something? - [Interruption.]

825 826

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, no. That is only way to inquire into a matter of this nature.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am only telling you, Hon. Minister, there is already an Order given by the Deputy Speaker that he will investigate. I will give a copy. On the 1st of December, the Hon. Azwer had referred to this whole issue and then said, "Please hold an investigation into this incident. It has been given publicity in the media throughout". Then the Deputy Speaker has said, "Your point of Order has been noted. I will take it up with the Hon. Speaker and give an order in due course". So, let him inquire. You and I or you and someone else from the Opposition can certainly assist him. We have no problem. Do it quickly.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Are you agreeable for a Parliamentary Special Committee to inquire into this?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You may ask the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, no. We are proposing - [Interruption.] You are agreeable for an investigation. We will ask for a Parliamentary Special Committee. According to the Standing Orders, we can request - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Then give us the terms of reference. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, we will give notice - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We do not mind a Select Committee, provided we agree on the terms of reference.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, obviously, there will have to be. First, the Motion will be placed before the Parliament - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) So now, we have to agree on the terms of reference. That is all.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We will move the Motion, -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) But, first you have to give us the terms of reference.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We have to give notice for a Select Committee to be appointed to go into this matter. [Interruption.] Now, you have agreed - [Interruption.] I think so, because it is a grave matter where Parliament must go into inquiry. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Okay. Hon. Minister, you have made a proposal regarding a Select Committee - [Interruption.] I have to say, that in principle we are agreeable to a Select Committee but kindly speak to us about the terms of reference before that. But, if in the alternate you want to hold the inquiry as was suggested earlier, we have no objection to that even. - [Interruption.] I am on my feet, Mr. Chairman. Can you ask him to sit down? [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, if the Hon. Member is on a point of Order, he should be given an opportunity. But, propose it in short, very specifically, but it has to be a point of Order. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, it is a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Azwer, you have to refer to the Standing Order number and raise it.

827 828

2010 03

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Now, Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned my name - [Interruption.] He is putting the cart before the horse. How can we have the terms of reference? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Leader of the Opposition must know better. How can you have the terms of reference before the Committee is appointed?- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Do not obstruct. Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The point of Order is that he has referred to me. He said that I have asked for an inquiry and you said you will do it. [Interruption.] Are you asking under which section the Deputy Speaker gave the Order?

( ) (The Chairman) Do not get involved in cross talks.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is putting the cart before the horse. How can he ask for the terms of reference before the Committee is appointed? The Leader of the Opposition should know about these basic things.[Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you can continue.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Mr. Chairman, The Hon. Minister and I were trying to find an amicable way out of this. So, let us talk it over and handle it. He wanted to know whether we were against the Parliamentary inquiry or a Select Committee, and I said, in principle we are for it, but let us agree on the terms of reference. That is all. [Interruption.] Actually, we are trying to cool down the situation - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

[. . 2.29] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Technology and Research ) Mr. Presiding Member, I firstly thank you for having given me this opportunity to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Ministry of Technology and Research.

I would like to go back to history, to a statement made by the late Hon. Bernard Soysa, where he has stated that there was a downturn in technology and research during colonial times. During colonial times, science and technology were taught in the abstract form and no research was done. We are a country with a proud history of 2,500 years. Ruwanweliseya, Sigiriya and various irrigation systems were some of those proud achievements that we have gained through science and technology.

Next, when we look at the post-Independence period, out of 62 years, 30 years was focused to dismantle the brutal LTTE. There was no clear-cut agenda in the area of technology and research as the sole focus was on war. During the conflict, some have enriched themselves at the cost of our soldiers and the others entered into so-called peace agreements, which impugned our sovereignty. With all odds and forces against His Excellency the President and with the appointment of Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, we shocked the world by dismantling the LTTE on the 19th of May 2009, thus giving our country the opportunity to focus on development such as investing in science and technology. For 30 years, out of our Budget we could not give tangible benefits to all parts of Sri Lanka as one-third of our nation was controlled by the brutal LTTE.

I am proud to say that this Budget is a development Budget touching the interests of the sons of every part of Mother Lanka. The remnants of the LTTE together with some of its conspirators who are also in this House continue to attempt to discredit Mother Lanka. We witnessed even in London the remnants of the brutal LTTE seeking to discredit Sri Lanka.

His Excellency the Presidents love for our country will deter all these forces and take this country forward

with mammoth developments, which I say to these conspirators, that the development which is taking place is unstoppable.

At this stage, I thank the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana for the leadership given to the Ministry of Technology and Research. My Minister, the Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi will endure to take technology and research to the common masses of this country, for example, to help the farmer to improve his crop, the mason, the village smith and the others to obtain commercial gain through technology and research. This is in keeping with His Excellency the Presidents vision. I would like to quote page 81 of paragraph 7 of His Excellencys Budget Speech. It states, I quote:

....empowering the village is our central theme in development.

Sri Lanka boasts of a 91 per cent literacy rate but countries with lesser literacy rates have achieved economic growth through technology and research. My Minister will strive to achieve technology transfer to reach the common masses with the high literacy rate this country possesses.

Mr. Presiding Member, the Government aims at increasing the research and development expenditure by the private and public sector to at least 2 per cent of the GDP. In this regard, the Government has allocated Rs. 1,000 million to set up an Innovation and Technology Development Fund which would finance high quality research and innovations. As clearly explained by the President in his Budget Speech, Public and private partnership will be encouraged. The Government intends to relax administrative procedures obstructing the Public sector working with the private sector to undertake joint research and development.

I think I will be failing in my duty if I do not thank the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana for his Vidatha Programme which was brought in to achieve this goal. South Korea and Taiwan caught the electronic and ICT revolution; India, China and Cuba caught the biotechnology revolution. We missed it. In 1960, the per capita income of Sri Lanka was US Dollars 320 and in South Korea, it was US Dollars 84. In 2009, Sri Lanka's per capita income was US Dollars 2,200 when South Korea was having a per capita income of over US Dollars 20,000. This clearly demonstrates that technology and research is the only way forward in obtaining development status. However, research should not be done in isolation.

My Minister proposes to meet the clusters of various industries with particular focus to the SMEs, so that research and technology could be carried out on a need assessment basis.

Sri Lanka Standards Institution offers multi-faceted services such as standardization, testing, calibration, training and certification. My Minister proposes to

883 884

2010 03

encourage the SME sector towards obtaining the GMP certiticate, that is "Good Manufacturing Practice", which would help increase the quality and yield of the products of the SMEs.

Another function of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution is to work with other Ministries and agencies to prevent substandard goods and services entering the Sri Lankan market. My Minister proposes to work through Ministerial Committees and to have a continuous dialogue with State agencies such as the Sri Lanka Customs, towards achieving this goal.

The Industrial Technology Institute has had major achievements. The local BTI could be made available one fourth the cost of what is imported from Cuba. Thus, I believe, with mammoth development taking place under the leadership of my Minister and with our able Secretary together with all other officials in the Ministry of Technology and Research, we would be in a position to give all the support needed to take "Mahinda Chintana" forward.

Thank you. [. . 2.37] ( ) (The Hon. Mohan Lal Grero) , , 93, 94 . , . , . , . - - . , , , . . , - - "" , "" " ", " ", " " ? ? . . . , . , , . , , .

, , , .

Hon. Deputy Chairman, I thank you for giving me this opportunity and before I conclude my speech I want to emphasize three more facts. One is the importance of establishing a primary and a secondary education system in Sri Lanka where a child would be spending more time in the primary school saving his childhood. The second is, introducing a system of teaching English in a more methodical and a student-friendly manner so that the child will learn English language easily and then he can put it into practice at the society level. The third and the last, but not the least, is transforming education into a system of minimum learning rather than maximum teaching, where the child would be taught life skills, how to live as an educated and a literate person in the society and it should be a system which also provides them the basic concepts - not the maximum concepts - to learn at the next level of the school. If we can achieve these targets, I think we will become one of the major nations in Asia and our country will also have a more meaningful and a more successful free education system.

Thank you so much.
