... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, according to Standing Order No. 84, no Member shall impute improper motives to any other Member or shall refer to any other Member by name. But, when the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was speaking, he referred to a responsible Minister saying that he misbehaved outside. Whatever it is, Sir, we are not concerned about that. It must be expunged because he directly referred to an Hon. Minister who is in the House. According to the Standing Orders - [Interruption.]

Mr. Chairman, Thomas Jefferson once said that the freedom of press is one of the bulwarks of liberty and can never be restrained, except by a despotic government. Then, it is fair to say, Sir, that in relation to media freedom in this country, this Government has become a despotic government. It is no secret that many journalists had been murdered, abducted, threatened and tortured in the last few years. Prageeth Ekneligoda, Lasantha Wickrematunge, Poddala Jayantha, Taraki Sivaram, J.S. Tissainayagam, Ruwan Weerakoon, Upul Joseph, Keith Noyahr, Upali Tennakoon, Iqbal Athas and Chevan Daniels are some examples of such journalists.

Sir, I would like to direct your attention to the Worldwide Press Freedom Index of 2009. Every year, Reporters without Borders establishes a ranking of countries in terms of their freedom of press. I am sad to say that out of 175 countries, Sri Lanka is placed 162nd, just above Saudi Arabia and Somalia. Even Afghanistan is placed above us. So, if Sri Lanka is to be the light of Asia, then it is imperative that we change this situation at the soonest. We need to safeguard the basic fundamental rights of the citizens and thereby, give room for democracy to flourish in this great nation and only then can this country be rid of the stigmata of being a failed State.

I would like to read out a passage from Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunges final editorial, which he wrote in "The Sunday Leader" of 11th January, 2009. In that, he states, I quote:

"The free media serve as a mirror in which the public can see itself sans mascara and styling gel. From us you learn the state of your nation, and especially its management by the people you elected to give your children a better future. Sometimes the image you see in that mirror is not a pleasant one. But while you may grumble in the privacy of your armchair, the journalists who hold the mirror up to you do so publicly and at great risk to themselves."

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I would like to raise a point of Order. The Committee Stage Discussion is drawn up by the Opposition. But, I do not see any Member of the Opposition in the Front Benches including the Leader of the Opposition. In the morning also they took up the same position. Every time they are not there. Except for two solitary Members, the UNP is not represented in the House at all, Sir. This must be brought to the notice of the Hon. Speaker and you have to reprimand the Leader of the Opposition for behaving like this.

[. . 2.32] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Hon. Deputy Chairman, the human capital is the most precious commodity a country can have and the priority in terms of finance and the focus a government provides for its health and education are of paramount and vital importance. If we are to ensure its value, the appropriation through the Budget must reflect the importance we place on it. We must not forget that this valuable asset is fundamental in driving the economy and in taking forward any development plans of the State. I am, therefore, sorry to state that based on this Budget, the appropriations made and the modalities of implementing such targets are totally inadequate and without any merit.

Last week, during the Budget Debate, I brought to the attention of the Assembly specific data but they were treated with contempt and ridiculed by my Colleagues in the Government. It is even more worrying that my learned Colleagues in the Government, the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle and the Hon. (Ms.)

Kamala Ranathunga - both women - were the most vocal. It is ironic, and it was in fact, the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle who informed the Assembly that every person enjoys a glass of fresh milk and three full meals everyday. As we all know, this is an insult to reality at a time that our citizens cannot cover even the bare necessities of daily living and ensure the most basic of education for their children.

However, I need to confirm that these figures were obtained from a recently-released Demographic and Health Survey conducted by the Department of Health and the Institute of Medical Research under the supervision of the World Health Organization and the UNICEF. From the reaction to these figures alone, it is very clear that the Government has no faith in the modalities that are in place and that they have no real plan to improve the conditions of our people.

The most shocking and alarming factor is that nationwide, we have a malnutrition level of 29.4 per cent among children under the age of five years. Approximately, one in every three children is malnourished. Furthermore, a Nutrition and Food Security Assessment Survey shows that the rate in low birth weight, stunting and wasting among children are rapidly increasing especially in the plantation and estate sector. I am deeply concerned about the malnutrition among pre-school children. Despite liberal allocations to minimize this unacceptable situation, I regret to state that the efforts made by the Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs to improve the nutrition of this sector has had very poor and totally unacceptable results. We should be particularly concerned about the health of expectant mothers and mothers who are breastfeeding. For example, the figures show that the iron deficiency is seriously affecting 16.2 per cent of all pregnant mothers, 19.6 per cent of breastfeeding mothers and 21.7 per cent of other women who are not in these two categories.

What are the main reasons for these deficiencies? In a document titled The Challenge to Ending Poverty in Sri Lanka issued by the Parliamentary Research Unit, our per capita income is stated to be US Dollars 2,053. According to that, every Sri Lankan should have an average income of Rs. 235,000. However, the reality is that 41.6 per cent of our population earn less than Rs. 7,000. That is less than US Dollars two a day or just Rs. 235. In addition to this, according to the official records of the Department of Census and Statistics, the percentage of our citizens below the level of poverty is 15.2 per cent. This means that their monthly income is less than Rs. 2,200 or Rs. 65 a day. So, when my learned Colleagues stand up to reject accurate information, they must realize that this is the reality and rejecting them purely to cover the failures of a Government that has been in power for more than six long years, is fruitless.

Sir, these factors are further detailed in the Nutrition and Food Security Assessment Survey report commissioned by the UNICEF and the World Food Programme and issued in June 2010. It reveals that from the paltry income of less than Rs. 7,000, the average household spends 37.9 per cent on food. At present, with the exorbitant cost of the basic food items, I ask what a mother can get for Rs. 89 a day to feed her children and to see her husband off to work with a basic meal.

The survey also reveals that they have to resort to the inevitable. That is to borrow one-third of this requirement from the shop-keeper, the neighbour and the relatives. That brings up quarrels within families and friends often ending up with violence and disharmony.

Sir, how did we get here? What happened to the safeguards that were in place such as Samurdhi that was meant to eradicate poverty and improve nutrition? Today, we have 1,600,786 families registered to receive benefits and another 71,762 for nutritional benefits. The data that I read out stands witness to the total lack of effectiveness of these measures.

Despite this, the Government has decided to freeze the allocation for Samurdhi in this Budget, which in real terms, means that the financial value has decreased by a minimum of 15 per cent, when taking into consideration the unprecedented increase in the cost of basic commodities. We also have to remember that these figures are at an average in districts such as Moneragala and Hambantota, which have the highest percentage of poverty and we need to concentrate our efforts in these areas. Have we given enough priority to these areas? The answer is, most certainly, no.

In this Budget, the allocation for education is 3.6 per cent and for health, it is less than 4.5 per cent out of the Budget expenditure. What message is the Government trying to send to our people? In the area of education, out of all the students who sit for the GCE (Ordinary Level) examination, only 52.51 per cent pass and 50 per cent fail in Mathematics as a subject. According to a survey carried out by the Department of Census and Statistics with the support of the International Labour Organization, more than 900,000 children under 14 years were engaged in economic activities.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Sir, give me two more minutes please. We need to achieve qualitative improvement and quantitative expansion in tandem. Especially the education system

709 710

[ ]

2010 07

should be nurtured and expanded according to the manpower needs of the country. High quality education and training is the best way to prepare the workers of today for the jobs of tomorrow; and to use knowledge effectively in all sectors of economy for sustainable development and growth.

As a UN Goodwill Ambassador, I believe the Millennium Development Goals in 2015 are important, but there are no tangible measures taken by the Government to ensure that we reach them. The goals are to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, ensure environmental sustainability and develop a global partnership for development.

Sir, I speak today and draw the attention of this Assembly to the untold suffering of a mother who is unable to see her child have a basic meal and of the woman who bears the weight of the responsibilities of a household.

The female-headed household rate is above 24 per cent. That means, one in every four households is headed by a woman.

We now have the added burden of a looming crisis due to the loss of GSP. As we all know, women consist a higher percentage, by far, of garment factory employees and as the industry estimates, 500,000 of them will be made redundant, depriving entire families of their only source of income. Let us not forget that these monies are sent to homes across the Island, helping to drive the macroeconomy ahead at the village level. What plans does the Government have for these desperate citizens?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Sir, give me just one more minute, please.

There are other concerns for women - human trafficking that includes children and women and a level of domestic violence, which is almost 60 per cent in the country. The failure to adequately protect migrant women workers is clear by the horrendous stories that are reported. This is particularly sad as they bring in to this country valuable foreign exchange that we cannot do without. We cannot continue to ignore these problems; they need to be addressed, and addressed urgently.

Sir, as a mother and a wife, it is very distressing to see the enormous stress that women in my Electorate,

Colombo West, go through. The Asian mother is a special breed. She is the one who will stay up late to make sure that her son studies; she is the one who guides her daughter to become a woman and to start a family of her own. These qualities are fundamental to us and it is the duty of us all to safeguard her as she struggles through a difficult life. I humbly request the Government to take these statistics into consideration with the due seriousness they deserve and to re-direct the priorities to where they are most wanted.

Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chairman.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) I am happy to have been given the opportunity to say a few words about the activities of my Ministry of Disaster Management. There is a disaster in the UNP, I will have to mitigate -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The disaster is with you all.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) I have to mitigate now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) As a result of that disaster, their speakers are not here. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Let me at the outset thank His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for having provided substantial allocations to my Ministry.

Although this Budget has been presented as an interim fiscal measure, it has laid a sound economic foundation for the country. The 2010 Budget is a development-oriented Budget with a vision for achieving an accelerated path of sustainable economic and social development after three decades of war in the North and the East. The vision for economic development is through a unique path of uplifting the rural, small and medium enterprises sector through a market-friendly economic framework. It is a Budget that is in tune with the development needs of the country today.

This is the first Budget after the defeat of terrorism. However, the reaping of the full benefits of ending the war has to be awaited until the many hurdles that surrounds the economy of our country are cleared.

Thanks to the President, it was his prudent economic management that saved the country from the global economic crisis that had shaken the powerful countries in the world. While fighting a war against the terrorists, he managed to strengthen the economy and to launch several mega development programmes successfully. In this process, battling with natural and man-made disasters takes an important place.

Sir, as the Chairman of the National Council for Disaster Management, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa has emphasized the importance of strengthening the pre-disaster preparedness activities and implementing a long-term disaster risk reduction programme in the country. Based on the vision of Mahinda Chintana - Idiri Dekma" to create a safer Sri Lanka, my Ministry has developed the policy for Disaster Management and a National Disaster Management Plan for Sri Lanka.

On the direction of His Excellency the President, as the Chairman of the National Council for Disaster Management, Rs. 2.5 million was allocated for District Secretaries of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Galle, Matara, Kurunegala, Badulla, Ratnapura and Kegalle for the provision of emergency response activities.

Sir, since I assumed duties as the Minister of Disaster Management, my immediate task was to obtain the predictions from the Meteorological Department about the monsoonal rains and to prepare agencies to mitigate and reduce flood impacts. My Ministry had drawn up plans and commenced the canal clearing programme, when rainfall exceeding 210 millimetres was experienced in the Colombo District prior to the predicted period of inter-monsoon rain. Gampaha had been the worst affected district with an intensity of rainfall exceeding 320 millimetres a day.

Sir, in May this year, we experienced one of the worst floods, especially in the Western Province and the whole country in general. During May 2010, a total of 606,072 people were affected in 13 districts due to floods, earthslips and high wind. The worst affected districts were Colombo and Gampaha where 153,342 and 193,033 people were affected respectively.

Poor maintenance of drains and canals, unauthorized land filling, settlements and encroachments of canal reservations and low-lying areas, disposal of household garbage into canals due to the absence of proper mechanism to collect the urban waste, disposal of building debris and other material from reconstruction sites into low-lying lands, resulting reduction in water retention are some factors for increasing flood threat. The drainage systems which were designed for lower discharge in the colonial days in Colombo and other districts could not cope with such a high intense rainfall. However, contribution of high intensity rainfall due to global warming cannot be ignored in developing mitigation programmes.

Sir, the predictions of scientists are that the global warming experienced at present will create more hazardous situations and we have to be prepared to deal with severe floods, droughts and cyclonic conditions in future.

Sir, considering the possible increase of disaster events in future, we need to have a special fund to respond urgently and implement mitigation activities to save the lives and properties of disaster victims. This is currently in progress, which will be launched shortly. My Ministry has initiated actions to operationalize the Disaster Management Fund as provided in the Disaster Management Act.

My Ministry has proposed amendments to the Disaster Management Act to strengthen the Ministry of Disaster Management to cater to future demands. The draft is being studied by the Attorney-General at present. I intend to submit the Amendments to this House in the near future.

Sir, at a special meeting chaired by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, held on 18th May, 2010, a Task Force was established under the Chairmanship of

787 788

the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence to study the causes for the recent floods; to identify mitigation measures and to drive the implementing process accordingly to prevent similar disastrous situations in Colombo in future. Another Committee has been appointed by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Affairs, to develop short-term, medium-term and long-term programmes to mitigate floods in the Gampaha District. My Ministry is playing a major role and working very closely with these Committees.

Sir, I take this opportunity to mention to the House that the following actions have been taken to minimize affects of floods due to ongoing monsoonal rains.

A series of meetings were conducted under my Chairmanship at national and divisional level with the officials of District and Divisional Secretaries, Local Authorities and other organizations including the elected representatives to discuss the major causes for flooding in the respective areas and also to identify immediate flood mitigation measures. Field visits were undertaken in Modera, Maligawatta, Dematagoda, Kolonnawa, Moratuwa, Kesbewa, Maharagama and Seethawaka Divisional Secretary's areas to implement mitigation activities.

Sir, my Ministry is working very closely with the Ministry of Environment to complete an Integrated Environment Impact Assessment for the Northern Province to facilitate the ongoing development programmes to ensure sustainable development with minimum risk from disasters.

I also take this opportunity to inform the House, that my Ministry has installed lightening detectors and constructed a parapet wall around the Mihintale Chaithya at a cost of Rs. 3.6 million - where Buddhism started in Sri Lanka - in order to protect this monument and the devotees from any natural disaster.

Sir, I would like to inform the House that a sum of Rs. 163 million was allocated through the National Disaster Relief Services Centre (NDRSC), which is under the purview of the Ministry, to District Secretaries for distribution as relief services which include cooked meals, dry ration, funeral assistance and housing assistance for the victims of recent disaster of flood and landslides. The breakdown of the above is: flood relief - Rs. 99 million; cyclone - Rs. 6 million; landslides - Rs. 1 million; drought - Rs. 2 million; wild elephant attack - Rs. 1.8 million; fire - Rs. 4 million; and civil conflict affected IDP assistance - Rs. 55 million.

Special meetings were arranged with INGOs, NGOs and other donors to obtain assistance for the disaster victims.

I must mention with gratitude the assistance received from the World Food Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, and other UN agencies to provide relief to disaster-affected victims and for mitigation activities in time of distress.

Sir, at present, several mitigation activities have been undertaken in the most-affected areas in the Colombo District by the Disaster Management Centre, which is one of the agencies under the purview of my Ministry, with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Development Corporation, the Irrigation Department, the Colombo Municipal Council, the Local Authorities in Colombo Metropolitan Area and the Road Development Authority.

A Committee chaired by the Secretary to my Ministry has been established as the National Disaster Management Co-ordinating Committee, by the Disaster Management Centre, comprising 70 agencies of the Government, INGOs and NGOs, which will set up short-term and long-term mitigation projects for disasters.

My Ministry has also formed a Committee under the Disaster Management Centre chaired by the Secretary to my Ministry to mitigate Colombo floods where the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Development Corporation - SLLRDC - the national and provincial level irrigation departments, the Divisional Secretaries Divisions, the Colombo Municipal Council, the local authorities, the Agrarian Services Department, the Central Environmental Authority, and the Urban Development Authority, are members. This Committee is entrusted with the task of setting up short-term and long-term flood mitigation projects. It identifies the causes of floods, bottlenecks, unauthorized constructions and illegal filling of low-lying lands. Based on the recommendation of the Committee, the following activities have taken place: Desilting of Mutwal Tunnel; Dredging of Kiththampahuwa Canal in Kolonnawa and removing obstruction in the canal near the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation; Cleaning and desilting of the canals in the Colombo District; and Preparation of flood-affected area maps for each divisional secretary's division.

It is my duty to inform the House that the Sri Lanka Navy, on the instruction of the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, has commenced a canal cleaning project and three main canals, the Kirulapona Canal, the Wellawatte Canal and the Dehiwala Canal in the Colombo District were cleaned before the rain. After the recent floods in May 2010, the Sri Lanka Navy gave us an additional hand to clean more canals to mitigate the future flooding situation.

Mr. Presiding Member, some districts in Sri Lanka are affected by droughts, and crop damages due to droughts in the last 30 years have exceeded Rs. two billion. My

789 790

[ . . . ]

2010 07

Ministry alone has spent Rs. 79.5 million to provide drinking water in drought-affected areas for the last four years. I have directed my Secretary to develop a long-term drought mitigation programme for drought-affected districts such as Hambantota, Moneragala, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Ampara, Jaffna, Ratnapura, Mannar and Vavuniya. As an initial step, funds will be provided in 2010 to improve the cascade system in the Districts of Kurunegala, Moneragala and Anuradhapura.

Sir, I must also inform this House that the Ministry has established an Early Warning System under the Disaster Management Centre using 55 early-warning towers along the coastal belt from Puttalam to Trincomalee covering the Western, the Southern and the Eastern Provinces. In 2011, it is also planned to establish 25 more towers covering the Districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Mannar.

Sir, an Emergency Operation Centre under the Disaster Management Centre works 24 hours on seven days to receive information and requests for assistance in case of disasters to coordinate search and rescue operations and evacuate people to safe locations. I have to mention with gratitude the assistance given by the Armed forces and the Police in this national effort.

Sir, another agency under the purview of my Ministry is the National Building Research Organization - NBRO - the prime responsibility of which is to identify areas affected by landslides and initiate actions to mitigate future landslides. Being the mandated agency for formulating and issuing early warning messages for landslides, the National Building Research Organization - NBRO - is in the process of implementing an early warning system with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme - UNDP - using rain gauges so that the people living in landslide-prone areas could move away to safe locations before landslides occur.

The NBRO is in the process of implementing two major structural mitigation projects for mitigating landslides in Peradeniya and Padiyapelella in the Kandy and the Nuwara Eliya Districts. By mitigating the landslides, safety of users of Peradeniya-Gampola Road, Hanguranketha-Walapane Road and Padiyapelella- Maturata Road as well as the people living in these towns, could be ensured.

Sir, it is very important that the people living in the hill country be made aware of good practices to minimize landslides by their actions. The NBRO has introduced land-use practices in the Badulla and the Matale Districts to minimize risks in these districts.

The NBRO has completed landslide hazard maps in 1:50,000 scale covering the districts of Matale, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Kalutara, Kegalle and Ratnapura. Mapping of districts of Badulla, Matara, Galle and

Hambantota is in progress. It is proposed to have landslide hazard maps for all 10 districts vulnerable to landslides by 2011, which I believe, will be of an immense help for the planning of development activities in these districts.

Sir, during the heavy monsoonal rains, the NBRO has recorded 93 and 126 incidents of slope failure with serious consequences in the Kalutara and the Galle Districts respectively. All these have occurred as a result of cutting down trees in hilly areas without proper planning. The NBRO has initiated awareness programmes for the people living in the hill slopes to increase their knowledge about landslides and how to live with landslides. Programmes are targeted for school children, decision-makers, planners, administrators, Grama Niladharis and Samurdhi Niladharis and villagers as well. A large number of awareness materials have also been prepared by the NBRO in the forms of books, posters, video clips and manuals.

Sir, it is not an easy task to prevent people interfering with nature and regulations are required to control any inappropriate human activities which increase the potential of landslide in an area. I have already instructed my officials to submit required legal provisions which would enable the NBRO to take action against those who violate the regulations.

Sir, one more institution under my Ministry is the Department of Meteorology, one of the oldest institutions, a watchdog over weather and weather-related events since 1948. This Department has been designated as the Tsunami Early Warning Centre after the tsunami in 2004, and functions as the focal point authority for receiving tsunami information and issuing warnings and advisories. This Department provides meteorological and climatological services to the general public and to Government institutions on weather conditions such as cyclone, heavy rain, lightning and high wind. As its prime responsibility, this Department contributes to public awareness programmes on weather, climate and climate change thematic areas. I also take this opportunity to mention to the House that we had 30,602 visitors to the Department during last year.

Recently the Meteorological Data Dissemination System for reception of satellite information was installed by the Indian Meteorological Department. The Department distributed 50 rain gauges to schools in flood-vulnerable areas in the Central Province. Currently, the procurement procedures have been completed for acquisition of Doppler Radar from the World Meteorological Organization and construction work of an access road to Gonagala Peak is in progress. Doppler Radar will provide accurate time information of hazardous weather, including heavy rain, lightning and strong winds within a short time. Now, we are in the process of extending value-added weather service to the

791 792

North and the East through installation of the latest equipment and awareness programmes.

Sir, my Ministry has declared 26th December as the National Safety Day to keep the people reminded of the disasters and improve their capacity to take timely action. In 2010, the Ministry is planning to commemorate the National Safety Day in Jaffna and I take this opportunity to cordially invite the Hon. Members to join with us at this important national event.

Sir, last but not least, I want to mention that the role played by this Ministry in achieving and sustaining the economic and social development is unquestionable. The thrust provided by the Budget on this Ministry is enormous.

The responsibility placed upon my Ministry in meeting with the challenges is even greater. In responding to these challenges, I hereby undertake to provide services to the people to greater heights in the future.

I must thank my Secretary and the Director-General of the Disaster Management Centre and all other officials of my Ministry for the support and co-operation extended to me to deliver the goods. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Minister, for your kind invitation. . [. . 5.48] ( )

. . . . . , . - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, Order, please! When a Member denies something in the House - and in this instance it is a Minister - the normal practice is to accept it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is because you are in the Chair. He has to deny what I am saying.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Denial is always accepted.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So let him deny. Let that go into the Hansard. You do not need to teach me about that. So, on that score, this is something which has been printed on page 48. I will table the Agreement as well, which I will ensure, with the permission of the Chair, is printed as well. It very clearly states that the IMF has imposed a condition that the Petroleum Corporation and the CEB cannot incur any further losses, and losses have to be turned into profits. I am basically asking the Government to rebuke me if that is the case. I do not want to waste any further time because that is in black and white.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That was done during your regime.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, for God's sake, please behave. -[Interruption.] I am telling you, it was signed under former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. -[Interruption.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) The Chairman then was Mr. Daham Wimalasena. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There was a revision that was required during Mr. Daham Wimalasena' s time. It was basically the same agreement that President Chandrika Kumaratunga signed and it was only extended. - [Interruption.] So, that is the same thing. Do not basically make it a UNP or a SLFP Agreement. If that was the case, it was the SLFP Government that entered into an Agreement with the Laugfs Company. All that was done, was the extension of the time period. So, there was no difference at all. It was the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that entered into the Agreement, and it is still being carried out by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. So, please do not try to politicize everything. I am getting up here as a professional in order to emphasize that we have a problem. Let us solve it. There is no green, blue, red to this problem. You are talking of a loss that has been incurred in your entity. The Petroleum Corporation is not making a profit. You are making a loss of Rs. 12 billion after charging the highest petroleum prices in the region. So, there has to be something radically wrong. It has to be corruption; misuse; or there is too much labour involved in the process.

CORRUPTION IN MUNICIPAL COUNCILS OF COLOMBO AND KANDY

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , .

I move the following Adjournment Motion owing to the fact that the Colombo Municipal Council and some other Local Councils have been dissolved and no elections have been held.:

"The Local Councils official tenure of office has lapsed. The Government has arbitrarily extended the period. Today, Colombo Municipal Council and Kandy Municipal Council are run by Government intervention and thus it has been politicized

by the Government resulting in unprofessional running and corruption and thus the rate payers are being deprived of a professional service for the rates paid. Suddenly, the Colombo Municipal Council was dissolved and instead of calling elections

they have appointed a special commissioner. Would the Hon. Minister please ensure that the corruption report of Colombo Municipal Council, Kandy Municipal Council are tabled in Parliament immediately and as to why elections are not held forthwith?"

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Member cannot refer to the President's travel. He goes right around the country. This is a road leading to Parliament. You, I and the public from Kaduwela and from all other places use this road. He cannot refer to the President like that. The President travels right around the country, not like your Leader. Your Leader is hiding. He has no place even in "Sirikotha."
