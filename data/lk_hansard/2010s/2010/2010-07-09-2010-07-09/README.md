( ) (The Chairman) .. . [. . 10.11] .. ( )

( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that the country is today deriving benefit from a stable peace in the country and also from political stability. That is the reason why the Sri Lankan economy is growing by approximately 7 per cent. The most visible developments are in the field of tourism where enormous investment is taking place : building new hotels, upgrading existing hotels, particularly, a revival of the economy in the Eastern Province. All these developments are taking place with regard to the economy.

I would like with your permission, Sir, to clarify the position regarding the United Nations office, because there seems to be some degree of confusion in respect of what has actually happened. The United Nations is not closing its office in Colombo. That is incorrect. They are closing only the regional office, but the operations of the United Nations in Sri Lanka will continue. That is very clear. Mr. Neil Buhne, the Resident Coordinator, the Head of the UN office in Colombo, has not been recalled to New York. He has been asked to come for consultations. It is not that they are closing down the operations in Sri Lanka and asking Mr. Neil Buhne to come to New York. That is not the position. He has been asked to come to New York for consultations, but he will come back to Sri Lanka.

Now, Sir, I would like to explain categorically that throughout this situation, the Government of Sri Lanka has looked after the safety of the United Nations' premises. Nobody was harmed. There was a demonstration. The Government took action to strengthen protection at the periphery. The police were increased and at the end of the day when the personnel of the UN office wanted to go home, they were permitted to do so; nobody was obstructed. The exits and the entrances were open. They were allowed to go home. Then, the four officials who remained expressed a wish to do so. They were not restrained from leaving the premises. They wanted to stay for a few hours. That was their decision and they stayed on. After that, they left the office and reached their homes in safety. Nobody was harmed; there was no intimidation; there was no harassment. I want to make that very clear in the interest of accuracy. Also, Sir, I would also like to say that the Government of Sri Lanka gave categorical assurances to the United Nations in New York, that we will continue to guarantee the inviolability of the United Nations' premises on Bauddhaloka Mawatha.

1241 1242

2010 09

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Have they closed the office? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, they have not. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is a news item today. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

But, that is wrong. That is exactly what I said. Hon. John Amaratunga, I said two minutes ago, that that report is wrong. They have not closed their office. They have closed a part of it; the regional office. The operations of the United Nations system in Sri Lanka will continue. Mr. Neil Buhne has been asked to come to New York for consultations, which as you well know - [Interruption.] No, he has been asked to come for consultations. The Hon. John Amaratunga, having served in the Cabinet, is well aware that that is not unusual. Sometimes envoys are recalled for consultations in situations of this kind. That has happened. He has been asked to come to New York for consultations. But, it is wrong to say that he has been recalled from Sri Lanka. That is not the factual position - [Interruption.]

I want to emphasize, Sir, that the Government of Sri Lanka, through the proper channels, gave the United Nations in New York, very explicit, emphatic and categorical assurances that the inviolability of the premises will be guaranteed. They were well aware of that. Mr. Neil Buhne was also aware, throughout yesterday, of the efforts that were being made by the Government of Sri Lanka, to resolve this crisis. There were efforts being made throughout yesterday and we were in constant touch with Mr. Neil Buhne. The Secretary to my Ministry, Mr. Romesh Jayasinghe was talking to him constantly and he was fully aware of the steps that we were taking to endeavour to resolve this crisis. We had every expectation, Sir, that in the course of today, before the weekend, we should be able to arrive at some resolution to this. That was known by the United Nations system.It is therefore, in our view a little precipitate and hasty; I say that it is precipitate and hasty on the part of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to have taken this action. He knew what was being done. We were making progress. These are not situations that can be completely resolved in an hour or two. It takes a little time. We have to act within the parameters of a democratic system where demonstrations cannot be forcibly stopped. So, the United Nations system was aware of it. They knew of the progress that was being made and we had every expectation of being

able to resolve this crisis speedily. So, it is in that situation that this decision was made in New York, which we regret, because we think that it was somewhat hasty.

However, the Government of Sri Lanka is committed to dialogue as the way forward, as the avenue for the resolution of problems of this kind. We will, therefore, continue to be engaged with the United Nations system in putting in place, an acceptable solution as soon as possible. [Interruption.] Yes, I am aware of that. But, Mr. Chairman, this is not the first time in the history of this country, that problems of this kind have arisen - [Interruption.] - and this is why I said in all seriousness, without any rancour to the Opposition benchers, yesterday, that in situations of this kind, where you are dealing with multilateral bodies, with the United Nations system, we should not try to play party politics. There is a time and place for party politics. It is in that spirit that I referred to India. I can honestly say that it was not to sling mud at anybody, it was not to cause any embarrassment to any individual, but I was just pointing out the difference between the culture of the two countries. It is in that context that I referred to Shrimati Sushma Swaraj, who categorically said that in India, the BJP, the major Opposition party would never play politics with international issues. That is the point I made. These are international issues. It is in the countrys interest to resolve matters of this kind. These are not partisan issues which are exclusively of interest to one political party or the other. The future of the country, the strength of its economy, its stability, its image in the world are the matters that are at issue here. It is precisely in that kind of context that Shrimati Sushma Swaraj made this point.

I would also like to tell you, Sir, that two hours after this discussion with Shrimati Sushma Swaraj - the discussion that she had with His Excellency the President and with me - I was sitting next to Shrimati Sonia Gandhi at a banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan and I told Shrimati Sonia Gandhi, Madam, two hours ago the Leader of the Opposition had this to say about their attitude to the conduct of the Indias Foreign Policy and Shrimati Sonia Gandhi told me that that is very much entrenched in the Indian culture and that is how they deal with Indias foreign relations. That is the point I made. I had no intention of causing any hurt or embarrassment to any individual and with regard to the intervention by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition a few minutes ago, that is precisely what I said.

Shrimati Sushma Swaraj said that they would certainly not dream of pressurizing a foreign government to take action against India. They would pressurize locally, certainly, they will use all means at their disposal to exert pressure within the borders of the Republic of India, but they would not pressurize a foreign government, a multilateral institution to exert pressure on their country, because it is their country. It is not the country of the Congress Party, it is not the country of the

1243 1244

BJP, it is the country which belongs to them all. The country where in the fullness of time they are all going to lay down their bones. That was the whole spirit which permeated the discussion with Shrimati Sushma Swaraj had with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in New Delhi. That is all I said.

The contrast here is obvious and I was quoting the paragraphs of this report, I was not saying anything of my own. It is not a Sri Lankan document. It is a formal document of the United States Senate. The word is there - pressurizing. Now, that is exacly what would never happen in India, and it is that that was emphatically confirmed both by the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and by Shrimati Sonia Gandhi, the Chairperson of the Congress Party of India. I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Chairman) . [ ] . 3 . . [ ] , . [ ] . . .

The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was speaking about Mr. Neil Buhne only being called for consultation and not being recalled. Hon. Minister, usually it is the procedure that sometimes an ambassador is recalled or asked to come for consultation and sometimes he is never sent back for years. It is more or less a thing that happens before an ambassador is recalled or before an embassy is closed in a country. So, even if he is called for consultation, it is serious and it should be taken up with more seriousness, and the Government has to give its attention.

The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris has also made statements in the newspapers that everybody has a right to have peaceful demonstrations. I really appreciate that, Sir. But, I must tell you, that when I was the Minister of Higher Education, there were thousands of students who came and demonstrated peacefully in front of the University Grants Commission. We never used force. But, today, university students cannot demonstrate against certain things and fight for their rights. They are sent back; force is used and they are assaulted and you are talking about peaceful demonstrations being allowed in

the country. If you are allowing it, then you should use the same yardstick for everybody else; for the Opposition, for the university students and for the activists.

[. . 12.30] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am grateful to you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this occasion, in what should have been a Discussion on the Votes of the Budget 2010.

I had missed most of the exchanges in the House last week, but in following what was said, I felt that I had not missed much in terms of rational arguments from the Opposition. This week was more interesting because individual hysteria, as we just saw, is always more entertaining than mass hysteria. But, it was sad that the same, simple, and in fact, contradictory themes, came in most of the speeches of the big guns, in terms of noise, if not of content of the Opposition.

The two themes that seemed to reverberate were those of submission to the IMF and carelessness in dealing with the international community. There were charges of inconsistency this morning from the brains trust of the Opposition, the Hon. Kabir Hashim, who failed to understand that the Budget is based on three very simple principles. They are, fiscal responsibility, social justice and national unity and security. The last of these, for obvious reasons, predominated in the last few years and it is good that the Opposition too, at least, pays lip service to this principle. But, their new found conversion to patriotism should not blind them to the need for continuing engagement with those who support our national goals. They should be ashamed of encouraging demonstrations against the IMF, as the Hon. Kabir Hashim seemed to do today. But, I suspect that the noise raised against the IMF is entirely due to jealousy.

Imagine the hysteria of a different sort that the Opposition would have engaged in, if the last tranche of the loan had not been forthcoming. But, the IMF does not issue blank cheques of the sort the Leader of the Opposition boasted of earlier and, which led to such damage to this country, when the spendthrift policies of the government in which he cut his teeth were encouraged with no heed for justice or equity or ethnic harmony, so that terrorism was able to rear its head.

No, Sir, the IMF advises and discusses conditionalities and any prudent government will accept conditionalities when they are congruent with national interest.What no government that depends on the support of its people will do is, accept conditionalities that are not congruent. Unfortunately, we have had a few instances of such conditionalities and we have had to reject them.

But, that should not preclude continuing engagement with those who suggest such things. Experience indicates that often these spring from misjudgment and from people being misguided. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs made clear from where such false guidance came. Though the Hon. Leader of the Opposition made a valiant attempt to explain away the plain English of the United States Senate Report, we have had enough and more examples of such casuistry to swallow such explanations.

There is, however, some light at the end of this tunnel for a country that has suffered too long from misrepresentation. Perhaps, the highlight of the speech of the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, which indicated a national

1287 1288

consensus regarding the sad decision of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint a panel, which itself does not seem clear about its responsibilities, was his reference to some European Ambassadors consulting him about GSP Plus. Sadly, in the first few years of this Government, many European Ambassadors and indeed some UN Officials believed the myths propagated by the Opposition, that the Tigers were too strong for the Sri Lankan Forces and that the Government would fall because of crossovers. That belief has changed in the last few years and it is my belief, Sir, that we now have in this country international representatives who understand the mutual confidence that the people of this country and the Government of the President have in each other. I believe that they, including Mr. Neil Buhne, have done their best to overcome some of the prejudices put in place by their predecessors, who accepted the advice of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, as cited by the United States Senate, to continue to pressurize the Government. I am, therefore, delighted that they have begun to consult those with a more adult conception of what the role of an Opposition should be.

Sir, we will continue to engage and build up trade relations with countries in Europe as well as elsewhere. The loss of GSP Plus is to be regretted, but the price we were asked to pay would have been regretted even more. This does not mean that there are not areas in human rights in which we have identified actions that must be taken and these will proceed. But, as the communiqu signed last year by His Excellency the President and the Secretary-General of the United Nations indicated with regard to another context, such measures are the responsibility of the sovereign, elected Government of this country.

Finally, Sir, may I draw your attention to some inconsistency in the comments of the Opposition with regard to the other two goals of this Budget. The Hon. Kabir Hashim, who was a Minister when the education budget was ruthlessly slashed, will grant that social justice was not high on the agenda of the Government he served. But, more remarkably, though the claim then was of fiscal responsibility, the 2003 Budget, a copy of which I still treasure as an example of how not to conduct a government, made clear that several Ministries had no operational funds at all; that is, they were created simply to provide jobs for the boys. This practice began in the time of the Jayewardene Government and the country has continued to pay for a job of at least one of the boys of those distant days. In fact, for some reason, the Budget Estimates give him two pages of identical allocations, which I hope is a mistake.

But, this Government was finally able, after 33 years, to cut down on such unnecessary expenditure and the presentation of the Budget makes clear that rationalization will continue. We can only hope, Sir, that, as the

Opposition also tries now to rationalize, we will find support for the positive measures of the Government, constructive criticism on the areas in which improvement is possible and thorough commitment to the unity and security of this country with the promotion of discipline as well as equity and social justice.

Thank you.

. , . . [.. 1.23] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Now that you have thrown a challenge, Minister, Hon. Dew Gunasekara, we will respond. - [Interruption.] Sir, today I will speak in English.

First of all, I consider this opportunity a privilege to speak on the various departments and agencies coming under the Ministry of Finance and Planning. On the first day of the Budget Debate, we tried to articulate the point that this Budget was developed based on the discussions the Government of Sri Lanka had with the International Monetary Fund. The Government, over and over again, attempted to say that there was no link between this Budget and the IMF. They said there were no conditionalities. However, over the last two weeks, we have been debating this point. We have been saying, Yes, there are conditions laid down by the IMF". Those on the other side of the isle have been saying, No, there are not.

1305 1306

2010 09

Sir, now I want to table two documents. I want them to be included in Hansard.- [Interruption.] Hon. Gunasekara, please stay. I am responding to you. The first document I table* is the Press Release of 28th of June by the IMF.

It very clearly states, I quote:

Despite the weaker-than-programmed 2009 fiscal performance, the Governments 2010 Budget proposal, if carried out, would significantly address past fiscal slippages, mainly through comprehensive tax reforms and sizeable cuts in recurrent spending.

The second document I want to table is the most interesting one. - [Interruption.] The Letter of Intent - [Interruption.] Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, please listen. - [Interruption.] Please listen. - [Interruption.] You accuse us of not having a substantial debate. But, when we want to have a substantial debate, you scream. - [Interruption.] Hon. De Vass Gunawardena, sit down, will you? You and I are from the same village in the South. -[Interruption.] Please, listen to me.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Now, the division in your party is very clear. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The second document I table*, Sir, is the request of the Government of Sri Lanka for a Stand-by Arrangement.

Then, I refer to a document titled "Table 2. Sri Lanka: Prior Actions and Structural Conditionality". That is, the conditionalities of the Loan Agreement. It states "Prior Actions and Structural Conditionality". There are a number of conditions given here including the increase of the Nation Building Tax by 200 per cent. That is, from one percentage point to three percentage points. That is given as a prior action. There are a number of other things about the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the Ceylon Electricity Board et cetera. But, I am not going into any of those because we have already done so. However, I am going to point out to you the last condition. The last condition, Sir, is this. I want to read it out properly. - [Interruption.] - Hon. De Vass Gunawardena, listen. It states, I quote:

Submission to Parliament of the 2010 Budget consistent with programme targets.

What more do I need to show to prove my point? That is behind us. We do not want to dwell on that anymore. We want to move forward. I want to say to this House - to those on the other side as well - that the UNP has always been for reducing the Budget Deficit. We have not moved away from it. - [Interruption.] ( ) (An Hon. Member) How do you reduce the Budget Deficit?

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) We are not saying what the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama presented to Parliament is wrong. We are not saying that. - [Interruption.] It is the right thing, which we stood for. - [Interruption.] I will come to the point. - [Interruption.] With the introduction of the Fiscal (Responsibility) Management Act of 2002, you and we agreed to reduce the Budget Deficit to 5 per cent by 2006. But what happened was, after the 2004 General Election, with the Rata Perata regime and subsequently, with the Mahinda Chintana, it went haywire. The Budget Deficit, instead of being reduced, got increased. That is where the problem began. The officials of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and Planning are probably there in the Officials' Box. What happened was, there was what we economists call fiscal dominance of monetary policy. During a particular period of time, what happened was, there was what was called monetary accommodation.- [Interruption.] The fiscal policy was, the Ministry of Finance and Planning was spending and the Central Bank was accommodating that expenditure. - [Interruption.] That is why there was uncontrollable inflation. Now, I must also say that that has, to a great extent, reduced. I must say that also. It has reduced to a great extent: the fiscal dominance has reduced and monetary accommodation has also reduced. This is the difference in the Chintana. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is here. I have been saying this previously also. The Mahinda Chintana - Towards a New Sri Lanka states in page 40, I quote:

......reduction of the Budget Deficit ....... is not a characteristic of prudent public finance and management.... - [Interruption.]

In page 40 of the Mahinda Chintana - Towards a New Sri Lanka, you are saying that your policy is to reduce the Budget Deficit. We like that. That is good. We must be pragmatic about that. The problem, though, is all this time, what you have been doing has impoverished the people. They are being taxed to the core. Now, you are saying, Look, we have to do this; we have to increase taxes. All those Hon. Members were saying, We have no option.

1307 1308

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

. But you must also realize, Sir, that over the period of the six-year regime, the Cost of Living Index or the Colombo Consumer Price Index has gone up by almost 100 per cent. . [ ] . What I was going to say - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, please listen. What I was going to say was, you had two contracts. One contract, you had with the IMF and the other, with the people. In fact, you went before the people twice, with the Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Election, and you had a contract with the people. - [Interruption.] Ultimately what happened? Whose contract took priority? - [Interruption.] You forgot the people; you forgot the people who voted for you. , . IMF priority . [ ] You forgot the people. - [Interruption.] You did not tell the truth to the people. - [Interruption.] You did not have the guts to tell the people the truth. . . , . . 2,500 . , today you come here and say, "We are sorry, the IMF takes priority". - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Please do not disturb him.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) But, that is all right. - [Interruption.] Let us look beyond. The Hon. Minister wanted us to talk substance. Therefore, please let us look beyond.

Then, I move on to the end of the war. We all respect His Excellency the President and everybody else who fought the war and brought it to an end. However, how do we leverage this opportunity? Now, the Hon. Dew Gunasekara said that the two Deputy Ministers are here. I am going to ask the two Deputy Ministers, have you read, "The Economic Development of Sri Lanka : A Tale of Missed Opportunities" by Donald R. Snodgrass. Have you read that? It was written in 1999. Actually 33 years before that, there was another publication and in that publication, he wrote an article under the heading, Ceylon : An export Economy in Transition". The whole world was pregnant with hope that Sri Lanka will become the great nation of Asia. , . . . . ? [Interruption.] - Professor Sirimal Abeyratne at the Colombo University has written a lot about this and what does he say? He says, "Ultimately it boils down to two things - policies and politics".

Now, having finished the war, His Excellency the President says, There is no development without peace, and there is no peace without development. [Interruption.] Now, is this a mere political rhetoric? I want to ask you that. The TNA MPs have been showing that the allocations to the North and East have been minuscule. They are talking about as to how they are going to build these houses, roads and give them jobs. Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, how are they going to do it? They were asking questions. So, I ask, is this mere rhetoric or are you going to actually - [Interruption.] Okay.

Now, what I want to say is, there are a lot of lessons that we can learn from Malaysia. I said, "Malaysia" because there was a Malaysian expert who spoke at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit, a couple of days ago. These two countries both face similar situations at independence - Sinhalese Vs. Tamils, Chinese Vs. Malays. What did they do? They overcame that problem. They overcame with a new economic plan, the discrepancies and discriminations that the two communities faced. Now what has happened? Malaysia has lapped us many times. -[Interruption.] Now, there is a discipline called "Horizontal Inequalities". There is a Professor by the name of Frances Stewart at Oxford, who writes about these things. Her first book is on Sri Lanka - comparing Sri Lanka and Malaysia. What does she say? She says, "You have to have policies that do not discriminate based on race or whatever group that people belong to".

A couple of days ago, the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma said that we need to increase the price of bread to Rs. 1,000. That is what he said. Now by doing that, what happens to the people in the estates that the Hon. Sri Ranga represents? They eat bread. They use wheat flour. If you take the price of bread to Rs. 1,000, how does it impact them? You can do it. All what I am saying is, there is a discipline that you need to read about these things. That is how Malaysia overcame these problems. The policy making must be equitable to all segments of society. [Interruption.]

Now, the next issue after peace is sustainable economic development. There are two things in economic development. One is growth. We all are talking about growth rates - 7 per cent, 8 per cent and all that. [Interruption.] ? The second is, equitable distribution of that growth. Now we all know, to grow at 8 or 9 per cent, we need to invest about 40 per cent as a percentage of the GDP. That is the investment. The reason for such a high proportion of investment is because of - learn if you do not know, it is called ICOR - Incremental Capital Output Ratio. And, because of the inefficiency and corruption of the system, there are so much of leakages. That is why you have to invest so much. . .

So, then the point is, how do we bridge this gap? Is it going to be private-sector led or is it going to be Government-led? Now, this is very interesting. This is the "Daily Financial Times" of yesterday, 8th July, 2010. I want to just read from the front page of the Daily Financial Times. What does it state? It states, I quote:

Gota urges investors to think positive

That is what it states. That is, to bring in investments to Sri Lanka.

Then, again the Malaysian expert states, I quote:

Some political leaders and nations foolishly question why must foreigners come and make profits in their country

He further states,

I quote:

Say no to emotional nationalism!

Come on gentlemen and ladies, let us move beyond this. If you want to develop this country, let us move away from emotional nationalism - what our Hon. Wimal Weerawansa is doing and what others are doing? Let us really understand what the problem is. [Interruption.]

The next article in the same newspaper states, I quote:

Ahoy private sector!

Dr P.B. Jayasundera says this. So he is also asking private investments to come in. But, what does this box below say? The box says that the Government pays Rs. 58 billion to Al-Maktoum to purchase his shares. What does that say? So, is this not absolute contradiction? On the one hand, you say, "Come private sector invest". On the other, you say, "No, the Government will own everything". [Interruption.] So, if the Sri Lankan Airlines is losing Rs. 12.2 billion a year; if the Government taking the full responsibility to invest in Sri Lankan Airlines? Is this not an absolute contradiction, I ask you?

Now, look at India. You do not need to look far, look at India. In India, the state involvement in the market place is very limited. But, in Sri Lanka, it is not the case. In telecommunication, 82 per cent is private sector, electricity 42 per cent, road 16 per cent, rail 4 per cent, ports 80 per cent and airports 68 per cent. The next time you go to Delhi, you will land in Terminal 3. Terminal 3 is the fifth largest airport in the world. [Interruption.]Yes, because that is what I am telling you. It will only opened next Saturday. Do you know how much it cost? Do you know? Tell me Sajin, you are the aviation man. How

much did it cost? How much? . . [ ] . It cost US Dollars three billion. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Do not disturb. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) It cost US Dollars three billion. invest ? GMR Group.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please, Hon. Member. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) It was 50 per cent of this new terminal. Indians are

progressing. - [Interruption.] . Airport . . [ ] . . - [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Chairman, I cannot speak if these Members are disturbing like this. [ ] . Sit down, please. [Interruption.] -Thank you. , , . . [ ] Whether you look at Mumbai, Hyderabad or Bangalore, it is the same story. Let us learn the good things from India.

Now, the other model is for the Government to spend. That is what the Hon. Vasudava Namayakkara was saying. All the other Members and the Ministers who were speaking, were saying that the Government must spend, therefore the Government must tax. That is the only way it can spend. Come on! Get out of that box. What is happening is, in the tax revenue - the debt repayment for 2010 - capital component and interest, there is a discrepancy. On the first day I asked, is it US Dollars 787 billion as provided by the special law or is it US Dollars 332 billion plus 565 billion, which was presented by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama the other day? Either way, it does not matter. If you take the lower figure, it is 108 per cent of the tax revenue. So, where is the money to invest? Please answer that question. You buy the shares of Sri Lankan Airlines and you take total responsibility to invest. You build Maththala Airport all by yourselves. You take the total responsibility to invest. What we saw was what the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti was saying. There have been massive cuts year after year in capital expenditure in all Ministries except for the Hon. Basil Rajapaksas Ministry, which is a new Ministry. -[Interruption.] We do not know and we will have to wait and see.

1311 1312

So, the problem therefore, is that this model is unsustainable. It is unsustainable. Last year alone, the increase of commercial loans was 151 per cent. I do not have to tell this. You know that. All the officials are here. They will tell you that. -[Interruption.] Right, but that is the truth Sajin.- [Interruption.] It is not sustainable. If you want private investment, create that space for private investment. Create the space. -[Interruption.] I do not know Sajin, have you read "Danny Crossmann"? Danny Crossman is a guy who talked about [Interruption.] Will you please listen? , - [Interruption.] - You have to know about the world, Sajin. . . . [ ] So, Danny Crossman says that you need good governance. Good governance; .

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Right. I will finish. -[Interruption.] So, now, please sit down. Give me two more minutes. -[Interruption.] . - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Members, he is going to wind up. Please sit down. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) So, what is happening is, these people are going and getting loans from all over the world. I want to show you a very interesting article in the same Daily Financial Times. Now, for a question raised the other day by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the relevant Minister said, of all the loans taken from China from 2006 to 2009 - of what is called "Chinese Aid" - 99 per cent were loans and the Hon. Kabir Hashim showed that for some loans, the interest rate was more than 6 per cent.

Now, look at this. This is from the "Daily Financial Times" dated 8th July, 2010. I am just taking one day's newspaper and contradicting your positions. It states, I quote:

China now exports its convicts!

What is this? I want to read it out. It states, I quote:

Thousands of Chinese convicts, for example, have been pressed into service in projects by State-run

Chinese companies in Sri Lanka, a strategically important country for China, . Human rights . port projects ? Brahma Chellaney - author of the International best-seller "Asian Juggernaut" . I will table* this newspaper article. - [Interruption.] . , . - [Interruption.] I take the responsibility. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, now wind up, please. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) All right. Anyway, I am running out of time.- [Interruption.] But, let me finish my speech by saying this. [Interruption.] You challenged us to make a contribution. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Mr. Deputy Chairman, please expunge that. He is referring to a foreign government. So, it is a very serious issue. [Interruption.] He has no responsibility to say so. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If that is against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You challenged us to make a technical contribution and we have made it. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) This is a very serious issue. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) I will look into it. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Can you sit down? - [Interruption.] Please let me finish my speech.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Now, wind up, please. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You challenged us to make a technical contribution; we have made a technical contribution. We have said, "It is necessary to reduce the deficits". We agree with that. Our problem is that, the contract with the people was forgotten and the contract with the IMF took priority. That is what we were saying. We say, let us move beyond this. Just put the past behind and move beyond this.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. You have almost taken one more minute. Please wind up. I cannot give you more time.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Let me finish. All what I am saying is, let us create an environment to bring in the foreign and local private sector, because without them, our model is not sustainable. I hope you would take my constructive criticism into your thinking.

Thank you very much.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, he was talking about foreign investment and he misled the House. If you look at the history of foreign investment in this country, the then President, Mr. J.R. Jayewardene established the Greater Colombo Economic Commission in 1977 and today, as the BOI, we have progressively increased our foreign investment. During the last five years, we have gone beyond our own records. We are now almost at the point of a billion dollars. But, the very same people who have come to this House not representing the people but through a list - God only knows how they have been appointed - are today criticizing us and misleading this House.
