[. . 1.52] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) . , . . . . Today, we are meeting perhaps for the last time in this term of Parliament. We have just completed a very closely- fought, very vituperative and acrimonious campaign. Somehow, the result is something that the entire Opposition is not prepared to concede and that is another matter. There is a common saying among the Americans. The people of the United States of America also have a presidency which runs for a term of four years. There, a President can only have two terms. Similarly, we too have an Executive Presidency where a single individual can enjoy two such terms, each extending to six years, in total 12 years. The Americans say that when a President gets elected, in his first term he concentrates on winning his second term and when he gets on to the second term, he focuses on earning a place in history. The other day at Hyde Park when we had that massive rally, an unprecedented large crowd gathered for the first time perhaps in the history of this country. After a Presidential Election with such a convincing majority, we had a massive protest rally by the Opposition pointing out various loopholes in the legitimacy of the election results. In that platform, I spoke in Sinhala and said, certainly quoting this particular situation that I referred to in the United States of America, that our President concentrated on winning his second term during his first term and even before he was sworn in for the second term, he has created history in conducting the most fraudulent and rigged election in the annals of electoral history in this country. - [Interruption.] Having said that, I am not going to delve on it anymore. Let us contest that in courts; contest that before the people.

2253 2254

Today, I have to make a much more responsible speech. That is why I would like to divert and be given the ear of the Government benches to point this out. I was somewhat relieved, though I have reservations about the electoral verdict, when I heard President Rajapaksa speaking to a very small gathering at the Election Secretariat at Rajagiriya when he was declared the winner. I heard him say that he is the President of not only those who voted for him, but also those who did not vote for him. Definitely, it is a sentiment that must be appreciated. But, definitely that is also a sentiment which must be reciprocated. Those who did not vote for him should feel the same way. Therefore, there is a great onus placed on his shoulders to convert these words into real action.

We have the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana before us today who had been presiding over a fruitless exercise for the last several years. We were part of that exercise. Nothing came out of it. Finally, we did not even see his final report. When I asked him for a copy, he said that that is only for the eyes of the President. Hopefully, whatever is there, we can expect something to happen in the next term. But then, could we have any hopes particularly when you look at the way in which this entire electorate has been polarized? I heard the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharanas Colleague, who also subscribes the same ideology as him, the Hon. Minister of Constitutional Affairs, speaking this morning and comparing this question of polarization. I dare say that when you take up this election, on the surface it seems that there is a very serious polarization. Almost 32 electorates, where there is a predominance of minorities or where there is a considerable leverage of the minority votes, the President has lost. In all electorates where there is a predominant Sinhala-Buddhist population, he appears to have got a resounding majority. This is not a very healthy sign. None of us want this to be in the similar fashion. That is if we do accept the legitimacy of this election. What we feel is, there has been a very carefully-planned, well-orchestrated manipulation of the results. That is a different matter. But, then as it seems, even if the results were different, there appears to be a particular trend which was created by the Government and the Presidents campaign team which was focusing on a campaign to rouse the sentiments of the Southern Sinhala population against a non-existent agreement between General Fonseka and the Hon. Sampanthan. That may be one reason or perhaps there may be other reasons but then, I do not for a moment concede that that was the ground on which this electorate voted. In any event, we stand by our position that there was serious manipulation of these results. Does a President who had won such a convincing majority behave in a fashion such as this to show some insecurity in pursuing his opponent, in seeking vendetta, in seeking revenge? I think you have to have a serious introspection as to what went wrong, where things went

wrong and why the minorities behaved and voted in this fashion. I am glad that the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana is here. Definitely, this leaves certain lessons for the Government to have a serious introspection as to the issues concerning minorities and as to why the collective minorities, both the Tamils and Muslims and the Up-country Tamils, did vote in this fashion. I am not for a moment trying to claim credit for this campaign, but then we need to have a serious introspection if we are to fulfil those pledges the President made even yesterday in his National Day Speech. Having said that, since I have very little time, Venerable Presiding Member, may I say a few words in Tamil.

[. . 4.07 ] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . , , . . 10 . 2004 . . Hon. Deputy Speaker, the resounding victory of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for a second term has earned the congratulations of several friendly countries. These messages of congratulation are a clear manifestation of solidarity towards Sri Lanka by the international community as well as an acknowledgement of the integrity of the election process executed by the Commissioner of Elections and his staff, which culminated in the polling on 26th January, 2010 and the announcement of the results by the Commissioner on the afternoon of 27th January, 2010. In announcing the final results on the 27th of January, 2010, the Elections Commissioner stated, "...the January 26th Presidential Election concluded in a peaceful atmosphere except for a few minor incidents". Subsequently, at a press briefing held on 3rd February,

2010 05 2291 2292

2010, the Elections Commissioner had also put to rest the wild rumours that were being spread questioning the integrity of the election process and the results and had advised anyone who is not satisfied with the final result, that the correct path to follow would be to go before the Supreme Court. That has been the practice in all elections in the event one is not satisfied with the results.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the integrity of the election process was further endorsed by the statements made by the election observer groups. The Commonwealth Expert Team in its report stated, ..based on our team reports and reports from other observers, it appears that overall voting and counting have proceeded reasonably well in most areas. The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence - CMEV- stated, I quote: In comparison with the violence recorded on Election Day in the 1999 and 2005 Presidential Elections, Election Day of the 2010 Presidential Election was considerably less violent. The Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections - PAFFREL - in its Election Day Report stated, I quote:

The Presidential Election took place in an essentially peaceful and calm environment. The higher voter turnout of nearly 75 per cent, out of which 99.03 per cent of the votes polled were valid, shows the enthusiasm with which the people of Sri Lanka have participated in the election, the first to be held in a country totally free of terrorism. Having received 58 per cent of the votes, the margin of victory of almost 18 per cent over the next closest rival candidate, provides President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his administration a strong and firm foundation on which to build for the future strengthening of national amity and for the progress and prosperity of our nation. By stating to the OpEd published in the "Wall Street Journal" of 3rd February that the election victory, ....is merely the start for Sri Lanka, the President has implied the strong resolve of his Government and himself to resolutely address the work ahead needed to lead our country towards prosperity, long-lasting peace and economic development. In the same OpED piece, the President goes on to call on the international community, I quote: ..to support us as we build a peaceful and successful Sri Lanka, united in our resolve to achieve the progress denied for decades. The President's view is, I quote:

..our future success relies on a lasting peace. The removal of terrorism was an important milestone in this process, but the nation needs to be bound by a common purpose. That purpose will be built around a full reconciliation programme. My new Government will address the genuine grievances of all communities and bolster the enforcement of equal rights for all. In the address of His Excellency the President to the nation at the 62nd National Day Celebrations on 4th February in Kandy, he echoed the same sentiments. I wish to remind the Hon. Members that yesterday our President informed the nation, I quote:

\In my foreign policy, whatever I have done was in the interest of the people of this country. Now the world should have a correct opinion about us. The Tiger terrorism that impacted on other countries too has ended. The state of war is now over. We are entering into a new era of co-existence after finishing the period of some controversy. I would like to say that we are now entering the golden era of international relations. Now the integrity of this election process is well established. The world has come to acknowledge the success of democracy and the vibrancy of our democratic society. People from all sections and communities equally participated in the election process. They have now spoken out and cast their votes. It is our responsibility to ensure that the world would be with us in the pursuit of what we are currently carrying on for the greater good of our people. In doing so, I must assure the international community that the country, as a democracy, a country that has defeated terrorism and is seeking prosperity, having now heard the voices of those who have been denied democracy and equal opportunities, because of the presence of terrorism, is marching forward and towards that, our constant assurance remains that we would be engaged with the international community. In doing so, we will give value to the judgment of our people in deciding Sri Lankas destiny. Our President has the objective of following vibrant international relations in pursuing goals for our people. That is how we have seen today the development agenda unfold in the Eastern Province as equally as in the northern part of Sri Lanka. In the South of Sri Lanka, the biggest development projects are now on and they bear fruit for our people. That is the voice the people have expressed in supporting President Mahinda Rajapaksas victory with an unprecedented majority where he has registered over 1.8 million votes over the next closest candidate. This is what the purpose of democracy is all about and this is the opportunity for the international community along with our Tamil brethren living abroad to be a part of that exercise for the greater good of our people. It is in that context that Sri Lanka has always been maintaining its stand and under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, our call has gone out to the international community and equally to the international Tamil community requesting them to join us in Sri Lanka in pursuing the goals of bringing about greater opportunity and prosperity for our people. There have been certain concerns expressed because of the agitation - sometimes that registers with the international community - coming from the Opposition and those are perceptions. It is time that we realize that perceptions alone cannot make a difference unless reality speaks in support of those perceptions. Today, in the absence of reality supporting perception, I call on the international community not to go by some of the statements that get echoed or expressed by a limited section of the Opposition in Sri Lanka who speaks sometimes without any basis, makes allegations without any substance, but to go along with the agenda that has been pursued by the people who have spoken out and

7 PL 004735 (2010/02)

2293 2294

supported President Mahinda Rajapaksas victory for a second term of Executive Presidency. We will always be there to address the issues that surface before us for the people of our country and towards that, the President has once again called on the international community to join hands with Sri Lanka in our pursuit of the goals for the greater good of our people. I thank the people of Sri Lanka for their response once again for the call of democracy and to join hands with all communities together for a country that can now act for the greater good of the people through the development agenda that is being pursued with opportunities for all. I thank you, Sir. [. . 4.18] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.
