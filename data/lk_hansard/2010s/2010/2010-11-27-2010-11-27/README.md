( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [. . 10.04] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. On the 19th of November, exactly a week ago, yesterday, after indulging in, I would say, a multimillion dollar inauguration, if I may add, the ill-gotten Second Term of his Presidency was of course an

993 994

extravaganza, which would have made even Kim Jong-il of North Korea envious. After that, President Rajapaksa presented the first ever Budget as the Government media says of the "new era", promising to make Sri Lanka, the emerging "Wonder of Asia. Of course, in order to facilitate his vision for our country - when the new God of the sun and the moon and the stars also, I think, now naturally wants to outshine Prabhakaran who used to call himself the Sun God - in the very same morning appointed the worlds largest number of Ministers. Name-board Ministries were generously distributed while ensuring that 70 per cent of the National Budget remained in the hands of one family. In an unprecedented display of arrogance and hubris, if I may add, the regime subscribed experienced and able Ministers to political obscurity. The Minister, Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, who was here a little while ago, one of the most able and capable Ministers Sri Lanka has ever produced and Ministers like the Hon. DEW Gunasekara, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and Ministers like former Prime Minister, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, who still can serve this country are much better than some of those Cabinet Ministers who were brought into the Cabinet this time merely for the sake of having a currish or brutish background. In fact, the underworld elements within the Government, I would say, were given preference in selecting new Ministers. Like the Emperor Caligula, whom we have read in history books, who appointed an ass or a donkey to the Senate of Rome to express his contempt and disdain for the political establishment of the day, the present leaders have expressed their hatred of the traditional Sri Lanka Freedom Party Leaders by the very manner they appointed the Cabinet just a week ago.

Sir, in the classic "newspeak" of the Rajapaksa regime, the President painted a rosy picture of our country presenting us with a collection of statistics during the Budget while almost completely forgetting all the promises given to the people during the last Presidential and General Elections. Many statistics given to Parliament in the Budget Speech, actually directly contradict figures put out by other arms of this very Government. In fact, most of our Members have dealt with this area very ably in the previous few days. So, I am not going into every single detail but, for example, in this Budget Speech, it claims that the per capita income this year is expected to be around US Dollars 2,375 in comparison to US Dollars 1,000 five years ago. I am quoting directly from His Excellencys Speech. However, I have read the Household Income and Expenditure Survey put out by the Department of Census and Statistics and what does it say? This document, again a Government document, claims that the per capita income in 2009 was Rs. 8,931 per month which amounts to Rs. 107,172 per year, which is actually US Dollars 952. According to this document, which is also a Government document, if I may repeat it, the per capita income as of last year was only US Dollars 952, which is a far cry from

the touted US Dollars 2,375 the Government is claiming. I would like to ask now, who is telling the truth? Who is misleading this House. Perhaps, the Secretary to the Treasury who obviously wrote the Budget Speech must be charged for misleading Parliament and even, I would say, for misleading the President.

Mr. Speaker, although the Budget Speech is full of such lies, or if I may use the Parliamentary language, "full of such inexactitudes", many of which should be dealt with by my colleagues here in the House. But, now I would like to move on to the central theme of the Budget which the State media has called an investor-friendly Budget.

In fact, in the Budget Speech the President says, I quote:

We need to reformulate our strategies and the institutional mechanism to improve our investment climate.

In the new global order of the 21st century, Mr. Speaker, where both the investors and the consumers they cater to have become more politically conscious and more politically correct, improving our investment climate does not only mean economic incentives or it does not only mean having a skilled labour force. The investment climate of a country today is determined by the political climate there. Democracy, human rights and the rule of law have been the key indicators of a countrys suitability and the perceived level of corruption in the country also plays an important role in attracting investors to that particular country.

In fact, after the war ended two years ago, Sri Lanka should have been the preferred destination for foreign investors given the geographical location, the experienced and skilled labour force that we have and the other economic incentives, which have been extended throughout this period by the Government. But, the website, Bloomberg, expresses some of these concerns in a news item published on the 23rd of November 2010, the very next day after the Budget. There is an article captioned Sri Lankas post-war boom misses investors wary of corruption in that website and it says, I quote:

Overseas investors remain concerned about corruption and red tape.

And this article further goes on to say, I quote:

Foreign direct investments fell to $ 208 million in the first six months from $ 253 million in the same period of 2009.

In fact, now that the war is over, in this period and in the same period as of last year, we should have doubled the Foreign Direct Investments but the exact opposite has happened. And, this article also states some of the reasons for this decline. I quote:

Berlin-based watchdog Transparency International ranks Sri Lanka 91st out of 178 countries on October, 26.....90 places below Singapore.

995 996

It also reminds us about our human rights record. I quote:

In July the European Union, rescinded Sri Lankas preferential trade access because of the countrys human rights record, particularly due to violence in the final weeks of the war that killed as many as 15,000 civilians.

It also points out the why the investors are keeping away. Again, I quote:

" Some investors are concerned by the growing power of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. After Rajapaksa was elected to a second term in January and his party swept elections in April, parliament lifted the two-term limit for the presidency. Three of Rajapaksa's brothers hold top government posts and his 24-year-old son is in parliament".

So, as you can see, these are articles which have been published in - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, today, because of gentlemen of this nature, Sri Lankas international reputation stands at all-time low and now Asias oldest democracy is perceived as a country well on the path to dictatorship and oligarchy. Despite the democratic trimmings and slogans of this Government, since the passage of the notorious Eigtheenth Amendment to the Constitution on the 8th of September, Sri Lanka has become a Constitutional autocracy as far as most people are concerned.

Actually, on a lighter note, as I talk about the 8th of September, which was the day the Eigtheenth Amendment was passed, this regimes lucky number is obviously number eight. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Presidential Elections both in 2005 and in 2010 were on days which added up to number eight. This is very interesting, a very light point, Hon. Azwer.- [Interruption.] For example, Mr. Speaker, in 2005, the Presidential Election was held on the 17th which adds up to eight. In 2010, the Presidential Election was held on the 26th which adds up to eight. Then, for example, I was removed from the Mahinda Rajapaksa Cabinet on the 8th of February and then - [Interruption..] I am just showing you some - [Interruption.] These are very interesting coincidents.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is on his feet. Why are you allowing these jack-in-the-box type of people to get on?- [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . [ ] . . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) As I was saying, I had to leave the Cabinet on the 8th of February and Sarath Fonseka was arrested on the 8th of February this year and the General Elections were held on the 8th of April this year. And, as I said earlier, what is very, very strange is that Lasantha Wickramatunge was also killed on the 8th of January and Sripathi Sooriyarachchi's high-speed accident also happened on the 8th of February 2008. In this regard, our leaders seem to have a lot in common with Prabhakharan, who believed in all these superstitious nonsense. He always planned his killings on an 8th. So, we wonder whether this is a clue to the death of Lasantha Wickramatunge and we wonder whether this is also a clue to the mysterious accident of Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi. Everything which happens, happens on the 8th under this Government.

Getting back to more serious stuff, Mr. Speaker, the new Eighteenth Amendment has now been passed into law killing the progressive Seventeenth Amendment, a historic piece of legislation which was endorsed unanimously by Parliament in 2001. While protecting the presidency and keeping it in the hands of the family, the Eighteenth Amendment also ensures that all appointments to the Public service, judiciary and the appointment of the Elections Commission or Commissioner fall under the writ of an almighty executive President. In short, the Eighteenth Amendment is a piece of the Rajapaksa legislation that ensures that the Rajapaksa writ holds sway over every single area of governance and public life, exactly that which the Seventeenth Amendment sought to prevent by way of de-politicizing the Public service, judiciary, police and ensuring independence during elections.

While all of us in the political firmament have been determined to redefine the Sri Lankan Constitution that would make the Presidency more accountable to the people - that was the stand of the common candidate and all the parties of the Opposition during the last Presidential Election - this Regime has checkmated the nation by this constitutional coup - actually what happened on the 18th was a power grab or a constitutional

coup, if I may add - to increase its powers and ensure that the First Family remain at the helm of this country for an indefinite period. In short, the Sri Lankan Presidency has now been transformed into the office of an all-powerful dictator. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. You cannot tolerate more than this.

For those who tell us that the President was re-elected by a popular mandate, - I know there are lots of people who say that the President was re-elected by a popular mandate - it should be told that some of the worst dictators the world has ever seen have tried to legitimize their positions by conducting nominal elections. -[Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, the former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, for example, held an election every five years where he was the only candidate; so does Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Adolf Hitler, for example, too obtained a two-thirds majority in the Reichstag on the 23rd of March, 1933 to pass the Enabling Act. - [Interruption.] Sir, this is not a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, please ensure that our prime Speaker, who is opening the Budget Debate for the fifth day, is allowed to speak. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] . . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Within 12 months of passing this Bill empowering Hitlers Cabinet to take over the functions of Parliament, Hitler banned all political parties but his own, wiped out the labour unions, stamped out democratic associations of any kind, abolished freedom of speech and of the press and stifled the independence of the courts. This is what Hitler did in 1933 after he passed the Enabling Act with the two-thirds majority in Parliament.

Without exaggeration, Mr. Speaker, Sri Lanka is now travelling on the same path. Today, this Government is trying to ruthlessly destroy the democratic Opposition just as Hitler tried in 1933. In fact, what did we see? Within the fortnight of the Presidential Elections, the common candidate for the Opposition, General Sarath Fonseka was

dragged out of his office by armed thugs and the most shocking political witch-hunt in Sri Lanka began at that particular time. Even, at this moment, after trial by several Kangaroo Courts, he is serving 30 months of rigorous imprisonment. The common candidate of the Opposition, within two weeks of the Presidential Election, was dragged from his office and arrested. This is how the witch-hunt against democracy commenced in Sri Lanka this year. Sir, almost all the political parties have been divided and weakened. The Government's numbers have been achieved by using the full might of the Governments financial strength to bribe and entice the Opposition Members to sign over the countrys democratic rights

Where financial enticement failed, the Rajapaksas' employed tactics of terror, blackmail and intimidation, threatening lawsuits and trumped-up charges against those they needed, to pass the Eighteenth Amendment into law.

The printer's wife and family were taken in lieu of him until he produced himself at the Police. Even I was taken to the notorious

fourth floor of the CID and questioned for nearly four hours just two months ago and this shows the direction in which this country is heading today. Sir, this has not stopped there. Now, look at the direction we are moving. On the 6th of September, when the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and all our Members came to Matara, the whole Matara was a sea of green. But, on the very evening of 6th September, all cutouts - ( -) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake ) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ,. ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I say with responsibility that the orders were given by the Secretary, Defence who was travelling across Matara that day. The Police were used to remove the decorations and cutouts of the democratic Opposition and because the

1003 1004

2010 27

OIC of that area was not available that day, he was immediately transferred. But, thanks to - from what we hear - the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, his transfer had been cancelled later; the uncle transfers and the nephew stops the transfer. This is how the police operates these days.

Mr. Speaker, student leaders are being rounded up and arrested. Even at the moment, Udul Premaratne, Convenor of the Inter University Students Federation and many others are in custody. As you know, nearly 11,000 students, youths and others are languishing in jails in the North and their identities are yet to be revealed. We know that fellow Parliamentarian, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti was assaulted by army goon squads reportedly coming under the Ministry of Defence when he went to Jaffna to collect information about these prisoners. This is the pathetic, dangerous and worrying situation in Sri Lanka today. I ask you under these circumstances no sensible investor will ever decide to come to Sri Lanka.

Look at the media. The media has been totally stifled and the fear-psychosis is so much that most, if not all, journalists subject their articles and reports to self-censorship. Each time I mention any member of the Rajapaksa name in a critical manner in any interview, it is discreetly left out in the publication. The general response when I query the omission from journalists is, "I travel by bus and live alone with my wife and family. We do not want to be killed like Lasantha, we do not want to be beaten up like Poddala Jayantha, we do not want to disappear into thin air like Ekneligoda nor do we want to live as refugees abroad like many of our colleagues". This Mr. Speaker, is the pathetic state of the media in Sri Lanka on the fifth year of the Rajapaksa Presidency.

Mr. Speaker, another important influence on economic development in developing and emerging markets - it applies to emerging miracles as well - is the rule of law. No country has ever achieved economic prosperity for the people by suppressing the rule of law. All those who tried to do so have only brought economic ruin to their people and their countries, for example, Zimbabwe, Burma and North Korea and this is the direction we seems to be going towards.

In September 2005, the Council of the International Bar Association passed a Resolution which states, I quote:

"The rule of law is the foundation of a civilized society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all.

It ensures adherence to principles that both liberate and protect........."

With this Resolution, the Council of the International Bar Association listed certain components of the rule of law. What are these components? They are, an independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair and public trial without

undue delay. It also describes as "unacceptable" arbitrary arrests, indefinite detention without trial, cruel or degrading treatment or punishment and intimidation and corruption in the electoral process.

Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, for us in Sri Lanka, all what has been described as unacceptable by the Council of the International Bar Association has now become part and parcel of our lives in our society.

Mr. Speaker, the Declaration on the rule of law made by the International Commission of Jurists at Athens in 1955 emphasized as follows. I quote:

" 'The state is subject to the law' and declared that 'judges should be guided by the rule of law, protect it and enforce it without fear or favour and resist any encroachments by governments or political parties in their independence as judges'".

As I said at the last Budget Debate in June, the most serious assault against the rule of law today in Sri Lanka is the encroachment of the judiciary by the Executive in the most unscrupulous manner. I know this statement made certain repulsions in Hulftsdorp. This is what I said in June.

"Although the lower level of judges and magistrates are putting up a valiant and courageous front to preserve their independence, many judges from the higher echelons of the judiciary have compromised their independence and their integrity in the most shocking manner. Plum positions for spouses and offsprings have been doled out, the promise of promotions including the promise of promotion to the Supreme Court while others are being tempted with the prospect of been appointed the Chief Justice are used as bait and some are being tempted with diplomatic postings after retirement.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

himself and lawyers who appear against the interests of the Government are threatened and labelled as terrorists by the defence ministry. In fact the defence ministry seems to be gradually replacing the judiciary in Sri Lanka as judge and executioner". In fact, Mr. Speaker, in the same speech I made, I warned of the consequences if the Constitutional amendments are passed. I quote myself from Column 653 of the Hansard of 2nd July, 2010:

This culture of impunity and the rape of the rule of law will be total and complete if the Government is allowed to carry out the proposed constitutional amendments.....

I was saying this in June this year, before the Eighteenth Amendment was passed on the 8th of September.

....giving the Executive the ultimate power of appointing the Constitutional Council. Any semblance of independence these commissions may have, will be stifled and the police, the judiciary and

1005 1006

the Elections Commission will become mere extensions of the Executive dropping any pretences to impartiality they may still have .

I repeat the last few words: ... will become mere extensions of the Executive dropping any pretences to impartiality they may still have.

In fact, Mr. Speaker, some judges of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court seems to have done just that by dropping any pretences to impartiality they may have had prior to the Eighteenth Amendment.

Because of the restrictions put on by the Standing Orders I will not go into details, but talk about the procedures in general. Today, the Court of Appeal is divided into two camps : the pro-Government group consisting of those who are expecting promotions to the Supreme Court and the independent group who want to carry out their duties in a non-partisan manner. This seems - [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, I am talking about the mood - [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, please, I request you - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, in the race to become the next Chief Justice, many are now desperately trying to impress the appointing authority.

Sir, now I want to say a word about the Attorney-General. I hope he does not come under the Standing Orders. For the first time in history, the lawyers and the public were treated to the spectacle of seeing the Attorney

-General of our country seated in the High Court on Tuesday, 23rd November of this week, when the General Sarath Fonsekas white flag case was being heard.

In fact, today because of the Eighteenth Amendment and because the President has the power to appoint all the judges and the Chief Justice, there is a race to become the Chief Justice and some of them are blatantly becoming partisan in order to win the goodwill of His Excellency the President. Despite the obvious bias of certain over- ambitious judges, we must also note that the minor judiciary which consists of Magistrates, District Judges, Labour Tribunal Judges, Primary Court Judges, even High Court Judges and some of the Court of Appeal Judges have shown impartiality even at the risk of losing their perks and promotions. We must salute those courageous judges who are still upholding the impartiality of the judiciary in Sri Lanka today. Even in the Supreme Court, I must say, there are some courageous judges who are true to their conscience,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

That is how the judiciary is handled today.

In fact, many lawyers have spoken to me from Colombo as well as outstations to express their dismay at the current situation and the mood is for all to unite to safeguard the independence of the judiciary from the corrupt few. This emerging mood became very clear at the Bar Association Elections in February when the Government sponsored candidate, Mr. Palitha Kumarasinghe, PC, was defeated resoundingly by the independent candidate, Mr. Shibly Aziz.

This, Sir, is the true situation in the courts of law today and without the rule of law in place in the country, no investors from anywhere in the world will ever decide to come here. As the situation becomes worse everyday, it will become increasingly more difficult to attract foreign investors because remember, Mr. Speaker, today the world has many countries which offer the same, if not, better incentives than Sri Lanka. So, Sri Lanka has to compete and Sri Lanka, as they say, is no more the only girl in the beach. There are many more we have to compete with. [Interruption.] Maybe, yes. Many boys too, certainly. [Interruption.] Very much so.[Interruption.]

Sir, the sine qua non for a positive investor climate, if I may say so, is also durable peace. However, despite defeating the LTTE nearly two years ago, the Government has yet to win the peace by winning the hearts and minds of the Tamil people. , , , ,

1009 1010

. . . . , .

In fact, in a vulgar and crude display of chauvinistic triumphalism, the Rajapaksa regime has alienated the long- suffering people of the North and the East even more, and many of them - the Tamil people in the North - are finding themselves in a from the frying pan into the fire" situation despite being liberated - [Interruption.] from the clutches of the LTTE.

The President,[Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, let him speak during his speech. - [Interruption.] Please.

The President, in his Budget Speech, of course as usual, talked about, connecting hearts and minds of our multiethnic and multicultural society. While talking about it, yet he has not set aside a single cent for the 23,000 odd IDPs who are still languishing in those internment camps in the North. 23,000 . , - [ ]

In fact, the Government is not concerned about the over 100,000 displaced families in the North; presently they are only getting four poles and eight corrugated sheets from the Government. The last budget set aside a measly Rs. 350 per head but this time around, that has been suspended. This is in stark contrast to the Defence Ministry increasing its vote by Rs. 13 billion despite the fact that the war is over.

. 350 . 13 . . This is the direction in which the country is moving today. The Government has not only given step-motherly treatment to the Tamils in this country, they are provoking them by many of their actions today. . . 21 . . . "Theepam Day" - ( ) (An Hon. Member) .

Also look at the policy of shameless discrimination which is being followed by this Government in State recruitments. Recently, the Government recruited minor staff for the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions in Ampara, Batticaloa and Vavuniya. Batticaloa, -minor employees- . ? 30 . 30 29 . . . ? . 21

. 21 17 , 4 . 21 . 19 , , . . Mr. Speaker, the Government is also following a policy of shameless discrimination in State recruitment. Recently, the Government recruited minor staff for the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions in Ampara, Batticaloa and Vavuniya where the locals were shockingly overlooked. In Ampara, out of 30 minor staff recruited, only one was a Tamil, 29 were Sinhalese from the South, Ratnapura etc. In Batticaloa, out of 21 recruited, 17 were Sinhalese and only four were Tamils. In Vavuniya, out of 21 recruited, 19 were Sinhalese, one was a Tamil and one was a Muslim.

What is equally worrying is, the Government plans to change the demographic pattern of the North and the East, which would culminate in a West Bank type of situation in time to come. Although the Government continues to deny such claims in public, the army is giving land and creating permanent settlement for army personnel and their families in the North. , . . .. . . , , . , . 1,000 . . 1,000 . prefabricated . . , . . , . , [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, although the regime talks about the emerging "Wonder of Asia" all signs today are that we have become the emerging "rogue state" of Asia. Although, we have become the LTTE terror in the North and the East, the whole country is engulfed by the crony terrorism

of the Rajapaksa family.

[. . 12.53] () ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Presiding Member, I was not expecting to speak today. So, you must forgive me if I do not deliver a polished speech like that of the Hon. Member from Matara who spoke first this morning. Having heard some of the things he said and indeed some of the things that the other Member from Matara who spoke just before me said, I think it is very necessary to make some responses.

Sir, it seems to me that the speaker from Matara who spoke first this morning exemplified what we have seen so far from the speakers of the United National Party and indeed others in the Opposition, that like the Bourbons of France, they have learnt nothing and have forgotten nothing. I think one of the things that the Hon. Member this morning forgot when he claimed that he had been dismissed from the Cabinet is that, he had in fact resigned in a fit of solidarity with the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike and forgets that right through his current infatuation with the United National Party; he does not note some similarities but only some, between the developments in this Budget, what I would describe as the positive features of the economic changes that took place between 1977 and 1994. In those days, Sir, the problems we had were that, there only seemed to be two economic systems : one, a form of socialism and the other was basically, crony capitalism with, let us say, no concern at all about rights. Sir, I am surprised that the Hon. Member this morning forgot about fashion. When I first knew him 30 years ago, he was a very distinguished fashion designer going under the name of Mangala Innocence and I am not really sure whether that was an ironic word or not. But, he forgets that fashions come and go and that there are very large variations in fashion at any one time. Today, he quoted at length from what he claimed was an extract from a Bloomberg Review about Sri Lanka. I have no idea whether he quoted accurately or not. But, you know, we can all play quotations snap.

1051 1052

[ ]

2010 27

If I might quote from The Times of London - a newspaper which was pretty anti-Sri Lanka for a long time - dated 23rd November, 2010, which states:

Senior figures in the IMF say it is broadly happy with the steps Sri Lanka is taking to start to repair public finances ravaged by 30 years of civil war.

But, what is the point of playing snap with all these quotations because we all know we can find what we want from anywhere we like. This is particularly true for Sri Lanka that due to the extremely effective campaign waged by his present Leader, there has been a tendency to denigrate Sri Lanka unfairly without any consideration of evidence. What was absolutely missing in the Hon. Members speech this morning was any attention to evidence; the evidence of the Budget, the evidence of the reactions of the business community in Sri Lanka, the reactions of newspaper reporters who came from abroad and say that this is a very forward-looking Budget.

If I might comment briefly on the speech of the Hon. Member who just spoke before me, I have heard people who have been associated with liberalism saying that this is a very good, liberal Budget because it balances the requirement of development, the requirement of ensuring that the private sector participates fully in action while at the same time targeting the interest of the worst off.

If you look at the enormous debts that this country contracted during the Jayewardene era, all of which seemed to be forgotten by the UNP now, it was for development that was selective.

It did not take into account the interest of the periphery of this country in the way it should have. You need to take only one look at various documents distributed with the Budget Proposals this time to see the range of activities that this Government has engaged in indeed before the end of the war because one of its basic commitments is to ensure equitable development. Now, in this context it seems very bizarre that once again the unfashionable fashion designer started making allegations that do not seem to be evidenced anywhere. He claims that there was an attack or prevention of a festival celebrated by the Tamils in the North. One of the things I would like to tell him is that, his assertion that the media is suppressed in Sri Lanka, is sheer nonsense. If he reads the newspapers, he will see ample criticisms of the Government in all of them. Now, any responsible politician should check those newspapers, and I am afraid that the incident he described today as having taken place one week ago, was not mentioned in any of the other newspapers. Now, this is the technique I would recommend to him. One of the ways we got to know that the many allegations about war crimes made by people all over the world are completely untruthful is that we used to monitor all the allegations made by TamilNet, which you will agree, was the worst possible case, and got to know perfectly the figures they alleged about civilian casualties right through 2007, 2008 and indeed 2009. So, the figures that are now trotted out are complete nonsense because they were not mentioned at that time.

Similarly, the Hon. Member from Matara was making allegations about prevention of a festival, which has not been mentioned thus far. Now, it is similar with his claims of occupation of the North. If he remembers, 18 months ago - he kept saying that the war was over two years ago; obviously he was trying to exaggerate - there were allegations that we were going to keep the displaced in camps for a two-year period while we settle the North with the Sinhalese. Now, almost all the displaced have returned home and we do not hear apologies from people who made those outrageous allegations. Instead, now the story has changed to saying that there are going to be military cantonments. As I told my Friends in the TNA, there will have to be military installations in the North and they too agreed with me that it is essential. But, it is incumbent on the Government to make sure that these are small and as unintrusive as possible and what the Members of the Opposition should work at, is helping us to develop them as His Excellency the President has initiated already a truly multinational, multilingual, defence force just as in all other areas. This is not going to be an easy task because of the lapses in our educational system, the absence of multilingualism and it is only this Government which has taken pains to correct it.

Sir, I would go further and say that one of the most appalling aspects of the Jayewardene Government is that while it opened up business it was concerned only with crony capitalism. It did not diversify in terms of services. This Government has, for the first time ever, embarked upon a comprehensive education reform programme which has been highlighted in the Budget. This shows the true impact of liberal principles, which is absolute commitment to State intervention to support the worst off while at the same time allowing the private sector to do whatever it can that is positive and at the same time allowing diversity and range which will help to improve quality. Sri Lanka has one of the best education systems in the world as far as the basic education is concerned. But, we know that at the top levels we are slipping behind. This Government has taken the initiative to move forward in this respect and I think these things should be recognized.

Sir, one of the saddest aspects of the Budget Debate thus far is the manner in which especially the United National Party and the others as well, are combining the worst excesses of the two diametrically-opposed economic systems of the 1980s. It is extraordinarily amusing to find the Hon. Members of the United National Party, forgetting what happened in 1980 when the strikers of July 1980 were treated so badly, shedding crocodile tears about the working class. It is also extraordinarily odd to see them objecting to the measures taken in the Budget very transparently and openly to encourage foreign investment and opening up of our markets . All this is done very straightforwardly in the Budget and all they can do is, to protest because they failed to do all these 30 years ago. That is why the opening up of the economy by the late Mr. J.R. Jayewardene was

1053 1054

immediately accompanied by such social unrest. Here, we have a Government with a comprehensive vision. We have a Budget that will clearly take this country forward while ensuring that the benefits of development will reach the worst off in society.

I was astonished to hear yesterday that the Hon. Member of the JVP from Gampaha claiming that never in the history of Sri Lanka had the Public servants being taxed before and that this was an attack on the poor Public servants. In fact, the tax imposed on the Public Service was removed only in the 1980s at a time when President Jayewardene refused to let Public Service wages go up properly and therefore, introduced this measure as compensation for the fact that he was not raising wages. At the moment, Public Service wages are certainly compatible at many levels, if not all. He forgot to mention that the tax is only applicable to people earning more than Rs. 50,000 a month and very rightly, I think it is the case that such people who also have a second income often in different ways should be subject to tax. So, this type of blind condemnation without any knowledge of the real history of this country is typical of the Opposition.

I find, Sir, that they seem to be in that strange mixture of affection for their common presidential candidate to have abandoned all principles whatsoever, in the way they discuss the economy; in the way they discuss human rights; in the way they discuss the media. They just seem to parrot-forth criticism absolutely with no understanding of the situation that this country had in the past, and the enormous developments that had been made during the last 18 months; not only then but in the period before that also.

We have succeeded, Sir, in ensuring development on an equitable basis all over this country. We have instituted measures to develop the skills that will ensure that the worst off members of society will have the opportunities that the Hon. Member from Matara enjoyed all his life. We are doing our best to ensure that the infrastructural developments that take place will be accompanied by human resources development. In such a context, I think we should take up the point made by the last speaker who suggested the importance of a principled approach to politics. I think if you have a United National Party that is stuck in the mindset of the '80s; that still pays tribute to late President J.R. Jayewardene for having opened up the economy; that ignores his failure to open up the social service sector and the development of terrorism because of his neglect of the aspirations of the people there and the way he addressed it through hard tactics -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up.

() ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I am just about to finish, Sir. I think that forgetfulness of history is perhaps one reason why they are unable to appreciate the positive measures taken by this Government and why they will continue to be stuck in negativity for the next half century.

Thank you. [. . 1.08]

Sir, Standing Order No. 136 which deals with the General Authority of Mr. Speaker states, I quote:

Mr. Speaker shall have power to regulate the conduct of business in Parliament in all matters not provided for in these Standing Orders

Also, Standing Order No. 138 states, I quote:

Anything which by these Standing Orders may be done by Mr. Speaker may be done by the Deputy Speaker or

Deputy Chairman of Committees or by a member elected by Parliament presiding in the place of Mr. Speaker

So, you have all the powers.
