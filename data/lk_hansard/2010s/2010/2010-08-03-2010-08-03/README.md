( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Speaker, opening the Debate on behalf of the Opposition, at the outset, I am instructed to state by the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip that the Opposition would be compelled to vote against the extension of the state of Emergency for obvious reasons that this Emergency is being abused for other collateral purposes, which is quite obvious from the manner in which issues pertaining to freedom of the individual is affected today, and particularly the culture of impunity that is prevalent very much in this country, where large crimes and very unfortunate attacks are taking place without any acceptable proof. In opening the Debate, I would refer to an article published by a consistent critic of the Government, Tisaranee Gunasekara, the Editor of the "Asian Tribune". I would copiously quote from her article in dealing with the situation in the country today, particularly the culture of impunity and the way in which it is affecting the democratic freedom in this country. Mr. Speaker, before I come to the obvious issue, which of course, all my other Colleagues also may refer, that is the attack on the "Siyatha" TV Channel and its studios, I would quote from the article of Tisaranee Gunasekara written under the title The War on Media Resumes on the 1st of August, 2010, last Sunday. She states, I quote: Positive Reportage or Spin? In the last four and a half years the regime used patriotism to cover up for its abuses in the North-East and the right of sovereignty to escape from retribution for these wrongdoings. How long can these tactics work, post-war? This uncertainty would make the regime extra-sensitive to media criticism and enhance its determination to use positive reportage alias spin to hide unpleasant realities from the public eye.

Having said that, in the previous paragraph, she goes on to state this as well. I quote:

Nor is there a discussion about the regimes plans to settle families of armed forces personnel in specially constructed cantonments in the North. This is a development which can

have a serious impact on future inter-ethnic relations and thus on peace and stability. And yet, the issue is barely mentioned in the mainstream media. By and large, Sri Lanka has a compliant media; still the Ruling Family does not seem to be satisfied, as the recent judicial and extra-judicial attempts to curb free reportage amply indicates.

Mr. Speaker, Tisaranee Gunasekara, as everybody knows is a very consistent critic of the Government. But, then let us dispassionately, look at what she is attempting to say here. I will come to the other issue about the attack on the media later on. But, dealing with this subject of the Regimes plans to settle families of Armed Forces personnel in specially-constructed cantonments in the North, the author of the article also laments here that this issue is barely mentioned in the mainstream media. That is the point I am coming to.

Yesterday, as a matter of fact, the Tamil National Alliance had a press conference. If you read at the Tamil media today, the main caption in the front pages of all the Tamil media is about the press conference, the charges that the TNA is levelling against the expansion of military camps in the North and the way in which the ordinary citizen is affected by their lands being appropriated without proper legal recourse. As a matter of fact, even what was said by the General Secretary of my Party, Mr. Hasen Ali, has been quoted in the headlines of the Thinakkural newspaper of Sunday, 1st August, 2010 , I quote: , . ? -

Why are these camps being expanded after the conclusion of the war? This has been an issue raised by the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and that has been carried as the headline in the Tamil newspapers of Sunday, 1st August, 2010. Similarly, the TNA raised the issue yesterday, and all the Tamil newspapers are carrying it as the headline. But, look at the Sinhala mainstream media today? The Lankadeepa carries it in page 13 in a very insignificant manner. No other Sinhala mainstream media appears to have even displayed any attention to the press conference. I am saying this because the mainstream media of this country is polarized. Tisaranee Gunasekara is very correct. The mainstream media is totally polarized and is not prepared to pay attention to an issue that the minority political representatives are bringing up, and to give the necessary coverage, at least, a minimum prominence in reporting these news items within the first three pages of the newspapers.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, why do you not quote from Frederica Jansz also?

333 334

2010 03

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I will.

Frederica Jansz is now engaged in a different battle with her own media fraternity, about her not getting - [Interruption.] No, she is engaged in a different battle, a home-and-home battle within the media. I am not going to comment about that. I have seen it. [Interruption.] I am not competent to comment on that because I do not normally take on the media people because I get into their bad books. [Interruption.] I know what you mean. She is entitled to say what she says. She may have been critical and in fact, I think the media ethics demand that they must have some form of resolving these things within their own families. But, they have brought it out to the open. I do not know. I do not think ethically it is the correct thing to do. But, then anyway, she has come out with it. That is a different issue.

Let me come to this issue of the expansion of military cantonments which is an issue the TNA has raised. The General Secretary of my Party has raised this in the "Thinakkural" newspaper of last Sunday, as the headline. This is about Nallathannimalai in Irakkamam area where there has been an army camp that has been set up all of a sudden. I do not see any reason why an army camp should come up in a place like Irakkamam in the Ampara District. A navy camp has been set up in Oluvil. Young children who were studying in the schools had to be displaced because a Navy camp has suddenly come up in Oluvil. The public is perturbed, they are worried as to why a navy camp in Oluvil and an army camp in Nallathannimalai have come up. The TNA is complaining of expansion of military cantonments all over the North and that fact, which has been highlighted in all the front pages of the Tamil media, has not even caught the attention of the Sinhala media. That is the state of affairs today and these genuine concerns will have to be looked at quite seriously. That is why I felt that I must bring this up today, since we have not still had a proper response to the criticism that have been levelled about the expansion of military camps.

On top of it, what has happened to the land in the Eastern area? Now, there is an allegation by the Hon. P. Ariyanethran and that too is the headline news in the Virakesari newspaper of last Sunday. "

" - in the Ampara District the Tamil-speaking people are in danger of losing their land. This refers to a letter that had been written by my Colleague, the Minister, Hon. P.Dayaratne, to the Coast Conservation Authority with a copy to the DIG of the East about encroachment of State land by certain people unlawfully and the need to take over those lands to establish hotels and other tourism infrastructure. This is an issue. I recently visited Pottuvil area. People who had got legitimate deeds, people who have had permits for several years have suddenly now been told that they have to vacate their land because the

Government is interested in setting up tourist hotels. The Hon. P. Dayaratna has written a letter and that letter has caused so much of conciliation, fear and suspicion. Therefore, I would like to refer to this particular news item and would like to have an official response from the Government as to what it plans to do about taking over land. If you want to a take over land, there is a particular legal procedure. There is the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act; the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena knows about this because he has been in charge of the UDA. The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act requires one to give, whichever party is in occupation illegally, one month's notice. But, this Government does not believe in giving that one month's notice. Pardon me, Mr. Speaker, your good brother, the Defence Secretary, in the case of the Slave Island Housing Scheme demolition did not give that required notice to all those residents. Forty families were thrown out on to the roads overnight. He brought 2,000 army personnel and demolished all those houses, and today they have been told, Okay, you have to leave this place. That is because the Defence Secretary is interested in acquiring it for some military school that is adjacent and he believes that it belongs to the military for some reason or the other. But, even if it is so, there is a procedure. The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is there. It requires you to give one month's notice. That one month's notice is given for legitimate owners to prove their right to ownership and that was denied to these poor people. They have NHDA - National Housing Development Authority - documents. The late President Premadasa as the Minister of Housing, himself had signed and given those deeds as crown granted deeds. But, all those deeds are totally ignored because the Defence Secretary wants this acquired. You can acquire land; we are not opposed to that, but then follow the procedure and allow the normal citizen to have the right to go before a court of law and defend his right to possess it for whatever legitimate reason that he may adduce before a court.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, if I may interrupt you, the Secretary, Defence did follow the due process in that respect. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, he did not. I am saying it with responsibility. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Thirty days' notice was given. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am saying it with total responsibility to this House because I was involved in the issue from the very start. They were given just 48 hours' notice.

335 336

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Even the newspaper publishing was done and 30 days' notice was given. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I do not think so. You are frequently out of this country and you do not know what is happening in this country. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) No, irrespective of that, I read and write, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Anyway, I am not prepared to engage in any debate about this issue Mr. Speaker. But, then let me come to the other issues concerning this particular matter. I would like to refer to the re-settlement in the North. In re-settling people, the Government is making various promises. Now, I had a big delegation from Nachchikuda in the Kilinochchi District. Muslims came and met us at our Party office and my Chairman was also there with me on that day. Nachchikuda was a LTTE base; the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka knows. A prominent base of the LTTE in the Pooneryn area coming within the Pooneryn DS Division. Now, the vocation of the people who were living there was fisheries and pearl-diving and various others. But, these people were displaced by the LTTE forcibly way back in 1990. They were living in Puttalam - 1,750 families. Of these, only 165 families have gone back to Nachchikuda. But, most of them are unable to get back to their lands because that has been occupied by other people from the Jaffna Peninsula. When a complaint is made to the police station, there is an Officer-in-Charge in the police station in Mulangawil, which is next to Nachchikuda. He acts a very funny manner. He says, Well, I cannot do anything about it. Even the Divisional Secretary is unable to help them. When they produce documents and say that they have been in possession of these properties before they were evicted, these officers are unable to give them any acceptable reason as to why they are being refused permission to enter their land.

If a land kachcheri is to be held, proper notice has to be given to the people who have been displaced from this area. There have been several families which had come from Iranaitivu, which was another LTTE base, an Island off the coast of Mannar and the Jaffna Peninsula. Former LTTE cadres of Iranaitivu have come and taken over lands in Nachchikuda area and they are all, apparently behaving in a fashion as if they are now in possession of these lands and nobody can put them out. People are

frightened because they have arms. They may have hidden their arms elsewhere. So, these poor people cannot go back and resettle. These are contentious issues on resettlement which the Government must address and I think there must be proper land kachcheries and proper inquiries held before you allow people to come and resettle. Many former LTTE cadres are allowed to come and settle freely in the lands belonging to the people who had been evicted from there. But, then, the poor people, when they go back, the divisional secretary or the policemen do not appear to be paying any heed to their grievances. This is a matter which has to be discussed politically, among the political parties concerned and all the Government Agencies involved in resettlement. But, in the meantime, what the Government is interested in is only on expanding military camps. Even areas beyond Puttalam, many areas near Wilpattu - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is a jungle.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, yes, it is a jungle. The entire area of Mullikulam has been fenced. Nobody can go and resettle there. For some reason, strange parties are coming and fencing areas and these are supposed to be mineral-rich areas. The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka was in charge of the mineral resources at one time, but, now there are other parties who are interested and appear to be going and fencing large plots of lands. - [Interruption.] For the Hon. Azwer, now elephants have become a very favourite topic but he forgets the fact that he was once an "elephant" himself. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I was, long ago. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I have brought up some of the issues concerning resettlement in the East, issues pertaining to setting up of Army and Navy camps, quite indiscriminately, without proper consultation with the local people. After all, they must be made aware as to why such camps need to be put up there.

Today, the Jaffna Commander has made a very welcome statement that is carried in The Sudar Oli newspaper where he says that all the High Security Zones will soon disappear and people can go and resettle. That is a good statement. But then, that appears to be contradicting the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella because he says, "No, there cannot be any haste or hurry".

337 338

2010 03

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, I will take just five minutes more and wind up.

If I did not refer to the Siyatha TV attack, my Colleagues may think that is not the right thing to do. That is an issue that has now caught the attention of everybody, and the similarity of this and the attack on the MTV studio is something that does not escape our attention - quite strangely enough, it is a similar attack. Just past midnight, with extreme precision you go and destroy the electronic equipment and within minutes the assailants all escape. I mean, leave alone the Pannipitiya MTV studio attack. That took place far away, but this takes place within yards from "Temple Trees, His Excellency the Presidents residence, and strangely the culprits are not yet to be found and the police today say, We are still investigating. They will go on investigating; the attack on the Pannipitiya MTV studio, they are yet investigating and these are all matters that are on record. We cannot simply sweep them under the carpet.

Let me quote from Tisaranee Gunasekara once again. She says referring to this particular incident, I quote :

Either Colombo is not safe, despite the near hysterical hype on security and ubiquitous presence of gun-toting servicemen; or the attack on Siyatha was carried out with the knowledge (if not at the behest) of powers-that-be.

Either the government is criminally incompetent; or the government is criminally complicit. These are the only two possible conclusions, given the current Lankan conditions."

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What is your conclusion? Whom are you accusing? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, I am not trying to attribute anything to anybody.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Tell us openly, whom are you accusing?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The problem is - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Name the culprit.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) There are the only two conclusions according to Tisaranee Gunasekara. Now, what has happened to the MTV attack? - [Interruption.] No, I just do not want to get into an argument. Mr. Speaker, I will end up with this particular quote. What has happened after the attack on MTV? Mr. Chevan Daniels went on CNN and said this. Mr. Chevan Daniels was in charge of the MTV studio then. What he said was this. I quote from the article titled, "Anniversary of terror attack on MTV-MBC Radio/TV Station" which appeared on the website, "dbsjeyaraj.com"

, the Sri Lankan government is carrying out a fantastic military offensive against a stronghold in the north and has captured Kilinochchi and Elephant Pass as well, and what really puzzles us is that why the government cant put forward

a similar effort to curb the type of lawlessness that is now rampant in the south, and in particular in Colombo.

This is what Chevan Daniels said on CNN and the Defence Secretary, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa came on an interview soon after that telecast live on State TV, and other channels later in the day. Drawing reference to the CNN interview he said, I further quote:

Half an hour before I came here I saw someone from Sirasa appearing on CNN saying that a claymore mine was used in the incident and that the government was responsible. He asked if the government could capture Kilinochchi why it couldnt catch those responsible through investigations." The same article goes on to state: "He referred to that person as a kottiya.. and said he would imprison him. He then went on to say that the burning of the MTV was an insurance ruse undertaken by the company itself." This was what the Defence Secretary said then when the MTV studio was attacked. Today another studio has been attacked and the Pannipitiya MTV studio attack has not been probed into and very strangely enough, one of the newspapers, which is to a certain extent very sympathetic to the Government, The Island states this. I quote from the column "Political Watch" written by Mr. C.A Chandraprema which appeared in "The Island" of 1st August, 2010:

Siyatha : Govt. out-manoeuvred again?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, let me finish. I am concluding.

339 340

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. Now, the Hon. Member was copiously quoting from Tisaranee Gunasekara's article. This is what has been stated in The Sudar Oli of 31.07.2010. , - []

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, I am winding up.

Now, Mr. Chandraprema states, I quote:

The biggest mystery surrounding the attack on the Siyatha TV channel in the small hours of Friday is not who was behind the attack, but why all other important private TV channels downplayed the whole issue on the Friday night news broadcasts.

Mr. Chandraprema who is quite friendly towards the Government, in his column states this very important thing, I further quote:

The silence on the TV channels would give the impression that the atmosphere of repression and intimidation in Sri Lanka is so intense that nobody even dares talk about it, and this silence is an even more potent anti-government weapon than any noise the private TV channels may have made.

I will not make anymore comments. With that I conclude. Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to follow my dear Friend, the Hon. Champika Ranawaka. We were sitting here together and he was one of those who signed the DPA Manifesto along with Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Bandaranaike.

According to Section 2(1) of the Public Security Ordinance, in view of the existence or imminent state of public emergency, if the President is of opinion that it is expedient to do so in the interests of Public security and preservation of Public order or for the maintenance of supply and services essential to the life of the community,

he may, by Proclamation, declare that Part II of the Public Security Ordinance shall come into operation. None of those circumstances I referred to exist now for Emergency to be declared by the President.

Both the Emergency Regulations and the Prevention of Terrorism Act are meant to prevent terrorism, but what we see is that the result is counterproductive. Instead of preventing terrorism, they have created State terrorism. It is State terrorism which is responsible for the murders of the late Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, the late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, Mr. Vigneswaran, the late Hon. Sivanesan, the late Hon. Raviraj, the late Hon. Maheswaran and Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge, journalist, and ten other journalists. According to the Amnesty International, at least 14 media personnel have been killed in the country since 2006 and more than 20 have fled the country. No one has yet been prosecuted for these attacks on the media. The police have not yet found out who the killers of the persons I mentioned earlier are. Senior journalist Ekneligoda is said to be missing for the past few months. Where is he? - [Interruption.] Senior journalist Sadun A.Jayasekera attached to the Daily Mirror was attacked by the members of the Presidential Security Division. If this is the fate of a senior journalist who has been attacked by the Presidential Security Division while he was covering an event of the President, one cannot help but wonder what would be the plight of others who are met with violence elsewhere. The "Sirasa TV" was attacked sometime back. Last year even the establishment of the "Uthayan" newspaper, a Tamil daily, was attacked and machinery was damaged. Even the machinery of The Sunday Leader newspaper was damaged and destroyed. The "Rupavahini" was also attacked. - [Interruption.] The attack on Siyatha followed last week. - [Interruption.] The Officer-in-Charge of the Criminal Investigation Department - CID - is a suspect of a murder case. He got caught while he was trying to dump the body of a person whom he had killed, into the sea. This is the type of police officers we have got, to whom the Emergency Regulations have given powers.

I do not know why General Sarath Fonseka, my Friend and Member of Parliament, is still being harassed. If the offences alleged to have been committed by him were committed when he was the Army Commander, action should have been taken against him before the Military Court then. After allowing him to retire and contest the Presidential Election, he should not be harassed. What I mentioned earlier were not acts of the Members of the Opposition, but those committed by the Government Security forces and the paramilitary group which supports the Government.

Some changes have been made to the existing Emergency Regulations. Some Regulations have been repealed. The period of detention, under Section 19 of the Regulations, has been reduced to three months from one

347 348

year. Regulation 63(1) has also been repealed. We welcome that. A large number of persons are languishing in jail as a result of dubious confessions. According to these Regulations, the burden of proving that his confession has not been voluntarily made, is placed on the accused. The Human Rights Committee of the United Nations has commented adversely on a similar provision in the Prevention of Terrorism Act. It is now urgent that convictions based solely on such confessions under this and under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, be reviewed. A new ground for Preventive Detention under Regulation 19 has been introduced and that is to prevent a person from acting contrary to the PTA. It should be noted that the PTA already has provision in Section 9 to issue a Detention Order if the Minister has reason to believe or suspect that a person is engaged in the commission of any offences under the PTA. The Regulations which have been repealed have no retrospective effect. The persons who were taken into custody under the earlier Emergency Regulations will be dealt with under those earlier Regulations.

The evidence gathered by the International Crisis Group suggests that during the last five months of the civil war, tens of thousands of Tamil civilians - men, women, children and the elderly - were killed; countless more were wounded. Hundreds of thousands were deprived of adequate food and medical care, resulting in more deaths. What happened at the last stages of the war in May, 2009 at Mullivaikkal? Several civilians were brutally killed and three people, who surrendered with a white flag, were killed; one of them was a Sinhalese lady. We are not worried as to who gave the order to shoot, but the fact remains that three or four persons who surrendered with a white flag were shot dead by the army.

The Crisis Group requests the Government of Sri Lanka to cooperate fully with international efforts, including that of the UN mandated international inquiry, to investigate the alleged war crimes, guaranteeing free access to the conflict-affected areas and effective protection of witnesses. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has appointed a panel to report to him regarding the alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka. Even the European Commission has expressed concern about the Emergency.

Abductions for ransom still continue and last week, a businessman from Vavuniya was abducted and was released only after Rupees five lakhs was given and as a result, all the traders in Vavuniya staged a protest and closed their shops for one day.

Navaneetham Pillay, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations, has suggested that an inquiry of an international level be held regarding the alleged human rights violations committed during the last days of the war. I think that although the Hon. (Prof.)

G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, who is a professor of law, is not here, he has told the UN Secretary-General not to interfere with the internal affairs of this country. He is a Professor of Law and he must be aware that according to the International Human Rights Law, any country can take note of flagrant human rights violations in another country. - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me. On 28th May, 2010, one Somasunderam Subramaniam, aged 56, who came to Kayts from Kilinochchi was assaulted and killed. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please take your seat. [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sometime back, five dead bodies of males were found wrapped in polythene and dumped in a cesspit in a house at Ganeshapuram, Kilinochchi and the Magistrate has ordered the JMO to hold a post-mortem examination. As a result, people are afraid to go and settle in Kilinochchi. Even the Magistrate of Chavakachcheri was threatened and as a result, all the Jaffna lawyers boycotted the courts for a week. He is inquiring into the death of one Kapildev at Chavakachcheri.

Now, the Government has appointed a truth and reconciliation Commission to find out on what transpired from 2002 up to now in Sri Lanka. A similar Commission was appointed in South Africa immediately after the war to bring about reconciliation between the warring groups and it has successfully brought about reconciliation between those two groups.

The so-called Commission must have consultations with the representatives of the Tamils not only in Sri Lanka but the Tamil diaspora as well, in order to bring about an actual reconciliation and find a lasting solution to the vexed ethnic question. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Now, the cat is out of the bag. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) You are the cat. The cat is standing now. [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The Government celebrated its victory on 18th June, 2010. As far as the Tamils are concerned we consider that week as a "week of mourning for the civilians who died in the last war.

Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, even Lord Buddha has stated that "Victory breeds hatred and conquered live in sorrow". I think the Government has a secret agenda for extending the Emergency. It wants to keep the Tamil prisoners behind bars by extending the state of Emergency.

I want all the Opposition parties to oppose the extension of the Emergency. I also kindly request the Government to give amnesty to all the Tamil prisoners and release them in the way the JVP insurgents were released in the 1980s. Some of them have been on remand for more than 10 years.

In the meantime, I also want to refer to one other matter. One Tharshika, a nurse attached to Velanai Hospital was found dead in the hospital. The doctor was a Sinhalese man; there was some relationship between the two. First, they said that it was a suicide. Later, on representations made by his relatives, the body was exhumed and was sent to Colombo JMO for a report. According to the JMOs report, some important parts of the body were missing. Later, two attendants were arrested and some parts which were buried were taken out. This is what is happening in Jaffna. Thank you.

Now, I will talk about common subjects. My friend, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence has struck again. This time he has taken over the CID, the TID and the CCD, in addition to the STF. I do not know whether anything will be left for the IGP at the end. At this rate, the Secretary, Defence will get into a police uniform because he is going to do all the police duties. One day, the IGP will be left without anything. I will not be surprised if the Secretary, Defence, one of these days takes the uniform off the IGP. He almost did that at the Thummulla Junction. He almost removed the IGPs uniform; he told the IGP that he must get out in 24 hours. So the IGP will be just looking up and waiting in the coming days and is going to be just a free-paid man without a job.

Now, we have got the most aggressive UDA in the world. The Secretary, Defence took over the UDA because he is eyeing all the valuable lands in Colombo. The country has no money to spend on the most essential things, but the Secretary, Defence wants to shift the Manning Market to put up a luxurious shopping centre. There are already enough shopping centres in Colombo; we are not short of shopping centres. But, the problem is, people do not have money to do shopping.

355 356

Then, he is also trying to shift the prisons. Imagine the amount of money we need to put up new prisons. I think the aim must be to ensure that I go to Moneragala. That is another game to sell the prime lands available in Colombo in order that people in the Government get some commissions, nothing else. What is the Cabinet of Ministers doing about these things? They are dumb; they are not talking and this is almost a one-man show or two-men show.

The order of the day is court-martials and torture chambers in the Navy Headquarters. When the Secretary, Defence and the Minister of Defence want to take revenge from servicemen, they are taken to the Navy Headquarters. In the same way, I was abducted and taken to the Navy Headquarters. Now, they have taken over 50 disabled soldiers, sailors and airmen to the Navy Headquarters and are trying to court-martial them for protesting against the Ipalogama racket at the opening ceremony of the Ipalogama Housing Scheme. These people who are on artificial limbs and crutches are being marched up and down at the Navy Headquarters and are being questioned. The only mistake they made was that they disagreed with the payment scheme of the Ipalogama Housing Scheme. So, this has become the order of the day and they are enjoying it at the expense of the innocent soldiers.

The thirst of the Minister of Defence and the Secretary, Defence will never end. Now, they are planning to sack about another 500 officers and men from the Armed Services and the Police. They are supposed to be the people who voted for me at the last Presidential Election. In this way, they will end up by sacking 90 per cent of the forces and the police. I have already said that the brain of the Rajapaksa Regime is meddling with the Services. In the way things are happening, very soon you will find that I am correct.

Abuse of power is also a common occurrence. The Government is framing charges after charges against me. Already four charges have been framed and out of these four charges, three are events related to the Presidential Election campaign. This has never happened in the history of this country. In the past, our leaders were magnanimous enough to behave like victors. They knew to behave like victors or leaders after winning an election. Now, it is the other way. This is a dangerous situation and is a disgrace. The whole world is laughing at us. The whole world is aware of what is going on.

The country has no money. The country is grumbling and unable to increase the salaries. But, we are having Cabinet meetings at very high expense at Kilinochchi. We had a Cabinet meeting which cost about Rs. 10 million at Kilinochchi. The cost for air travel only was about Rupees six million. The road movement was Rupees two

million and the cost for the food of the Cabinet Ministers was Rupees two million. We had a Cabinet Meeting in Kilinochchi at a cost of Rs. 10 million. Now, the Head of State is going to have another bust-up in Bentota this weekend. Everybody will get drunk and have a dance in Bentota at the expense of the Government. The cost will be about Rs. 20 million at least. These are peoples money. After wasting money like this, the President is trying to cut down the interest on the deposit which he promised to the senior citizens.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is violating all the Standing Orders. He is casting aspersions on the conduct of the Hon. Members. He must withdraw all those things. He is a person who betrayed the nation by saying that the people who held white flags were killed. His "bena" has robbed the country. If your "" brings the money that is enough for us.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Please sit down.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You have to withdraw what you said about the Hon. Members.-[Interruption.] None of them. You are a drunkard. Are you supplying alcohol to them? -[Interruption.] No. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. Please sit down. ( ) (The Hon. General Sarath Fonseka) Somebody else was trying to dance with the white flags. Do you not know that I won the war and I am not scared to talk about it. You go and ask the man who was talking about the white flags. I only won the war. You remember that. I have to vindicate myself.

Last time, the Deputy Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage - I must not call him an "Honourable" Deputy Minister because according to Hansard, he has been referring to me just as "Sarath Fonseka." So, I will be calling him "Mahindananda" from now onwards. He has been talking about the army cook who was planning to assassinate me, who was killed in the Army Headquarters. He does not know that the cook was killed in the TID. The cook committed suicide in the TID. He also has said that I was ungrateful to the Secretary, Defence. Both the Secretary, Defence and the Minister of Defence were ungrateful to me. They were trying to finish my career. They were trying to get rid of me after I finished the war. -[Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I rise to a point of Order, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! What is your point of Order, Hon. Azwer? ( ) (The Hon.

He does not know the Standing Orders. No Hon. Member shall refer to another Hon. Member by name. If he cannot say Honourable he is dishonourable. That is a different matter. He has betrayed the nation. He must refer to a Member as Mr. or Honourable, otherwise he cannot speak. You cannot refer to an Hon. Member by his name. The Standing Orders are very clear, Sir. He must withdraw those or he must not be allowed to refer to the Hon. Deputy Minister. You must follow the Standing Orders whatever you do. This is not the army that you led. You must respect the Standing Orders of this House. -[Interruption.] No, you cannot call him or any Hon. Member by his name. -[Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) There is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I raise the point of Order under Standing Order No. 84 (vii) and (viii). - [Interruption.] The Hon. Member referred to me and I am objecting to that reference as he imputed motives to me, which are incorrect. I would urge the Hon. Member, as he has already admitted that he has not read my article titled "An Economic Analysis of Corruption in Sri Lanka", to read it and I hope you will take corrective action, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Anything against the Standing Orders will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, one must read an article only where one is satisfied that it is in line with what he believes in. What does the opening statement of your article, the heading itself, say? I am sure the English you and I understand is the same. What do you say? An Economic Analysis of Corruption in Sri Lanka. You are talking about Sri Lanka, my dear Hon. Member. If you have said An Economic Analysis of Corruption of the People's Alliance Government, I would not have brought this up. I would have read this in full; I would have probably answered you. But, I cannot do that because you are talking about Sri Lanka. There is only one Sri Lanka in the world; there is only one people in Sri Lanka. Please understand that. Therefore, your argument of the fact that I have insulted you as a Member, is totally incorrect. I am only going through what you are saying here, your own words. Why do you not answer that? I will give you my time. Please answer that. I will give you my time. Answer that, please. I am giving you my time. Answer that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Have you not written about Sri Lanka? Sir, please give him time to answer.

It states, I quote:

"Given the manner the government has got the de-facto LTTE leader to rope the diaspora to the rehabilitation work and bust the LTTE

network in many countries KP, the guest, one may say has much more to offer to Sri Lanka than KP the prisoner."

The KP, the prisoner is different to the KP, the guest. That factor is being emphasized here by no less a person than the editor of "Daily Mirror" today.

It further states, I quote:

"With Karuna's clout hitting the rock bottom among the LTTE sympathizers who also looked at Douglas Devananda with an enemy perception the government was badly in need of somebody who could turn the tables and help rebuild government's credibility among the Northern civilians."

This is a very clear statement by the editor of "Daily Mirror" today and I would like to move forward in that direction.

. , . , . . . .

"By getting the de-facto leader of the LTTE the group that killed Tamil civilians' faith in the State to do this job the Sri Lankan government has proven its skill in State craft... "

I emphasize the words "State craft".

"........just as much as its prowess in war."

[. . 5.26] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we have this afternoon, heard many speeches pertaining to the extension of the Emergency. We have debated this for the last few months and every month, the Hon. Members on the other side do speak on behalf of extending the state of Emergency and the Opposition do speak opposing it. They are saying that the duty of the Opposition is to oppose. I think it is rightly to oppose when really the reason is rightful to oppose.

In these circumstances, if you look at the situation, we are all speaking of the grand victory the Government had at the election. That probably was endorsement of the people. But, there is a duty cast upon the Government to execute the democratic principles, the rights and the freedom of this country to adhere to the society. I do not really understand whether those fundamental principles that the Government should adhere to are being practised today.

If you look at the last two months, it is important to note that on 11th February, two journalists and two cameramen were prevented from taking photographs because they were talking about General Fonseka or some protest march on him. Then, again on 14th February, two cameramen were deprived of carrying out their jobs and their cameras were taken into custody. A few days ago, the "Siyatha" studio was attacked between 1.30 a.m. and 1.45 a.m., which was situated at Union Place, Colombo in the High Security Zone.

While we are talking about the fundamental issues that have been raised as far as the democracy of this country is concerned, is this what we are practising? Is this what they ask from us or is it what the society needs? The US Government has vehemently opposed the attack on that studio. The Chairman of the studio had telephoned the police and the Fire Brigade. It took 35 minutes for them to come to the spot. The Chairman, Mr. Roshantha Kariyapperuma, had to send a vehicle to the Fire Brigade

office to get them to come to the spot. Is that what we are asking for through the extension of the state of Emergency? When the Emergency is in force, whether he is the chairman of a company or an ordinary citizen, he should be in a position to telephone the police or the Fire Brigade when it is necessary. Those are the fundamental issues the Government should see through. Is that what we are asking for and is it what we are getting?

In the same way, if you look at the Northern Province today, we see that the Tamils of the Northern Province, including those in Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, are completely unstable economically. The people who are staying in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu have no permanent abode. Even if they are being given a permanent abode, they have no proper economic rights to live. They do not know what their next meal is going to be. They have no vocation to do; there is no business. The children have not gone to school for years. So, those are the fundamental issues that we have to look into. But, the Government might say, "Oh, the war was stopped only a year ago and how can we provide all this?" I agree with them; I agree with the Government on certain issues. But, we must not forget these fundamental issues because we are talking about a small community; we are talking about a certain community. We, the Tamils, have suffered for so many years in the Northern Province and we will suffer the same event for years to come.

A few days ago, we were notified that the Armed Forces are going to take possession of close to 10,000 acres of land in the Northern Province. The reason is that they want to settle in those lands with their families. So, if they are going to take 10,000 acres of land which is available in the Northern Province, how can the Tamils who are living there, who are farmers by origin, do their vocation and their farming? Just consider these issues. Is this why we have won the war for? Have we won the war to stabilize a certain community or to destabilize a certain community? Let us give everyone the opportunity that they are entitled to. I think the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka said that there were 21,000 Sinhala families in Jaffna before 1981, according to the Government Agent's Report; maybe probably in 1981 or subsequently after 1981. We are not disputing the fact that Sinhalese were living in Jaffna.

There was a certain percentage of Sinhala elements in Jaffna with whom we totally agree, and we respect them. There is no problem in living with them in Jaffna but the point remains that we have to adhere to the fundamental base. You cannot take 10,000 acres of Government land and then hand it over to the Armed Forces and their families to go and stay. What is all this? We are talking about the Emergency and asking to eradicate Emergency laws, and then we have the same army camps or even bigger camps in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. Is that what the Government is asking for in the extension of the state of Emergency?

Today, we have to consider one issue very seriously, and that is the widows of the Northern Province. We have not considered this issue up to now. In the Southern Province, there have been widows of heroes of the army. They have been looked after by the Government and they have been given a certain amount of allowance. But, if you look at the statistics of the North today, the number of widows in Jaffna is roughly 26,340; in the Mannar District, it is about 4,082; in Kilinochchi, it is about 6,733; in Vavuniya North, there are 380 and in Mullaitivu it is around 402. In the East, there are 49,000 widows. That means there are nearly 87,000 widows only in the North and East of Sri Lanka and these widows have nothing to live on; nothing to eat. Their children have no right to education. How can they live? They have no vocation. The husband is dead. So, they have no way of living. Is the Government sentimentally considering these issues?

Out of the 87,000 widows who are living today, the majority are less than 20 years of age. So, what I am trying to say is that, these are matters the Government of Sri Lanka should look into. The Ministry of Child Development and Women's Affairs will probably look into this matter.

There has been three decades of war. Tsunami has made the families suffer economically and emotionally. The income capacity and the saving capacity of the Tamils and the Muslims, and the economy of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces are not in a positive position. The livelihood of the Northern people is not bright. The community has become dependent on the aid of the Government and other agencies. We find that there are several people who are mentally affected by the war. The community who are mentally affected are debarred from providing sufficient economic growth to the country. What is the plan to adhere to these issues? We find that several people are disabled. There are enormous issues which have crippled the progress of the Tamil community. Another big issue, as I told you earlier, is with regard to the widows of Sri Lanka. There are Hindu, Muslim and Christian women who are affected. Whoever is involved in planning programmes for them need to understand the religious, cultural and social behaviours of each community. So, what I am trying to re-emphasize in the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency is the good governance that we are talking about. They say that they are trying to make Sri Lanka one of the best countries in South-East Asia. But, if you look at what happened to Siyatha about three days ago, is that the type of image that you are going to have when Sri Lanka is going to be one of the best countries in South-East Asia? Why do we not stop these personal grievances against individuals? Why does the Government not think of building this community and the country on a large scale and in a different manner? How did Singapore grow? How did Malaysia grow? How did Japan with all their war crimes come up in life? How did Australia and United States of America grow? There was economic

growth. There was democracy. If there is no democracy, there cannot be economic growth. So, if we are going to look into economic growth, there should be democracy in the country. I was discussing one issue with a banker and he told me that the Central Bank has said that by the year 2015, the fundamental figure for a bank - the banks capital- should be Rs. 15 billion. Today, the basic amount is Rs. 2.5 billion. What is the big idea of making Rs. 15 billion? It is because they want to get foreign exchange to this country as a capital. These are not issues that we have to look into.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Therefore, Sir, I earnestly request the Government to consider the issues that were raised by me today. Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Presiding Member, on the last occasion that I spoke in this House, it was unfortunate that the senior Ministers in the Government disturbed my speech. Fortunately, today you are in the Chair, from where you cannot disturb me.

I spoke that day and tabled the All Party Representative Committee Report in this House. Sir, I do not understand why those senior Ministers were asked to disturb me so that I would not be able to state what I feel about the APRC Report. After all, the APRC was appointed by His Excellency the President, who mandated that it draws up a home-grown new Constitution that would be a comprehensive approach to the resolution of the national question. By this statement, His Excellency the President said that there is a national question that has to be resolved and also it could be done only with a new Constitution. After accepting that, after 15 parties participating in the APRC process and after 128 meetings, at the end of the process, there were still 13 parties participating in the meetings. Further, out of the 13 members, two were from the Opposition and 11 were parties supporting the Government. So, there is a consensus more of the Government parties than the Opposition. Still, the Government is fighting shy today to accept the APRC Report. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, who was the Chairman of the APRC, has stated to the media that the report submitted by me, a copy of which I gave him is, in content, the same as his Report. The only complaint he has is that it was not signed by all the members of the APRC. But, Sir, the Report submitted by the Hon. Chairman himself was signed only by him and the document tabled to this House by me contained at least two signatures. I urge the Government to be sincere in what it does. If they stated then that this was to resolve the national question, why do they fight shy of this? Today, the whole world knows what the consensus is. The Tamil parties are considering it. They feel that this could be a good start for discussions to a great extent and for resolving the national question. Under these circumstances, the Government should be magnanimous. You are the victors now. You keep on talking in this House about your victories. So, victors should be magnanimous. Why do you not take up your own document, debate and discuss it? You do not have to accept everything in it. But, you can progress from there to create a situation where we would not have to extend

the state of Emergency again and again every month. So, what is this extension of the state of Emergency doing? It is putting fear into the minds of our people. Though the Emergency does not permit the registration of persons in police stations, the Government has come up with a new circular. The IGP Circular No. 2225 of 2010 issued under the Police Ordinance states that the OIC or the HQI of a police station has the right to ask people in his area to declare themselves to the police station. What are the police stations that are registering persons? It is Wellawatta, Kotahena and Modera Police Stations. These are areas where the Tamils are living in large numbers. I visited some police stations and checked how many Sinhalese have registered themselves. In one police station, there was one Sinhalese who had registered himself. I do not know how he came to register himself. It is putting pressure on the Tamil people who are living in Colombo. Not only that, youth in the up-country want to come to Colombo to find some sort of employment. They are unable to find State sector employment because they do not have equal facilities for their education. So, they come to Colombo to find employment in some enterprise in the private sector; maybe middle-level or low-level, but they do feel that their economic emancipation lies in the capital city. So, while they are trying to come here, there is this pressure put on them to register their names in police stations which is keeping them out of the City. This is very unreasonable.

Further, there have been certain restrictions imposed for parking on main roads or thoroughfares in Colombo now. Parking on roads in Colombo is necessary to go about your business, to go about your day-to-day life, to buy the things that you need and to sell the stuff that you have. But, this is being restricted. You are not allowed to park on Thurstan Road, Duplication Road, Galle Road and Havelock Road. Why is this so? Maybe during the war when security was an issue and when certain roads were used by the higher-ups, maybe the Defence Secretary or the Chiefs of the Armed Forces, it was necessary to restrict parking. But, today we are out of the war; still they do not allow parking. I inquired from a police officer who was on the street. He said that recently when the Defence Secretary was passing that way, there was a traffic jam caused by somebody who had parked his vehicle on the road. From that day onwards, they have banned parking on the streets of Colombo. If there were other facilities, if the City of Colombo had been planned in such a manner that there are alternative places for parking, maybe it would be okay. But, today, even at 7 or 8 o'clock in the night, you are not allowed to park on the main roads in Colombo. This has to change. These things should not be done at the whims and fancies of one official. There has to be some decorum in what is being done. The conveniences of the public have to be taken into account when this type of thing is done.

Sir, on this occasion, I wish to talk about something in the North and the East. Recently, His Excellency and his Cabinet went to Kilinochchi to hold a Cabinet meeting in

399 400

the so-called headquarters of Prabhakaran. What are these shows that you hold? Todays "Daily Mirror" carries a beautiful cartoon: a family is almost crying. Then, when the President comes and stands behind them, they are carrying a board saying "Cabinet Meeting in Kilinochchi" and they are pretending to smile. They come back, the Cabinet Ministers come back, those people are forgotten and they are going back to their suffering. People have been "so-called" resettled. But, what have they been provided? They have not been provided homes; they have not been provided for their livelihoods. They have been given a maximum of Rs. 70,000 to rebuild their lives. Can a person who lived so well, who had his own livelihood and his own house, rebuild his or her life with just a mere Rs. 70,000?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon, Member, you have only one more minute. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Government has to be a little more concerned about the true suffering of those people without holding showpiece Cabinet meetings in Kilinochchi; not being worried about the sufferings of the people there.

Further, Sir, as soon as the war was over, the Government boasted that the seas were opened for fishing and that the economic empowerment that the people in the North-East are going to receive is going to be enormous. But, Sir, in the Nandikadal area, people were allowed to fish for a short period. This area is known for prawns, I am told, but today, again the Government has imposed a ban on fishing in the Nandikadal area and we understand that the Government is going to enter into an agreement with a foreign company to give them exclusive fishing rights in the Nandikadal area. We also understand that that particular company does not fish prawns but fish some other variety and so they are going to use certain chemicals, destroy the prawns and then introduce some other variety of fish.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Is this WHAT we are expecting as dividends after the war? Are we not putting people into more problems because the Government wants to do business with foreign entities by suffocating the people in the North and the East?
