( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

[. . 2.46] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, it is after some time that I have got an opportunity to speak on the Debate on the

extension of the state of Emergency. I am glad to follow the Hon. Salinda Dissanayake. I must thank the Hon. Salinda Dissanayake for bringing up what President Obama has told about our President, the denial of human rights in Sri Lanka and about the extension of the number of terms by His Excellency the President. All that will go into the Hansard since he had spoken about them in this House. All the other things will be forgotten and we are only concerned - our people are only concerned - about what the President of the United States of America has told about our President and about our Government. I must thank him for bringing it up so that it will go into the Hansard.

Sir, today the copies of the Appropriation Bill have been distributed in this House. We see that the expenditure on the Ministry of Defence is going up to Rs. 215 billion next year. It is so sad that though two years have passed since the end of war, we are still spending so much on Defence. I do not know for what purpose. The Hon. Prime Minister speaking in this House said that there are two categories of persons who are involved in the LTTE. One category is the diaspora who are creating problems because they want to extend the state of Emergency in Sri Lanka. They have got to extend the state of Emergency abroad, not in Sri Lanka. We have a Minister of External Affairs; we have diplomatic relations. We must use our diplomatic channels. These persons who are in the United States of America can be punished or arrested or dealt with by the Government of the USA. The USA Government has still got a ban on the LTTE. I feel there is no meaning in extending the state of Emergency in Sri Lanka without using the diplomatic channels. All this is to deny the political rights in this country, to deny the rights of the people to speak and to express their views, to hold demonstrations and other ways of protests to show their true feelings about this Government. So, the state of Emergency is extended every month to attack the Opposition and to silence it and not for the purpose that the Government keeps on telling us.

Sir, I wish to take up another issue. It is one and a half years since the war has ended. Still, there are people who are searching for their relatives; there are people who are appearing before the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. What are those people asking for? They are asking for the whereabouts of their relatives. The Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms had his Consultative Committee meeting. The Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation was also there. He has in his custody nearly 10,000 persons who were arrested in the Vanni. I requested certain information about the people who are missing. It was given to the Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation and at the second meeting I raised questions, but there were no answers. There are 20,000 to 30,000 people who are missing. Nobody knows where they are.

549 550

[ ]

2010 19

They have 10,000 people in custody but the Government is not willing to release the names of these persons in custody. If you release those names, at least those families who are looking for their relatives will see the list; they will know that those people are not in Government custody. That means they are missing. They could have died on the last day of the military operations. It is believed that 20,000 persons died on that last day. So, at least they will know that they should not have any hope for the future. Why is that the Government not releasing the names of those 10,000 persons held in custody? This is a question that all are asking. The people in this country whose children are missing have the right to know what happened to them.

Further, Sir, we had a 30-year war. We have come to the end of the war; we have finished that. But, at the same time, what was the cause for the war? The cause for the war was several administrative decisions made by former governments. There was a problem about standardization in universities and there was the problem of denial of certain rights or language rights to minorities. And, before all that there was a major issue : the issue of lands, the issue of colonization especially in the Eastern Province. So, the colonization created a fear, a sense of alienation among the Tamil population who lived in the North and the East and that caused political debate all over the country. The democratic political leadership of the people of the North and the East took it up at several levels. But, there was no proper solution. That is why the youth took over, they rebelled, they fought a war for 30 years. But, at the end of the war, what are we doing? In the Eastern province today - I will give you a list here, I will read it to you, Sir - where the Government after the war, is taking over lands indiscriminately and distributing it among the Sinhala population from the Eastern Province and from outside and to foreigners, depriving the fisherfolk, the cultivators, the farmers in the East of the lands that they have been enjoying over the years. This is again going to create hatred and alienation that the minorities faced in the North and the East in the past. This would again lead to a situation where the people would want to rebel, initially may be politically, and I hope not even militarily again in the future. So, we should now at least, learn our lessons; having commissions to hoodwink the UN is not enough. We have to learn real lessons if we want the situation in this country to go back to a sustainable peace instead of a temporary peace that we have now today. So, towards that I wish to read a list of some lands that have been now taken over by the Government and given to people. One thousand five hundred acres were given for tourism development to outsiders in the Trincomalee District. This is between Irakkakkandy and Pudavaikkattu. Further, 1,400 acres again in the Trincomalee District in the Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha area and 1,000 acres in the Batticaloa District in the Vavunathivu Pradesiya Sabha area which was used for cattle grazing -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, do you have a long list to read out? Your time is up. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, I have only a few more to read. This land has been given to an Iranian company for growing pineapples. Then, we have 15,000 acres taken away in the Trincomalee District in the Kantalai Pradeshiya Sabha area and it has been given to outsiders for their homesteads. Another 1,500 acres in the Batticaloa District in the Koralaipattu South Pradeshiya Sabha area has been given as Mahaweli Development land for the majority population. Further, 300 acres in the Batticoloa District again in the Koralaipattu North Pradeshiya Sabha area has been given for prawn culturing to people from outside the District. Another 1,900 acres has been taken away by the Forest Department in the Pottuvil area in the Ampara District through the District Secretary. All these lands belonging to ordinary people, on which they have been living and cultivating or using for their fishing purposes have been taken away. Is this the right thing to do? Why is this Government so blind to the realities of the last 60 years where we had a 30-year war? I request the Government to rethink and allow the people to enjoy in their lands continuously without interrupting them and creating problems, which will cause another war in this country. Thank you.

[Interruption.] Hon. Member, this has been extensively discussed at the Consultative Committee Meeting. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) "" . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There was a delay in the discussion and- [Interruption.].

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, I was there at the last two Consultative Committee Meetings and this was the agreement reached and this is the view of the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Your view and the view of the Government is different from my view. But, according to what was agreed at the last meeting, we should be able to reflect upon it and give our ideas. At the last meeting it was mentioned very clearly that we could reflect our ideas. But, we were not informed about todays Consultative Committee Meeting. I am sorry about that. We were not informed about it at all. So, if that is the case, you all do it the way you want. Last time, at the Consultative Committee meeting, the President on his own initiative said that there were some ideas which have to be considered and that he appreciated that. So, if that appreciation is there and we just come and say the same thing without any difference, then what is the problem? If you want, go ahead. We do not want to waste your time. But, it was a genuine effort made by the President to interact with the Opposition as well.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) There was an officials committee that was appointed. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When was that appointed? There was no officials' committee which we were informed about. On that particular day, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and I think the Hon. Deputy Minister of Ports and Aviation were also there.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Those Amendments were brought before the Consultative Committee and these issues were extensively discussed at the meeting held this morning too.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, there was no meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You should have come. You did not come before the Consultative Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am sorry, Hon. Minister, you say that there was a Consultative Committee meeting which we had not been informed of. Give us one document to prove that there was a meeting.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) There were two Consultative Committee meetings. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. Where were they held? We were not informed of them. So, if that is the case, you all do it.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Parliamentary officials were present there and they were asked to give notice.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The President ensured that this was brought in because the Opposition brought in some ideas. If you want to do it without the Opposition, go ahead and do it.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) So, that is why all those ideas were incorporated to the extent that could be possible.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, there was no consultation with us. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) We cannot incorporate all the ideas of the Opposition. ( ) (The Chairman) . , -
