( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, I am very happy to participate in the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget 2010, but I am only sorry for the Acting Minister of Finance and Planning who had been burdened with the task of reading out a couple of sheets of paper. Knowing his ability and efficiency, I think it has been done deliberately to discount him.

The Budget 2010 has been presented at a critical turning point for Sri Lanka. This is the first post-LTTE, peacetime Budget that has been presented. Everyone in Sri Lanka expected the Government to present a development-oriented Budget. But, what have you done? It is crystal clear that the Budget 2010 displays a clear military bias. See the amount of money that you have allocated for the Ministry of Defence. How can one explain the massive Rs. 24 billion increase in defence expenditure in 2010 over that of 2009? So, that is something you have to explain.

This is the 63rd Budget that has been presented in our Parliament since Independence. But, this 63rd Budget is unique in several aspects. I will just mention a few of them. Firstly, it is the first Budget in the history of Parliament that has been presented without any Budget Proposals. There were no proposals. Secondly, this is the first Budget in the history of Parliament that has been presented to service the expenditure of this country through borrowed funding on commercial terms. If you look at Table I - Summary of the Budget 2009-2010 - you will see a host of borrowings. Thirdly, this is the Budget that has been presented without the Finance Minister; he being out of the country. Never have we heard this. It is again, a unique record. So, in this scenario, the Budget should go to the Guinness Book.

849 850

[ ]

2010 03

Never have we experienced these phenomena that I mentioned. Sir, as I see, this is a right about-turn Budget. I tell this for very good reasons. All what the previous Budgets have done have been undone by this Budget. That is, the vision of the previous Budgets of this Government was down with the imperialists, down with the rapacious West, down with the IMF, down with the World Bank and all other foreign lending agencies. We were proudly told that the Government was turning towards China, Russia, Libya, Iran and some other countries. It was told that we can run the country without the rapacious West. So, this Government now, by turning to the IMF, has taken a right about-turn. The Finance Minister of any country is entitled to have his own dreams, but I am sorry for the Hon. (Dr.) Amunugama, the Acting Minister of Finance and Planning and the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, who turned the other way for this purpose as the Minister, and had to read the Budget while the Finance Minister had run away from the country. This is the situation. Why is that?

( )(An Hon. Member) That is a State visit.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Ah! This Government is in a financial fix. If you look at Table I - Summary of the Budget 2009-2010 - of the Budget Speech, you see what the financial situation of the country is. So, all the financial giants starting from the IMF are invited to grant commercial loans even at unrealistic interest rates to this incompetent Government. -[Interruption.] Then, why are you going round borrowing from the IMF and the other international agencies? You are going to the HSBC; to Templeton; to Grindlays Bank and Deutsch Bank. There is no bank left in the whole world; all commercial borrowings are going on right now. If you are asking foreign companies to come and invest in this country like what is happening in Malaysia, Singapore and even in India, it is okay, because the ultimate beneficiaries in such a situation will be the people of this country. Look at China. Only the board is communist but its economic thinking is completely capitalistic. Do you agree ? ( )( - , , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Acting Minister of Finance and Planning and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning ) No, no.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Otherwise! You are borrowing from China also. At what rate? I will give you the details of the phenomenal development. According to the available information, its growth rate alone is nearly 11 per cent. All this has happened because China has liberally embraced the open economy. We are going the other way. That is the most unfortunate thing.

Hon. Acting Minister, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa thinks that the people of this country are like a set of monkeys in a zoo gaping at him to deliver the goods. You have now received the fourth instalment from the IMF after bending on all fours. I do not know what you went and did, but certainly the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and several others who went did so. This is what happened. The Government has now received the fourth instalment of US Dollars 407 million; a very fat sum indeed. Now, all I ask you is this. After you do justice to this amount, from where are you going to raise loans for the future activities in November? Please, tell us. Is there any other foreign commercial bank that is left without lending? You go to all the foreign commercial banks. Are you going again or are you going to Iran, Libya or Russia to service the vicious cycle of your debt trap? Now, this Government has no shame; it is devoid of principles. At times, it calls the IMF as rapacious and is not willing to bend before them, but willing to go with a begging bowl to foreign commercial banks or sell our treasury bonds to raise money. Where are you going to end? Surely, you cannot run a country like this. We do not even run our homes like this. I am telling you that you are going down an abyss taking this country to ruination. That is what you are going to do day by day.

This is nothing but a shameless Budget. I told you it is a shameless Budget. It has completely brokered the self-respect of this nation. That is what has happened. This is a Budget that will make the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is the underlying reality of this horrendous Budget.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to place on record, a very appropriate statement made by the late President Ranasingha Premadasa. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, you must agree on this. What did he say? He said, I quote:

There is no point in any development that keeps the people in hunger.

, . . . [ ] . . . . This was the economic thinking of late President Premadasa who was a very practical man. The late Premadasa encapsulated in one sentence what development is. Logically and rationally

851 852

defence expenditure should have decreased with the victorious conclusion of the war. You are always talking of the war. All Government Ministers and Members were talking about the victorious war in their speeches made in this Budget Debate. We all know it. Now that is over. It is almost a year ago. Now, it is time to get down to development. This is particularly so in a country which is struggling with a huge debt burden. To be precise, it is 86 per cent of GDP. These are your figures.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) What was it earlier, Hon. Member?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Forget about earlier. You took the Government on the understanding that you will do a better job.

Mr. Speaker, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, during his recent visit to Sri Lanka, referring to the Grecian economic crisis stated thus. Things happened the other way. What did he say? I quote:

Greece borrowed too much beyond its means which led to mountainous deficit.

That is what we are. I mean, he drew that comparison as an example of what is happening in Sri Lanka. A country facing a huge deficit and borrowing like ours, the economic rationality demands that such a country divert towards development purposes - that is what is lacking in you - a substantial portion of the resources it previously spent on defence. Tragically, this Government has chosen to do the inverse. This Governments economic thinking seems to be revolving round the paradoxical maxim, guns versus rice. That is what we can understand. It prefers to spend on "guns" rather than on "rice". The whole economic thinking of the Government is lopsided. This Government, in fact, is demanding more and more belt-tightening from the already overburdened people to sacrifice in the name of development. The 2010 Budget is a warning to the people that this Government is not serious in economic development, but only concerned in giving priority to military expenditure. With your figures, we have to come to that conclusion.

Mr. Speaker, choosing "guns" over "rice" means ignoring or de-prioritization of vitally necessary public services such as education and health. The allocation for education and higher education is just 18 per cent of the defence expenditure. Now, you know how much of foreign exchange is going out of the country for our Sri Lankan children to get education abroad. The CIMA itself -

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We are trying to remedy that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) What is the remedy? You have not done anything. Children going for CIMA spend Sterling Pounds 3,500,000 annually as remittances. This is something very serious. We have to take cognizance of the amount of money that is going out as a result of the weakness of our expenditure.

Now, it is a comedy of errors that the new Education Minister is advocating; to do away with the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, which enables clever students from non-privileged backgrounds to enter prestigious schools, saying that it is unnecessary. Why? What is the reason? He wants to do away with it preventing opportunity for those children from the villages coming to some popular schools. Thus, according to the Minister, the solution to the crisis in the education sector is not to improve the quality of teachers and of teaching but to provide facilities to the underprivileged schools, all of which cost money. There should have been a better or higher allocation for education. This is nothing but the economic thinking of the Government that favours the maxim I said, guns versus rice.

Mr. Speaker, the late President Premadasa stated thus. We have got used to treating the poor as a set of worthless beings. He always said that. He always invited our attention. The late President Premadasas economic thinking was down to earth and practical. His economic strategy was consciously premised on the belief that the poor are a development asset rather than an impediment to development which you have not considered. Tragically, the post-Premadasa era has abandoned this conceptual advance after we lost the Government. This is evident in the low priority accorded to poverty alleviation and employment generation in the post-Premadasa economic strategy. For example, according to media reports, the Chinese-funded economic projects in Hambantota, the highways and the 18 major projects, do not even provide temporary employment opportunities for local people. Where are the employment opportunities? You are talking of development. They are all brought from China, Chinese prisoners. They employ migrant workers from China. - [Interruption.] What are you talking about? Do you think the people in Hambantota do not want to work? Do not talk nonsense. I think the Indians will follow.

Sir, the latest Global Hunger Index labels Sri Lankas condition of child malnutrition, child mortality rate and the proportion of people who are calorie-deficient as very serious. There are serious comments made. According to a nutrition and food security service conducted jointly by

853 854

[ ]

2010 03

the Ministry of Health, UNESCO and the WFP, Lankan households spend 37.9 per cent of their monthly income on food and nearly a third of the households borrow money for their day-to-day purchases. The monthly income of 39.1 per cent of the households is less than Rs. 9,000 while 32 per cent of the households did not have enough food at least once during the previous 12-month period. In short, the "build, baby, build approach to development has been devastated by this Government, leading to potency in certain natural disasters. This Government has failed to improve the living standard of the majority of people, except marginally. The recent spate of price increases in essential food items and goods and services crystallizes the economic thinking of this Government in the light of the staggering defence expenditure of Rs. 200.2 billion apportioned by the 2010 Budget.

Sir, this is the logical outcome of the Rajapaksa economic thinking. This runs counter to the truism of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, which he never forgot. That is, development is not development if it keeps people in hunger. That is what you have to bear in mind and that is what is happening. A Grade II student participating in an islandwide essay competition to commemorate the 80th birth anniversary of this late President wrote in his essay, If the development of the country goes hand in hand with the worsening of living conditions of the people, for whom or for what is that development? That is what we have to ask. Then, he goes on, "Is it for a developed country having malnourished people? Is this not insanity? Must the people of the country gaze at highways and huge bridges and buildings like a child looking yearningly at an empty ice cream cup?" That is what it appears to be. He also asks, Should the people eat stones or tar when development fails to eradicate hunger? That is what we also have to ask. Some are just gazing.

Sir, this in a sense, is the economic thinking of the Government. It is wise for the Government to keep in mind what happened in Indonesia. Hon. Deputy Minister, you are quite aware that under President Suharto, almost the same happened. Under President Suharto and his family regime, that Government engaged in a massive project of constructing bridges, buildings and highways with a supposed to be booming economy while totally forgetting to improve the living standards of the people of that country. What happened? This resulted in widespread hunger in that country due to food prices being doubled and trebled, leading to riots forcing Suharto to stand down. I hope this will not happen in our country.

Likewise, 63 per cent of the total expenditure of the 2010 Budget in our country is being controlled by one family. There is nothing to hide. It is quite clear from the allocations. It is wise for this Government to keep in mind that in post-war Sri Lanka, the real national security depends on equitable and humane development rather

than on military expenditure or guns. Now is the time to shift from guns to rice, before the bloated defence spending becomes the national sacred cow, plunging this country into an abyss of chaos.

Sir, if you look at the figures given in the Budget Estimates and those in the Appropriation Bill, there is a discrepancy. Either the figures are fudged or you are trying to mislead the people of this country. Why can you not have one set of figures? That shows your inefficiency. The Estimates give distorted figures.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Give me one example.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I cannot, I have no time. But, you know it. You know what has happened. Why are you denying that? Take up the Budget Estimates and the figures that you gave. - [Interruption.] I cannot. I will leave it to you. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is giving private tuition.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no, that is all right.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am a Colleague.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) He is my Colleague. Take up your balance sheet. Now, take up Table I - Summary of the Budget 2009-2010, in the Budget Speech.

( )( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) What is wrong in private tuition?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You should not get private tuition on the Floor of the House.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You were tutored by the IMF.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) , . . , Summary .

I cannot understand how you are going to present the 2011 Budget in November. I can assure you, Sir, that there would be no relief because the IMF conditions are applicable to the 2011 Budget as well. The conditions will continue. You will not be able to give the Rs. 2,500 to the Government servants.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You wait till November. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You will not be able to reduce the prices. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You will see that in November. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) On the contrary, you will increase the taxes. That is what you would do. You are bound to do that because of your borrowings. Those are the borrowing conditions. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Do not say no, no. I only pray that you would not be called upon to present that Budget. If not, it will be another question of reading a set of papers. I am so sorry for you, that such an eminent, efficient, senior and competent Minister was given that task. I think it was to tarnish your name.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, we have limited time.

887 888

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Member - I told him in Sinhala also - is ignorant of the Constitution. Article 42 of the Constitution is very clear about the executive powers of His Excellency the President. Then Article 44 deals with "Ministers of Cabinet and their subjects and functions." I will only read the relevant sections, Sir. It says that he can assign portfolios and functions as he wishes because he is the Executive. If he wants he can hold all the portfolios. But, he does not do that. He is generous and he has given portfolios to others.

Sir, I will only quote Article 44 (2) of the Constitution . It states, I quote:

"The President may assign to himself any subject or function and shall remain in charge of any subject or function not assigned to any Minister under the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article or the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article 45, and may for that purpose determine the number of Ministries to be in his charge,.........".

Now, he is criticizing the executive powers which he has no right to do.

It further states, I quote :

"and accordingly, any reference in the Constitution or any written law to the Minister to whom such subject or function is assigned, shall be read and construed as a reference to the President"

Then Sir, I will further quote only one sentence from Article 44 (3). It states :

"The President may, at any time, change the assignment of subjects and functions and the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers....."

He is criticizing and challenging the powers of the President, which he cannot do. Therefore, Sir, I hope you will go through his speech, and wherever possible, wherever he has made references against the Constitution, expunge them according to the Standing Orders. That is my point of Order. [Interruption.] Thank you.

( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Hon. Deputy Speaker, Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future embodied in the Election Manifesto of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa promised to transform Sri Lanka into the Emerging Wonder of Asia. The Government has managed many challenges, both man-made and natural, and made successful progress. Almost three decades of conflict has been brought to an end. Similarly, the tsunami-affected areas in the coastal belt have been developed. We were even able to withstand the global, financial and economic crisis.

895 896

The Government has given priority to infrastructure development initiatives with a special focus on developing energy sources, seaports, airports, expressways, road networks, bridges, new irrigation schemes, water supply projects, et cetera. Similarly, high importance has been given to education, health and rural economic development. Despite many challenges, the Budget deficit has been maintained at 8 per cent of GDP, which is commendable, and the IMF has extended its support.

The country has graduated to a middle-income country and the per capita income has increased from US Dollars 1,062 in 2004 to US Dollars 2,053 in 2009, an achievement that we can be proud of. Our average economic growth has been increased to 6 per cent in the past five years. In the first quarter of 2010, the economic growth rate was recorded at 7.1 per cent. Unemployment has been brought down to 5 per cent; poverty levels have declined from 23 to 15 per cent. These are commendable achievements despite the natural and man-made challenges the country faced. The tourism sector has been picking up very fast and is an indicator that reflects economic achievements.

The projected economic growth of 7 per cent for the year is on par with the economic development for the fiscal year 2008/09 of India, the third largest economy in Asia. The LTTE was defeated by the Government and the Governments fiscal policies have stimulated the economic growth.

As the Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, my Ministry will play a leading role in the countrys development by mobilizing small entrepreneurs engaged in traditional industries, the handicrafts sector, small industries and enterprises scattered all over the island. These engagements will contribute to the Mahinda Chintana" vision of transforming Sri Lanka into the Emerging Wonder of Asia.

My Ministry will work towards bringing traditional industries from the war-affected areas in line with the rest of the countrys enterprises. In this regard, a medium-term Results Focused Strategic Plan is being prepared by the Ministry. The SME, Industrial Development Board, National Craft Council, National Design Centre, Palmyrah Development Board, Elephant Pass and Kurinchativu Salterns and North Sea Limited come under the purview of my Ministry.

My Ministry will play a significant role by supporting in the transfer of technology to the rural industrialists and handicraftsmen; introduce innovative designs to enhance competitiveness in the market, provide opportunities to run trade fairs at provincial and national levels to find

market opportunities to promote handicraft and small industries; transfer technical, managerial and entrepreneurial skills and training to small and medium enterprises; and streamline the availability of credit; provide quality raw material and equipment to support the SMIs and SMEs scattered all over the island.

Moreover, the 2010 Implementation Plan includes the reactivation of the Elephant Pass and Kurinchativu Salterns, which will be able to achieve a national salt production level of at least 60,000 to 80,000 metric tons in the medium-term, and provide employment opportunities to 2,000 people. These salterns will commence operation as soon as the de-mining activities in and around them are completed.

Further, the palmyrah sector which comes under the purview of my Ministry, is also very important. We have proposed to develop this as a dynamic and vibrant sector with a focus on new planting, expanding the Katpagam sales outlets island-wide, enhancing the production of palmyrah handicrafts, and increasing sap, pulp, soft drink, and jaggery production. We have also proposed to re-establish the Kaithady Research Institute, and to relocate the Head Office of the Palmyrah Development Board in Jaffna in line with the incorporation Act, and to enhance the living standards of those dependent on this sector.

The Annual Implementation Plan for 2010 along with other nationwide initiatives includes the conduct of the "Shilpa" National Exhibition, National Award Ceremony for Handicraftsmen and Small Industrialists, Kitul Production Programme, Development of Craft Villages, Industrial Estate in Atchchuveli, Jaffna, improvements to Polonnaruwa and Badulla "Lakkam" Sales Centres, establishment of "Lakkam" Sales Centres in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and Common Service Centres.

My Ministry will work closely with other line Ministries, Provincial Councils, Federations of Chambers of Commerce and Industries, private sector and other development partners to fulfil the achievement of its mission.

His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa repeatedly states that peace without development or development without peace is not sustainable.

With the liberation of the Eastern Province, the Government embarked on a development drive for the Province. Now, the Governments focus has been on the Northern Province, to prioritize de-mining operations and complete the resettlement of people. This year, the Government has a priority target to complete all de-mining operations, to resettle all IDPs and to ensure their quality of life. The resettled people will be given all necessary assistance for restarting their lives. My Ministry is very committed to assisting in this regard.

The reopening of A-9 road, removal of restrictions on fishing, the opening of bank branches and unrestricted transportation has expedited business development in the North and the East. Assessments are being carried out to identify fully and partially damaged houses, buildings, hospitals, courthouses, bus stops, market places, et cetera to implement an accelerated rehabilitation programme.

Following His Excellency the Presidents visit to India with a delegation including myself, I am pleased and wish to appreciate the generous support extended by the Government of India for building 50,000 houses in the Northern Province. Also, the blueprint for construction of railway lines in the North has been finalized. A comprehensive medium and long-term plan is being formulated to transform the conflict-affected areas and to improve the living conditions.

The recurrent expenditure of my Ministry for the year is Rs. 493 million as against the capital expenditure of Rs. 194 million. However, I will assure that the people of this country will get the maximum benefit for every cent spent by my Ministry.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy)

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Debate of the Second Reading of the Budget 2010.

There is a confusion as to whether this Budget is for the whole year 2010 or for a six-month period starting from June till end of December 2010. This Budget should have been presented to Parliament during the latter part of last year. Money was allocated for the first few months of this year by the Vote on Account passed last year. Later, the President authorized expenditure from the Consolidated Fund for two or three months of this year.

From the Budget we find that Rs. 201 billion has been allocated for Defence expenditure this year, out of the total expenditure of Rs. 974 billion. The amount allocated for Defence expenditure in 2009 was only Rs.177 billion. I do not know why the allocation for Defence expenditure has been increased to such an amount. Now that the war is over and there is peace, such a big amount should not have been allocated for Defence. The

allocation for the Health Ministry is Rs. 52 billion. For the Education Ministry, the Government has apportioned only Rs. 27 billion and Rs. 19 billion has been approved for the Higher Education Ministry. This time only Rupees two billion has been allocated for the Ministry of Rehabilitation but last year the allocation was Rupees four billion.

The real problem the people are now facing is the high cost of living. We find that no meaningful proposals have been included in the Budget to bring down the cost of living. Almost everyone is affected by the high cost of living. Consumers are hard hit in the stomach. Putting together a simple and inexpensive rice and curry meal these days has become a huge strain on the family budget. Duty on imported food stuff has been increased.

Re-imposition of the import tax on consumer items is the main reason for the higher prices. The price of carrots has gone up from Rs. 140 per kilogram a month ago to Rs. 240 per kilogram now; capsicum from Rs. 160 to Rs. 320 per kilogram and beetroot from Rs. 120 to Rs. 200 per kilogram. Similarly all the other vegetables have gone up in price. Vegetables are almost beyond the reach of medium low income families.

You must avoid wasteful expenditure. The public enterprises, namely the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the Ceylon Transport Board, the Ceylon Electricity Board and Mihin Lanka have incurred great losses in 2009. The operating loss to the Ceylon Electricity Board was Rs. 7.4 billion in 2009. It is vital that the power sector is transformed into a sound and financially viable section in the economy. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation reported an operating loss of Rs. 12.3 billion in 2009.

The second national carrier, Mihin Lanka, has incurred a loss of Rs. 930 billion in 2009 and all these losses have to be borne by the Treasury. If we are unable to properly and profitably manage the public enterprises, they should be privatized.

When I speak about the economy of this country, I am reminded of what the late J.B. Kripalani, a respected socialist leader, had to say when India attained Independence. He said, What we want now is not -isms whether it is communism, socialism, or capitalism. What we want is an efficient government. What he said then is applicable in respect of our present economy as well. The rot in the economy in this country set in with

929 930

[ .. ]

2010 03

the nationalization and subsequent fragmentation of estates in 1970 by the Government of late Mrs. Srimavo Bandaranaike. Some estates are viable and can be efficiently and profitably run only if they are managed in a large scale. It was late Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, when asked whether he would nationalize the estates, said that he was not prepared to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. But, now the goose that laid the golden eggs has been killed by its wife.

Instead of privatizing the estates, they have been leased out to companies and the companies are not managing them efficiently and are not developing the estates. There should have been an outright privatization which was not done in the case of estates. Before privatization, the Shell Gas Company and the Caltex Company were being run profitably and they have paid enough money to the Government by way of taxes.

When considering the cutting down of wasteful expenditure, we must start it from the top. I do not know why we want about 47 Ministers to run Sri Lanka. In Japan, where there are 720 Members of Parliament, there are only 20 Ministers in the Cabinet. - [Interruption.]

As far as unemployment is concerned, there are 23,000 graduates unemployed in the South and 3,500 graduates unemployed in the North. Something has gone wrong with the method of education imparted in the universities. Our universities have only manufactured graduates who are unemployable. The education system in the universities must be vocational-based.

In the North, development work has not been done for the last several years. In 1952, our late Leader, Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam, who was the then Minister of Industries, started a cement factory at Kankesanthurai, a caustic soda factory at Paranthan and a paper factory at Valaichenai. They provided employment to several Tamil youths. All these three factories are non-functional now. They must be made functional to enable some people to be employed there.

The Government had the Victory Day Celebrations on the 18th of June, 2010 to celebrate the victory they obtained by defeating the LTTE in May, 2009. We regard this day as a day of mourning. What happened at the last stages of the war in May 2009 at Mullivaikkal? About 30,000 civilians were brutally killed and some people who surrendered with white flags were shot dead and one of them was a Sinhalese lady. We are not worried as to who gave this order to shoot, but the fact remains that people who surrendered with a white flag were shot dead. The Government might have won the war, but so far it has failed to win the peace and the hearts of the Tamil-speaking people. The Government should take some meaningful steps towards this end. The evidence gathered by the International Crisis Group suggests that during the last five months of the civil war,

tens of thousands of Tamil civilians - men, women, children and the elderly - were killed; countless more wounded; hundreds of thousands were deprived of adequate food and medical care, resulting in more deaths.

Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has appointed a three-member panel consisting of Marzuki Darusman, Steven Ratner and Yasmin Sooka to advise him on human rights issues relating to Sri Lanka. Three hundred thousand persons from Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu got displaced due to war and they were put behind barbed wire fences in the Menik Farm camp. People are still not being allowed to resettle in several areas in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu.

If the GSP Plus facility is withdrawn by the European Union, several thousands of workers in garment factories will be thrown out of employment. As such, a small country like Sri Lanka must cautiously deal with the European Union and Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. To my mind, the conditions imposed by the European Union to continue with the GSP Plus facility are reasonable, fair and, should and could be implemented by the Government.

We understand that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is trying to bring an amendment to the Constitution so that the President can contest for a third time and to repeal the Seventeenth Amendment. The Government needs two-thirds majority in Parliament to do this and I doubt whether they will get it. As far as the TNA is concerned, we strongly oppose any amendment that might repeal the Seventeenth Amendment and give a third term to the President. We, the Tamil National Alliance want the abolition of the Executive Presidency and we want the Seventeenth Amendment to be fully implemented by the present President and the President should appoint a Constitutional Council and thereafter appoint an Independent Public Service Commission, a Human Rights Commission, a Bribery Commission and an Elections Commission. The Seventeenth Amendment was passed by Parliament to avoid politicization of Government departments. It was passed with a two-thirds majority. Since the Seventeenth Amendment forms part of the Constitution, the President is duty-bound to implement it. If he intentionally fails to implement it, then he can be even impeached.

Coming onto High Security Zones, will the Minister of Defence enlighten this House as regards the areas which have been brought under High Security Zones in the North and the dates on which they were brought under them? Have declarations which made parts of the North as High Security Zones been approved by the Parliament? There is no legal basis for any concept of High Security Zones in the North now.

Valigamam North area, which is about 30 per cent of the North, is under the occupation of the Army and is

931 932

under a High Security Zone. In Valigamam North, there are 48 Grama Sevaka Divisions and 28 Grama Sevaka Divisions are said to be under the so-called High Security Zone and nobody is allowed to go and resettle there. Only 12 Grama Sevaka Divisions are fully occupied and five Grama Sevaka Divisions are only partly occupied. Palaly Airport, Teachers Training College, Palaly, Myliddy Fishing Harbour, Chest Hospital at Myliddy, KKS Harbour, Cement Factory at Kankesanthurai, Keerimalai Naguleswaram Temple, Mavatapuram Kandasamy Temple and District Hospital, Cancer Hospital, Union College, and Mahajana College at Tellippallai are said to be in the so-called High Security Zone. Valigamam North, Mandaitivu from Jaffna to Columbuthurai, Karampaham, Eluthumutuval North and South, Nagar Kovil and Maruvan Puloo are situated in the so-called High Security Zones. About 100,000 Internally Displaced Persons of Valigamam North and about another 100,000 Internally Displaced Persons in Thenmaradchchi are not allowed to go and resettle in their own lands due to the so-called concept of High Security Zone. Preventing a person from going and living in his own land is a breach of his fundamental right.

At Mandaitivu, about one kilometre of the main road is blocked and Ward Nos. 1 to 5 have been declared as a High Security Zone.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, you have only two minutes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, please give me one more minute.

About 1,500 families were displaced from Mandaitivu and they are returning from Vanni. Refugees who have returned so far and living in refugee camps in public buildings in Ward Nos. 6 and 7 are living under wretched conditions. Let those people who were displaced from Mandaitivu be allowed to resettle there.

The workers expected a salary increase of at least Rs. 2,500 but the Budget has not provided for such payment.

The Army Officers are misbehaving in the North. On the 6th of June 2010, at Viswamadu, near the 12th mile post, four Army Officers entered a house in the night and put up two ladies who were sleeping there. One lady, who started to run, was assaulted on her head and she had started bleeding from her head and the Army Officers put her down on the ground and gang-raped her. The three officers, one by one, sexually abused her. When another officer went near the other lady, she had told him that she was having her periods. At an identification parade held at the Magistrate's Court, Kilinochchi, all four Army

Officers were identified. This news did not appear in any of the English daily newspapers.

I request the Government to withdraw the Army from the North and demilitarize the area. If necessary, some Army Officers can be confined to the Palaly Army Camp as was done before 1990. In 1990 there was only one Army Camp at Palaly. People want the North to become normal. Army Officers are occupying several houses in the North. I kindly request the Government to direct the Army to hand over the houses they occupy, to the owners.

Two judges from Chavakachcheri and Vavuniya have been transferred out with immediate effect. Both of them were inquiring into the abduction and killing of a 16-year-old child at Chavakachcheri and the abduction of another child at Vavuniya by a paramilitary group, which supports the Government. If the judicial officers who do their duty properly are transferred in this manner, I fear that the people might lose confidence in the judiciary.

I also request the Government to repeal the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act and give amnesty to all the Tamil prisoners and release them.

Thank you. [. . 1.45]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Funds for the North and the East are integrated with the funds allocated for most of the Ministries. For example, if you take the Ministry of Power and Energy,

957 958

[ .. ]

2010 03

we have now started a project - you know that very well - to give electricity from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi and to Jaffna. I, myself participated in the opening ceremony. So, you must not analyse the money that is allocated for the Ministry of Rehabilitation only. You have to look at every single Ministry. There is a large component of work to be done in the North and the East. Later, I can write to you and give you the allocations for all those. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Hon. Minister, that is a national level programme. We have to think about especially the North and the East. That is what I am saying.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Not only the North and the East, there are special projects in other areas also. But, they all are lumped together in this Budget. For example, as I mentioned, it may be construction of new roads by the Ministry of Highways; whether it be the Northern Province or the Eastern Province or the Central Province, all these come together. So, you have to look at the printed estimates. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) You have to give facilities to the disabled civilians.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, of course. There will be a budget for rehabilitation, social welfare and things like that. So, you have to examine that also. We have allocated funds for that. So, please look at the printed estimates for each of those and see whether these are there or not. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Okay, thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you are fast running out of time. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Yes, Sir. I will take one more minute, please.
