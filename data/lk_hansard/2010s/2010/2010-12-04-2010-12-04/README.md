IT and language training are very essential to develop youth talents to enter the outside job market. Therefore, my Ministry has developed 45 Praja Shakthi (E-Kiosk Centres) to provide training of IT and languages. This programme has been implemented through STMF. A total of 22,079 youths have been trained under this programme during this year up to 30th September, 2010 and will be further expanded under the proposed five-year plan.

Mr. Chairman, the Navashakthi Entrepreneur Development Project was a special project introduced by me in January 2009 with the aim of motivating unemployed youth in underprivileged and under-served areas to have self-confidence and undertake entrepreneurial projects for economic empowerment. Youths will be trained to take up self-employment in the fields of dairy, poultry and goat-farming and also in setting up of small businesses, tailoring and cultivation. These projects are tied up with a loan scheme arranged by my Ministry with the Peoples Bank. Under this programme a total of Rs. 11.8 million has been disbursed among 397 beneficiaries from January 2009 to the end of September, 2010.

The Plantation Human Development Trust - PHDT - incorporated under the Companies' Act No. 17 of 1982 is entrusted with the functions of human and social capital development of plantation worker community. It has a network in Nuwara Eliya, Hatton, Badulla, Ratnapura, Kandy, Kegalle and Galle plantation regions. Infrastructure development, support for education activities, water supply and sanitation projects, concreting of roads and support for religious activities were implemented through the PHDT for the benefit of the plantation worker community and the socio-economic development of the neighbouring villages and urban areas. A total of Rs. 87.6 million has been spent in seven plantation regions to carry out these special activities in 2010. A further Rs. 42.2 million was incurred to develop water supply, roads, foot paths, pavements and common amenities in the Nuwara Eliya and Hatton regions.

Mr. Chairman, to revitalize the livestock sector in Sri Lanka, it is very important to improve food security as a means of resolving many issues such as poverty reduction, livelihood development, unemployment, malnutrition and saving valuable foreign exchange incurred in importing livestock products. More than 410,000 families are directly and another 1.3 million families are indirectly engaged in livestock sector activities such as dairy, poultry, goat and swine farming.

His Excellency the President has stated in his Budget Speech that the livestock sector is critical in food security, income generation and foreign exchange savings. His Excellency the President has also proposed an increase in the farmgate price for liquid milk to Rs. 50 per litre to promote milk production. Special credit facilities at 8 per cent interest will be extended to promote small-scale livestock activities. The investment by the private sector will be encouraged to increase the availability of liquid milk. At present, the country has reached 35 per cent self-reliance in local milk production and plans are underway to become self-sufficient in milk by 2016.

The poultry industry, which is almost 95 per cent in the hands of the private entrepreneurs has shown a tremendous growth during the past years. However, due to the avian influenza disease which affected most of the countries in the world the local poultry industrialists also reduced their import of parent birds, which has resulted in a minor setback in poultry production at present.

Mr. Chairman, I wish to state that Sri Lanka is very fortunate to be free from this disease which has affected most of our neighbouring countries, due to our vigilant quarantine formalities. At present the locally produced poultry meat and meat products meet 70 per cent of the country's requirement. However, both private and state sector poultry organizations are now gearing up for increased production with the import of parent livestock and 100 per cent self-reliance to be reached in the near future. The goat and swine farming sectors which make little contribution to the total livestock production, needs much attention.

Sir, the following institutions dealing with livestock sector activities are under the purview of my Ministry, namely, Department of Animal Production and Health, National Livestock Development Board, Milk Industries of Lanka Company (Pvt.) Limited, Sri Lanka Libya Agricultural and Livestock Development Company Limited and Mahaweli Livestock Enterprises Limited.

There are three main programmes implemented by my Ministry, namely, establishment of dairy villages to increase milk production, formation of livestock breeder farms to supply breeding animals and establishment of liquid milk sales outlets to promote consumption of liquid milk. During 2010, a total of 175 dairy villages, 111 livestock breeder farms, 71 milk sales outlets and 32 bio-

gas units have been established in the country to promote livestock development.

The Department of Animal Production and Health - DAPH - provides technical expertise and backup services to the livestock industry. There are 283 field veterinary centres under the provincial Department of Animal Production and Health to implement livestock disease control and development programmes at grass-roots level. I am happy to inform you that the DAPH has carried out 495,249 immunizations to prevent contagious diseases in cattle and buffaloes. One hundred and thirty six thousand and fifty one artificial inseminations in cattle have been carried out up to the end of September 2010, which will result in an estimated 23,000 good quality female calves. Four hundred and twenty nine artificial inseminations in swine also have been carried out and 709 piglets are born during this period. Three new veterinary investigation centres at Trincomalee, Ampara and Colombo have been completed in 2010.

The National Livestock Development Board - NLDB - having nearly 40,000 acres under its control has the main function of supplying the much-needed breeding material to the livestock farmers. The NLDB has issued 1.3 million broiler chicks, 0.68 million layer chicks, 758 cattle and buffaloes, 2,371 piglets and 167 goats and sheep to livestock farmers during the year 2010. It has produced 37,525 UHT treated (delight) milk packets under my guidance, and the shelf-life of this Tetra Pak will be six months without affecting the quality or the goodness of fresh milk. The NLDB is also making arrangements to import chicks to run its poultry hatcheries to full capacity. Already 2,080 parent birds have been imported so far.

Mr. Chairman, Milco (Pvt.) Limited which is the only State-owned milk-processing organization has four factories located in Colombo, Digana, Ambewela and Polonnaruwa. The major processed products are milk powder, sterilized and pasteurized milk, yoghurt, ice cream, condensed milk and cheese. The Milco has carried out the following activities for the improvement of the dairy farmers and the dairy sectors. Installation of two ice cream producing machines at the Colombo factory having a capacity of 600 litres per hour, establishment of an effluent treatment plant at Colombo factory, establishment of 50 dairy villages and new sales outlets are some of the initiatives taken by Milco during the year 2010. It has produced 3,195 metric tons of milk powder, 9 million litres of liquid milk, 96,000 kilograms of condensed milk, 3.4 million litres of ice cream, 14,000 kilograms of cheese and 3.5 million litres of milk utilized for making yoghurt and 439,000 kilograms of butter this year, up to the end of September 2010. Also, it has 1,849 active Farmer Managed Societies - FMS - spread throughout the Island with a membership of over 55,000.

Mr. Chairman, I am happy to inform you that the Milco (Pvt.) Limited has increased its purchasing price of

liquid milk by 10 per cent per litre with effect from 22nd June this year. I also wish to state that the price of any of the milk products marketed by Milco was not increased as a result of the increase of the purchase price of milk. It has made arrangements to market UHT-processed liquid milk in 180 millilitre and 400 millilitre nutritional packs with 30-45 day shelf life, especially for school-going children.

Sri Lanka Libya Agricultural and Livestock Development Company Limited - LANLIB - is a joint venture project between the NLDB and the Libyan Government. The primary objective of setting up this company in 1981 was to export tea to Libya but the monopoly of exporting tea to Libya was lost with the liberalization of trade in Libya. Therefore, LANLIB had to look for alternative revenue-generating activities. Action is being taken to recommence the poultry breeder farm at Mawatte with the introduction of two batches of layer and broiler parent batches to produce day-old chicks. The cattle bank which started with 25 animals has grown to 80 at present.

A total of 391,146 table eggs, 1.3 metric tons of chicken meat, 7,538 litres of milk, 13,184 pots of curd and 7,250 yoghurt cups were produced this year up to end September, 2010. All efforts are being taken to develop LANLIB activities to make it a profitable venture to service the livestock sector.

The Mahaweli Livestock Enterprises Company - MLE - commenced its operations in 1990 with the aim of improving the income of farmers in the Mahaweli area and is situated at Tambuttegama in the Anuradhapura District. This organization which was under the purview of the Mahaweli Ministry has now come under my Ministry. The main objective of this operation is to produce day-old broiler chicks, have an outgrower system of farmers to rear them and purchase back for processing. It also rears commercial broilers for processing. During 2010, it has issued 428,800 day-old broiler chicks and has produced 268 metric tons of poultry meat.

This Ministry has formulated the following programmes to accelerate livestock development to produce livestock products in meeting the nutritional requirements of the people. Importation of 15,000 high-yielding dairy animals to produce milk and to supply the much-needed breeding materials to the dairy farmers; development of 3,000 hectares of improved pasture and fodder lands to meet the increased feed requirement of the dairy cattle; establishment of an ultra-modern long life liquid milk processing plant at Mirigama replacing the 50-year old Milco plant at Narahenpita to increase the availability of liquid milk and popularize its consumption; introduce latest technologies to the Department of Animal Production and Health, National Livestock Development Board, Milco and Veterinary Research Institute to provide a better service to the farmer; establishment of livestock

1015 1016

resource development units with mini-laboratories in each of the divisional secretariat areas and strengthen its staff with more veterinary surgeons and technical staff to provide animal breeding, health and extension services at the farmers door step, and establishment of more poultry hatcheries at regional level and promote small entrepreneurs in poultry rearing to uplift the economic standards of family units and meet the demand for eggs and poultry meat.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I am glad to speak soon after the Deputy Minister for Industry and Commerce made his speech. I am glad to know that they intend developing the handloom industry. Being a person who was in the textile industry and the garment industry, I believe that handlooms of Sri Lanka are unique and they have to be developed in that unique way. In the '70s, handlooms were produced for the need of the local population and the products were sarees, sarongs, bedsheets and other products. But, with the importation being liberalized, the usage of local handlooms have vanished. So, you have to realize that you can develop the handloom industry by producing only unique products that will be useful for the society such as furnishing and other useful material. So, your focus has to be on better designing and when better products come out, that will enhance the living standards of the higher echelons who can afford to pay large sums to purchase the handloom products. They now cost much more than in the '70s as higher wages are paid to the workers.

Sir, the Ministry of Industry has been combined with the Ministry of Commerce. This is probably in keeping with the idea of developing industries servicing the exports from this country. So, that is a very positive move and I hope the promises made in the Budget would be kept so that the industry would develop. In the Budget, it was promised that industries having over 65 per cent of value addition will be brought under a concessionary income tax regime, which is from 15 to 10 per cent and for export industry, the taxes would be reduced from15 to 12 per cent and for large companies, the taxes would be reduced from 35 to 28 per cent.

Hon. Minister, there is one issue I would like you to reply, if you do not mind. The Export Development Board is under your Ministry. When there was a drop in the economy when the world economy was struggling, the Export Development Board announced the Export Development Reward Scheme. This was because the Government thought that the exports would be reduced as the world economy was having problems. So, they

envisaged a certain competitiveness to be added to the exports from Sri Lanka. They said rewards of 3 or 5 per cent of the total export value would be given to industries which can sustain their exports equal to their previous years exports in value during the year 2008 and 2009. This scheme was published and announced - ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Member, the Government has already paid Rs. 782 million in 2009. We have agreed to pay the balance from the 2011 Budget. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, Sir. That is the problem I am raising, Hon. Minister. In the year 2010 there was an allocation of Rs. 1,200 million. But, the 2011 Budget Estimates do not show any money allocated for this purpose. There is no allocation at all for the year 2011, whereas I understand that more than Rs. 1,200 million have to be paid to these exporters who reduced their prices to become more competitive and to maintain their export volume. After they did all that, if that promise is not kept, it will be very unfortunate. The industrialists and the businessmen will lose confidence in the promises made by the Government and due to that, all the incentives that you are offering will become null and void. It will not be useful for anybody. That is why I am asking you, Hon. Minister, why no allocation has been made for the next year? I appreciate your immediate response and your response that this would be paid. That gives some hope to the industrialists. But, at the same time, when there are no allocations made for the year 2011, it gives us a doubt.

We have been speaking in this House many times on the GSP Plus. I myself was a garment exporter and during that time, I know that we were restrained from exporting above the quota. But, however the quota itself was creating a market for our products. When the garment quotas were receiving a higher premium in India or in Hong Kong, those buyers used to come to Sri Lanka and purchase from us. From 2004, with the abolition of the quota system it has become more difficult to compete in the world market mainly because we are not backward integrated. We do not produce any of the raw materials that are needed for the export of garments. So, we had a disadvantage. Fortunately, the GSP programme gave us a special incentive to export to the European countries, where the difference in price between an exporter who did not have the GSP Plus benefit and us was 12 per cent because the tax duties paid by importers in Europe for products from non-GSP Plus countries was 12 per cent more than our products that were imported to Europe. As we have lost this advantage today, the quantity and the

1047 1048

value of exports of garments to Europe has dropped drastically. This is something that you have to correct. Hon. Minister, you are going to be held responsible for exports in addition to production in industries. As such, you have to persuade your Government to negotiate with the European Commission, if you are willing to negotiate on this issue at least today. Further, the garment industry is becoming more and more competitive. Other countries are using more advanced machinery. You have agreed in the Budget to reduce the cost of importing advanced machinery, which is a very positive move.

But, at the same time, the investor has to borrow at very high interest rates from the banks. The banks are now declaring profits of Rs. 3 to Rs. 6 billion for six months to nine months in the year 2010. They are making exorbitant profits. The Government reduced the rate of interest in 2008. Reduction in the rate of interest for lending immediately led to the reduction in the rate of interest for deposits. They have been reduced drastically and it remains low. But, the banks have now increased their lending rates and they are making exorbitant profits. In addition to the increase in the lending rates, these banks have also increased their charges to the customers. Every single transaction is charged by these banks and their cost of administration is almost covered by these charges alone.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) What do you mean? Do you mean the private banks or the State-owned banks?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I mean, all the banks. Actually, the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank are much better. But, the private banks are charging exorbitant charges for transactions. They cover their cost of service through these charges alone and all the additional amount and the premium they charge, which is above the borrowing rate, is pure profit to the bank.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) State banks are much better.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I agree with you. I always suggest to anybody to deal with state banks because they are more humane than the private banks. The private banks are now so motivated towards profit-making that their services are becoming more and more expensive. The Government has been

talking about an EXIM Bank which would lend to exporters on a concessionary basis. This has to come into being. You have to support the industry with lower rates of interest. Otherwise, it would be difficult to survive because you know that the interest rates in foreign countries are a fraction of the interest rates in Sri Lanka, maybe one-third. So, we have to compete on equal terms.

We do not have the advantage of the situation that we had during the quota regime. When we were exclusive, we had larger quotas than what we could service. That situation has changed today. This is the reason why I am calling upon the Hon. Minister to push for this EXIM Bank. Further, Hon. Minister, you are supporting the local textile industry by allowing them to supply to the armed forces, for school uniforms and other Government purchases. If it is really being produced in Sri Lanka and supplied to these institutions, it is worthwhile.

You are allowing a premium price of more than 50 per cent of the cost if you directly import those textiles to Sri Lanka. But, this extra 50 per cent that you pay is going into the pockets of the so-called local manufacturers who are not manufacturing locally but are importing the fabrics and selling them to institutions with high profits of up to about 50 per cent. They are hoodwinking you. The checks and balances that you have on the import of yarn are not sufficiently tight. The Textile Quota Board is part and parcel of this racket of importing fabrics at high premium and selling them as local products though they are not produced in this country. We are making only a few people rich without providing employment to those people who can be employed in these industries because we are supporting the so-called local manufacturers.

Thank you.

( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Sir, I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Minister of Finance and Planning, for presenting a timely and well-planned national Budget, aimed to create a conducive environment for an accelerated and sustainable development in Sri Lanka.

1075 1076

The Budget 2011 has been presented by the Government to achieve long-term economic benefits to the country by accelerating development activities along with public welfare programmes. It includes several incentives for the advancement of the industry and commerce sectors, which would ensure a higher contribution of the two sectors for the development of the country.

As the Minister of Industry and Commerce, I am happy that our Government has taken appropriate measures for creating a stable and predictable macro-economic environment within the country, which is favourable to the development of the two sectors. In spite of the global financial crisis which devastated the economies of many countries, Sri Lanka has been able to maintain a steady growth due to the appropriate fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies that were adopted by the Government.

Accordingly, as highlighted by the vision for the industrial sector under "Mahinda Chintana" - the national policy framework of Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka is presently focused on achieving a large base of vibrant and competitive world-class manufacturing industrial firms to generate higher economy, higher profitability and sustainable employment to offer widened opportunities for improved job quality and higher family income to alleviate poverty.

Under the "Mahinda Chintana: development framework, several long-term development activities have been introduced which aim to boost the economy of the country, emphasizing on economic growth through industrial development specially SMEs development and accelerating commercial activities.

The industrial sector which has maintained a steady growth of around 6.6 per cent per annum during the last decade, made a contribution of 29 per cent to the Gross Domestic Product while recording a 25 per cent of the countrys total labour force in 2009. The industrial sector is also a significant foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka which made a contribution of 75 per cent to the countrys export earnings in 2009, surpassing those of agriculture and services sectors.

Several measures have been introduced by the Budget 2011, to promote the local industrial sector taking into consideration the significance of its contribution to the economy. The import duties on several machinery, equipment and raw materials have been removed, enabling the local industries to reduce their cost of production, which would in turn make their products more competitive in the local and international markets.

In order to encourage local value addition, the income tax on industries with more than 65 per cent local value

addition, has been reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The Budget has made a special focus on several industry sub-sectors considering their potential for development.

As such, Customs duty on several automobile parts including vehicle body, radiator, et cetera has been reduced to promote the local automobile manufacturing and assembling industries. In order to facilitate apparel and footwear sectors, which make the highest contribution to the export earnings of Sri Lanka, they has been granted an exemption from Customs duty and VAT for the import of machinery and equipment to manufacture textiles, footwear and leather products. Customs duty on imported raw materials and packaging materials used in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry have been reduced or removed in order to encourage the manufacture of high quality pharmaceuticals locally at cheaper prices. The confectionary and bakery products manufacturing industry of Sri Lanka, which produces high quality products to the international and local markets has been rewarded by reducing or removing the Customs duty on several raw materials used in the industry.

The incentives offered by the Budget for innovation, research and development are very encouraging. This would promote research and development activities related to the industrial sector, increasing the quality of our products and enabling the same to penetrate into foreign markets, and to comply with international standards.

This would further enhance innovative activities, which my Ministry carries out, in collaboration with the academia and relevant stakeholders to improve the quality of our products and the productivity of the production processes. These tripartite activities include the Dye and Mould Facilitation and Development Centre, the rapid prototype machine developed by the University of Moratuwa and the Reference Pharmaceutical Analytical Laboratory established in the University of Colombo.

Further, my Ministry has taken many initiatives for the development of several industrial sub-sectors. This includes the preparation of a five-year plan for the period of 2011 to 2015 in consultation with the relevant stakeholders from the industrial sub-sectors, academia and the Government, which could be considered as a pathway to achieve the objectives laid down by the "Mahinda Chintana" industrial policy, consisting of work plans for the development of each priority industrial sub-sector.

Our Government has made a significant headway in the area of regional development through the Regional Industrial Estate Development Programme and the "Gamata Karmantha 300" Industrial Programme. At present, 26 industrial estates in various parts of the

1077 1078

[ ]

2010 04

country have been established providing more than 250 industrial units and 15,000 direct job opportunities. Six more industrial estates are under construction. They are scattered in regional areas and concentrated on the usage of local raw material, technology transfer, employment generation and investment promotion in rural areas. Furthermore, steps have been taken to establish two industrial estates in Mannar and Vavuniya Districts, especially focused on the development of the North and the East.

The Budget has made special emphasis in developing the Small and Medium Enterprise - SME - sector of the country, which is considered as the backbone of our economy. The SME sector accounts for over 90 per cent of all the industrial establishments of Sri Lanka and generates an employment of around 20 per cent. The development of the SME sector has been identified as the key to a balanced regional development and poverty alleviation.

In this context, the Government has taken steps to further develop the sector through several measures as proposed by the Budget mobilizing a sum of Rs. 5,000 million received from the World Bank to assist the SMEs in order to optimize their businesses. The unpaid tax liabilities up to March 2009 of all the enterprises with a turnover below Rs. 100 million, would be written off. In order to facilitate the SMEs which operate on subcontracting arrangements, the Economic Service Charge would be exempted from the 1st of January, 2011. A concessionary income tax rate of 10 per cent has been introduced for the SMEs. An investment of Rupees five billion for skills development activities of the SMEs has also been proposed.

The export sector of Sri Lanka which was able to resist the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, now contributes to nearly 17 per cent of the countrys GDP and has shown an encouraging improvement during the year 2010, registering a healthy growth rate of 10.5 per cent. In order to encourage the export sector of Sri Lanka, the Government has taken steps to reduce the income tax of export companies from 15 to 12 per cent. Taking into consideration the importance of the export sector to the economic growth of our country, my Ministry is continuously working towards the promotion of the export sector by way of an array of programmes pertaining to enhance the supply chain efficiency, promotion of export-oriented SMEs, trade facilitation, provision of trade information, e-commerce services and other supporting services, entrepreneurship and skills development during this period.

The main objective of these programmes was to enhance the competitiveness of the export sector enabling them to confront the global challenges. During the year 2010, Sri Lanka has expanded its foreign trade relations

through bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreements to which it is a party. It must be mentioned that the Fourth Trade Policy Review of the World Trade Organization was successfully concluded recently.

In order to improve market access for Sri Lankan exports, the Government has taken positive steps to negotiate the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement, which facilitate Sri Lanka to enhance our market access, particularly to two major markets, namely China and South Korea. It is noteworthy to mention that the exports to China under APTA was 53 per cent during the year 2009.

In addition, Sri Lanka is a party to bilateral trade agreements namely, India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement and Pakistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement. Also the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with USA is an arrangement under which the two countries meet annually to discuss all trade and investment-related issues. With a view to explore trade and investment opportunities between the two countries, on the sidelines of TIFA talks, a Public-Private Partnership Programme and a visit to Jaffna was organized for the visiting US Government officials and US companies based in US and Asia, in October, 2010.

Now, I would like to mention that the integration of the subjects of industry, commerce and export development under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has immensely improved the activities of all three sectors due to the closeness of their interrelations. Thus, through the collective efforts of the three sectors, we have been able to enhance the competitiveness of our industries, in local and international markets. In this context, my Ministry pledges to actively participate in the development objectives of the Government in our path towards making Sri Lanka, the "Wonder of Asia".

In conclusion, I wish to thank the Hon. Members of both sides of the House for their valuable comments made in the Debate today. At the same time, I wish to thank my Deputy Minister, the Secretary to the Ministry, Mr. Collure and the officials of the Ministry.

Thank you. [. . 2.31]

-EDRS - . What has happened to the Export Development Reward Scheme? Hon. Minister, I listened to the reply given by you but you did not explain the correct situation. I cannot give you time now to explain that. You can reply to that subsequently. Now, we know what this EDRS is. It was given in 2009 due to the global financial slow down. There were two criteria that the exporters had to meet to get 5 per cent EDRS - the Export Development Reward Scheme. The first one was that all exporters had to maintain 90 per cent of the value of the turnover in US Dollars, equivalent to the same quarter of the past year. The second one was that all exporters had to maintain the same number of employees based on a predetermined cut-off date prior to the implementation of the scheme.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Hon. Member, up to now, we have paid a sum of Rs. 782 million for 180 exporters under the EDRS scheme. We are going to pay Rs. 492 million by the 31st of December.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay. The Hon. Minister says that Rs. 782 million has been paid. I appreciate that but that is for the first quarter. I have the "Budget Estimates 2011" with me. The Hon. Minister says, " We are going to pay Rs. 492 million by the end of December". But, the second quarter payment is less than the first quarter payment. Let us even give you the benefit of the doubt. What about the third quarter? What about the fourth quarter? What is the estimate? How much have you allocated? Hon. Minister, you have allocated nothing; you have not allocated one cent for the EDRS. This is the truth. EDRS has no money. The exporters are not going to get the EDRS. So, what I want you is to please tell His Excellency the President to re-evaluate this and to give you about Rupees two or three billion to pay the EDRS. - [Interruption.] - ; . , . . [ ] . . [ ] Sir, according to the Historical Exchange Rates, the Sri Lankan Rupee has appreciated against the US Dollar during the period 1st of January, 2010 to 4th December, 2010 from 116.78 to 111.44. Also, the Sri Lankan Rupee has appreciated against the Euro for that same period from Rs. 167.79 to Rs. 147.87. So, if there is no depreciation of the currency when inflation is also taking place, your rupee is going to get overvalued. . , , . ? . , Harsha, it is difficult to compete. We have priced ourselves out of the market . That is true because the rupee is appreciating and there is so much of inflation. So, how do you compete?

You cannot hire and fire. There are problems. I want you to understand this not only from a humane point of view but also from a point of view of maintaining the jobs in this country. ? -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, please give me one more minute.

These problems have not been created by the industrialists, particularly the small and medium industrialists. They have been created by others, particularly by the Government. The industrialists had nothing to do with the GSP; the industrialists had nothing to do with the value of the rupee; the industrialists had nothing to do with the bank interest. So, I am urging you, Hon. Minister, to please consider the plight of these small and medium industrialists, particularly in the apparel sector because they work hard. I have many friends in the small and medium industry. I know how hard they work from morning to night. They travel around the country. They give hundreds and thousands of jobs but these people are in trouble. Please help them because if you do not help them, they will have to shut down their factories. If they shut down their factories, people will lose jobs their. So, please consider the plight of these people because it is really not their fault, and see how you can find some solution. Please tell His Excellency the President to allocate you sufficient money to pay EDRS for the remaining two quarters.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, it gives me great pleasure to participate in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms, and the Ministry of Justice.

Sir Winston Churchill is once supposed to have said that a countrys conscience can be judged by how it treats its prisoners. If that test is applied, most countries in the world will fail that test and we are no exception. The conditions in our prisons, particularly the fact of overcrowding, as the Hon. DEW Gunasekara just mentioned and the attendant problems that arise from there, are all indications of our conscience that we locked some people away and then forget about them. It is important to remind ourselves that this situation needs to be remedied, this situation needs to be changed - I am glad that there is a Ministry for Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms, not just for prisons but for prison reforms - and that is a task that all of us must join our hands and engage in because if prisons continue to be what they are, the rate of crime will increase. It will not reduce. The prison is no more a correction centre or a penitentiary; it is a place where a newcomer learns how to engage in crime. So, radical reforms must be undertaken and I would urge the new Minister, the Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera to do this

1131 1132

earnestly and I am sure he will have the support from a lot of people in that endeavour.

Talking about the people in prison, I must bring to your notice that just a little while ago the Hon. Praba Ganesan, a Government Member, informed this House that there are PTA detainees in prison for over 18 years. This is not something that I am saying. This was just stated an hour ago by a Government Member. I am aware that there are persons, almost 800 odd in number, who are in prisons without charges being framed for over 10 to 15 years and as the Hon. Praba Ganesan just said, some for over 18 years. I am not sure how this is possible. It obviously must be illegal because the Emergency Regulations that were amended on the 2nd of May this year, permits detention even in fiscal custody for a maximum period of six months. If they are on remand orders on a judicial order, then they ought to have been granted at least bail. I am quite aware that granting of bail to those who are alleged to have committed offence under the Emergency Regulations or under the PTA are restricted, and in the first case you need the sanction of the Attorney-General. But, the Attorney-General has consistently stated that he has given instructions that bail must not be refused. So, it is something unfathomable to keep people for such long periods, even if they are on judicial orders, under fiscal custody and not to have been granted bail.

The other matter is with regard to the persons who are called "rehabilitees" or persons who are supposed to have surrendered near the end of the war last year. I wish to draw the Hon. Ministers attention to that matter. The Hon. Minister of Justice is not present here at the moment. He has been present in the House right through from morning but he seems to have disappeared just when the Votes of his Ministry is under discussion. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) There, he comes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. I was drawing your attention, Hon. Minister of Justice, to the issue of the surrendees who are supposed to have surrendered and I say that Regulation 22 of the Emergency Regulations, which purports to legitimize the detention of surrendees is ultra vires. You know that under our system of law, no one can self-incriminate himself. In our law, we have confessions and any statement made to a police officer amounts to a confession. I am glad that the Minister, Hon. Susil Premajayantha who knows about this very well, having practised extensively in High Courts, is also present here. That is a general law. Of course, there is an exception in

the Prevention of Terrorism Act and also in the Emergency Regulations, which states that even if it amounts to a confession, under certain safeguards if it has been made to a police officer not below the rank of an ASP and so on, it can be led in evidence and still its voluntariness can be tested at a vior dire inquiry. Now, that being the case against somebody who is being indicted, how is it possible to detain a person even for the purpose of rehabilitation, upon his own confession, which is not tested in court; which is not tested for its voluntariness; which is not tested to see whether a responsible police officer or a person not below the rank of some grade has obtained that confession? A surrendee is necessarily somebody who is supposed to have confessed to something. So, that does not fit in with our law and I urge the Hon. Ministers who are present here to take a re-look at Section 22 of the Public Security Ordinance and make necessary adjustments. [Interruption.] - No, I am not saying that this is the case with regard to the 11,000 or these 8,000 surrendees who are now there; I am not saying that, but it is quite possible that there are some of them or even one of them, who is not really a surrendee, who has been made to sign something. Now, if there is a possibility, we must take all precautions to see that that does not happen.

Credit must be given to where it is due and I agree with the Hon. DEW Gunasekara to say that; particularly the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation, Brigadier Sudantha Ranasinghe and his team of people are doing a great job. I am not disputing that. I have seen some of those measures that have been taken. But, I am on a more fundamental issue as to how one determines that they are surrendees and I say that the legal regime governing this is not sound and needs to be looked at, all over again.

That brings me to the issue of the Hon. Attorney-General granting consent and I am sad to find yet again, the Department of Attorney-General being taken out of the institutions that come under the Ministry of Justice. This is not a healthy trend. There has been heavy criticism about this from all sections of our community when it was done last time and this trend continues and I would urge the Executive to remedy this.

Judges granting bail is the other matter. The judiciary must have the discretion in the issue of granting bail. The Attorney-General cannot exercise judicial function. There are many pronouncements with regard to this and therefore the provisions in the Emergency Regulations and the Prevention of Terrorism Act that seek to confer this judicial power of the Attorney-General, must be removed. Even where the minor judiciary is empowered to grant bail, it does not really happen; even when bail is granted, persons are unable to furnish bail. You know the perennial problem with regard to that. But, in the case of Emergency Regulations and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, I must say that the minor judiciary is very concerned and most of them would grant bail, particularly if a person has been in remand for too long. But, for that to

1133 1134

[ . . ]

2010 04

happen, for the minor judiciary to act independently, the right signals must come from above and unfortunately, those right signals have not been coming from above. It is a sad thing. The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya also mentioned that the judiciary is not seen by our country today to be independent. It is not their fault. I would urge the Executive to stop interfering with the judiciary; I would urge the Executive to stop putting the judiciary under this kind of pressure. It may not be right to state all the instances in the near past when the judiciary had been brought into such pressures, but you know what it is and you must not do that, because that is a - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

... , .

, ... , . Whereupon THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you can continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, it is my pleasure to continue my speech with you in the Chair, particularly on the subject of Justice - on a personal note, having known you as a fellow Attorney-at-Law, who practised along with me in Courts.

I was saying that the judiciary must not be pressurized by the Executive and I hope that trend stops. With regard to the LTTE surrendees, - as they are called, or rehabilitees, - and the previously arrested persons and persons who have been in remand for long period of time, I urge the Hon. Minister of Justice to make recommendation that a general amnesty be given. The war is over, a phase of reconciliation is being ushered and if we are to move towards that phase in good faith, several measures need to be taken, and one of the important ones of those is to grant amnesty to these persons. That will demonstrate the good faith of the Government towards these former combatants, if they have been former combatants.

With regard to another matter about the reconciliation, a Commission has been appointed, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, we read about it everyday in the newspapers. Todays newspapers carry an interview, which the Hon. Minister of External Affairs is supposed to have given in the UK. In that, whenever a

question has been asked of him about the accountability issue at the end of the war, he has referred to the LLRC. He is being repeatedly asked, "Will there be a probe into these allegations?" He says, we have appointed a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. So, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs has told the world that the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission will look into accountability issues. But, if you look at the mandate given to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, if you look at the Terms of Reference, there is nothing of that sort; there is nothing about accountability. The word "truth" does not even appear in the mandate. Without ascertainment of truth, without finding out what actually happened, how can there be accountability? So, we need to stop misleading the world in regard to this. We read about so many mothers and wives in their hundreds having given evidence before this Commission, who have said that their sons and their husbands surrendered to the security forces, but cannot be found today. They have gone missing. Everywhere this Commission sits, there are hundreds of women who queue up and give this evidence. There must be something done about that. There must be some investigation into that. Surely, the Government is not going to receive all of these evidence, and then only talk about reconciliation; you cannot talk of reconciliation without dealing with such intense issues of life and death.

So, I urge the Government - as you have done in extending the period of warrant of this Commission to May 2011 - to extend the mandate as well, which it does not have now, to actually investigate into allegations such as this, the evidence about which they have already heard and about which our Hon. Minister of External Affairs is going around announcing to the world, that this Commission will do that work. But, for that Commission to do that work, you need to extend the terms of its mandate. Lastly -

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala)

. . rose.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sorry? Say what you have to say. ( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) When you say "arbitration" -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, not arbitration. Your Minister says, accountability

1135 1136

issues will be dealt with by this Commission. Its Terms of Reference does not have it. So, I am saying, extend the Terms of Reference to cover what he is saying. That is all.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Precisely. They might have the same Commission appointed for the arbitration and the prosecution, both.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, this has nothing to do with arbitration. I am sorry. Even after I have repeated, I do not seem to have been understood. This is nothing about arbitration. Lastly, about free speech. Free speech is cherished by all of us. All of us want to have the right, the freedom of speech and expression. There is no dispute about that because that is a fundamental right and it is a cornerstone from which many other freedoms actually evolve.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member you have two minutes more. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am winding up. I said, "lastly". Therefore, as a country, as we insist on our right to freedom of speech on the soil of other countries, we must take a good look at the mirror ourselves. How has freedom of speech being treated in this country? How many journalists have been killed? How many are in exile today for writing what they believed in, what they knew to be true? It is good to look at ourselves internally before we preach to the world. Look to see whether we have dealt with accountability issues; whether we have been truthful, we have permitted the freedom of expression of all sections of our society; whether our judiciary actually is permitted to function independently before we go and challenge other systems in the world.

Thank you very much.

Thank you Madam. It is a great pleasure and privilege to speak when you are presiding. Coming all the way from the rural area of Ampara, we know how much you are committed to the MEP and also to the Government of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. We laud you.

The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act came into being through Act Nos. 44 of 1952, 34 of 1954, 24 of 1955 and Law 41 of 1935. It has a long history. I remember very vividly, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Chief Government Whip once said this is the only body - the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Advisory Board, Wakfs Board and Quazis Board - where an Act specifically prescribes by legislation that only Muslims should be appointed to these Boards. This stems from the Shariah Law. It is mentioned in the Holy Quran. It comes from that.

In Sri Lanka, Marriage laws are divided into: Marriages (General), Marriage and Divorce (Kandyan), Marriage and Divorce (Muslim). Under the last mentioned law, there are Muslim Registrars and Quazis. Muslim Registrars still come under the Ministry of Public Administration. Most appropriately and fortunately too, the Quazi Courts and the Board of Quazis are brought under the Ministry of Justice.

Over the years, there have been a lot of agitation, particularly about the functions of the Quazis in this country led by Mr. Yahya Hadjiar, President of the All-Ceylon Quazis Association of Ratnapura, and also well supported and always advocated by the former Head of the Quazi Board, Chairman, Mr. S.M.A. Jabbar, about their welfare. These Muslim Registrars are not very affluent people. You know, in the Eastern Province they go from town to town. They do not at times even carry a briefcase. I think their status should be raised.

I would like the Hon. Minister - at this moment I offer him my best wishes for he has joined the Government of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa - to carry forward the Mahinda Chintana, although he belongs to a separate entity, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. These are all progressive steps that we are witnessing around us these days.

The other day also, I explained in this House the functioning of the Quazi Courts. Now, the Quazi Courts come under the Minister of Justice - the Hon. Rauff Hakeem at the moment. I think he knows the law much better than us. Therefore, he will take appropriate action

to raise the standard of Quazis. They do not have offices. They do not have clerical hands. They sometimes operate - you will be surprised - in garages and in a portion of their houses which is not conducive for the dispensation of justice. Madam, according to the Islamic Shariah, Quazi Courts and the Muslim Marriages Act plays a very important role in our society - country. There is always a misconception that Muslims can marry four times or seven times. I do not know from where they discovered the number seven.

This is a translation of the Holy Quran. Sura An-Nisa, Verse 3, the English translation of which is in my hand now. What does it say, Surat 4, A-2-4. I think the Hon. Chief Whip will listen to this carefully. 3. If ye fear that ye shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two, or three, or four; But if ye fear that ye shall not Be able to deal justly (with them), Then only one, or That which your right hands possess. That will be more suitable, To prevent you From doing injustice"

I do not want to read the whole thing. The Arabic version is by Mohamed Yusuf Ali.

There is also a book here with me - Al- Ameen Law Report, Volume IV - 2010 - Dispensation of Justice as far as the Muslim Marriage and Divorce are concerned. The Hon. John Amaratunga should know it as he often appears in cases of - [Interruption.] Myself ? I still have only one and I believe it will be only one - Insha Allah!

This is what Mr. Shibly Aziz, President's Counsel says in his Message to this book. I quote:

The contribution of Mr. Ameen to the legal literature especially to the Islamic Jurisprudence should be welcomed and he must be

encouraged to further his contribution in this area and I recommend this volume to the legal practitioners, law students and those interested in this field..

This is a vast field. Books and books have been written in Sri Lanka on this subject. Muslim Law is executed according to the Shariah Law, adhering to the Sunnath-Wal-Jamaath practices.

"Having been a member of the Wakfs Tribunal and the Board of Quaziz and as a practitioner who has appeared in a wide array of cases involving Muslim law, he is eminently equipped to bring out this compilation of cases relating to the Muslim law of Marriage and Divorce, Wakfs and Mosques."

Therefore, Madam, I hope to bring a Private Members' Motion in this House soon to deliberate on very comprehensively. I hope we will have for it, the support of all sections of Members of this House.

Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to wind up the Debate on the Votes of my Ministry. At the very outset, I must thank His Excellency the President, for having placed the

1177 1178

[ ]

2010 04

all-important task of bearing the responsibility of the Minister in charge of justice, in me. I believe in this post-conflict period, which the country is looking forward to a speedy reconciliation among various peoples in this country, the task before my Ministry is an immense one. To discharge my duties to the best of my ability and with independence, I must profusely thank His Excellency the President for having placed the trust and confidence in me. I must also thank my predecessor, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne. Speaking before me, he outlined a few important tasks which he had already set in motion. I am fortunate enough to follow him in taking forward some of those projects and also to make improvements, so that we will be able to achieve the objectives for which this Ministry has been created.

Having said that, at the very outset, I seek your indulgence to digress for a moment to say a few words in tribute to a Colleague of mine, the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor, whom we laid to rest yesterday, the sole Member of Parliament for the Vanni District representing my party. His sudden death came as a rude shock to all of us. His dedication and devotion to the welfare of his people, almost the entirety of whom was composed of people who have been driven away by the LTTE almost 20 years ago, and his commitment to the ideals of our party were well exemplified by the thousands who gathered at Erukkalampiddy, Nagavilly in Puttalam last morning. We would like to share our grief with his young family and the people whom he represented.

Having said that, Mr. Chairman, as several previous speakers mentioned before, we have the important task of fulfilling the duty of getting rid of the large backlog of cases that is pending before several courts in this country. I propose to work closely with the Chief Justice, the Judicial Service Commission, the Attorney-Generals Department, the Police Department and also the Government Analysts Department, which come under my purview. To achieve this objective, I will try to instil some efficient system for disposing cases very expeditiously.

I am extremely pleased that His Excellency the President as the Finance Minister has identified the importance of this issue and therefore, has included a very handsome sum of almost Rs. 450 million to be spent over a period of three years to see that this task is fulfilled. There are several reasons for the inordinate delays in the legal system, and we may have to look at even the need to increase the number of judges at every level, if necessary, and I will certainly in a few days' time initiate a discussion with the Hon. Chief Justice, possibly along with the Attorney-General, to devise ways and means of expediting this objective that has been placed before us.

Having said that, I must now come to a point raised by my Friend, the learned Presidents Counsel and my

Colleague in the Opposition, a few weeks ago. He, in a very healthy manner, brought out criticism about my conduct when the amendment was sought to be moved at that time to increase the number of Court of Appeal Judges. He adverted to the fact that I was an impediment to that exercise. Maybe, my learned Friend had forgotten the rationale for my objection. My rationale was based on the fact that all original jurisdiction conferred in the Supreme Court must be taken away and placed at least in the Court of Appeal, so that we will be giving a chance to the aggrieved parties to appeal. Both, the fundamental rights jurisdiction under Article 126 and the jurisdiction conferred in the Supreme Court where Members of Parliament are expelled from Parliament under Article -

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Minister, If you permit me, I will just - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, I will conclude. You may explain later because I have very limited time. You will get another opportunity sometime later. My rationale was based on that. But, the Hon. Chief Justice at that time was so possessive of his original jurisdiction area that he was not willing to part with it and the entire country paid a big price. We know how the original jurisdiction of fundamental rights was to a certain extent used in a manner not befitting the way in which it should be used. So, now I am not there to criticize that conduct because the term of his office is over. The 10-year era of Sarath N. Silva court is over. Now, we are beginning a new era.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Minister, please forgive me for saying this.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Be very brief.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes, I will be very brief. When that amendment was brought to Parliament, it was referred to the Supreme Court for determination and it was approved by the Supreme Court. Therefore, the Hon. Minister knew very well that once it has come after the determination of the Supreme Court and when you were making a suggestion, that we must include the fundamental rights jurisdiction to the Eighteenth Amendment and that this House has no power to do it. That was an invalid point taken up. That is what I wanted to highlight.

1179 1180

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) At the Bill stage itself, I took up the issue with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and even with the Government Members. At the Party Leaders' Meeting too, I raised this issue of the need because the aggrieved parties are left with absolutely no remedy. If the original and final court is going to be the Supreme Court, today the aggrieved parties have no way to challenge. So, that was the only reason, because as Members of the legislature we have our right to make legislation. We must do it. We must try and introduce reforms in a manner which could bring relief to the general public who come before the courts of law.

I think the Hon. Member in an indirect manner said, to atone for my so-called mistake, that I must try to devise ways and means to see that the after-effects of that decision should not impinge on the expedition of cases before the courts of law. I think there are several ways in which we can do that. I propose to discuss that with the Hon. Chief Justice. I do agree that after the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill and the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill were passed, now we have several Provincial High Courts that are also dealing with civil appellate jurisdiction. This has now resulted in the Supreme Court being saddled with large number of "leave to appeal" applications pertaining to civil appeals from the high courts. There are almost 40 odd high courts exercising this jurisdiction. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to look at creating one or two permanent civil appellate divisions in the Supreme Court. But of course, in the Constitution we have this limitation of only 11 Judges in the Supreme Court including the Chief Justice.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) There are vacancies in the Supreme Court pending for 18 months. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is left to His Excellency the President, to decide quickly on those appointments. Of course, there is a provision in the Constitution to create ad hoc Supreme Court Judges from the Court of Appeal, if possible. But, then, the Court of Appeal too has a severe problem. We have to look at the reasons why the backlog has still not been expeditiously disposed of though the former Chief Justice expected it. When the Civil Appellate High Courts were set up, there was up to 1996, about 11 to 12 years stagnation of briefs before the Court of Appeal and what he devised was, to leave appeals from 1996 to 2000 in the Court of Appeal and from 2001 onwards to refer the appeals to the Provincial High Courts. What has happened now is that despite that decision to allow the Court of

Appeal to try and expeditiously dispose those briefs of that four-year period,, we find only about - I do not know, he is a regular practitioner before the superior courts, he will know - ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have to wind up in two minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) My whole time has been used in dealing with this particular issue raised by the Hon. Member. Anyway, Sir, there are various methods through which we can devise ways and means of using the funds that have been allocated for this great purpose and we will very quickly try and devise those methods. We will have a discussion even with the Bar Association and other related institutions to see that this is dealt with in a very efficient manner. There are several courthouses that we propose to open in the next year, mainly in the North and the East, particularly in the North. The Hon. Azwer raised the issue of the Quazi Courts. Now, the Quazi Court system has been strengthened. Divisional Board of Quazi Sittings are being arranged in Puttalam and Kalmunai and in other areas to get rid of this issue of litigants having to travel to Colombo to redress their grievances. Travelling expenses and lodging facilities for the Members of the Board of Quazi have been arranged through my predecessor, for which I must thank him. Even the Hon. Milinda Moragoda, the predecessor to the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne, too, should be thanked for having taken certain progressive steps. Therefore, I am fortunate to follow the Ministers who had been very diligently and conscientiously working to improve the conditions for lawyers, litigants and the judges, so that the purpose of this Ministry would be better fulfilled.

Having said that, finally, I might also add that my Secretary, Mr. Suhada K. Gamlath, who was a college mate of mine when I was in the Law College, and who has served several previous Ministers, is a very experienced member of the Official Bar who understands the problems in the judicial service and therefore, I am fortunate to have his service. I must thank him and also the Additional Secretary, Mrs. Kamalini de Silva, who is also a person with a long track record in this Ministry, the Government Analyst and the other officials, for coming here to assist us in this Debate. I look forward to working with them to improve the standards, which are looked forward to, by the President when he appointed me in charge of this Ministry.

Thank you very much.
