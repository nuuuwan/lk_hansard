Mr. Speaker, I now rise to move the Vote of Condolence on the death of an illustrious Member of Parliament from the Jaffna District who passed away in Montreal, Canada in December 2006, having rendered yeoman service to his people and countrymen.

Having had his early education at Ananda College, Colombo, the Hon. Vaithyanathar Navaratnam entered Law College thereafter and started his life as an Attorney-at-Law. He displayed eminence as a lawyer when practising in Colombo and Jaffna and appeared for very important cases in the highest courts of the Island. He was a renowned lawyer, who entered the political arena in his youth. He was a pioneer member of the Federal Party and contested the General Election in 1952. Indeed, he was among the seven candidates from the party who led the hustings at that election. Although he was not able to succeed at that election, he continued his political career and became the Secretary-General of the Federal Party in 1961. As the Secretary-General of the Federal Party, he rendered a great service towards the development and expansion of the party. At another occasion, he functioned as the Joint Treasurer of the party as well.

The Hon. Navaratnam was a close associate of the respected politician father of the Federal Party, the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam and indeed played a prominent role in the formulation of the famous Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact that reverberated over the political scene of the country for nearly five decades. In 1956, he organized a march to Trincomalee from Jaffna with a view to highlighting the grievances of the Tamil people in our country. It was one of the successful protests of the Tamil people of the day. Thereafter he played a prominent role in the Satyagraha movement organized by the Federal Party.

After the untimely death of the Hon. V.A. Kandiah who represented the Kayts Electorate in Parliament in 1963, the Hon. Navaratnam got the opportunity of

contesting the by-election held and was able to get elected with a majority of over 10,000 votes. Thus, he entered Parliament for the first time in 1963. At the subsequent General Election held in 1965, he was again able to get elected for the second time.

In 1968, the Hon. Navaratnam was expelled from the Federal Party and later on engaged in politics as an independent member. Thereafter he formed the Tamil Autonomous Party and became its leader. He contested the General Election in 1970 as a member of that party but was unsuccessful.

On two different occasions, the Hon. Navaratnam had earned international awards for his role as a politician and later on in the '80s, he settled down in Montreal, Canada having left the Island. He was a loving father of five children and continued his political activities while resident in Canada as well. As a loving leader of the people of the North of Sri Lanka and his countrymen, he served them until his death in December 2006 at the grand old age of 97 years.

Mr. Speaker, I would request you to convey the deep condolences of this House to the relatives of the late Hon. Navaratnam.
