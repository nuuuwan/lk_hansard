() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) . That has no bearing on this subject. - [Interruption.] No, not at all. I know that.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Can you tell us?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I will tell you. When the challenge of Macau came, the Singaporean Government had to take a decision because they depend so much on traffic into their country. As you know, the number of visitors, the arrivals to Singapore is many times more than their local population. As a result, the Government of Singapore decided to go in for casino development within their country. For that, they selected the Fullerton area. You know the Fullerton Hotel which was earlier the Post Office of Singapore. I do not want to take too much of time on this but -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) If you want to know the geography of Singapore, you admit that you are not - [Interruption.] Tell us, how many casinos have they permitted?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) For the moment two, but -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Macau has only two casinos !

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, the full development of the Fullerton area is not yet complete. It is still being done.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am talking about the Act of Parliament.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes. Any Act of Parliament can be changed. [Interruption.] But, what I am saying is the principle of it. So, what is there to laugh? -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The Finance Minister of Singapore - [Interruption.] We have to go only by the principal Act.

1173 1174

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, what is the principle of the present Act? - ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Minister, you know about the Act but we do not know. What is the name of the Act? Give the name of the Act. We do not know, but you know. Tell us. Then, we can look at it and reply you. Since you have studied it and we have not, kindly give us the name of the Act. [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is not a quiz contest. I must tell you that I have been very courteous when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition. I do not want to offend him. But, I want to say that he must raise the level of thinking. [Interruption.] That is the whole problem with him. You always peck on some petty little things. That is why you are in such a big mess today. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Minister, this is relevant because - [Interruption.]

ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SRI LANKAN CRICKETERS BY INTERNATIONAL MEDIA

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to move the Adjournment Motion.

I move:

Sri Lankan cricket has not only achieved world fame by winning the World Cup but also earned the reputation of being the worlds most friendliest cricketing nation bringing honour to our nation.

It is a foregone conclusion that Sri Lanka is the favourite to win the World Cup in 2011.

This has resulted in certain countries with vested interest, trying to character assassinate some of our popular cricketers by accusing them of taking money and fixing matches.

Therefore the Government must take every possible action by standing firm with our cricketers even to the extent of taking defamatory action against international media personnel who are spreading such diabolical, baseless, uncorroborated lies affecting the credibility and the reputation of our cricketers and the nation at large.

Sir, you would see that the reason for bringing this Adjournment Motion is very clearly to protect the good name of our country, the cricketers as well as to ensure that honour is brought to our cricketers. You would see,

Sir, that there is an international conspiracy to demotivate our cricketers at a time when we are heading towards winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup. There are many unscrupulous elements who are trying to tarnish not only the image of our country, but also of our cricketers who are now household names. Therefore, it is my intention to get the full backing of the Government to protect the interest of each cricketer. Sir, I would not mention the names of cricketers who were character-assassinated because it is unfair by them and the Captain of the Sri Lankan Cricket Team, Kumar Sangakkara has very categorically said that he has full confidence in the entire team. There were certain baseless accusations made in the British press that had been refuted, and the captain standing by his fellow cricketers had shown team solidarity. Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dilhara Fernando and Lasith Malinga officially complained that there had been certain things that had been done to disgrace the cricketers of Sri Lanka as well as the cricketing nation. These cricketers have brought great fame to the country. Unfortunately, my Colleague, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, the person who brought glory to Sri Lanka through cricket, is not here today but I have shared some views with him. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, a former Minister of Sports, would second my Motion and the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana who takes up these matters on a regular basis, would also speak.

We find that the Ministry of Sports makes statements in a lackadaisical manner. We have a very amiable and a very active Minister. . . , . , . . , . . . , . . . , . . .

As you know, in the UK the Pakistani Cricket Team has been accused and they counter-accused the Sri Lankan Cricket Team, which is not fair. Likewise, the Indian Press has taken to task. They are the formidable competitors who could come into the finals of the World Cup in 2011 and Sri

1293 1294

Lanka as the winner, God willing. Keeping this in mind, I think it is absolutely essential that the Minister, the Government and the country as a whole, take necessary action in order to protect our cricket team. Let me run you down memory lane on certain matters that have led to this particular issue. As you know, our cricketers are world famous; they are household names today. The Government had the enthusiasm today to incorporate the Gaming (Special Provisions) Bill. Likewise, the same attitude should be disposed towards our cricketers and the cricketing fame has got to be protected. Today, the British Press has criticized them and there has been no defence of the cricketers. The Asian countries such as Pakistan and India have mentioned this. All I could say is, in the spirit of sports this type of a thing must be stopped. There is the necessity to take up certain matters beyond what is read. Speaking to the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunaga, he said, Ravi, this is being done keeping the World Cup 2011 in mind. If you character-assassinate two or three cricketers, they will have this recurring in their minds and thereby their productivity can be affected. Why does the Government not take the British Press - press , press ? Channel 4 , . . . . match fix . . . .

, . . . . . . ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, are you quoting any particular incident? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, I will mention the country that has accused but I do not want to name the accused because it will be unfair

for that particular cricketer. If you take Zimbabwe, they basically have mentioned the name of one of our very popular young cricketers. They mention that he has done certain things and as a result court action has been taken and if he comes to that particular area, his passport will be impounded. Apparently, this is completely baseless. The cricket team itself has got together and asked as to why such things are being done. Mr. Muttiah Muralitharan, our famous world record holder has said, ICC should impose life ban on fixers. Why is he saying that? He says that because the British Press has accused the Pakistani cricketers for fixing a Test cricket match about an year ago. They go back into history. If it was something which happened last week, then you have rectification within that particular period. But, when you refer to something that has happened one year ago, there is no justification or any remedial action that can be taken.

Likewise, in New Delhi, the AFP reports the same thing; fixing a match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. I point out these matters just for abundance of caution. I do not want to have a tensed situation created between countries that are taking up these issues. I brought it up owing to the fact that the media has come forward and is trying to tarnish the image of Sri Lanka. I want to stop at that particular issue. I am sure you will understand the reason why I do not want to go beyond. ( ) (The Presiding Member) I thought the local Press has given enough publicity. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, no. I must say that the local Press has not done anything to discredit our cricketers. I am sure there are no traitors within the system. But, our media should have taken much more proactive action by taking the British Press and the Pakistani Press on. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Do you mean the Board of Control for Cricket? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That should have been the official action by the Cricket Board. What I say is, the media should have taken the foreign media on, on behalf of Sri Lanka. This is the Sri Lankan media. So, when the name of the cricketers are being tarnished, the image of Sri Lanka is also being tarnished. Our media should have looked into this when the British Press said that such an issue was there. Likewise, the foreign match-fixing was also there. I am just quoting certain things mentioned in Centurion on September 15 (PTI). It states:

1295 1296

[ ]

2010 10

British Tabloid 'News of the World' claimed they were involved in bowling deliberate no-balls during the fourth Test at Lord's between England and Pakistan.

I am quoting a different country because I do not want to bring Sri Lanka into this picture. Now, here they have mentioned that Murali has mentioned in the same media, which reflected Sri Lanka, that such players should be taken to task. Now, why is he saying that? He has said that the cricketers go through a strenuous task to bring Sri Lanka to a particular point to the best of their ability and if there is wild allegation, it should be knocked out, but if there is genuine allegation, a life ban should be imposed because that will deter such matters in future.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I think Hon. Member, I must bring to your notice that we are also playing a twenty-twenty game in the House now, because we have only twenty minutes for each side. Your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, I will certainly wind up. I thought we had thirty minutes.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is reduced to twenty.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, I am sorry. In that case, how many minutes left?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Your time is almost up because the Hon. (Dr. Jayalath) Jayawardena and Hon. Lakshman Kiriella are also due to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will certainly just take a minute more and then give way to my honourable Colleagues to complete it.

( ) (The Presiding Member) All right.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) One article also refers to Mohammad Aamir of Pakistan, who has basically said how he was dragged into

this particular spot-fixing and he also says that the other Asian countries are also doing this and questions as to why only he and his country is being accused. I am referring to him. Now, these are the areas we have to be careful. When they have problems, they do not need to bring Sri Lankan cricketers into this situation. That is why - , . . , .

, the National State Assembly, Act No. 25 of 1973, the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 and also the Sports Act, No. 47 of 1993 ensures that the sports bodies are also brought before the Committee on Public Enterprises - COPE. Now, this is not happening. , . . Board of Control for Cricket - - . . , . . , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . The next speaker is the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to second this Motion. Firstly, I would like to remind the House that we are on the threshold of the World Cup and particularly after the success in Australia, we are favourites to win the World Cup or at least enter the final. One thing I wish to mention is, I have read articles in Sri Lankan papers - without mentioning names - it appears that some members of the media are being used by certain disgruntled cricketers; by people who have not been able to get themselves selected. You can see that certain media personnel try to target some of our star players in the cricket team. In fact, - I read an article once - I was surprised that an English newspaper had accused a top Sri

1297 1298

Lankan cricketer, when he was touring Zimbabwe, of having an affair with a female. Of course the name was not mentioned but it was very clear as to who the Sri Lankan cricketer was. So, I think there is an effort on the part of cricketers who have not got selected, to get hold of media people and target certain cricketers so that they can get back into the Cricket Team. You may have seen the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga speaking after we won the one-day series. He categorically said that this same team that is touring Australia should be the team that should play in the World Cup because they had delivered. So, I hope the media will act responsibly. They have a very important role in the coming weeks and months. They should not be used by certain interested parties to tarnish the image of our cricketers.

Match-fixing is a worldwide phenomenon. Yesterday, we saw the Pakistan wicket keeper fleeing Dubai and going to London to escape match-fixers. So, this is a worldwide phenomenon. But, I think by and large, our cricketers have been very clean. The ICC has held several inquiries but our cricketers have always come out clean.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I think the international teams have accepted that the Sri Lankan Cricket Team is a very disciplined team in the world.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes, they have come out clean unlike the famous South African Cricket Captain who had 70 accounts.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is Cronje. He was proved guilty also.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes, that was by the South African Commission. I think it was called the King Commission. When they inquired into the entire episode of the South African cricket and match fixing, they found that he had 70 accounts. But, our cricketers, by and large, have come out clean. I think they are now well-paid. But, it is important that the Minister of Sports should take steps to safeguard our cricketers in the coming months, because one article might spoil their entire focus on cricket.

So, with those words, I wish to thank the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake for bringing this timely Motion.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, ex-Minister of Sports. The next speaker is the Hon. Felix Perera. ( ) (The Hon. Felix Perera) . .

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. The Hon. Rajiva Wijesinghe, you have five minutes.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you, Sir. I am delighted at this opportunity to contribute to this Adjournment Debate, because for once the Hon. Member for Colombo, who peppers this House with 1,001 Motions on every conceivable subject under the sun, has picked up one of interest to the country at large. Cricket can be seen as a metaphor for life and we need to admire and encourage the efforts of young sportsmen like him as they hit all round the wicket, hoping that at least once or twice they will actually connect with the ball.

But, there is another reason to take this Motion seriously. The leadership of the United National Party has for a long time assumed that life is like a Royal-Thomian Match, and blowing horns is an effective substitute for intelligent discussion. It is possible therefore, that in order to introduce a fundamental policy change, they may have decided to test the waters by talking about cricket. If that is the case, there is another reason for congratulating him on this Motion, because it may be a way of announcing a sea change in the attitude that he has evinced towards Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans in the past. In effect, what he is proposing today is total loyalty to his country, unyielding support for our cricketers against any allegations that might be made against them. He does not encourage journalists who wish to denigrate our cricketers to continue to put pressure on them; he does not call for an independent international inquiry into the allegations. He says with no beating about the bush that we should, on the grounds that such allegations are part of a vicious plot designed to stop us winning the World Club, reject them absolutely.

I am not sure myself that we should adopt such a position without making clear our reasons for rejecting allegations that we believe to be false. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order please! We are playing cricket, not playing music. [Interruption.] Disturbances in the cricket field.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) This afternoon, Mr. Presiding Member, I was interviewed by Al Jazeera, which suggested that the Sri Lankan Government wanted to close debate on allegations against our forces. My point was that we do not want to close debate, we welcome debate, but debate must be based on facts, not just on blind assertions. We do not want the nonsensical substitutes for evidence of people like Philip Alston, who claimed that the moving leg of someone supposed to have been dead, could have be explained by drunkenness.

But, Mr. Presiding Member, we rely on facts and argument to prove our case. Thus, Mr. Muralitharan, when he was treated out outrageously by some desperate Australians, had his arm put in splints and made sure that the visual evidence established his innocence. Following his example, I am sure that all our cricketers would welcome investigation of any incident on which a basis for investigation is available. I do not think they will want simple denial based purely on patriotism, knowing that blind patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel. Though we have no scoundrels in this House, it is surely strange that those who are not particularly patriotic, when it comes to national interest, should suddenly get worked up when it comes to rather trivial allegations about cricket. That perhaps should prompt the conclusion that we should be careful in acting on the advice that the mover of this Motion gives. It is possible that the reports conveyed about this debate to the international community, will suggest that the Sri Lankan Parliament is determined to dismiss all allegations and claim that anyone who raises such allegations is biased. We might be accused of shooting the messenger instead of properly reading the message.

We have seen previously sudden changes in midstream, as when the constitutional changes proposed in 2000 were rejected on racist grounds. Even though the Hon. Member for Colombo may be sincere in his affection for our cricketers, others in his party may think this yet another way of scoring brownie points with their funders and turn this Motion on its head. A family tree will be constructed to prove that any cricketer against whom any allegation was made is related to His Excellency the President. The Cricket Board will be accused of cooking the statistics, and leaving out really deserving players who happened to have been Opposition candidates. India and Pakistan will be vilified for supporting us, whereas the real world out there had been united in condemnation.

We should therefore be careful, Mr. Presiding Member. While it would be nice to encourage the Hon. Member for Colombo if his conversion is genuine, we should reiterate our position that, while we will always resist unfair allegations and unfair condemnation, particularly if it is intended to prevent us from achieving a

just victory for our people as happened recently during the struggle against terrorism, we will consider any allegation on its merits provided it is made with precision and accompanying evidence. The commitment and sense of propriety of Mr. Muralitharan are better examples for us, as laid out in his recent interview, than big match histrionics of the type we have just heard.

Thank you.
