The Sri Lankan economy grew by a higher rate of 7.8 per cent during the first half of 2010 compared to the growth of 1.9 per cent recorded during the corresponding period of 2009. The improved performance in all key sectors of the economy contributed towards this growth. The Agriculture sector, mainly driven by the higher growth in the production of paddy, tea, and minor export crops and better performance in the fisheries sector grew by 7.2 per cent. The Industry sector grew by 8.0 per cent with improved performance in mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity, gas and water, and construction sectors. The factory industry, the largest sub-sector of the manufacturing sector, registered a higher growth which was mainly reflected in domestic market oriented industries, such as food and beverages, while export market oriented industries recovered during this period. The services sector recorded a growth of 7.8 per cent in the first half of 2010 supported by higher contribution from domestic and foreign trade, transportation, tourism and financial services.

The above mentioned report further states, I quote:

Paddy production in the 2009/2010 Maha season increased by 10.3 per cent to 2.63 million metric tons compared to the corresponding season of the last year. The increase in production was largely a result of the adequate rainfall supported by continuation of the fertilizer subsidy ....

....together with higher contribution from the Eastern and the Northern provinces. The total newly cultivated paddy lands in the Northern Provinces were 4,424 hectares in the 2009/2010 Maha season which included 1,406 hectares in the Jaffna district and 2,741 hectares in the Manner district.

A calculated genocide is taking place in Sri Lanka and this Budget clearly expresses the intention of this regime to accelerate the agenda of genocide. Hon. Presiding Member, the international legal definition of the crime of genocide is found in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948.

Article 2 describes two elements of the crime of genocide. One is the mental element meaning the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such.

The second is the physical element. What are the physical elements? "Killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group".

Article 3 describes five punishable forms of crime. They are genocide, conspiracy, incitement, attempt and complicity.

"The town held only about 10,000 people, all of whom have fled the area since the government forces began to pound the area using Kfir jets and artillery from across the bay ......."

"Still apart from the chaos resulting from search operations that followed the capture of the town, the damage to civilian establishments including schools and hospitals appear to be minimal."

It further states, I quote:

"Until the people return to Sampur, the military victory will be ground captured, meaningless politically even if it is of crucial importance from a defence perspective. For what is land if not barren, without people?"

"Let everybody live happily and achieve peace I know not any other way".

This philosophy undernotes the Action Plan of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. So, everything is pointing towards a revived economy - a great renaissance - which spells a bright future for our country.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in presenting the Budget 2011 in this hallowed House to this august Assembly yesterday, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa evoked nostalgic memories amidst an emotions-packed aura, which pervaded this House.

His Excellency the Presidents Address reminded one of the days of his father - one of the founder members of the SLFP, former Deputy Speaker of Parliament and then a Minister, the Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa, who adorned the sacred sanctums of Parliament. And, prior to that, of his paternal uncle, the Hon. D.M. Rajapaksa, who was the State Councillor for Hambantota.

Now, we see the second and the third generation with His Excellency at the helm of this blessed Isle, when the 30-year menace of terrorism was totally defeated in May, 2009. We see over here his elder brother, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa in the hot seat of the Hon. Speaker. You see his younger brother, Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the Defence Secretary, directly prosecuting the war on terrorism, emerging like a phoenix from the ashes, a stupendous success. We see another brother, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa leading from the front in the massive Economic Development Programme ahead. ,

' ' . ,

' '

; - -

. We also see the third generation in the young Member of Parliament here in this House, the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, catching up so splendidly in the footsteps of his illustrious ancestors. What a unique and united family group committed to serve the people of this nation!

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

285 286

, , , . . .

.It is indeed a record and a rare coincidence to see such a united effort in a group of family members committed towards uplifting this once beleaguered nation from the throes of terrorism to one geared to be the "Wonder of Asia".

His Excellency the Presidents ascendancy to this lofty post began from the distant paddies of Mademulana, deep down South in Ruhuna, where his ancestors literally lived in the paddy-rich fields. It is a significant family with all its members living in unity and conformity of purpose. , . , , . . . .

His Excellency the President has earned the goodwill and support of the entire international Muslim community. I should mention here Iran, Saudi Arabia Kuwait, Pakistan, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Turkey and even Iraq - you name it and those countries are with us. When international imperialism was trying to devour this nation at a very crucial stage, when annihilation of this nation stared in your face, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa stepped in and saved the nation, me and you, Mr. Swaminathan. I was with His Excellency the President during his last UN visit to meet the Secretary-General of the UN. We had direct talks and what did Ban Ki-moon say? Showering praise on His Excellency the President, he said that His Excellency was mature enough to take over the leadership of Asia. Who said that in our presence? It was Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This should ring in the ears of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and others who are leading their people astray.

Today, Muslims in the North and the East are beneficiaries of the lands, cattle and paddy fields of which they had been robbed. Muslims who were summarily evicted from their homes by the terrorists are now moving back to their legitimate abodes after three decades. Do you remember the Muslims who were murdered by terrorists in Kattankudy Mosque, in Eravur, in Alinchipathana and in Palliyagodella? As a result, I must say that over 70 per cent of the Muslims are now in support of His Excellencys development plan clearly spelt out in "Mahinda Chintana".

His Excellency intervened to ensure that a greater number of Muslims were able to perform the Haj this year. At times, he has spoken even to His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia and that is how the goodwill has been built up among those countries and ours. After 30 years we saw the resettlement of Muslims in Mannar and

we now hear the Azan - Call for Prayer - from the Mosques of Jaffna. Sir, you know that from Kilinochchi and from other places, for 30 years there has been no Call for Azan. Who created this peaceful and religious atmosphere? Is it not the President of this country? Touch your conscience, hearts and see; you will feel it. This Azan is being now announced over the Tannoy in the Mosques in Jaffna and other places in the North.

That is why the Muslim world has taken serious note of the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa. He has proved to the world that he is a man of not only words, but a man of deed. He would take everyone together. He has always said, This is not the nation or the country of Sinhalese; this is the country of the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Malays, the Burgers, the up-country Tamils and all the others. That is the philosophy and the clear vision of the President of this country.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Azwer, you have five more minutes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, Sir. I will wind up within five minutes.

Thirty seven bridges were constructed in the East. It was led by the Minister of Economic Development, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. It is the "Revival of the East" - "

". Sir, remember this. When the war was being waged, 37 bridges were built from Pulmoddai to Pottuvil. What can we not do now? What can Mahinda Rajapaksa, Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa not do now? - [Interruption.] . . .

What a significant feat! Now, the East is flourishing. The splendid road network is expanding day by day. Tourism is booming with the influx of foreigners thronging this Isle on vacation. Blue-chip investors are involved in stiff competition to make their mark over here and contribute towards the ongoing development.

Sir, I urge the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the coterie of Members on his side, small section though they are, who are envious of all these positive developments, to put aside their jealousy and ill-will and join hands with His Excellencys programme for the progress and growth of this nation.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan. You have 20 minutes. [. . 5.20]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President presented the Budget for 2011 yesterday and today we heard many speakers on this subject and many points of view were expressed. This Debate on the Budget in a continuing form and different opinions have been given and ultimately the Government in power is responsible for the enforcement of the principles of the Budget.

Firstly, I wish to bring to the notice of the Deputy Speaker that there is an Act called the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act. This Act is to ensure

331 332

that the finance strategy of the Government is based on the principles of responsible fiscal management to facilitate public scrutiny of fiscal policy and performance and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

Section 3 of the Act outlines the fiscal strategy of the Government. Paragraph A refers to the reduction of Government debt to prudent levels by ensuring that the Budget Deficit at the end of 2006 shall not exceed 5 per cent of the estimated GDP and to ensure that such levels be maintained thereafter. For the year 2009, the Budget Deficit was 9.9 per cent and for the year 2010, it was 8 per cent and for 2011, it is about 6.8 per cent.

Section 3(f) states that ensuring at the end of the financial year commencing on 1st of January, 2006 the total liabilities of the Government (including the external debt and the current exchange rates) do not exceed 85 per cent of the GDP, the estimated gross for the financial year and at the end of the financial year; commencing on 1st of January, 2013, the total liabilities of the Government do not exceed 60 per cent of the estimated GDP for the financial year. Presently, it is 70 per cent exceeding the estimated GDP.

The total decrease of the GDP should be less than 60 per cent in the year 2013. The Fiscal Management Report published under this Act on the 29th of June 2010, has reported that the total debt will be 70 per cent of the GDP in the year 2013. The Government has to explain why they are in breach of the said conditions that were laid down by this Act. The citizens of the country, if they are in breach of any provisions of the law, are liable to be indicted. I am not trying to say that the Government should be liable for it. But, there should be a plausible reply given by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning to this House why certain conditions that were laid down by this Act have not been fulfilled, and it is the responsibility of the citizens of this country to know about it.

For the year 2011, the budget allocation for the Ministry of Defence is about Rs. 215 billion. In the year 2010, the Ministry of Defence Budget was Rs. 202 billion. Even after the war is over, there is no reason for the Defence Budget to be increased by Rs. 13 billion for this year.

His Excellency the President had ensured the citizens of this country that he will give a salary increase of a minimum of Rs. 2,500 per month to Public servants. Taking into consideration the increase of the Defence Budget of about Rs. 13 billion, a salary increase of an additional Rs. 1,000 could be given to the Public servants and it will cost the Government about Rs. 1.2 billion per month. Presently, the Government has provided a special allowance equivalent to 5 per cent of the basic salary from January 2011. The current cost of living allowance

of Rs. 5,250 per month will be increased to Rs. 5,850 per month, which is Rs. 600. So, taking all these into consideration, an ordinary Public servant who is drawing about Rs. 10,000 to 12,000 will get an increase of about Rs. 1,200. But, if this Defence Budget had been reduced, I am sure, as assured by His Excellency the President to this country in the manifesto, that Rs. 2,500 could have been given to the Public servants.

So, these are matters that we have to take into consideration. The unnecessary waste in this country should be forbidden. Whatever the credibility of this Government, it should be answerable to the society and to the citizens of this country.

As per today, the Gross Domestic Product remains as 5.5 trillion. In the year 2011, the total debt of the Government will be about 4.3 trillion. The debt interest cost would be about Rs. 350 billion. If you calculate the interest factor, it will amount to about 7.5 to 8 per cent. In the circumstances, the interest payable by the Government for the loans incurred is far excessive of the lending rates applicable, and is an exorbitant amount when compared to the normal lending rates in the world. So, we have to take into consideration why we are paying double the interest rate than what a country or any lending institution would normally offer. The Government of Sri Lanka is paying an interest rate double the amount than what is normally applicable to lending institutions.

As per the Appropriation Bill 2011, if you take the details of the Recurrent Expenditure and Capital Expenditure for the Hambantota District Secretariat, there is a difference of Rs. 59,325,000 than in the year 2010. The Hambantota District Secretariat has been allocated Rs. 437,475,000. The District Secretariat of Jaffna has been allocated Rs. 395,500,000. That is about Rs. 37,375,000 more than last year. The District Secretariat of Mullaitivu has been allocated Rs. 132,625,000 which is about Rs. 33,230,000 more than last year. The Kilinochchi District Secretariat has been allocated Rs. 145,000,000 which has a difference of Rs. 22,800,000 more than last year. The District Secretariat of Nuwara Eliya has been allocated about Rs. 328,850,000. That is about Rs. 34,250,000 less than last year. I do not know what the reason for that is. The Puttlam District Secretariat also has been allocated Rs. 465, 850,000 which is less than in the year 2010. +

Taking this into consideration, we see that as far as the displaced people in Jaffna are concerned, they have not been properly looked after. His Excellency the President said that about 225,000 displaced people have been given accommodation and proper shelter, and only about 13,000 or 16,000 people are yet to be resettled. I think it is the duty of this Government to exactly tell this august Assembly, as well as the citizens of this country, how they have resettled them because we are not sure and there are differences of opinion. People have seen that the shelters provided for the resettled people are not

333 334

[ . . ]

2010 23

permanent shelters or they cannot be assessed as permanent shelters. They just have four pillars, a tin shed and maybe some cement right around it. That is not going to serve the 225,000 people who have been displaced by this war; who have lost everything in their hand. Therefore, the Government should have some sort of an expenditure plan for the displaced people and should be answerable to this august Assembly as to how these displaced people have been looked after.

() ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne - Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development) Have you seen it? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I have seen it. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Every member of the family is being provided Rs. 500 each day to construct their own houses.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) If I am correct, they have been given dry rations to the value of Rs. 85.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) The people who are occupying the houses told me. Everybody is being paid Rs. 500 to construct houses on their own.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you, Hon. Minister. I am not trying to dispute it and I do not want to start a debate on that issue. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) But, they are being provided dry rations daily up to now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you very much. I am only asking the Hon. Prime Minister to table to this Assembly, the amount spent on the buildings, how many people have been provided with buildings, the nature of the vocation they

will be provided for the future and the other facilities they have provided for the resettled people. Then, I will certainly accept the same, and that should be a public pronouncement to the people of this country.

There was a tax holiday under Section 24C of the Inland Revenue Act - a five-year tax holiday for investments over Rs. 30 million for any business investment in the Eastern Province. Now, this proposal has been restricted to profit specific businesses as per the Budget presented yesterday. That means that investments already made under this provision may not enjoy the tax holiday if it does not come into the category of specific businesses. The supporting documents and technical notes of the Budget Speech contains this provision. It is with great regret we note that this tax holiday provision was not granted to any investment made to the Northern Province. There is no tax holiday at all to the Northern Province up to date. If that is the intention of the Government, there could be no proper development in the Northern Province and no specific investment would be made if the tax holiday is not applicable to the Northern Province.

His Excellency the President stated, as I mentioned earlier, about the displaced people. They have been housed in different places and many of the resettled people have not been settled in their places of origin. The Government should make available the correct statistics and inform this august Assembly. Even after two years of the cessation of the war, the citizens of this country have not been informed officially the true statistics of resettlement.

There is another question I wish to ask from the Hon. Minister of Finance. There was a project called Uthuru Vasantham, which is also called Vaddakin Vasantham - the Northern Vasantham. About Rs. 3.5 billion was allocated for the year 2009 for building 80,000 houses. Each house was roughly estimated to cost about Rs, 43,000. I wish to find out if the Hon. Minister of Finance could let us know whether these 80,000 houses were built and where they have been built as per the Budget Proposal for the year 2009.

The Foreign Direct Investment for the first six months of the year 2010 was Rs. 250 billion. For the first six months of the year 2009, Foreign Direct Investment was Rs. 300 billion. There is a difference of Rs. 50 billion. Therefore, there seems to be no confidence of investors to invest in Sri Lanka. A frontier country like Sri Lanka, presently from the point of view of tourism, is progressing. Yes, I accept that it is progressing. The hotels are full and you cannot get even rooms. I totally agree with him. The Government is intending to increase the number of tourists to five-fold in the near future. The present cost of rooms is estimated to be about Rs. 25 million. If the investment climate of Sri Lanka is not stable, the entire investment of tourist hotels may not be

335 336

forthcoming. The Government should have a stable policy of investment. As mentioned earlier, if retrospective laws are brought to curtail investment such as what happened in the Eastern Province, it will not support investment. There were exemptions and tax holidays announced earlier for investments over Rs. 30 million but now there is going to be a retrospective effect of law to curtail that. If such curtailment is brought, there will be no -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, there is no curtailment of any investment. I heard that you mentioned that the Northern Province is not included. No, it is included. The Northern Province was not liberated at the time we gazetted including the North and the East. All the benefits have been given now. Even now, already five major investors have come. Brandix, MSL and all are there. So, do not worry.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, Sir, what I am trying to say is, investment that was made here -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) It is wrong information. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, it is not wrong information. Excuse me; it is from the supporting documents and technical notes. It is mentioned here. If necessary, I can make a further clarification to the Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, if you have any investor who needs any concession, send him to me. I will see to that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you, Sir. Then, it is also noteworthy to mention that the Budget Proposals have a provision to write-off unpaid tax liabilities up to 31st of March 2009 of all enterprises with a turnover below Rs. 100 million. This provision is contrary to the Supreme Court Order that was made earlier when the amnesty, which was introduced by the United National Party, was available and it was held by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court Order of the earlier amnesty provided to

the taxpayers was unconstitutional, in what context could this provision to write off unpaid tax liability, be enforceable?

It is also noteworthy to mention that there are provisions to be made under Section 170 (7) of the Inland Revenue Act where the Court shall order the appellant taxpayer to pay the full tax in dispute or part thereof pending the determination of the appeal in a court of law. This provision is extremely unsatisfactory whereas when an appeal is pending in a court of law regarding a tax dispute, the appellant taxpayer will have to pay the Department the amount of tax that is due.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) No, that is, after the appeal is rejected. It is very clear. His Excellency the President has made -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) It says that it will be refunded. It is correct, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That means, these taxpayers want to drag this. We cannot allow them to do that. They just go and file cases. If they invest that money in a bank, they will get the interest. We cannot allow that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Then, there must be some provision to say that the appealable commission is the final authority - [Interruption.] But, it does not say that. It says, If the appeal is dismissed, the money will be repaid. I totally agree on that.

Then, there is also a provision of a penal liability introduced for auditors and tax practitioners who misuse statutory provision or any Act or regulation by deliberate misinterpretation of any provisions therein. This provision is completely unethical and unwarranted from a professional point of view. A tax practitioner can interpret the law as far as the tax practice is concerned in whatever way he wishes, and cannot be said that if by chance he interprets it wrongly, he is under a penal liability.- [Interruption.] It may have deterrent effects but this is a completely unethical provision.

Therefore, my position is that in such situation, the main idea is to see that the people are benefited. Even the salary increase that has been given does not comply with the requirements of the Manifesto, the assurance given by His Excellency the President. So, it is my

earnest request as well as the request of the United National Party, that there should be well-being for the people at large; the cost of living is high. Also, the people in this country should have a definite base on which the entire system of taxation and the penal provisions and the liabilities of this country are based. Thank you very much Sir.
