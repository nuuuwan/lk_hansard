(iii) The Governments of Sri Lanka and India had agreed to negotiate the CEPA with the objective of further enhancing the economic relations between the two countries. The CEPA encompasses trading in goods, services and investments. The existing ISFTA will become the Goods Chapter of the CEPA with further improvements. Until 2008, there were 13 rounds of negotiations held on the proposed CEPA. During these negotiations, the two countries agreed to take into account asymmetries of the two economies in all elements of negotiations and progressive and sequencing of liberalization.

(iv) The Government has initiated a wide consultation process with the stakeholders on CEPA. The negotiations on certain sections of CEPA have not been concluded as yet. The decisions on CEPA will be made after consultations with stakeholders and once negotiations are concluded.

(v) The negotiations on certain sections of CEPA have not been concluded. The decision on signing will be made once the stakeholder consultations and negotiations are concluded.

(vi) Negotiations with India on CEPA are conducted at Commerce Secretary level and technical level discussions are conducted at Director-General level. Representatives from all the relevant agencies such as the Department of Commerce, Board of Investment, Sri Lanka Customs, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Finance and Planning, Ministry of External Affairs, Sri Lanka Export Development Board, Sri Lanka Tea Board, Attorney Generals Department, Department of Fisheries, Department of Animal Production and Health, Department of Inland Revenue, Department of Ayurveda and Institute of Policy Studies are included in the negotiating team.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Minister. My first Supplementary Question is regarding the negotiating team that you mentioned. One of the most critical elements missing in the negotiating team is the Chambers. Why do you not include also the Chambers, which is a pivotal element of bringing in benefits to the country through the CEPA, into the negotiating team without saying it is a fait accompli.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) We had a meeting in my Ministry. Dr. Jayasundara also participated in that. Representatives of all the Chambers too participated in that meeting. In future also we will summon them and get their useful ideas.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know that you are trying to do your very best. My second Supplementary Question is about the Free Trade Agreement with India. It was initiated and pushed forward with a lot of vigour. Unfortunately, the exports from Sri Lanka to India are fast reducing and the imports from India to Sri Lanka are fast increasing. So, the parity has gone back to 1 : 10 which was the ratio in the year 2000, when we inherited the Government at that moment. As an active Minister, would you try to change this to where we have more exports and less imports so that the balance of payment advantage would be to Sri Lanka?

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Hon. Member, we are working on that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My third Supplementary Question is this. Hon. Minister, - I am sure of your keenness - is the Government as keen as you are to ensure that the CEPA is concluded because before an Indian delegation comes, the CEPA comes into discussion. After they go back, it will get back on the back-burner. So, if by chance the Government is interested in doing more business with India, protecting our domestic industry, Hon. Minister, why can you not decide whether the CEPA is good, bad or is going forward or not?

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Okay. Thank you.

( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) , , , .

Mr. Chairman, His Excellency the Presidents Mahinda Chintana -Vision for the Future emphasizes very strongly on the need for strengthening the traditional industries and Small and Medium Enterprises with a view to enhance income of the rural masses, create self-employment opportunities, contribute to increase the regional GDP and to reduce poverty and regional income disparities. The small and medium industries are considered as the backbone of our economy.

The vision of my Ministry is to upgrade, expand and strengthen the traditional industries, small and medium enterprises and make them large, dynamic and vibrant economic sectors that can contribute significantly to the Gross Domestic Product by producing world-class high economic value-added products that can compete both locally and internationally and generate sustainable employment and income to the rural poor.

In terms of the vision, my Ministry is actively involved in formulation of policies and programmes and directing the implementation of such policies and programmes in the area of handicraft sector, Small and Medium Industries -SMIs - and Small and Medium Enterprises - SMEs -, the Elephant Pass Saltern, palmyrah sector and manufacturing of fishnets. The institutions that come under the purview of my Ministry are: the Industrial Development Board, the National Craft Council, the National Design Centre, Palmyrah Development Board, Elephant Pass Saltern and the North Sea Limited.

As the Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, my Ministry will play a leading role in the country by mobilizing the small entrepreneurs engaged in traditional industries, handicrafts and small industries and enterprises scattered all over the island and by contributing towards the "Mahinda Chintana" vision of transforming Sri Lanka as the "Emerging Wonder of

333 334

Asia". The Ministry has developed its implementation plan to meet the expectations of Mahinda Chintana -Vision for the Future. The strategies and actions identified by the Ministry to enhance the traditional industries and small enterprise development with the view to uplift the rural economy are set out in the Annual Report.

With regard to establishment of industrial estates, one of the important strategies in the establishment and strengthening of industrial estates is to provide space for small and medium scale rural industries. There are 17 industrial estates operating under the purview of my Ministry and managed by the Industrial Development Board. These industrial estates have provided working space with infrastructure to many small and medium scale rural industries at a concessionary rental.

Regarding the transfer of technical know-how, the Industrial Development Board, which comes under the purview of my Ministry provides technical training programme to small and medium scale rural industries and assists them in accessing modern technology. Such programmes are conducted not only to the existing rural industrialists, but also to the potential newcomers who are interested in the rural industries. Moreover, training programmes are conducted to enhance the skills and capabilities of rural youth, not only to undertake rural industries, but also to become entrepreneurs in diverse fields.

Under the National Production Village Development Programme, the rural industries were supported with technology, machinery and equipment and also with Common Service Centres to assist the rural industrialists with access to market, technology and other facilities. In this regard, many Common Service Centres were established in rural villages to upgrade the rural industrial clusters such as pottery, coir, wood-based products, masks, rush and reed-based products, handicrafts, palmyrah, kitul products, cane et cetera. Moreover, machineries and equipment were given to the beneficiaries and 63 Common Service Centres have been established of which 23 are currently operational and the balance will be put into operation soon.

My Ministry with the support of Industrial Development Board, National Crafts Council, National Design Centre and Palmyrah Development Board organized national, provincial and district level exhibitions and trade fairs to promote the market access of rural industrial products.

At such exhibitions, trade stalls are given to producers at concessionary rate. This helps producers to realize the full benefit rather than exploitation by intermediaries. These exhibitions and trade fairs also help the rural industrialists to establish contacts with buyers on a sustainable basis. Moreover, my Ministry has initiated to

establish Lakkam Sales Centres to provide display and sales facilities on major road routes.

My Ministry also conducts assessment of the various products developed by the rural industrialists and craftsmen. The Ministry with the support of the Industrial Development Board and National Crafts Council identifies best- performing industrialists and craftsmen and provide them with medals, awards, cash prizes and certificates to recognize their creative skills and talents. Such award ceremonies are conducted annually at the national level and thus help to attract a new generation of youths into the traditional industries.

Mr. Chairman, now I would like to say a few words about the introduction of innovative market-oriented new designs. My Ministry, with the support of the National Design Centre helps rural industrialists and craftsmen to develop demand-driven, market-oriented innovative products by introducing new designs. Four hundred prototype new designs have been developed and are being introduced to craftsmen.

My Ministry purchases scrap materials such as brass, copper, rubber, compound et cetera and issues them to SMIs and SMEs. The Cess Fund and other facilities will be optimally utilized in a very transparent manner for this purpose.

With regard to popularization of palmyrah and kitul products, my Ministry works with the Palmyrah Development Board to popularize palmyrah products and to promote palmyrah-based value-added products and handicrafts. Similarly, my Ministry also has a special programme to promote and develop kitul industry production and activities such as the issuance of identity cards, introduction of Kasper technology to increase yield, promotion of kitul treacle by strengthening quality standards, working in close collaboration with the Sri Lanka Standard Institute and other related bodies.

Moreover, my Ministry also promotes the cultivation of raw materials such as mahogany, teak, rush and reed, kaduru, cane et cetera. Further, scrap metals and other materials are purchased from Government institutions and given to the small and medium industrialists and handicraftsmen at a concessionary price. My Ministry also helps and facilitates small industrialists to gain access to credit facilities. Cost of finance, high rates of interests, tedious loan procedures, availability of concessionary credit, emphasis on collaterals by banks and financial institutions remain a challenge. The existing financial institutions need to take a proactive role in helping local enterprises. My Ministry will address these issues and assist SMEs to prepare feasibility reports and obtain concessionary credit.

Now, coming to the Atchuveli Industrial Estate, I would like to state that in the early 1970s, the IDB set up an industrial estate in Atchuveli, Jaffna and it had 36

335 336

[ ]

2010 01

factory units with successful SMEs. The building and infrastructure has been completely destroyed due to the conflict which prevailed. It is proposed to re-establish the Atchuveli Industrial Estate in Jaffna which has 65 acres of land.

The Government of India has given assistance in the form of grants to the value of Rs. 235 million to reactivate the 25-acre industrial estate in Atchuveli, Jaffna. The Government of Sri Lanka has provided counterpart funds to the value of Rs. 45 million and these amounts have been included in the Budget Estimates of 2011 of my Ministry. The work plan has been already finalized and a Project Steering Committee has been appointed. Action has been taken for site clearing and fencing of the industrial estate with chain link. Preparation of tender documents is also in progress. The Indian Government grant is to be utilized for developing the infrastructure of the industrial estate, which includes access roads, internal roads, storm water drainage, water supply scheme with treatment plant, power supply, sewerage scheme and administrative unit.

Preliminary studies, investigations, environmental studies, land surveying, boundary establishment, fencing and land clearing are to be taken up under the domestic component of the project. The Cabinet of Ministers have approved the project, and the Budget for 2011 has made provision to the value of Rs. 280 million of which Rs. 235 million is Indian foreign grant and Rs. 45 million is the Government of Sri Lanka's domestic funds.

It is expected to put the Industrial Estate into full operation by 2012. It is expected to mobilize textiles and garments, plastic products, leather products, food processing et cetera and other small and medium industries in the Industrial Estate. Over 2000 employment opportunities will be granted through the Industrial Estate.

A Project Steering Committee with representation of the Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, the Ministry of Finance and Planning and the High Commission of India has been established to provide guidance and directions for the project implementation.The Implementation Agency of the project includes the Industrial Development Board and the Board of Investment.

Under the handicraft sector, the traditional handicraft sector has 19 clusters which includes clay, coir and fibre, jute, cane, metal, jewellery, masks, batik, lace work, wood-based products, leather et cetera. The medium term focus of the Ministry will be to strengthen the handicraft villages; provide support in the form of raw material; access to credit; market-oriented designs and product development; transfer of technology and craftsmanship; training and capacity development of craftsmen; quality improvement; marketing network through national and provincial exhibitions and trade fairs; recognition of

craftsmen through medals, cash prizes, awards and certificates; creation of craft villages, museums and centres; and link with the tourism sector to make this a dynamic and vibrant sector. Moreover, a web-based information system will be developed to link the handicraft sector and the handicraft villages with tourism sector.

With regard to national exhibitions and trade fairs, my Ministry has organized a four-day National Exhibition and Trade Fair on Handicrafts and Small Industries at the Sirimavo Bandaranayake Exhibition Centre at BMICH from 22nd to 25th July, 2010 which was inaugurated by His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This national exhibition displayed over 1,200 handicraft items and over 700 craftsmen from 19 handicraft clusters and over 90 small medium industrialists with over 1,000 products from 14 clusters participated to showcase their creative products, processes, skills and talents. There were over 156 trade stalls given to producers to sell their products. Of this 68 stalls for handicrafts and 68 stalls for SMIs. Stalls were only given to producers and not to the middlemen. This gave an opportunity for the people to buy directly from the producers.

Similarly the National Award Ceremony on Handicrafts was held on 25th November, 2010 in "Janakalakendra", Battaramulla to recognize and appreciate the high standards of craftsmanship and entrepreneurial skills of our National Winners - the craftsmen. Hon. Prime Minister, D.M. Jayaratne participated as the Chief Guest. Similarly the award ceremony for the small medium industrialists has been scheduled on 3rd December, 2010.

Further, the Palmyrah Industry is also a very important industry that comes under the purview of my Ministry. Under the "Mahinda Chintana" 10-year Development Framework, it is planned to increase the number of palmyrah plants from the current level of 11 million to 20 million by 2016. The Ministry will also develop and promote Palmyrah Industry as a significant contributor to the national GDP with focus on increasing the new plantations, product development and research and development.

It is also proposed to expand the "Katpaham" sales outlets, popularize palmyrah products; enhance the palmyrah handicraft production; pulp production, soft drink including cordials, jaggery, fibre production; and other value added production such as pinatu, pathaneer, tuber flour, Palmyrah jam et cetera; conduct exhibitions and trade fairs and marketing arrangements to popularize the palmyrah products; re-establishment of Kaithady Research Institute and to provide employment and income to the dependents of this sector.

The Palmyrah Research Institute in Jaffna was deserted after 1995 due to prevailed civil unrest. The Government of India has provided under its small grant

337 338

assistance scheme with modern laboratory equipments to strengthen and re-establish the Kaithady Palmyrah Research Institute at a cost of Rs. 70.5 million. With this support the palmyrah products are expected to be popularized in the domestic and overseas markets by promoting value added and new products.

The reactivation of the abandoned Elephant Pass Salterns in the North will contribute to achieve a national salt production level of at least 60,000 to 80,000 Mt. in the medium term and provide employment opportunities to 2000 people. I understand that this is the largest saltern in the Island. The demining process has been accelerated. A preliminary feasibility study has been conducted. We intend to reactivate the Elephant Pass Saltern in 2011.

My Ministry will closely work with other line Ministries, Provincial Councils, Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industries, private sector, media personal and other development partners to fulfil the achievement of its mission.

The total Budget of my Ministry is Rs. 1000 million of which Rs. 502 million is for recurrent and Rs. 498 million is for capital. My Ministry will ensure that every rupee of the Budget is spent in a results-oriented manner to meet the vision of the national development plan.

Let me very specially thank His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the guidance and directions provided.

Finally, let me also express my sincere appreciation for the contribution made by the Deputy Minister, Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake, Secretary, Adviser, Additional Secretary and Staff of my Ministry, Chairmen of all the institutions that come under the purview of my Ministry.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) What is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My point of Order is this. According to Standing Order Nos. 5 and 84, there has been a serious breach of privilege and violation of the Constitution and I crave your indulgence to bring this to your notice. Now, Sir, we have taken oaths under the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution states that: "I, ...... do solemnly declare and affirm/swear that I will faithfully perform the duties and discharge the functions of the office of Member of Parliament in accordance with

353 354

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the law, and that I will be faithful to the Republic of Sri Lanka and that I will do the best of my ability uphold and defend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka". The Seventh Schedule states that: I, ........ do solemnly declare and affirm/swear that I will uphold and defend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and that I will not, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka.

Sir, the LTTE outfit is a banned outfit. Now, a Member of this Parliament goes to London, joins the LTTE group and shouts slogans against the Government. This is a clear violation of the oaths we have taken under the Constitution.

Dr. Jayalath Jayawardana is a person who is a Member of our Parliament and also a member of the United National Party. It concerns our privilege also. Therefore, serious note must be taken of this and appropriate action taken.

I would also like to ask the United National Party and its Leader, "Is this the position of your party?" When His Excellency the President arrives at the Heathrow Airport to make a historic speech at the Oxford Union, this Member of Parliament goes there and violates the Constitution by joining a banned outfit. Of course, he has got the treatment -

2010.12.01 "" .

" "

. , .

The media reports that "The protesters had chased Jayalath Jayawardana and Wickramabahu from the scene calling them traitors. Now, Sir, even those banned parties have called these people traitors. So, he has violated the Constitution. It is a breach of Privilege. [Interruption.] Please hold an investigation into this incident. It has been given publicity in the media throughout.

( ) (The Chairman) Your point of Order has been noted. I will take it up with the Hon. Speaker and give an Order in due course.

( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! . Hon. Harsha de Silva, you continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion of the 2011 Budget. Today, I wish to make some observations on the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development. I am glad that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is here to participate in this Discussion.

Starting out this morning, we read in the newspapers that the inflation number for the month of November has just come and I noticed that it has increased to 7 per cent, which is tenfold from the lowest point, which was 0.7 per cent and we see a clear indication that the inflation is on the rise. So, I would urge you to take measures to ensure that inflation is kept at a single digit. I am not saying that 7 per cent is high. We have seen the inflation rate at 29.9 per cent, but still what we say is, prices are continuously increasing.

Last Sunday, the respected The Sunday Times columnist who writes under the pseudonym, the "Economist", has quite rightly found fault with the quality of budget debates of late. On page 16 of "The Sunday Times" of 28th November 2010, he states, I quote :

"It is the essence of parliamentary democracy that the accountability of public expenditure must be under parliamentary control. Parliament; and especially the Opposition are the watch dogs of the public finances. The Governments majority in Parliament should not be allowed to dilute the quality of the Budget debate or render the accountability of Parliament of the management of public finances a futile exercise.

- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, we have Government Members in front of us; we have Government Members behind us. So, the whole point is, these people must let the debate take place. Do not shout us down. Let us have this debate.- [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) - [ ]

( ) (The Chairman) You continue, Hon. Member.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, if this Hon. Minister will allow me to speak, I can speak.

( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I wish to state to this person that we, as a responsible Opposition, are constantly attempting to make meaningful contributions to the Debate. I am trying to make a meaningful contribution to the Debate and this is such an attempt, if you let me speak. - [Interruption.] "Bullshit" is not a word that should be used in this House.-[Interruption.]

357 358

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Members. , . Hon. Member, you continue. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Four months back, on 5th July, during the mini-Budget Debate for the year 2010, I spoke on the most important Ministry in post-war Sri Lanka. I said that I will continue to make our critical observations known and it is in that spirit that I plan to make my observations today.

In that speech of 5th July, I made out three points. Firstly, I said, "be pragmatic. Do not be stuck in old theories. Now, that we are at a crossroads, choose the correct path, not necessarily the most popular path". Secondly, I pointed to the economic growth and development of India and a number of smaller nations that follow pragmatic market-oriented policies. I showed that they were growing at high rates, even as much as 10 per cent on a sustainable basis. I pointed out that this growth was being fuelled by the market economy where the State played an increasingly lesser role while giving more and more opportunities to the private sector. Thirdly, I also pointed to the case of Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez has been systematically increasing the Governments control of the economy by nationalizing firms across the board, be it in cement, steel or petroleum. The situation today in Venezuela is even worse than it was several months ago. Currently their growth rate is only 1.9 per cent, Inflation is 31 per cent and the jobless rate is 8.4 per cent. This is a country that is flush with expensive oil.

The second point I made was, I questioned whether the "Mahinda Chintana" was the same as "Basil Chintana" or if there were two different policies. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I pointed out that President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in his "Mahinda Chintana" that deficit reduction per se was not prudent fiscal management and that he would not follow such a policy. But, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa spoke of the need for deficit reduction. I said it did not matter if this was due to IMF pressure or not but that we, as the UNP, agreed that the budget deficit, the primary cause for the crippling debt, must be reduced by cutting unwanted expenditure and reducing the largest component of expenditure in the recurrent budget, which is the interest payment. We agreed with him. So, my observation was that there seemed to be a conflict in the basic argument of

"who does what" and that must be sorted out if we are to have a clear policy going forward. This, I said was critical in the foundation for a possible sustainable growth path, which was in a model that was not realistic given the absolute financial crisis the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government was, and continue to be in, where the tax revenue is insufficient to meet the debt servicing now almost on an annual basis.

The third point I made was, I questioned the Governments plan to attract Foreign Direct Investments. I warned that the FDI was falling and that unless drastic policy changes were done, the job was going to be difficult and hoped that urgent steps would be taken in this regard.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva is raising a point of Order. point of Order ?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) . . .

( ) (The Chairman) That is not a point of Order. , .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) In fact, even though it was minor point, I pointed out to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa that as a first step, to at least develop an error-free website for the Ministry of Economic Development. I said foreign investors would consider the website of the Ministry of Economic Development as the first point of contact with Sri Lanka since it was responsible for almost all the development projects in this country. I asked, "why do we have pretty receptionists at our offices or telephone operators with sweet voices?" with no offence intended. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) On a more serious note, I spoke of the need to remove the barricades placed on the road to FDI. Now, I want to

359 360

2010 01

question, Mr. Chairman, where are we today with respect to these three points I raised? When I found that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa was going to make the concluding speech, I was excited to come and listen to him articulate his plans for development of Sri Lanka. In fact, I brought a notebook, papers and all that and sat here to listen to his entire speech. Like His Excellency the President gave Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa the driving seat in the terrorist war with General Sarath Fonseka as the key implementer, he has given the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa the driving seat in the economic war, I believe with Dr. P.B. Jayasundera and Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal -I do not know who takes precedence - as the key implementer. Yes, he made a speech. He made a long, long speech. I think it is longer than the Budget Speech itself. But, what was the substance of that speech? I was disappointed that it fell below expectations; not that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa did not try, nor was it his ability to put the points across, but it was the absolute lack of internal consistency that made that explanation confusing.

Let me take a few examples of the lack of internal consistency in the Governments plans to win the economic war from the perspective of the three points that I raised in my previous speech. Which road is this, " ", which I think means, free market economy with a national focus, as explained by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa taking? Is it going the India or China way or is it going the Venezuela, or might I add, even the Zimbabwe way, which really surprised me.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Sri Lanka way.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I will explain that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) While saying private investments are sorely needed for the development effort and as in the case of India and many other fast growing nations, he spoke of what he called nationalizations of previously private enterprises as in the case of Venezuela as a great thing to the applause of the many seat-warming Members of Government.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) What is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa has taken oaths in this House to protect the territorial integrity of the country and he is 100 per cent a Sri Lankan. - [ ] So, you cannot say a Member of the House is going the China way. . . China way , Russia way .

( ) (The Chairman) That is noted. Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, you continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I was talking about how the Members of the Government applauded when the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa spoke of nationalization. He said that the policy of the UNP was to first bankrupt the State-owned enterprises, then privatize them and finally give them away to foreigners. Not that it matters but the recently nationalized companies were privatized not by the UNP but their own PA, for instance, SriLankan Airlines and Shell Gas Lanka Limited, but the signal is, in economic terms, full of noise. There are a lot of distortions that make the signal unheard. So, what exactly is the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa saying? Is nationalization the way forward, or is private enterprise the way forward? So, will this Government make space available for private participation in development, be it infrastructure or otherwise or will the Government take to do them all?

Let us look at the five-hub concept in this light, supposedly, the new and improved "Mahinda Chintana". Where are investment opportunities in the maritime hub for private developers? All harbours are being developed by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government including the fisheries harbours except of course the Colombo South Asia Gateway Terminal, which was agreed upon much earlier.

Where are the investment opportunities in the aviation hub? All airports are built by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government as against the Indian case of the modern and sophisticated airports in places like New Delhi,

361 362

Hyderabad or Bangalore, to name just a few. But, what about space for airline operations as opposed to the numerous airlines criss-crossing the Indian skies? Forget about the horrendously loss making SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka. What about domestic airlines? The Sri Lanka Air Force has taken over that space.

What about the power and energy hub? I could not believe my ears when I heard this and read about it in the newspapers that the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka had said that from now on, it will be the Ceylon Electricity Board that will develop mini-hydros in the country and there will be no more private mini-hydros. What on earth are you saying? Where is competition in the power sector, the cornerstone of a market economy?

What about the commercial and the financial hub? Okay, just as I thought we were seeing some movement on relaxing the capital account for free movement of cash in and out within limits, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa dropped a bombshell. This is what he said. He said: '' - , - , , .'' Now, is this being progressive? Why do we have to go to His Excellency the President and get his approval to invest in -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That is in the Constitution and in the law. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Right, thank you. So, if you want to create a financial hub, all what I am saying is - ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) , . . [ ] .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) ,- [ ] ,- [ ]

( ) (The Chairman) . . Hon. Member, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) . So, all I am asking is, "Is this progressive or not progressive?" You had better think about it. I am here to make some criticisms.

While I agree that money laundering must be eradicated and those engaged in international pyramid scams must be taken to court and dealt with, misuse of Forex remittance rules and discretion by politicians must be done away with as such measures will only promote a class of cronies.

Also, I want to talk about the manipulation of the Colombo Stock Exchange by a few individuals and State funds which does not augur well for the development of Colombo as the financial hub of Asia. Look at what is happening in the Colombo Stock Market. To a great extent, it is driven by vested interests with insider information fuelled by margin trading.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member you have only two minutes left.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, you know that my time was taken. Have some justice.

( ) (The Chairman) But, you have to confine to the time allocation.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay, give me five more minutes. So, what I am saying is that there has to be a more prudent regulation to keep away rogues from the Colombo Stock Exchange and stop the manipulation that is taking place. Otherwise, we can never make Colombo the financial hub of Asia.

Finally, what about the knowledge hub? I feel that there is some movement towards that with the introduction of private universities. But again, the Budget only touched upon it, while unfortunately the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa found no time to articulate the Government's position in his record-breaking 100-minute speech.There was a reference made to Zimbabwe. You said that you will nationalize the unutilized estates and distribute them among the peasants as was done in Zimbabwe. Please look at what happened in Zimbabwe. It ruined the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe. So, think about these things.

I think the answer to the second question I asked, whether it is based on the Mahinda Chintana or Basil Chintana is now fairly clear; it is neither. The warnings were not heeded to. The clarity was not achieved. You are putting signals to the right and turning to the left, or you are putting signals to the left and turning to the right. Or, sometimes like some people at the intersection, you put both signals on and go straight. Do not take my word for that; take that of Professor Sumanasiri Liyanage. He was the person who delivered the lecture on "Apey Arthikaya" at the infamous workshop held in August. What does he think about the Budget and the Ministry of Economic Development? This is important. ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over . ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Please give me a little bit of time. I will stop soon. He says, "The logic of setting up a separate Ministry of Economic Development is not to show the nexus between the Ministry of Finance that is responsible for budgetary management and the Ministry of Economic Development but to emphasize the need for de-linking the two Ministries". But, he says, "Placing the two Ministries under the same secretary, in my opinion, is the first mistake that was done by the political leadership. This makes, wittingly or unwittingly, the development strategy compliant to the logic of budgetary management." This is a comedy of errors. Does it mean that the Ministry of Economic Development is only a nameboard to mislead the people? He says, "The activities of the Minister of Economic Development since 2010, may give the impression that the Ministry does not have a correct perspective on development". Professor Sumanasiri Liyanage does not stop there. He says, Development calls for budgetary manipulation. In economic theory, the orthodox view dominated by neo-liberal ideology talks about the reduction of the budget deficit, while the heterodox economics, which includes writings of Mr. John Keynes, emphasizes the need of budgetary manipulation, especially when resources of the economy are fully utilized. However, budgetary manipulation should be aimed at increasing the productive capacity of the economy. In this sense, the allocation suggested by the Appropriation Bill - listen carefully - is not consistent with the Mahinda Chintana Idiri Dekma projections. Mr. Chairman, this is not what I am saying. This is said by the much-respected Professor Sumanasiri Liyanage of the Peradeniya Campus who is supposed to be your adviser.

Now, I want to come to the last point. That is regarding investment, most specifically, Foreign Direct Investment - FDI. I do not wish to go into details but Mr. Chairman, it is now well known that the FDIs have

dramatically declined. Only US Dollars 208 million has come in the first half of 2010 as opposed to US Dollars one billion that was envisaged. It was the same case for 2009; US Dollars one billion was envisaged but that did not come through. We see in the Ministry of Economic Development plans that it has once again targeted US Dollars one billion for 2011 going up to US Dollars two billion in 2013. So, that is a four-fold increase of FDI from this year if we assume that we get US Dollars 500 million. So, to achieve that you have to have a comprehensive game plan.

Having plaster solutions would not improve the "Doing Business" survey. I agree that you have to improve the "Doing Business" survey but what is needed is clarity, clarity of purpose. Primarily, investors must know whether we are headed the India incorporated way. Investors must understand, they must see, they must believe that we are headed for the India incorporated way and not the Venezuela nationalized way. The signals must be clear; the distortions must be taken away. The noise must be stopped. This is what will determine whether it will be the Chinese high-cost loans that will throttle us in the near future or whether it will be the global investment that will give us economic freedom and power our journey towards a developed country.

Mr. Chairman, what we need to get clarified is, which way we are going: Are we going the India incorporated way or are we going the Venezuela nationalized way. That clarity must come through in all the things you do.

Unfortunately what has happened is, that clarity does not exist.

Continuing to talk about foreign investors and promoting foreign investments, we are shocked to hear what has happened in California. A man who is calling himself the official representative of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Counsel-General of California, one Mr. Jeff Gunawardena, has supposedly made false statements and the White House has instructed the Senator from California to return the money that this person has contributed to the election campaign. So, the Government must re-think of the official status of such persons whom we sent to other countries to bring in investments.

And, my last point is this. Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, I want to talk about your website; it is a minor point, but it is an important point. I said on the 6th of July that it has numerous problems. Today, I tried to go to your website but it does not exist. It states, Await, under construction". A website is the most important thing. - [Interruption.] No, it is not there. It states -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Shall I go into it now?

365 366

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, your photo album is -

( ) (The Chairman) Hon, Member, your time is over. I have given you five minutes from the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe's and the Hon. Harin Fernando's time. Your time is over, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Rajapaksa, your photo album is very nice but there is no website. Investors need the website. Therefore, let me conclude - [Interruption.] You cannot privatize the Ministry to Basil Rajapaksa.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) You referred to it as, "Basil Rajapaksas website" .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No, I am taking about the website of the Ministry of Economic Development.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Then, you must say so. That is a different matter.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I know that you are on Facebook; that you are very technology savvy. But then, why is a website not there for the Ministry of Economic Development? It is under construction for four months and that is not acceptable.

In conclusion I would say that I only made a macro-level contribution to the Committee Stage Discussion and there will be other Hon. Members who will make specific micro-contribution. So, what I have to say is, have a long-term plan with clarity.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. The next speaker is the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam. You have 15 minutes.

Order, please! .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am glad to speak today on, perhaps the most important Ministry in todays context. Our country has to regain itself from the devastation of the armed conflict which went on for several decades, and for a country in any part of the world that comes out of such a conflict, development is a key area. As you know, several countries in Europe had specific work plans to rebuild their countries after World War II. Several cities that were bombed out had planned development. One good example is the City of London itself, and in doing that the governments of the day of those places had to prioritize, had to have a vision for reconstruction and rehabilitation to come out of that conflict-ridden state and regain themselves. We should not erase the memory of the conflict but should keep it alive so that we do not commit the same mistake all over again. As mementos perhaps, as reminders for us, but beyond that, erase it in a way that we look forward to a time that will be very different to the time of conflict. But, this country, having announced the end of the conflict in May, 2009, is yet to catch a proper vision for itself.

There have been several statements and declarations made as to what direction the country would proceed to. But, the acid test of that, of any professed vision, is to see where you are putting your money. If one is to say this is his priority, then that is easily checked by looking at the Budget Estimates and I am sad to say that for a second time after the mini-Budget that was presented several months ago, we find that the words of the Government are not being translated into rupees and cents. I said this at the Second Reading Debate of the Budget as well.

At the Second Reading, the Minister of Finance presented the Budget and in his speech there were so many ideals that he spoke about. One cannot find too many problems with what he has set out to achieve and yet, even those glorious ideals that he has placed before this House cannot be seen in the Budget Estimates that we have for ourselves.

Economic development and post-conflict have to be handled very carefully. I said this at the Second Reading Debate and that was confirmed subsequently by my good Friend, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella when he told the media that there is no specific allocation that has been made for housing. That is an admission. Even today, when the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam was speaking, we raised the issue as to what really he has been doing, and all that he could say was that roads and bridges are being built. Now, I do not want anyone to get me wrong; roads, bridges and such infrastructural development are important. It is important to an area where the basic amenities are available; it is important to an area where people have a roof over their heads; it is important to an area where people know that they have a livelihood. But, not for an area where over 25,000 houses have been razed to the ground; not for an area where people are still unable to access their lands for cultivation purposes; not for an areas in which fishermen still do not have the tools to ply their trade and not for an area where manpower has diminished so much that it is estimated that the woman to man ratio is as high as ten : one. This has to be addressed in a different way. You have to first provide the basic amenities of life. We do not need to repeat this over and over again, but we are forced to because there is no satisfactory answer that comes from the Government. If at all, the Government is only conceding that they have not made any specific allocation. If we talk about housing, the only response is that India is building houses for us.

Now, in the budgetary estimates for the Ministry of Economic Development, housing has been given a very low priority, a very, very low priority. There is one item that says about housing in Mutur - I hope the Hon. Minister of Justice is listening to this - and it is just Rs. 60 million. Amongst figures of Rs. 1,000 million, it is just Rs. 60 million for housing in Mutur. Is that a reflection of the Governments priority, then? Even when you do provide, you provide so little that it is actually an insult to those people. In Mutur East and Sampur, people have not resettled properly. In the areas in Kanguweli and various other farming villages in the Eastern Province, the Muslim and Tamil farmers have not been able to access their farming lands. There is a growing threat of elephants, but there is a bigger threat of people who do not belong to that district coming and taking over the lands. About 25 Muslim farmers came and met me several months ago and said that they are unable to access their lands. Hon. Azwer should take this into heart because there are young men standing in their properties -

2010 01

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who took their lands? It was the LTTE. You are an LTTE agent. You have to condemn it.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Listen to me, Hon. Member. If anybody took their lands, it is to be condemned. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Are you prepared to condemn that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, anybody taking their lands has to be condemned. If the LTTE took their lands that is to be condemned. Today, you say that there is no LTTE. Then, who has taken their lands today? Your people there are complaining bitterly. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They are cultivating them now.- [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All you can say and all you can do is to sit at the back of the House and disturb every speaker. - [Interruption.] That is all that you have been hired to do. You will be kept in that place to do that job. They will not get any more people because you are doing this job very well. - [Interruption.] Even if you aspire for a higher position, His Excellency the President is not going to give it to you because you are doing this job that has been given to you very well.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Of course, thank you very much. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is the task assigned to you. It is such a shameful task that even when I speak about your own people not having access to their farms, this is all you can do.- [Interruption.] Yes, you are helping the terrorists who are keeping those farmers away. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The court should be ashamed of you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are helping the terrorists today who are keeping your farmers away. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are a shameless man. You are still supporting the LTTE.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Member should know that if this is reported to His Excellency the President, you are not going to be very popular because His Excellency the President says that there is no LTTE, but you keep talking about somebody helping the LTTE. He is not going to be very happy with you. So, be careful. You might be asked to resign from your National seat. - [Interruption.] - In your over enthusiasm, do not do injustice to yourself. Look after yourself please.- [Interruption.]

Now, in the various speeches made from the Government side, it was stated that the allocation for the North and the East is far more than the allocation made for the other provinces. That is not so. If you look at Volume 3 of the "Budget Estimates 2011" under Head 105 which is the Ministry of Economic Development, developmental projects in different provinces have been given different names such as Vadakkin Vasantham and so on and so forth. For the East, only Rs. 500 million have been allocated, and for the North only Rs. 1,100 million. None of the other Provinces have less than that. In fact, they either have Rs. 1,100 million or more. So, it is not true to say that the North and the East have been given a greater share of the pie. I am not complaining; I am only pointing this out. I am not complaining because I find that they have been given an adequate share. If there is one pie of a particular size they have been given that. But, it is wrong to say that they have been given more. You have to look at the figures and then - [Interruption] - I am reading from the "Budget Estimates 2011". Hon. Member should know that this is the Committee Stage at which we are considering the budgetary estimates that have been made for 2011and not for 2010. So, I am speaking on the subject. You will do well if you look at the 2011 figures rather than looking at the past. - [Interruption.]

In the speech that was made during the Second Reading, several measures have been proposed. One is the tax amnesty. I wish to remind this House that when the UNP Government passed the Tax Amnesty Act, the then President, Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made a reference to the Supreme Court seeking the constitutionality of that Act, and an advisory opinion was given that it was unconstitutional, that it violated the equality provision in Article 12(1) of the

377 378

Constitution. Soon thereafter, the Government changed and you repealed the Tax Amnesty Act, which was passed by the UNP Government saying that that was immoral and that violated the equality provision set out in the Constitution. But now, His Excellency the President as the Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech, has proposed that there would be a tax amnesty. - [Interruption.] You will do well to think about these matters. I am only pointing out the inconsistency in the policy and in the implementation. - [Interruption.] We did not vote against the Second Reading of the Budget. - [Interruption.] I know what a tax amnesty is, Hon Member. We took your Government's stance and challenged that Tax Amnesty Act; we were with you on that. So, please do not interrupt me. All I am saying is, now the Minister of Finance has proposed something contrary to that. So, think about it for a moment. ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Public Management Reforms)The tax amnesty given at that time was for tax defaulters. Here, we are giving tax amnesty for particular sectors, like the IT, to develop those sectors. I would like to emphasize that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Very well. Thank you for the explanation. I would like to wait and see. This is not called amnesty. Amnesty is given for defaulters. So, there is something wrong in the nomenclature. If you are giving tax relief, duty waiver, that is a different matter. You give amnesty only for an offender. When the Minister of Finance announces a tax amnesty, I take his words and I am saying that is inconsistent with your Government's policy - [Interruption.] No, it is not a legal argument, it is obvious. What is an amnesty? Amnesty is only for defaulters. - [Interruption.] Then, you will say "waiver" or you will say "tax relief". You must know the words that you are using. If you use wrong words, you cannot blame the Opposition for pointing that out. I am glad that you are giving an explanation and I hope that is the same thing that your Minister of Finance also has in his mind.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Azwer.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Azwer, I am listening to the Hon. Ministers explanation.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, though he does not give way, I have to raise this point of Order. The Hon. Member is most inappropriately discussing the vote of another Ministry, the Ministry of Finance. The Votes before the House is of the Ministry of Economic Development. This lawyer does not understand that. He must make this speech when the Vote on the Ministry of Finance is taken up, not today.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You have been told by Mr. Deputy Chairman that that is not a point of Order. So, please sit down. That is the ruling from the Chair and you know you have to abide by that. So, please sit down. Do not stand up again.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you have two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir. We did not vote against the Second Reading of the Budget. - [Interruption.] I said at the Second Reading Debate also that when a senior Minister goes and sits next to the Hon. Azwer, he starts doing this. I see the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena sitting next to him and he gets inspiration and starts behaving like this. - [Interruption.] We did not vote against the Second Reading and we made our stance clear. But, from that time until now, several poor people who live around my house in Colombo have asked me, "Sir, why have you done so? This is a rich mans Budget. Why did your party at least not vote against it? We had confidence in your party. Several persons who live around my house in Colombo have been asking me this question. I say this for a reason. The salary increase that has been announced is also, policy-wise wrong. You cannot give salary increases on a percentage basis. If you give salary increases on a percentage basis, the end result is that a person who receives more now, gets even more. Thereby, the gap widens. I am saying this because the first objective of this Ministry, the Votes of which is under discussion today, is poverty alleviation. You are talking about poverty alleviation; you are talking about

379 380

[ .. ]

2010 01

narrowing the gap, not widening the gap. You widen the gap if you give a person who earns Rs. 10,000 a smaller increase and a person who earns Rs. 50,000, a higher increase. That is not poverty alleviation. That is not the way of reaching equality. In spite of all these things, for a specific purpose which was announced and informed to this House, we did not vote against the Second Reading of the Budget.

Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that this is an important Ministry particularly in the context in which the country finds itself now. But, I am sad to say that the professed priorities are not seen in the Budget Estimates.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Duminda Dissanayake. - [Pause.] Not here. The Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake. - [Pause.] Not here. The Hon. T. Ranjith De Zoysa. - [Pause.] Not here. Then, I call upon the Hon. Dilum Amunugama.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I rise to speak on the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities and the Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprises Development. As I speak now, the Hon. Minister of Economic Development and the Hon. Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities are present in the House. I am very glad about it. I have one request to make from the Minister of Economic Development. The Budget provides decentralized budgetary allocations for the Members of Parliament. I was expecting very much that the decentralized budgetary allocation would be increased from Rs. 5 million to Rs. 10 million this year and this expectation came because your Government side itself has over 60 Members of Parliament who are back benchers, who are not Ministers. So, if you do increase the budgetary allocation for the decentralized budget, it would be helpful not only for the Members of Parliament in the Opposition, but also for the equal number who are there as back benchers in your Government. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, that is not our policy. We will decide on that. So, that is almost -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, your Jana Sabha has not come yet, has it?

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) No. We have already given. So, every Grama Sevaka Division will get money.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, anyway, it is up to your Government to decide, but it was a suggestion made by me in good faith. I would

387 388

2010 01

like to speak more on the Ministry of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities. His Excellency the President, while presenting the Budget in this House said that for reconstruction of housing in the North and the East, the Indian Government is aiding with 50,000 houses and the Government would raise its own funds for the construction of a further 80,000 houses totalling 130,000 houses. He also said that the shanty replacement programme will be started and a further 70,000 houses will be constructed making it 200,000. Then, under the rural and estate housing programme, a further 80,000 houses will be constructed totalling 280,000 houses. But, the Budget Estimates under the Ministry of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities for housing development has fixed a target of 9,000 houses for estate sector, 20,000 houses for rural sector, 7,500 houses under Gama Neguma and 1,500 houses under Ranaviru Housing Project in three years from 2011 to 2013. This all adds up to 38,000 houses only.

Was the statement made by His Excellency the President in the Budget correct, or are the figures in the Budget Estimates provided to us here correct, or is there a discrepancy, or was the Budget Speech itself only a mere rhetoric? A realistic plan does not seem to be in the hands of the Government about housing in the country. This is a very sad state of affairs. Housing, which is the primary need of a citizen is being attended to in a very informal manner, which is not to the liking of anybody.

I wish to state here the position of the estate housing. The first Ministry of Public Utilities and Estate Housing was created in 1994 and the late Hon. P. Chandrasekaran was appointed as the Deputy Minister. In 1995, he did a survey of the housing needs in the estates. The estimate came out that 230,000 houses were necessary in the plantations to house those people. The people in the plantations were brought here in the 19th Century promising them housing, and the estate managements provided barrack-type line rooms only. These line rooms with an area of 10 feet by 10 feet are not sufficient for a proper life. Today, there are expanded families living in these line rooms with the father, mother, son, daughter-in-law and two or three other children living within a 10 feet by 10 feet line room. In 1952, there was a law passed that no more line rooms should be built. That did not mean that houses should not be built. Due to the fact that the line rooms were banned since then, almost no houses were built till 1994. In 1995 as I said, there was a survey done and it was identified that there was a need for 230,000 houses in the plantations. The late Hon. Chandrasekaran during that time started constructing houses and each year several houses were built. From the year 2001 to 2004, during the UNP regime, upstair houses were built in the plantations on the same lands that the line rooms were constructed so that the cost of infrastructure could be saved. With all these, by the year

2005, only 23,000 houses was built. So, building 23,000 houses during 10 years means, you have built only 2,300 houses per year. Even if you had gone at that same pace of building 2,300 houses per year, we could have built 35,000 houses by today. But, that plan also did not succeed; it did not proceed. In the year 2005, the housing programme in the plantations had come to a stop. If we had continued building houses at the rate of 2,300 houses per year, the housing need of the people in the plantations could have been met only in 100 years. Is this the pace at which the Government planned to do it? But, it looks like the present Government is not even interested in maintaining that pace of building 2,300 houses per year. In 2005, under the Mahinda Chintana Programme, the President said that he would build 50,000 houses in the plantations in three years. Building 4,600 houses were started by the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake, when he was the Minister of Estate Community Infrastructure. Out of those 4,600 houses, only 3,400 houses have been completed up to date. The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa gave an answer in this House that there are 1,400 more houses to be completed out of those 4,600 houses, and he further said that those would be completed before the end of 2010, but they still remain uncompleted.

The best evidence is the speech made by my Friend, the Hon. T. Ranjith De Zoysa, just before me in which he said that the construction of houses which was commenced in three estates of the Ratnapura District in 2006 has still not been completed. In the last Budget, Rs. 250 million had been provided under the Ministry of Economic Development for completion of these houses. Probably funds were not released by the Treasury and no work or no progress has been shown in completing the 1,400 houses. Under these circumstances, when are we going to complete these houses? It is an urgent need and whatever that has been expended to build these houses would go waste if the walls that have come up collapse due to the rains and the weather in the near future. So, I call upon the Hon. Minister to find the funds to complete these houses as soon as possible. Today, with a very little allocation for housing, we do not know how the needs of the plantation people for housing are going to be met. There has been Rs. 1,034 million allocated; Rs.800 million for rural and estate housing and Rs. 234 million for rehabilitating the urban houses. So, under these circumstances, how are you going to meet the housing needs, not only of the plantation people, but also of the people in general? This is the main question. The needs of a man - a shelter for his head, food for his stomach - are very important and to provide these, he also needs education, upliftment of his personality and career. Housing is one of the most important needs but the Government does not seem to be interested in providing them, though 280,000 houses have been promised in the Budget. If only 38,000 houses are going to be built in three years, the question that arises is whether the 280,000 houses that you promised is going to take 28 years to be built. So, we do not see a proper housing policy in this Government.

389 390

Speaking of the plantations, the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure Development, which existed before and which has been abolished by this Government, drew up an action plan for developing the plantation areas. This action plan was funded by the UNDP and it is a comprehensive plan to meet all the needs of the plantation people right from housing, education, vocational training and all other needs. But, this UNDP-assisted programme has come to a standstill. The UNDP envisaged the setting up of a secretariat to follow up on this plan but that has not started off yet. The action plan has not been presented to any possible donors so that you can, at least, get foreign assistance to implement this plan. The needs of the plantation workers are considered internationally as an urgent matter. If you do present this action plan to possible donors, I am sure you will be able to raise funds for completing the national action plan for the plantation community. I call upon this Government to take the needs of the plantation people into consideration seriously and to implement some programmes for their benefit and welfare.

Going through the budgetary allocations, since estate housing and rural housing have been put together, we do not know how much is going to be spent on the estate housing sector. We would like this Government to tell us how the housing needs of the people in the plantations is going to be met. If the infrastructural needs of these people have been abandoned, it is very unfair. They need to be developed. I am sure, with six Members of Parliament from the plantation areas in your Government, you should take this seriously and provide for their needs. I do not know whether they do not represent the issues of their people to your Government because I see that you are neglecting this sector. I hope you would reconsider your policy and do whatever is possible to attend to the issues and the needs of the plantation people.

Thank you. [. . 1.50]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Chairman, there was a long speech made by the Hon. Minister of Economic Development on various socio-economic and political issues the other day, some of which we agree with and some others which we do not agree with. I do not have time to raise the gamut of issues but I want to respond to a few, prior to looking at a few other important matters relating to the Ministry of Economic Development.

Firstly, it is welcome to hear an unequivocal statement that the Government would not settle people from other parts of the country in the North and the East. I am sure this would provide a measure of comfort to the people and also to their representatives in the North and the East. It is in an environment of trust that the economy could progress. Yesterday, the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran and others continued to refer to incidents on the lack of security for individuals in the North and the East. Clearly, it is a situation that could be remedied by the Government.

One reason that Prabhakaran had to be defeated was to protect the right of people to be settled in any part of this country; a right that has been guaranteed by the Constitution. Many people have migrated into the City of Colombo over the last 50 or 60 years and made this their home. While that migration has brought certain issues to do with urbanization, it has also given the poor people a stake in the capital City of Colombo. Today, there is deep unrest amongst the poor that they may be displaced from their habitat. The city belongs not only to those who have been born here, like myself, but to everyone who has a right to live here and that right must be defended. I call upon the Government to make an unequivocal statement that any development plan for the city and its surroundings will improve the housing and quality of life of the poor. But, you may do so while they remain in their environment.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, this is a misconception that you are building. There are people who have come to various parts of the country from the North due to the threats by the LTTE. Now, we are making arrangements to resettle them. Resettlement means to resettle them in their original habitats. Some might have come to areas like

393 394

Negombo, Wattala or Colombo. So, we are inviting them and providing them with all necessary facilities to go and settle in their original habitats. Is that wrong? We are inviting those who are suffering in shanties in Colombo to go to their original habitats. That is all. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) We welcome any move, which is voluntary. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) We are also doing it according to the UN standards. Even for the persons who are in IDP camps, we have a way of doing it. We first take them to the village to see whether the environment is suitable for them to go back to their villages. The Government has provided them with buses to visit the place. Then, they come back and after one or two weeks, we take them to the village. So, this is how we do it. That is the UN standard. We are obliged by that. We guarantee that nobody will take over the villages forcibly. There can be acquisitions for development activities, road constructions or for some other purpose not only in a specific area but in other areas also. In the Southern Province, when the Southern Highway was to be built, lands had to be acquired. We have paid compensation to those whose lands were acquired for the Outer Circular Highway and Colombo-Katunayake Expressway in Gampaha District. That is a different thing. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Yes. We welcome the statement that there will be no forced attrition but we also request that the people be continuously consulted, particularly when developing the City of Colombo. We are told constantly that we must trust the Government because they have won the war and we must follow them in their economic policy. Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, called it right in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 when he closed the capital acccount. But, it is also Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed who went ahead with Putrajaya, the alternative capital, where businesses did not eventually move and a colossal white elephant has been built today. He wanted everyone to follow him because he was right on some decisions.

The investment in roads and ports should be properly evaluated to assess the value to society. Everyone knows that Mihin Air was a colossal loss, throwing good money after bad. Why is the evaluation of such projects and evaluation of the value to society not made public for public scrutiny? Why have these been guarded almost like military secrets?

Every part of the country needs to be interconnected. Therefore, infrastructure building is necessary. But, rails may be better than roads in connecting people and markets. People like us here in Parliament will benefit from the roads. But, is this the basis of economic development?

The other day, the Hon. Minister said that the Government is borrowing and through the borrowing they are funding assets. I beg to differ. Assets are only valuable to the extent that they generate income. Otherwise, they have no value. The question we are asking is whether these assets can generate reasonable income returns? If you get it wrong, we cannot uproot and sell roads and ports. We are sunk. The poor will suffer most if optimal investments are not made.

We were also told by the Hon. Minister that the model of economic development was Sri Lankan. Is it the model? On what is it based on? What substance is it based on? President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, "it is not a liberal economic model". The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa said, "it is a homegrown model". What is this model? How different is it to other models whatever country you want to compare it with, the US, China or wherever? Let us stop throwing labels. What is the substance behind it? Is it a secret or do we have to accept it when we do not understand it? Economic principles are universal. If we violate them, we do so at our own peril. We want reason to believe in the economy and in your journey.
