that our nation is lagging behind 25 years compared to other economies in the region. Therefore, we have to do 35 years of work in 10 years. The work which should have been done 35 years ago must be done now.

The Government is concentrating on IT, productivity, efficiency and innovative technologies to achieve a higher growth. Today the world is talking of a 10 percent growth. Until recently the world considered a 3-4 per cent growth as good, but not any more. China is growing at 10.2 percent while India is also encountering tremendous growth.

[. . 11.29] ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, at the commencement of my speech, I would like to quote a statement made by Walter Bagehot. He was an English economist, a political philosopher and a journalist. He stated, "A Parliament is nothing less than a big meeting of more or less idle people".

, " ." . Sir, I certainly do not subscribe to his opinion; I shall strive to disapprove of his opinion and will attempt to provide this pre-eminent and august Assembly with a dispassionate, authentic, constructive assessment of the 2011 Budget.

Walter Bagehot . 2011 , , . Sir, I would like to state to this House what a renowned and well-known US President once stated when commenting on Governmental policy. He stated, "If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity".

Chandrababu Naidu implemented his IT Revolution in Andhra Pradesh, and the present Minister of External Affairs of India, Mr. S.M. Krishna, initiated an IT Revolution in that particular State when he was the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Where are the proposals for promoting an IT Revolution in Sri Lanka? That is not mentioned in the Budget.

During the '80s, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher implemented a Youth Training Scheme to counter the unemployment problem in the United Kingdom. I would like to propose to this august and renowned Assembly that we also should have a similar scheme that provides incentives and financial inducements to various sectors such as the business sector and industrial sector of our society, so that theunemployment problem in this country is solved without delay.

, . . "export-led economic growth" . ? ? . Sir, it is a generally accepted economic axiom that for a country's economic growth to be sustainable and for a countrys economy to be prosperous both in the medium-term and long-term, we have to ensure that export-led economic growth is given priority and importance. This is of great essence; this is a quintessential economic principle that has been followed by many a prosperous country. If we are to initiate a

programme whereby the export development in this country is enhanced and the export-led economic growth is encouraged, we have to have a national export development strategy. Our country does not have a substantive export development strategy; there is absolutely no reference document. If we do not have a formal trade strategy, we all know, it does not bode well for long-term planning. There is an immense scope for export-led development, a substantial opportunity is available but because of lack of a strategy, there is a lack of predictability and direction. Therefore, it is very difficult to attract long-term investment.

So, it is imperative and indispensable that we formulate a five-year trade strategy, identify the thrust areas for exports, identify priorities for investment and have a proper direction in terms of tariff policies. You know, we have a system of determining tariff policies on an extremely ad hoc basis. It is either done through the annual budgets or overnight gazettes. So, I think as a country, we have to have a development-oriented and export-oriented policy programme and for that it is utterly important that we have a national export development strategy.

Sir, there are numerous amounts of trade negotiations taking place. But, they lack direction; they lack leadership. There are the IOR-ARC trade negotiations and the BIMSTEC trade negotiations. These are of little value to Sri Lankas export markets. It is more important to look at agreements such as the Indo-Lanka CEPA. I think this Agreement has to be prioritized. But, I believe, that due consideration has to be given to the opinions, the grievances and to the concerns of the requisite stakeholders. Why do we not explore the emerging market economies of the ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia? There is absolutely no movement in these trade agreements.

Sir, the present Export Development Board does not have a proper website portal that gives up-to-date information. This is a very important source of providing international tariff figures, export market opportunities, various regulations and various international trade statistics. The Export Development Board - EDB - should have a more proactive approach to export promotion. So, it has to be reorganized, revitalized, and virtually reinvented if it is not to be classified as a virtually defunct white elephant. As such, I believe there should be a stern effort to make sure that the Export Development Board acts as the main catalyst for promoting export-led development and economic growth in our country.

I quote:

" It is noteworthy that this was the first time in the six decade history of our country since Independence, to have achieved a more than 6 % annual growth during four consecutive years, and has occurred despite the intensification of the terrorist war and the heavy military expenditure.

This trend, however, reversed in the fourth quarter of 2008 with the onset of the second round effects of the global recession."

It further states, I quote:

" With the launching of prudent monetary policies by the Central Bank to contain inflation and even more significantly, the end of the terrorist war in May 2009 due to the astute political leadership given by the President, Sri Lanka was able to reverse the downward economic swing."

" In the above scenario, an average 8 % real growth rate, in the next 5/6 years, is realistic. This will enable a doubling of the per capita income in money terms or at market prices, with a slightly higher average inflation, and a slightly appreciating domestic currency, than at present, as indicated by the trend in recent months."

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. A.L.M. Athaulla said that His Excellency the President has a lot of compassion for the people, but there is a news report in "The Sunday Times" of yesterday which states that His Excellency the President had said, I quote:

IDPs have Rs. 3.5 billion in banks, says President

A 16-member delegation of the Tamil Political Party Forum met His Excellency the President and asked that the people who have been sent back to their homes be provided compensation for rebuilding their homes

because the homes were destroyed during the war. His Excellency the President has given a list of persons who have deposits in banks and the deposits were made when they came into the camps that were established to receive them at the end of the war. His Excellency the President has said that they have Rs. 3.5 billion in these deposits. So, they are well-off and they do not need any compensation. Rupees 3.5 billion divided by 300,000 persons who came to these IDP camps works out to Rs. 11,666. With this Rs. 11,666 can these people be fully rehabilitated?

The Government has a duty to look after these people. These people did not break their homes on their own. They were displaced because of the war; a war that went from Mannar to Mullivaikkal sweeping the whole area, where houses were lost in the thousands and it is estimated that 130,000 houses were lost. The Government of India has come forward with US Dollars 500 million to rebuild these houses or to build 50,000 houses. So, to build the total 130,000 houses, you need US Dollars 1.3 billion or Rs. 140 billion and they have only Rs. 3.5 billion and this is the list the President has given to the Tamil Political Parties Forum. This just shows how this Government is looking at the issues of these people.

According to the Budget Proposals, they are going to build as many as 50,000 houses for those who have been displaced or for those who have been so-called resettled. A further 80,000 houses are proposed to be rehabilitated from other sources and another 70,000 houses for shanty dwellers in urban areas will be developed. This also states that the Gama Neguma initiative will target regional redevelopment with 80,000 houses for the low-income rural and estate households each year. All the figures given on housing are rosy pictures painted without any basis. The "Mahinda Chintana" programme in 2005 promised 50,000 houses for plantation workers in three years. That is about 16,000 houses per year, whereas the 4,600 houses that commenced in 2006 have still not been completed. The Hon. Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities admitted in this House, answering a question from me, that 1,400 houses of the houses started in 2006, have not been completed.

Under these circumstances, are these figures there just to take us for a ride or are they realistic? If they are realistic, where does the money come from? Even the houses promised by India one and half years ago do not seem to have taken-off. There are no plans yet. We do not know when these would come up. Under these circumstances, how are we to believe that the Government plans to build altogether 280,000 houses in their housing programme.

The Estate Housing Programme was implemented in 1994 first by the creation of the Ministry of Estate Housing. Then, this Estate Housing Ministry was merged

1279 1280

[ ... ]

2010 29

with the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure. This Ministry does not exist today. In the Budget presented in July, this year, Rs. 230 million had been allocated for estate infrastructure. But, none of the houses that were incomplete in June, 2009, have now been completed. This is the status of the plantation people but still the people who got elected by the plantation people are running to your Government. I do not know for what?

The Government has proposed that 80,000 houses would be built in the estates and in the rural areas and they have also allocated Rs. 800 million for this purpose. So, Rs. 800 million divided by 80,000 comes to Rs. 10,000 per house. I do not know whether you can even level the ground to start building a house with Rs. 10,000. So, this is why I say that the figures are rosy stories and not realistic.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake is not in the House.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I mean the story is rosy. I think although the Hon. Azwer speaks all three languages, he does not understand the meaning of a rosy story.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I understand very well.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Talking about plantations, the Government has given a figure of Rs. 50,000 for replanting to the smallholders and there is no assistance for any of the major companies. They will have to borrow from the banks to replant. Today, 70 per cent of the tea plants are not replanted but the plants are over 50 years old. The lifespan of a proper tea plant is about 50 years. So, at least 2 per cent has to be replanted every year, but there is no - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa ) Hon. Member, 70 per cent of the tea production comes from the smallholders - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. You are giving - [Interruption] - Yes, Hon. Minister, I will come to that now.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, those companies are making money. We have taken over all the hospitals; we have taken over the construction of roads and we have taken over the schools in the plantation areas. So, the only thing they have -[Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Minister for that.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Why can they not do that? - [Interruption] -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Right. You are talking about - [Interruption] -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) So, why should we help them? We will help the smallholders.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay, you help the smallholders. I will tell you how you are helping the smallholders. You are giving Rs. 50,000 per hectare. - [Interruption] - The cost - [Interruption] - Please, Hon. Minister, let me also tell what I have to say. I am not speaking for the companies, I am fighting with the companies. The people who are with you are collaborating with the companies. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) You are representing the estate sector workers, but you are now speaking about their companies. You can never win from the estate people.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, no, do not worry, Hon. Minister. I know how to win from the people in the plantations. You do not realize that my people are living in those plantation company estates and those plantation - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) But, you are from Colombo.

1281 1282

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I was born in Kandy. My father contested for the Nuwara-Eliya seat in 1936. I am not an outsider to the plantations. You have allocated only Rs. 50,000. You need Rs. 2 million to replant a hectare. You need 30,000 plants for one hectare. Each plant costs Rs. 10. For 30,000 plants you need Rs. 300,000 just to buy the plants. But, you give only Rs. 50,000 for replanting.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That is the subsidy. A subsidy does not give the total cost.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You give two and a half per cent of the total cost. That is not a sufficient subsidy -[Interruption.] I am very glad that you are here to listen to this so that you will do something about it because you are the only person in this Government who understands things and work.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) There are other Ministers too. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, I have not seen a single Minister, except you. You further say that if the tea plantation companies do not cultivate the fallow land that they hold now,which is 65,000 hectares, you will take over them and give them to the smallholders. Sixty five thousand hectares is going to work out to 170,000 acres. There are enough workers in the estates who have the experience and capacity to replant this. Give these land to those workers to replant. Eighty per cent of the cost for replanting goes for labour. They have it. They can put it free.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That is what the President told. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Donating their labour will be free. So, use the balance money that you are going to give as subsidy to support these workers to replant one acre each, so that the plantations will not have a social problem of outsiders coming in. At the same time, those are the people who have sustained this industry for 180 years. They care more for it. You personally know it. You went to Galaha once and asked the people what they want. They did not

ask anything personal. They told you, "Please send us fertilizer for these estates so that the plantations can survive.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) I sent them. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You did send. So, that is the kind of people they are. So, give those people that opportunity instead of taking over the lands and giving them to outsiders. This is a suggestion - [Interruption.] Very good. I accept it. I hope you will take this as constructive criticism and implement such progressive measures without mere rhetoric in Parliament.

Sir, talking about the 10 per cent cess that you are going to charge on tea and 8 per cent on rubber, today, you have a cess of Rs. 4.50 on tea and Rs. 4.00 on rubber. This cess is supposed to support the industry. But, are you supporting the industry? The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board at a public discussion stated that out of Rs. 1,350 million collected as cess on tea, he gets only Rs. 200 million to pay the salaries of the Sri Lanka Tea Board and nothing more. So, where is the balance Rs. 1,150 million going? It is going to the Government coffers as revenue. The cess is not supposed to be a revenue measure. It is supposed to be a development-oriented revenue that has to be re-ploughed into that industry. Today, you have abolished the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure Development. You are going to increase the cess by Rs. 5.50 and it is going to bring about Rs. 1,700 million. What part of that are you willing to spend for the welfare of the workers? The workers in the plantations are a suffering lot. They have very few facilities because they were neglected for over 40 years. So, will you provide a part of the cess for the welfare of the plantation workers?

This Budget also proposes a pension scheme for private sector employees and senior citizens above 65 years. The worker has to contribute 2 per cent and the employer is to contribute 4 per cent. Let us say, a worker is earning Rs. 10,000. He would be accumulating Rs. 400 per month or Rs. 4,800 per year. After 10 years, he is supposed to get a pension. In 10 years, he would have accumulated Rs. 48,000 if his salary remains stable, but if it is increased by 10 per cent each year, he would have accumulated about Rs. 72,000. To this, you would add the five months salary that he will draw after 10 years as gratuity and a total fund of Rs. 120,000 would be made up.

Today, under the EPF scheme, the worker knows what he is going to get. With his contribution and the employers contribution, 20 per cent of the salary is

1283 1284

2010 29

collected every month. On this, there is a guarantee that he will get an interest of 12 per cent. So, at the end of the period he knows how much he could expect. But, this pension scheme has just left the worker, who is going to contribute to it, not knowing what he is in for at the end of the period. This is a very sad state. Before a person is asked to contribute to become a member of a fund, he must be told what he can expect from it. Otherwise, you are just letting him down like some of the finance companies which have let down their people. Further we are talking about -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) When they become the members they will exactly get to know about that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) At the moment, we are unaware. We would like the Government to tell us how this is going to be done; whether it is realistic; whether the workers would be benefited. A pension scheme is good because our people do not have the habit -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) This was a suggestion taken by a tripartite committee. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Minister, for responding quickly while I am on my feet. This is very encouraging, Sir. Otherwise, we stand here; speak; it gets into the Hansard; no Minister reads it and nothing happens. But, I am fortunate that you are here in this House today to immediately respond to the queries that I raise.

Now, I would like to talk about the cost of living in the plantation areas. Today, the estate worker is earning about Rs. 10,000, if he works for all 25 days. Further, each estate family is supposed to have a working average of 1.6. On that basis, it is possible for them to earn about Rs. 16,000. According to the Department of Census and Statistics, todays total family expenditure is Rs. 32,446. They have also stated that 50 per cent of an estate workers expenditure is spent on food and only the balance 50 per cent is spent to increase his quality of life. So, under these circumstances, these people need some sort of support from the Government.

Then, you are also considering to provide Food Security Cards. I would suggest to this Government that the plantation workers also be considered for food security cards. In the past, when Samurdhi was introduced, the estate worker was shut out from it because

he draws a monthly salary. But, when the salary is low, it does not permit a person to live a full life. As I said, according to the Department of Census and Statistics, 50 per cent of Rs. 32,000 is the expenditure for a family for their food. So, today, if an estate worker spends some of his money for other needs, he would have to be starving. He would have to be living below the nutritional level or without meals during his lifetime.

So, this situation has to be corrected and the plantation worker should be considered for this food security cards that you have promised to give.

Thank you, Sir.
