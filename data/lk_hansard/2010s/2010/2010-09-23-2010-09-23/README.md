( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) My second Supplementary Question is this.

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, if you had listened to the speech of the Hon. Prime Minister, he said that the economy is doing well; there is peace in the country; tourists are coming and they are expanding in numbers. Then, why do we need an extension of the state of Emergency? His own speech defeats the need for this Debate. So, I think there is no reason for any of us to vote for it.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Speaker, today we are talking about the extension of the state of Emergency in the light of two events that have happened since last month, one of which is the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the other is the verdict of the military tribunal on General Sarath Fonseka.

The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution has abolished the Constitutional Council and also with it the Public Service Commission, the Police Commission, the Elections Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and so on. The power to appoint these Commissions under the new Amendment has now moved to the Executive Presidency with a mechanism for consultation through a Parliamentary Council. This Parliamentary Council also appears to be an insertion at the last minute because as we, lawyers, discovered in Court, they had one version of the proposed Amendment until they were given another. The Eighteenth Amendment has further centralized power in the office of the Executive President. The office will come to be occupied by different people with the passage

of time. Who knows who will occupy this office; whether we will have a benevolent ruler or a despot over time? Emergency power is governmental authority which moves from the Legislature to executive officials with a concomitant alteration or reduction in individual liberties. This is not new to us, Sri Lankans.

An early example of Emergency power was when the Governor of Ceylon was entrusted with reserve powers amongst which was extensive Emergency powers in the State Council of Ceylon in 1931. We know that the Public Security Ordinance was introduced in 1947, which provided for the Governor to issue Emergency Regulations. The law was then passed, also as an urgent Bill in 90 minutes. And, now we know where we have got a culture of passing important laws in this country as urgent Bills. The Hon. Member for Colombo South at that time, Dr. A.P. de Zoysa, in the then Council said : "An unscrupulous Minister, an unscrupulous Prime Minister could make use of this very law to detain innocent people".

We have lived to the day to see the reality of these words. The Public Security Ordinance then was introduced and incorporated into the 1972 Constitution and also into the 1978 Republican Constitution. I am not an admirer of the 1978 Constitution, but must point out that along with the Executive Presidency also came a justiciable Bill of Rights in that Constitution. In 1979, the Emergency framework was strengthened by the Prevention of Terrorism Act - PTA. It was enacted as a temporary piece of legislation, but was made permanent in 1982. By 2003, regulations in force under the PTA included the creation of High Security Zones, restriction of areas for fishing, police powers to keep in custody those who surrendered. My point is that Emergency laws - I am talking about the Emergency - are now becoming the normal laws of the country because of a long history of the country being governed under Emergency Laws. A State of Emergency was also declared in 2005 in response to the assassination of our respected friend and the then Foreign Minister, and has continued by monthly renewal. On 2nd May this year, some changes were made to the regulations. There were changes made to the miscellaneous provisions and powers that may give the impression to the general public that the EMPPR contains all the regulations that create offences under the Emergency. But, that is not the case. Some repealed provisions have mere equivalence in other laws and in the Penal Code. However, some of the noteworthy provisions that were repealed are; freedom of expression, prohibition of public processions and public meetings, empowering a competent authority to control publications, prohibition in taking photographs of particular buildings, possession of maps, possession of uniforms resembling armed forces, regulations imposing the death penalty for threatening death or bodily harm in which a confession made to whomever in whatsoever circumstances was made admissible as evidence.

657 658

2010 23

Yes, these have been some of the improvements. Despite that, what has happened in practice to "Siyatha"? What has happened to peaceful protests led by the UNP and other civil service organizations during the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment? What has come of any investigation to media channels, publication houses, journalists - dead or missing?

The appalling regulations about the disposal of dead bodies has been repealed. Some grounds on which preventive detention orders could be issued, have been repealed. But, also there have been others which have been reintroduced.

Large numbers were lagging in jails due to the so-called confessions that were taken. It is now important that these convictions based solely on these confessions under this and corresponding provisions of the PTA, be reviewed in the name of justice to these people. There are still however, dangerous remnants of the Emergency powers. Trade union activity is sought to be restricted. In acting contrary to an essential services order, a person can be subject to restriction of movement.

There are other provisions permitting the proscription of an organization on the ground of acting contrary to an essential services order, which provisions were repealed sometime back, but reintroduced. A new ground for preventive detention has also been introduced. This is to prevent a person acting contrary to the PTA, when already the PTA has provisions for it. The highly unsatisfactory regulations where a person surrendering under the Emergency Regulations, is automatically subject to rehabilitation for a 12-month period and could be extended up to two years. This amounts to a detention without trial. It is uncertain whether people who have moved from conflict areas to government-controlled areas, also come under this Regulation. It is still possible for a police officer, for an armed forces officer to question any person detained under Emergency Regulations and to take that person away from the place of detention up to seven days at a time. There are regulations for arresting and detaining persons before a Magistrate within 30 days of arrest, but the discretion of the Magistrate has been restricted because it requires the consent of the Attorney-General. The result is that the persons might languish in a prison for two to three years before they are released or granted bail by the Attorney-General. So, what does it take us now to move from a situation of Emergency and a culture of Emergency to a culture of liberty and freedom? Post 9/11, the world moved from the paradigm of liberty to the paradigm of security. We, Sri Lankans, boast now that we have defeated terrorism within our boarders. Sixteen months since May 2009, we need a paradigm shift now from security to liberty.

President Rajapaksa himself has talked about the abuses of emergencies in times gone by and even went to international fora to defend the rights of our citizens. The entrenched war mentality must go. It is with sadness that

today, many speakers had to refer to General Sarath Fonsekas inability to be present in the Chamber, in the background of a situation where being a past presidential candidate, contesting the outcome of the election in the Supreme Court of the country, being subjected to a military tribunal and held as a result of it. As the Leader of the United National Party made a long speech on it, not just about the justice behind it, but also that it was contrary to law and practice of this August Assembly. I will not speak further about it.

The LTTE brought a system where people lived in fear because of the dictate of one individual. We must restore a system of governance within the law. I came to Parliament because I believed in the power of the law, but today I am less sure about the supremacy of law. Emergency laws are useless if the media is attacked and journalists are killed; and we have not found those who are guilty. The new targets appear to be media censorship, neutralizing trade unions and beating students. The laws must be proportionate to the threat at hand. We need to deal with hostile elements in the diaspora, but the Emergency Regulations virtually leave them untouched. It is the innocent, particularly the innocent Tamil civilians, who have suffered the most and are still being subject to intimidation and fear with disproportionate regulation. On 10th July 2009, President Rajapaksa in an interview to the "Time" magazine, had this to say in reference to Sri Lankas willingness to have a truth and reconciliation commission: "I do not want to dig into the past and open up wounds". But, I am glad that months later, he changed his position for the better and the better of the country by instituting the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.

The time has now come - this is my final point - for Emergency Regulations that govern the country to be replaced with the normal law. As someone once pointed out in the direction of the ocean outside the City of Colombo and said, there was not a single boat or a sailboat on the seas by the capital city, unusual for a major city like Hong Kong or even Sydney with its boats and sailboats; a clear indication of a country with the absence of peace. Investors will come here when the absence of war has been replaced with trust and peace. The Emergency Regulations must give way to the normal law of the country. It is only then that swords will be turned into ploughshares where war is the past and freedom, justice and equality will reign. Thank you. [. . 6.57]

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join in this Debate today in support of the extension of the state of Emergency, for I think we can note a sea change in the manner in which

659 660

the Opposition has approached the Debate. It was instructive, I believe, that an Hon. Member for the Jaffna District raised a point of Order to the effect that this debate was happening too soon. But, in the past, Members of the Opposition were delighted to use the opportunity of an Emergency Debate to abuse the Government, to claim that all sorts of wrongs were taking place under the cover of the Emergency. Old habits die hard, like indeed the Emergency Regulations, since we cannot expect total change immediately.

Todays Debate suggested that the Opposition no longer feels the same sense of urgency, and would have been perfectly happy if this Debate did not take place. Thus, the Leader of the Opposition talked about what he sees as erosion of the financial powers of Parliament. He, and a Member from Colombo District talked of problems with regard to Courts Martial, a Member from the Kegalle District complained about the Eighteenth Amendment and a Member from the Jaffna District referred to the situation of the people who had been displaced and abused by the LTTE for so long, and then the Member who spoke just before me joined all these up together, but he rightly drew attention to the accesses of his Leader; at least I think he is still their Leader.

When the Prevention of Terrorism Act was piled on top of the emergency when as he eloquently put it, trade unions and students were beaten up ruthlessly, if he remembers the early 80s when as he seems to have forgotten Tamils all over the country were ruthlessly assaulted. That style of Government, Mr. Speaker, led to an increase in terror. But, I am sure that the Hon. Member will grant that this Government was actually able to put an end to terror in Sri Lanka.

However, Mr. Speaker, let me refer to the points made by the Members from Jaffna, since those are issues of some importance and should be considered relevant. The Hon. Members' request for better attention to the people who had suffered for so long is perfectly reasonable and this Government will do its best to alleviate that situation. But, the same is true of the country as a whole, and the development that is happening all over: the restoration of confidence, the spread of business opportunities, these are the best remedies that can be provided.

In this context, I would like to mention a very pleasant experience last night, when I found one of my former students from the Sabaragamuwa University on the plane back from London. He came from Jaffna, but he had had to leave Jaffna, because of pressures to contribute to the LTTE, perhaps even to be conscripted. He and his widowed mother had had to flee to Colombo and while there, he had managed to get a student visa for Britain. But, in spite of having this visa, he felt confident enough yesterday to return; a situation that would have been unimaginable for able youngsters who were the prey of terrorists for so long.

It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we make things better for people like that. We need to cooperate for this, and I must therefore, pay tribute to the Member for Gampaha District, who provided a model of how an Opposition should behave today, when he brought a Private Members' Bill. The idea he advanced was a good one and as mentioned, the Government has been working on this already. It is best that such a Bill, which is in the national interest, be proposed by the Government after due consultations and it was heartening that there was an agreement to discuss the matter further, and expedite action on the basis of consensus.

I hope that this can be done too with regard to the oversight committees. Parliamentary promotion of accountability and transparency is essential and the ability of the Government and the Opposition to work together will, I hope be a precursor also to cooperation for national development.

But, while we move on, Mr. Speaker, we must be aware that there are dangers that we still have to overcome. Though within this country, I believe most of us recognize the need to respect the mandate that His Excellency and his Government received. There are still forces abroad that seek to disrupt us. We need therefore, to be vigilant, and it will therefore be necessary to maintain the state of Emergency for a few months more, though I hope that its provisions will be liberalized gradually.

I was sorry in this regard that one Hon. Member assumed that the Emergency would be used to destroy free education. This is the type of argument that makes a mockery of the dangers that we need to secure ourselves against, and the importance of introducing to the service sector too, the economic liberalization that his party so proudly claims it brought in 1977. He also got his history all wrong when he claimed that the Opposition accused President Jayewardene of excessive powers, that was President Jayewardenes own proud boast.

So, I hope that instead of being oppositional for the sake of opposition and instead of seeking to denigrate the country internationally in the hope of subverting the democratic will of the people, the Opposition as a whole, will at last accept that an elected Government must be allowed to govern. An Opposition has a role to play in oversight, in ensuring accountability and in promoting good ideas. It is not meant to criticize everything the Government does and it only makes itself a joke when it denigrates what this Government has achieved through its determination to destroy terrorism whilst promoting a better future for all Sri Lankans.

Todays Debate, when the Government for practical reasons offered the opportunity to the Opposition to debate the extension of the state of Emergency early, it should then be a prelude to a healthier relationship. In not responding hysterically today as it has done in the past, the Opposition has shown itself prepared to move

forward. Constructive criticism along with support to ensure security will be welcome. I hope the Opposition will continue to develop to a mature understanding of its role and support the Government to take the country forward. Thank you.
