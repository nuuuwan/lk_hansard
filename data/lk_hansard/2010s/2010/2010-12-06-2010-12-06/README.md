( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) First, you have to listen to the Hon. Member, Sir. It can be overruled after giving a hearing. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The former Secretary-General of Parliament who is now a paid officer of this House, who is in the Revision Committee of the Standing Orders made a statement to the "Daily Mirror" newspaper of 6th of December, 2010. I quote:

"Resolution can't unseat an MP"

Sir, it is highly unethical, and also prejudicial to the Motion that is to be forwarded to you today, Sir. Therefore, I would kindly request you to probe into this and take appropriate action. Can a member of the staff of this House make statements like this to newspapers? That is all, Sir.

Thank you.

Improper management of solid waste is one of the biggest and key environmental problems in Sri Lanka. Lack of systematic systems on waste collection, waste transport, intermediate treatment systems and suitable final waste disposal have been contributing to the solid waste problems in Sri Lanka. Present haphazard waste disposal practices in Sri Lanka have created numerous environmental problems on citizens.

Uncontrolled scattering and dumping of garbage caused serious problems in social environment, health and economic sectors. According to existing rules and regulations, Solid Waste Management (SWM) is mandatory duty of Local Authorities. But due to various difficulties such as lack of human resource, lack of technical knowledge and technical infrastructure, lack of financial resource, most of those LAs could not perform their job well.

( ... - ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader - Deputy Minister of Environment) Mr. Deputy Chairman, at the outset let me express my sincere gratitude to His Excellency the President for placing confidence in me to appoint me as the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Environment. I consider it a privilege and a very good opportunity to serve the country in the conservation of environment for the benefit of present and future generations.

The Ministry of Environment has taken various steps to guide our development path to be more sustainable. Let me present some specific achievements made in 2010. In order to ensure long-term sustainability of our development programme, the Ministry continued monitoring and co-ordinating the Haritha Lanka Programme administered by the National Council for Sustainable Development - NCSD - under the leadership of His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka. The programme includes activities under the 10 thrust areas such as, clean air - everywhere; saving the fauna, flora and eco-systems; meeting the challenges of climate change; wise use of coastal belt and sea around; responsible use of the land resources; doing away with the dumps; water for all and always; green cities for health and prosperity; greening the industries and knowledge for right choices.

Sir, taking necessary steps to conduct strategic environment assessments is another important activity implemented to integrate environmental concerns in the development programmes. This strategy prevents unnecessary delays in economic development programmes and avoids negative environmental consequences arising from those. Several hilltop areas which cover major upper watersheds of the main rivers of the country are denuded of forests and remain as bare lands. To address this problem, an action plan was developed to create a vegetative cover on hilltops with a view to reducing soil erosion on upper watersheds and ensuring the ecosystem sustainability. We are planning to implement it in 2011.

Sir, facilitating local authorities to address the ever-increasing solid waste management problem is a major contribution provided by the Ministry in 2010. This includes launching of the second phase of the Pilisaru Waste Management Programme, which promotes integrated solid waste management in the country. This is a key milestone passed in this year in environmentally sound solid waste management.

Sir, children, particularly, school children have a scientifically large potential to transmit the environmental

1333 1334

message to the larger society. In this endeavour in 2010, the CEA enrolled 25,000 members to their Environmental Pioneer Brigade Programme.

School children societies were formed by the Marine Environment Protection Authority to scale up the existing initiatives. An environment diary for Grade 3 students was developed by the Ministry and distributed among 26 schools as a pilot project to promote sustainable production and consumption in the country.

Sir, the biodiversity provides almost all the dietary, medicinal and other related products to human beings. Being a tropical country, Sri Lanka hosts a wealth of biodiversity which has global significance. The Ministry has taken various steps to conserve this national wealth of the country.

In 2010, the Ministry with its own technical capacity undertook the responsibility of updating the National Red Data List of Threatened Fauna and Flora which gives the conservation status of biodiversity. The Biodiversity Secretariat of the Ministry is now engaged in the preparation of an "act on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing" to regulate and check the unfair and unlawful exploitation of the countrys biological resources by various internal and external individuals and institutions.

The protected area network has been assessed through an islandwide scientific gap analysis to incorporate the most important biodiversity areas into the formal protected area network of the country. This activity is paving the way to increase the land area under legal protection and also thereby to meet the "Millennium Development Goal 7" by increasing the land area under protection.

Sir, Sri Lanka is paying special attention on climate change and its negative impacts on its nation. We strongly believe that every attempt should be made by us to slow down global warming, which would be the greatest challenge of the world in this millennium. In this context, the Ministry is in the process of taking positive and proactive steps towards mitigation and adaptation strategies and actions in reducing the ill-effects of climate change. The Ministry of Environment is also developing a national climate change policy and climate change adaptation strategies. We are now at its final stage of completion.

In addition, various steps were taken by the Ministry to promote regional environmental co-operation. Hosting the South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme and the Mangroves for the Future Programme are two important activities completed in this year.

Having said that, I feel it is my privilege to say a few words in Tamil.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera has moved this Adjournment Motion on the issue of limiting the entrance requirement age-wise, to the Sri Lanka Law College. The reply that has been prepared is basically in Sinhala. So, let me read that portion and thereafter I will deal with the issue separately in English.

" , 35 . . . 2010 . 2011 . . .

Now, this reply does not deal with the issue that had been raised by the Hon. Ajith P. Perera. In fact, I clarified this from the Principal of the Sri Lanka Law College as to the background, to the decision that has been taken by the Council of Legal Education. I do fully agree that the provisions in the Council of Legal Education Ordinance, as amended, vests me with certain powers to give directions to the Council of Legal Education. But, at the very outset having listened to the rationale that has been advanced, it is evident that it relates to the financial resources of the Sri Lanka Law College. The course of Attorneys-at-Law is a full-time course and that being a full-time course had been followed by all of us who had

1389 1390

gone to the Sri Lanka Law College and having entered into this noble profession, all of us know that not only the course of studies is full-time but also, it engages the students in various extra-curricular activities such as the moot court, mock trial, court visits and various other competitions and engagements. So, it has been found over a period of time by the authorities in the Sri Lanka Law College that most of those people who are over 35, who are already employed are poor in attendance and it has always been an issue of large dropouts happening either after the first-year examination or the second-year examination and thereafter. This ratio has been looked at very carefully.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me just finish. And, I am told that by admitting people who are advanced in age and who ultimately drop out, it would impact on those students who do not get the benefit of entering the Sri Lanka Law College because these people have already got admission and only a limited number of places - on an average of about 250 these days - are available. Although almost 7,000 applicants sit for the entrance examination, around 250 applicants are admitted every year. It varies according to the cut-off marks that are decided after having looked at the performance of the candidates. In this scenario, this matter has been looked into very carefully.

Not only this issue, even the issue of the examinations being conducted in the English medium has been, at the very outset, not a very popular decision. But, now from this year onwards for all three years of study, the examinations are being conducted in English. Of course, the opportunity is given if a student wants to sit in another language but, the lectures are conducted in the English language. Of course, the issue is there as to whether this rule was published and whether the rule was placed before Parliament. But, the fact is that the particular applicants concerned have already been given sufficient prior notice by the newspaper publication that has gone about the examination and they have also signed a declaration before sitting the examination. In that declaration, they have very specifically said that they are abiding by the conditions.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) On inquiry, the Sri Lanka Law College says that the declarants have been asked to declare, based upon the newspaper advertisements that have been published, giving the age limit as clearly below 35 years.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. It is only if I examine the number of candidates who have sat having been over 35 years, that we will be able to satisfy ourselves as to the veracity of your argument. Therefore, let me discuss this matter with the Sri Lanka Law College and if necessary, with the Chief Justice. In fact, I am meeting the Chief Justice tomorrow morning and this issue can be discussed. Since this is a policy decision taken by the Council of Legal Education and though the Minister is empowered to make interventions and give directions, it should not be used in a sense to impose my decision on the Council. Therefore, since there is going to be a meeting with the Chief Justice tomorrow morning, this matter will be discussed with him and the need to make the necessary adjustments, if possible, would be made known to you.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The fact is, most of those people who are more than 35 years are already employed. Even during our time when we were students, there were so many who were of elderly age who had been co-students with us. We know that they also went through this difficulty of having to satisfy the attendance requirement.
