( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I would like to raise a matter of Privilege. "The Island" newspaper of today, in its front page, carries the headline Azwer says Opposition MP misbehaves in Parliament and in small letters, Ranil denies. Yesterday, when this matter came up, I happened to be in my office room. There was no other MP there. I came into the House and denied it; I said that that is an insult to Parliament if any room in Parliament, mine, yours or anyone elses, can be used for nefarious activity. The way that newspaper has reported it is really an insult to Parliament. It states "......Opposition MP misbehaves in Parliament".

So, I would like you to call up that newspaper. I would not take anymore of your time, Sir, because notice of this has been given to you by the Chief Opposition Whip. Since it is a reference to me, I thought I would take it up now as I have to go for another function. But, the Chief Opposition Whip will take it up in due course. We cannot allow Parliament to be insulted this way. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) point of Order ?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I did not refer to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition misbehaving yesterday or whatever it is. I mentioned about a previous day's action by somebody else. - [Interruption.]

[. . 3.27] ( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Vote of Condolence. Let me associate myself with the sentiments

expressed by the Hon. Leader of the House and also the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah on the demise of the Hon. Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah.

He was a very popular politician who was loved by the people all over the country. He was the Managing Director of the Jaffna Tamil daily newspaper, Namadu Eelanadu and also the Chairman of the Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society in his area. The Hon. Sivamaharajah had been the Secretary to the Leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front, the late Hon. A. Amirthalingam from 1977 to 1983. He thereafter joined the EROS in 1989 and became a Member of Parliament.

Following his resignation from the EROS, he joined the TULF in the year 2000 and contested the General Election in the same year and was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Jaffna Electoral District. Thereafter, he worked closely with the TULF Leader, the Hon. V. Anandasangaree until his split-up with the TULF, subsequent to which he joined the Hon. R. Sampanthan and the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchchi or the TNA in 2004. He contested the General Election in 2004 from the ITAK, but failed to get elected.

The Hon. Sivamaharajah was an active campaigner for the rights of people displaced by the conflict. Therefore, at this moment, on behalf of the United National Party, its Leader and all of us, may I take this opportunity to convey our deepest condolences to the members of the family of the late Hon. S. Sivamaharajah. May he attain the supreme bliss of emancipation!

Thank you. [. . 3.29] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today we are taking up the Vote of Condolence on the Hon. Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah, who was a senior member of the TULF. The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah made it very clear in his speech, all the major aspects of his human qualities. He had been the Secretary to the Leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front, the late Hon. A. Amirthalingam from 1977 to 1983. He was living in Tellippallai, very close to the Thurkkai Amman Kovil, which is very popular in Jaffna. As he was a great devotee of the Temple, he also associated himself in many forms in helping the Temple and the Hindu community whenever necessary. Being such an individual, thereafter, he joined the EROS - Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students - in the year 1989 and became a Member of Parliament.

Following his resignation from the EROS, he joined the TULF in the year 2000 and contested the General

1247 1248

Election in the same year and was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Jaffna Electoral District. He, thereafter worked very closely with the TULF Leader at that time, the Hon. V. Anandasangaree, until the division of the TULF, subsequent to which he joined the Hon. R. Sampanthan and the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchchi, which is commonly called as the TNA, in 2004. He contested the General Election in 2004 from ITAK, but failed to get elected.

As I stated earlier, he was living in the high security zone and unfortunately he met with his timely death also in the high security zone. He started a Tamil language newspaper called, Namadu Eelanadu, in Jaffna. He was also a former Member of Parliament, as I mentioned earlier, and a Member of the Tamil National Alliance. He also served as the President of the Consortium of Valikamam North Public Organizations. There, he was very an ardent supporter of the cooperative movement and had helped the cooperative movement in many ways, when very few people were supportive of it. He was a journalist of repute and at the time of his death, there were many more journalists and employees of the Tamil media, who underwent tragic circumstances. At that time, there had been many organizations that had come out openly and were very furious about the death of the Hon. Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah. He was an individual who was a great politician in the Tamil region, whom we have lost in the year 2006.

Therefore, we take this opportunity and respectfully convey our condolences to his family and I hope with the grace of God, he will attain moksha.

Thank you.

Sir, the late leader, Mr. Sivamaharajah, was a very devout TNA activist and he was shot dead on a Sunday night by an LTTE terrorist at his home in Tellippallai, Durgapuram, Jaffna. , 21.08.2006 '', '' :

" . . ."

It was a time of war and there were terrorist activities.

As a result of brutal, murderous and terrorist activities in this country, the Muslims were driven away from Jaffna. They had lived along with the Tamils with a brotherly feeling for centuries in Jaffna. Mr. Sivasithamparam had the courage and the guts to tell in this House, Until the Muslims return to that place, I will not go to Jaffna again. It is a historical mistake that was committed by the LTTE - I will not say by theTamil community, but by the LTTE. He said so in this House, and he went there not alive, but as a dead person.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of Parliament on the death of the Hon. Edmund Wijesuriya, ex-Member of Parliament. I shall direct the Acting Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family. Thank you. Next is, the Question of Privilege by the Hon. John Amaratunga.

: 2010.08.18 ... : ... 2010.08.18 PRIVILEGE : COMMENT MADE BY HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER ON 18.08.2010

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I wish to raise a Question of Privilege under Standing Order No. 24(6) with regard to the comment made by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, Member of Parliament, on 18th August, 2010 on the Floor of the House in the guise of raising a point of Order. That itself was not a point of Order and does not fall within the ambit of a point of Order and should not have been permitted to be raised, in the first instance. That is the first complaint.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Firstly, the Hon. Member had blatantly violated Standing Order No. 78 by interrupting Parliamentary Proceedings to make an announcement that, "This House should not be used for nefarious activities", claiming that an Opposition Member was misbehaving indecently in the Opposition Leaders room. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please do not disturb him. He is raising a matter of Privilege. - [Interruption.] After that, -

1257 1258

[ ]

2010 19

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is casting aspersions on - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Secondly, leaving apart the conduct of an ordinary Member, this is a very serious accusation on the Leader of the Opposition, which tantamount to willfully trying to tarnish his image. Soon after the accusation was made, Sir, you can remember, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, who was, at the time, in his office sitting at his desk, rushed to the Chamber and refuted the accusation of the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer stating that, at no instance, his room was given to any Member of the Opposition to hold meetings in his absence. - [Interruption.] Therefore, that is a blatant untruth uttered by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer in the guise of raising a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Furthermore, this incident has been given wide coverage in the media. For example, The Island newspaper of Thursday, 19th August, that is, of today, carries a news item in the front page under the caption, Azwer says Opposition MP misbehaves in Parliament. - [Interruption.] This is an attempt to tarnish the image of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in the eyes of the people as a national leader. Also, the newspaper had no right to publish this statement of the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, which amounted to violation of Standing Orders and should be called upon to appear before the Committee on Privileges to show cause as to why they published that news item without due permission of the Hon. Speaker.

If at all, occurrences of this nature had in fact taken place, it is our duty, whoever the Hon. Member is, to place it before the House in the proper manner in the form of a Substantive Motion. - [Interruption.] This whole issue has been willfully and intentionally fabricated and concocted by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to bring discredit to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and to tarnish his image. - [Interruption.] This is a very serious allegation by which the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer had not only discredited the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, but also misled this august Assembly. - [Interruption.] In other words, Sir, his statement appears to be as if the Leader of the Opposition - ( ) (An Hon. Member) My question is, what is the point you are raising? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The point I am raising is that he had referred to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition; he has no right to. - [Interruption.] Therefore, it is the unanimous view of the

Opposition that strong cognizance should be taken regarding this grave situation pertaining to Parliamentary Privileges of an Hon. Member of Parliament and that too, when it happens to be the Leader of the Opposition. - [Interruption.] Therefore, steps should be taken against the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer for his most disgraceful and unbecoming conduct as an Hon. Member of this House, to inquire into the matter and take whatever action deemed necessary against the Hon. Member for violating all norms of Parliamentary Privileges.

, .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have made your statement.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , Privilege Question . . -[ ] . . - - Substantive Motion . [ ] . . [ ] . "The Island" . What "The Island" newspaper has stated is a fair reporting of what happened in the House - [Interruption.] What happened in the House has been properly and fairly reported in "The Island" newspaper. Therefore, there should not be any persecution against "The Island" newspaper. [Interruption.] No, no. If he has got some information, it is his duty to place it before the Speaker and get the Speaker to inquire into that. [Interruption.] No, no. You cannot stop that. This is not a place where you inquire into the issues raised by an Hon. Member of Parliament. [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Azwer, please sit down. I will refer this matter to the Hon. Speaker. : 2010.08.18 " "
