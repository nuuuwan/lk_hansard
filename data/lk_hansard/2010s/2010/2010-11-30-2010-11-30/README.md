Mr. Chairman, I have another issue. I find that the institutions administering justice, as a practice, are divided between two Heads: some under the Ministry of Justice and the others under a special Vote.

The Court Martial is not there because it is the Judicial Service Commission which must decide who are the officers who administer justice. Under that, there is no Court Martial. The Court Martial is outside this. [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Chairman, I thank you for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Committee Stage Discussion. I would like to say a few words about the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, the Department of Elections, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the Department of Attorney-General and the Department of Legal Draftsman.

So far, members to the Public Service Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka have not been appointed. So, they are not functioning. Several complaints made to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption remain without being investigated. Even the Members to the Public Service Commission have not yet been appointed and I understand the work of the Public Service Commission is being attended to by the Secretaries to the Ministries. This is irregular. When we send an appeal to the Public Service Commission, it cannot be attended to by the Secretary to the Ministry. So, I kindly request the President to appoint the Members to the Public Service Commission as early as possible.

97 98

Then, take the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. The recommendations of the Human Rights Commission are not implemented by any of the departments; even the court has rejected its recommendations last week. So, some amendments, such as referring the recommendations to the Supreme Court, should be brought to the Human Rights Commission Act to enable implementation of the Commission's recommendations.

When the Seventeenth Amendment, which was passed by all the parties with a two-thirds majority was in force, members of all these Commissions were appointed by the President on the recommendations of the Constitutional Council. This was done to avoid political interference.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) They were nominated by the political parties and you say, "without political interference. How can it be so?

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) That is correct. We brought in the Seventeenth Amendment to avoid political interference. You accept it, do you?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Members to these Commissions were nominated by the political parties.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) That is correct. But, why was the Seventeenth Amendment brought in?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It was brought in to avoid interference. But, they could not function and that is why we brought in the Eighteenth Amendment.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The Eighteenth Amendment repeals the Seventeenth Amendment. So far, the Members of these Commissions have not been appointed. So, something has to be done immediately.

Then, let us take the Department of Attorney-General. For a number of years, the Department of Attorney-General was attached to the Ministry of Justice. When the Senate was there, the Minister of Justice was

appointed from the Senate, not from Parliament. That was done to ensure independence of the judiciary. But, now the Department of Attorney-General has been brought under the Presidential Secretariat. We expect the Attorney-General to be independent, at least to a certain extent, and there should not be any political interference on him. The same thing happened to the Department of Legal Draftsman. Earlier it was attached to the Ministry of Justice but now it has been brought under the Presidential Secretariat. So, can we expect these officials to be independent when they are being appointed by the President? Mr. Chairman, we want these officials to act independently.

I also want to mention in this House that former Commissioners of the Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption were not paid their salaries and they were compelled to go to the Supreme Court seeking redress. I request the Government to see that they are paid their salaries as early as possible.

Then, I would come to the Election Commission. According to the Seventeenth Amendment, the Election Commissioner had several powers. We want you to give all the powers that the Election Commissioner has in India to the Election Commissioner in Sri Lanka also. According to the Eighteenth Amendment, as you know, after a date for election is announced, he is debarred from issuing any directive. But, to have a free and fair election, would that be sufficient? I am posing this question to you. The Eighteenth Amendment has taken away all the powers which were given to the Election Commissioner by the Seventeenth Amendment. I kindly request the Government and the President to immediately take steps to appoint the Members to these various Commissions.

Now, I would like to say some words about the Cabinet. We have a record of having the largest Cabinet in the world. There are 60 Ministers and there are about 40 Deputy Ministers. Altogether, it comes to about 100. For a small country like Sri Lanka, where we have got only 20 million people, do you want about 100 Ministers? I understand that about Rs. 2,225,000 is spent monthly on this Cabinet. In Japan, where there are about 700 or 900 Members, there are only 20 Members in the Cabinet. Can you think about it? I would ask you to bring your Cabinet down. Whose money are you spending? It is not your money. It is the peoples money, tax payers money. You are only the trustee of the money that is handed over to you by the people. You have created a record in the world for having the largest Cabinet. Why are you spending so much of money on this? Are you satisfying the people or the Members of Parliament by doling Ministries out? There are still two or three Members expecting Deputy Minister posts.

Then, I will say some words about the crossovers also. When a person gets elected from one party and comes to Parliament and if he wants to crossover, he

99 100

[ . ]

2010 30

must resign from his Parliamentary seat. That was the position earlier.

Finally, Sir, I want these Commissions to act independently and I want the President to appoint the Members to these Commissions as early as possible. I hope the Hon. Prime Minister would have listened to me and would take necessary steps in this regard.

Thank you.

[. . 11.30] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Committee Stage Discussion of the Votes on the President, the Prime Minister and various other Ministries. Sir, I want to raise some issues concerning the Ministries of Civil Aviation and the Ports and Highways but I can see that none of the Ministers are present here. Prior to your coming to the Chair, Mr. Chairman, I told the Hon. Speaker that certain fundamental factors are not included in the information provided to us, which is wrong.

The most important thing is not what we think of our country, the important thing is what the people who live outside Sri Lanka think. That is the important thing. The opinion of the people living outside Sri Lanka is important, not what we say. We may shout in this House; we may have media supporting the Government, but that is not relevant. What is important is, what do the people living outside see when they read the websites and newspapers. What do they see? They see human rights violations, abductions, political prisoners and control of judiciary. That is what they see. [Interruption.] You cannot see it, but they can see it. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, at the outset I would like to quote a Latin saying :

"Dux erat ille ducum "

(Ovid, Heroides, Epic, (viii, 1:46)

The meaning is, "He was the leader of leaders". And Lord Alfred Tennyson in his "Idylls of the King" says, I quote:

"Fills him: I never saw him like: there lives No greater leader."

This is exactly the personality of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. He has taken Sri Lanka to Himalayan heights. Sri Lanka is now in a position where we could export expertise on how to eradicate terrorism. There is a global demand for this commodity.

Yesterday, one of the most distinguished leaders of Asia, the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari visited Parliament. What does he say? I quote the "Daily News" of 30th November, 2010:

President Zardari said Pakistan has material like cement in abundance while Sri Lanka has tea, rubber etc. in abundance. He said Sri Lanka has the environment to develop as a tourist destination

He also pointed out that there should be new technology developed to contain terrorism. Sir, I will table* this article because I have no time to read the whole thing.

And, the Hon. Speaker says, I again quote the "Daily News" of 30th November:

"Sri Lanka will always remember the solidarity extended by Pakistan at a time when Sri Lanka faced the menace of terrorism directed against our territorial integrity.

President Zardari said that he too was a victim of terrorism. With a grim face he recalled how his wife Madam Benazir Bhutto was mercilessly murdered in the City of Karachi. He said, now that the war is over, technology must be developed and this will help not only to eradicate terrorism but also to guard us against the volleys of gunshots and the bullets that will be directed towards us. This is exactly what is happening in the world.

Imam Khomeini said in our presence to His Excellency the President, "Sir, you must be the Leader of Asia" and it was reiterated at the United Nations.

When Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General wants to come here and probe into our activities, what did he say to our President? "Sir, people have given you a massive mandate. You assume the leadership of Asia". This is how they look at our President Mahinda Rajapaksa objectively.

Now, Sir, - hullabaloo - ? , gazette . . . . , . . Gazette Extraordinary No. 1681/3 of 22nd November, 2010. . . The duties and functions of the Minister (Senior) for Good Governance and Infrastructure listed in this Gazette are:

Promotion of good governance in the state sector in order to achieve development targets envisaged in the Mahinda Chinthana - Vision for the Future.

It is very clear. The appointment of Senior Ministers together with the other Ministers has been meticulously and so brilliantly done by the Executive Head of this country. Now, look for example, at the duties and functions of the Minister (Senior)for International Monetary Co-operation listed in the Gazette.

Co-ordination of activities relevant Ministries related to subject areas..

And it goes on:

Representing the Government at high level meetings of International Financial Institutions.

How nice! What more do you want? It is very clearly written. Only the blind will not be able to read these things, Sir. I am sorry to say that this may be due to the disturbed on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. Erskine May has said that the post of Opposition Leader is very, very important in a democracy. I told this the other day also. Why is he behaving like this? We are sometimes reminded of the "Amdan", the famous TNL television show and also Mr. Bean, created by that swollen headed bullfrog

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] of the Matara marshes - a character created by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. We wish that he remains in the post of the Leader of the Opposition forever because that will do us good. Then, Sir, now he has - [Interruption.] Yes, he must keep him very close to him, so that there will not be any danger to others in the country. Then, Sir, with regard to the Ministries concerned, here I have -

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have one more minute, please.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me about five more minutes from the time allotted to the Government Members.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I have no authority to do that. You have only one more minute.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Now, Sir, we must always remember the people who make it possible and convenient for us to function in Parliament. To begin with, in the Presidents Office I should mention the Presidents Secretary, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, an eminent and versatile personality from the Rahula dynasty in the South. Then, there is, Mr. Gamini Senarath, Additional Secretary and Chief of Staff, Mr. D.S. Gunaratne, Additional Secretary, then the President's Co-ordinating Secretary in Parliament, Mr. Kumarasiri Hettige, Mr. Keerthi, Director/Transport and all able officers at the Presidential Secretariat and Temple Trees - the assistance given by all these people encourage us greatly.

Sir, in Parliament, all the people from the Speaker to the minor staff help us immensely. The entire staff of Parliament were able to control the floods that came to ravage this place the other day. They had to pump away 4,000 litres of water from this place. There is an X-ray machine at the entrance. It was brought here by a crane. But, our able-bodied men rose up to the occasion and were able to carry it by hand. Those are the courageous people. There is a minor staff of about 700 ably managed by Weerasiri Ranasinghe, the Arachchi. Also, the Hansard Department, the Interpreters' Department and then, all in the Table Office, the Manager of the Restaurant and his staff, the Police personnel, the Manager and others of the Bank and Post Office, the resident Doctor and his staff - they all gave their best to save our lives on that day.

, . . . 5, 10 . case . , Mr. A.M.A. Azeez, niece, Ms. Zainab Abdeen, Dane Estate, Rakwana. 2 . , . Mr. Selliah Kumarasamy has served for more than 50 years. He has been working here since 1956. He has worked in the Senate, House of Representatives, National State Assembly. Then, we have clever people like Mr. K.A. Rahulan, who did a wonderful job here and who is at present working in the Presidents Office. Like that, Sir, we must have a programme to felicitate these people when they retire. Mr. S. Kumarasamy is still in service for us. .

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. R. Yogarajan please. You have got 20 minutes.

[. . 6.19]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Chairman, on this occasion when the Votes on His Excellency the President, several Commissions, the Ministry of Ports and Highways, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, the Ministry of National Heritage and the Ministry of Culture and the Arts are being discussed, I am pleased to make some contribution.

Usually, in the Committee Stage Discussion, we may have one or two Ministries for a day. Today, with over 50 Cabinet Ministers we are debating five or six Ministries in a day and we saw the Hon. T.B. Ekanayake was struggling to finish his speech within the 10 minutes allotted to him because there were so many Ministers who had to share the time today. This situation has been brought about because the Cabinet is expanding so much.

In fact, I was reading the list of Senior Ministers, Minister (Senior) for Good Governance and Infrastructure, Minister (Senior) for Human Resources, Minister (Senior) for Rural Affairs, Minister (Senior) for Food and Nutrition, Minister (Senior) for Urban Affairs, Minister (Senior) for Social Welfare, Minister (Senior) for Consumer Welfare, Minister (Senior) for National Resources, Minister (Senior) for Scientific Affairs and the Minister (Senior) for International Monetary Co-operation and I feel that these 10 Ministries together with, maybe, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should have made a Cabinet for this country of 20 million people and not a Cabinet of more than 50 Ministers. I keep on saying more than 50 because I do not really know how many Cabinet Ministers are there. This is the situation in the country today.

We have just finished celebrations and one of the newspapers carried an item that the celebrations of the inauguration of His Excellency the President cost Rs. 5 billion. A sum of Rs. 5 billion is not a small amount for a small country like ours. A sum of Rs. 5 billion could solve the road problem in the plantation areas where there are only 10,000 kilometres of roads, maybe we could have built 5,000 kilometres of roads. But, Sir, you spent it all off.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Where did you get that figure from? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is in the newspapers. The Daily Mirror states that Rs. 5,000 million has been spent.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) "Rs. 5 billion" is totally false. You are just talking nonsense.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Then, why did the Government not deny that?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We are in the Committee Stage Discussion. Okay, I will answer. "Rs. 5 billion for the presidential inauguration" is totally a false statement. Can you substantiate your statement?

233 234

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will substantiate that with the newspaper cutting. I do not have it today. I will bring it. Okay, if you deny that, tell that newspaper that it is not true.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Member, newspapers news are not always correct. Do not go by newspapers. Today, you can plant anything in the newspapers. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Hon. S. M. Krishna, Minister of External Affairs of India, was here three or four days ago. He has again reminded this Government of the need for a political solution. This Government which has won the war has not won peace. Only a political solution can bring permanent peace to this country. Are you ever going to offer a political solution to the people of the North and the East? - [Interruption.] Yesterday, the TNA with great hope said that they would not vote against your Budget. They said that they would abstain from voting. - [Interruption.] They do not realize that abstaining from voting alone is not going to inspire you to give them a political solution. - [Interruption.] There are so many Members of Parliament who crossed over to your side to support the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Have they been looked after? Those who crossed this Floor to support your Government have been ignored. - [Interruption.] Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne, you crossed this Floor and went to that side leaving the party of your father. What are you? You are the Minister of Productivity Promotion. - [Interruption.] Your father was a great man, a former Cabinet Minister of Labour. You have got just a fraction of that Ministry. Are you satisfied?- [Interruption.]

Sir, today we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs and also -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . [ ]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is okay. Now, there is the Urban Development Authority. The Hon. Prime Minister as the Hon. Minister of Religious Affairs said that no temples are being destroyed. In Colombo, off Bauddhaloka Mawatha, there is a road called Ashroff Lane. In this Lane, there is a Muslim mosque which was built in 1942. Last week, the

Urban Development Authority has come there and said that they are going to demolish that. It was built in 1942. Hon. Prime Minister, I call upon you because you are a person with a great heart - [Interruption.] You want to look after all the religions equally. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

) (The Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Yogarajan is trying to instil communal problems. It is utter rubbish. There is no scheme like that, no place like that. Let him have his problems sorted out in Colombo or there. Do not drag us into this; do not do that. You are damaging the Muslim community. Do not do that. Who told you all this rubbish? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you may speak. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Azwer, if there is no proposal to demolish - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me; let me speak .[Interruption.]

) (The Chairman) Do not disturb the Hon. Member on feet.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Azwer, if there is no proposal to break or demolish that mosque, I leave it to you to protect that mosque.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You need not teach us, Hon. Yogarajan. - [Interruption.] Mind your own business - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This is my business, Hon. Azwer. I have to speak on behalf of the people of this country. - [Interruption.] The

235 236

2010 30

people of Colombo have voted for me in the past. I am defending their rights - [Interruption.] The Hon. Prime Minister, when he assumed office as the Minister for Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, invited us - all Members of Parliament of different religions for a meeting in this Parliament. Sir, you said that there was Rs. 75 million voted to your Ministry. You said that you would be doing a lot of development work for Hindu Temples also. But, Sir, unfortunately you did not receive the funds that were allocated. You did not receive that to implement those programmes. We are very sad about it. We know that you are very keen to look after the mosques, the churches and the Buddhist and Hindu temples. But, unfortunately no money was given to you. - [Interruption.] You have not been given that money. The Department for Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs has received only Rs. 10 million. - [Interruption.]

.. ( ..) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne) You have to ask the people there. You have to ask them how we spent this money on mosques, temples and kovils. You ask them how much we have paid. You do not know anything. You have not gone there - [Interruption.] You are in Colombo. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, your Ministry has received only Rs. 10 million.

.. ( ..) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne) You are in Colombo. You are in boutiques. - [Interruption.] You do not know anything. You have not gone to the kovils. That is why you are speaking like this here - [Interruption.] .

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) There are no planters in Colombo - [Interruption.] . . . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Prime Minister. Do not get angry. This is a fact. You know it very well. Anyway I will speak about - [Interruption/] I do not want to hurt you, Sir. You are an honourable Gentleman.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne) We are religious people. You are not a religious man. You do not have a religion. [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We do not take religions. We are born into a religion. [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) What is your religion?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Why do you ask that? Is that important? In this House, my race or my religion is not important. It is what I speak that is important. [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne) Do you know that I myself built a kovil for the Tamil people there. I have done everything for them. What did you do?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, we are still two months after the Eighteenth Amendment and awaiting the setting up of the Independent Commissions. The Election Commission was never set up. Last week we had a Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils. At the Consultative Committee, we discussed the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill. At that time, the Department of Elections had sent certain recommendations on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill. But, that was not even presented to the Consultative Committee. It was held by the Government, only a part of it was read and one amendment which we proposed was in conformity with that - [Interruption.] Just one of those amendments that we proposed was in conformity with the Election Commissioners recommendations and it was accepted. Sir, because it is the Department of Elections, this report was sent only to the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils. If it was an independent Election Commission this would have been made available even to other political parties in the Opposition. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I wish to say a few things about the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The Ministry of Civil Aviation under which Mihin Air and SriLankan Airlines come is being

237 238

discussed today. SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Air have been given a tax holiday, but the Sri Lankan Airlines is exploiting the people. Sir, the distance from Colombo to Chennai is 685 kilometres. The fare is Rs. 15,300 which works out to Rs. 22.35 per kilometre. [Interruption.] The distance from Colombo to Trichy is 450 kilometres and the charge is Rs. 23,000 which works out to Rs. 51 per kilometre, whereas the distance from Colombo to London is 8,700 kilometres but the fare is only Rs. 89,000 which works out to Rs. 10.22 per kilometre. The distance from Colombo to Paris is 8,500 kilometres and the fare is Rs. 99,000 which works out to only Rs.11.64 per kilometre. - [Interruption.] Sir, why is this discrimination? SriLankan Airlines is running - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) Are you trying to teach mathematics? [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You do not understand both, it looks like. I think you do not understand both. - [Interruption.] So, why is that? For Chennai and for Trichy it is Rs. 22 and Rs. 51 per kilometre respectively, whereas for London and Paris it is Rs. 10 and Rs. 11. per kilometre respectively. This is exploitation of a section of the people who -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Yes, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the point of Order is, SriLankan Airlines . Sir, it is a flying beauty.

( ) (The Chairman) The Hon. Member, you continue with your speech. You have only one more minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Chairman. So, why are we being exploited? We are people with Indian connections; we have friends; we have relatives; we have social

obligations; we have to go often to India. But, we are paying five times the fare that a man who travels to London is paying. Further, what is the fare to Jaffna? A sum of Rs. 18,000 is charged for a distance of 300 kilometres by Heli Tours. This works out to Rs. 60 per kilometre. Why are you exploiting the citizens of this country who have to go to their homes in Jaffna for an emergency?

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, Sir, I am concluding. They have to pay Rs. 60 per kilometre, whereas somebody else who goes to London pays only Rs. 10 per kilometre. Sir, this is the way it is happening and I hope this Government will take these statistics into account and do justice to all the people in this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Chairman) . 10 .

I wholeheartedly support the setting up of cadet corps in all schools where there are a sufficient number of students. When I was in Singapore recently, I met this young man, Junaid Ameen who is studying in Singapore. He told me that he has been conscripted for military training and for two years he must be in the Army for this training. Getting such a training is very important in order to combat terrorism in the future. While educating you can make a very good citizen, a disciplined citizen, a mind-developed citizen and also a patriotic citizen. Being a member of cadet corps would definitely help to instil a sense of patriotism in students.

291 292

2010 30

Those days, during the private school days, even before Dr. C.W.W. Kannangaras free education scheme, Cadet Corps was in existence. I remember at my alma mater, Zahira College, there was a cadet corps and scouting. Our boys came out with flying colours. They won the Queens Cup for shooting and cadeting. I still remember our great teacher, Captain Muhlar, who instilled a sense of patriotism and discipline in the minds of the students. Therefore, setting-up of a cadet corps in schools is very essential, Sir. also states this very clearly, - - Therefore, Sir, it is already there in the mind of the President, for implementation.

Also I would quote from the Budget Speech 2011. Under the heading, Sports Economy, paragraph No. 80, states:

. the Kreeda Shakthi initiative for sportsmen with notable talents will be expanded to train our youth.

That is in one area. The introduction of cadet corps and scouting in schools is very essential. As much as swimming is important, scouting is also important for self-discipline. You can create a disciplined force. When they come out after training, Sir, they become fully-fledged citizens to face any situation in the country; free this country from terrorism, if any, in the future and also help the nation grow and move forward progressively.

Sir, in this respect, it is worthwhile stating that this is a matter which should attract the attention of everyone in this country, should such a situation arise in the future. This is what His Excellency Asif Ali Zardari, the President of Pakistan also said: the battle is over but the war is still not fully over. You must use modern technology to combat terrorism. If there are bullets coming on to you, you must be able to prevent that, stop that. So, technologically we must advance in order to combat terrorism and that training would be given initially from the schools to the young students through the cadet corps that is proposed to be set up.

Private schools have cadet corps, Sir. I can remember S.L.M. Shafie Marikar, the Principal of Zahira College, which is a private school. He helped other private schools such as St. Josephs College, St. Peters College, St. Benedicts College and other colleges to get cadeting. After the takeover of schools, perhaps these disciplines fell through. There is a yawning gap now. But, in other countries, while studying it is an essential to get this exercise. Sir, I commend this Motion to the House.

Thank you. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane - Minister of Education) , , ,
