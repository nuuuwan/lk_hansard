( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem)

Hon Speaker, I am not asking a Supplementary Question. I am on a point of Order. Going through this Question, I begin to question the very propriety of a Question of this nature. Question time has been utilized to ask for the names of the foreign dignitaries who visited the Chief Minister. But, one Question seems quite mischievous - "on whose invitations those foreign dignitaries arrived" and "the matters those dignitaries discussed?" I think this is quite unbecoming of the United National Party which is committed to devolution, to be asking a Question of this nature. [Interruption.] I am questioning the very propriety of this Question. My Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is fully within his rights to ask a Question of this nature. But, what prompts that? Why is it unbecoming of a Chief Minister to invite foreign dignitaries to visit him? I mean, is it a God-given right of only the Members of Parliament at the centre or the Ministers to receive foreign dignitaries? This is a very mischievous Question and the tone and tenor of the Question appears to convey that it is quite contrary to the accepted norms for a Chief Minister to receive foreign dignitaries. I mean, this is very unbecoming. I raise a question of propriety on the very fact that this Question was allowed to be asked in this fashion.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Speaker, as the Hon. Rauff Hakeem mentioned my name, I would like to give a reply - [Interruption.] As a Member of Parliament, I have a right to ask that Question. [Interruption.] I would like to tell that we, as the United National Party, can look after the provincial councils, the national council - [Interruption.] I am sorry. My name has been referred to. Therefore, I need to reply. [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No, no. I have not concluded. - [Interruption.] Sir, my Question is of a mischievous nature only to the persons who think it is mischievous. What I am asking on behalf of the Central Government is, as to how much money has been utilized by the Provincial Council owing to the fact that the Provincial Council is receiving foreign dignitaries. I do not understand the devious nature - [Interruption.] as to why - [Interruption.]

Mr. Speaker, I am on a point of Order. What is the propriety in asking such a Question? Why do Parliamentarians want to know about matters that foreign dignitaries or somebody else have discussed with a provincial Chief Minister or others? It is very unbecoming - [Interruption.]

(b) Will he inform this House,- (i) whether about 300 hapless families had lost around 3000 acres of their chena lands as a result of elephants from surrounding jungles being brought and penned inside an electrical fence constructed within this farming land located at the Koanketiara village since September 2009; (ii) if so, whether action will be taken to return these farming lands to these destitute chena farmers who have lost their lands?

Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, being a senior politician in this country, is misleading the whole House and taking for granted that he can speak on any subject, not only on the subject before the House. Today, we are debating three Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act which was very well explained by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama. If the Hon. Leader of the Opposition wants to speak for the Hon. General Sarath Fonseka, then, we also should be allowed to speak about the Hon. General Sarath Fonseka, what he did to Major General Parakrama Pannipitiya. That is a different subject, I am not going to take it up. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition must set an example to his followers on his side. We know that today he is in a brawl; he is in a boiling pot. That is why -

Sir, take the time out of them, not mine. I am making a personal explanation. The Hon. Member does not know the Standing Orders. That is the problem. I can make a personal explanation at any time I want, and to do that I have taken time from my speech and I thereby saved the time of this House.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Okay, Sir. I take this opportunity to reflect on the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act that was tabled in Parliament a couple of days ago. As you know, I took this matter up in the morning in order to enlighten the Hon. Members of this House that as per Article 148 of the Constitution, the entire public finance comes under the august Assembly, the Parliament.

As you know, in 2002, owing to the sagacity of the UNP and the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, we wanted financial discipline to be brought in. As a resultant factor, we brought in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 and Section 16 of the said Act ensures that after a publication of a Proclamation or Order requiring the holding of a General Election, the financial status of the country needs to be brought out. This Act was tabled in Parliament. According to this Act, the contingent liability that is foreseen by the Government should be highlighted to Parliament. Unfortunately, this has been cleverly concealed and not disclosed to this House. I table* in this House the documents which have been submitted by the Central Bank under Reference Numbers 8R6A and 8R7A which highlight the fact that there is a contingent liability of almost US Dollars 818 million which the Government of Sri Lanka is supposed to be confronted with. It is roughly Rs. 100 billion. So, Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, it is incumbent on you to ensure that you enlighten this House as to how you intend overcoming such a burden because this is equivalent to almost 10 per cent of your last years total debt. The debt has increased in huge amounts. As I mentioned before, from 2005 to 2010, the public debt has increased almost by 253 per cent. So, as a result of that, Rs. 100 billion is -[ ] , . contingent liability . , , . , " " . , ", , " . . . Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act . . ? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

-- ; . . , - - . - [ ] , . Sir, what I want to say is, please ensure that Parliament is treated with decorum, respect and integrity. I also want to say that the Hon. Members of this Parliament are able to discern what is being told. Even though the Government seems to be having a steamrolling majority, it does not mean that they have got to steamroll the Opposition. Remember, I said that we have a team of experts. Even though we may not have the quantity, we have the quality to ensure that the hypocrisy being administered by you is highlighted at any given moment. So, ensure it is corrected to give the true picture. If there is a problem, solve it because after all, this is our economy. This is not the SLFP economy or the Rajapaksa economy. It is Sri Lankas economy.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

So, let us work together and ensure that you do not bring any more burden on the people of this country. Thank you. [. . 11.37]
