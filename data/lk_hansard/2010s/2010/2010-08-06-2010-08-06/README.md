Azwer) Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I also very briefly add my sentiments on the demise of this great son of the Ruhuna, Senator Dickson Silva Hendavitharana. I am particularly happy to revive his memory in this House since he had been a very good friend of the Muslims. I remember very well that in Matara, Gandara and also in Dikwella, he had a large number of Muslim friends.

As the Hon. Minister Felix Perera stated, he cultivated the habit of speaking to each community in the language they knew: in Sinhala, Tamil and English. I had the opportunity of going with His Excellency the President to the Maldives. The people of the Maldives and particularly the Minister of Fisheries there made inquiries about the Hon. Dickson Silva Hendavitharana; the Hon. Felix Perera, Minister of Social Services, will remember. He was an endearing personality. He helped the fishermen in countries of this region as well, particulary in the Maldives.

When the people of the Matara District and the Muslims in Gandara appealed to him, he helped to develop Muslim schools in all spheres of education, particularly Al Minhaj Vidyalaya in Dikwella. The Muslims in the Matara District still speak highly of him and they remain very grateful to him, Sir.

He had been a dynamo in work. As Chairman of the Fisheries Corporation, he used to visit Mutwal when we lived there. By the way, I should recall a nostalgic sentiment. Those harbour quarters at Dockland, Mutwal were built by my beloved father, the late Mr. M.I.A. Hameed. He was the Head Overseer of Port Commission, Colombo at that time. My Father also knew the Hon. Dickson Silva Hendavitharana and as a result, he became almost a family friend of ours.

Though it was stated here that he was the last Senator to die, there are three other Senators still living amidst us, Sir. We must not forget them. One is the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake, who was also a distinguished Member of this House, a very senior Parliamentarian and a very senior member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Then, there is the Hon. Jinadasa Niyathapala, who was also a Member of this House representing the Kotte Electorate. He was a Senator too. He is still among the living. Then, there is also the Hon. Alhaj Z.M. Mashoor Moulana, whom we all know very well. He was elected a Senator through the House of Representatives as a Federal Party Member. He is today the Mayor of Kalmunai, doing everything possible to develop that area. He deserves our full co-operation, Sir. Those three persons should also be remembered in this House, though we are paying our respect to the memory of Senator Dickson Silva Hendavitharana. We pray that the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake, the Hon. Jinadasa Niyathapala and the Hon. Alhaj Z.M. Mashoor Moulana be given long and healthy lives so that they would continue to serve wherever they are.

Sir, the Hon. Dickson Silva Hendavitharna was like a "Sando". He worked very hard, tirelessly all the time. He had a healthy body and a healthy mind too and he was very robust. He was not afraid to face adversity that would come against his political thought and philosophy. He faced every situation very courageously. That is why he was able to carry aloft the flag of the SLFP in that area very enthusiastically and with a great sense of will power. At one time, we were rather his adversaries. When the Hon. Ronnie de Mel was contesting the By-election of Devinuwara and also other by-elections and elections, we were on the Hon. Hendavitharana's opposite side. But, he was very friendly with us and whenever we met him, patting us on the shoulder, he would ask, "

? ?"

Sir, when you are presiding, it is very appropriate to recall at this moment the name of your great beloved father, the Hon. S.D.R. Jayaratne. I was very close to

885 886

[ ]

2010 06

him. I was in charge for 15 years of the Puttalam Electorate at that time and I used to visit your father very often at his residence at Madampe. I recall today that I, as the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, introduced the Passes for the ex-Members of Parliament to visit this House freely without facing any embarrassment of being searched, as other ordinary citizens have to undergo here. I have visited his house. When I visited your house - you were a small child at that time - and handed over the Parliament Pass, tears came to his eyes and he hugged me endearingly. Incidentally, we invited here the former Speaker, Hon. Stanley Tillekeratne and presented him the pass, when he was alive. Another ex-Minister to whom I went was the Hon. D.P.R. Wickremasinghe, another SLFP stalwart. He was also a Minister of Fisheries. He represented the Mawathagama Electorate. You know him. Sir, we remember great moments like these.

Hon. Dickson Silva also took a very keen interest, I must mention here, in developing the fisheries and the fishery harbours. He went even to Cod Bay in Trincomalee and the Beruwala Harbour. Today, this is being very progressively carried forward by the present Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne under the aegis of His Excellency the President. Then, he helped to develop Galle, Kudawela, Kirinda, Puranawella, Kalpitiya, Tangalle, Negombo, Panadura, Hikkaduwa, Modera and Mirissa fisheries harbours. He went to the North; he saw the fishermen of Mannar, Mailiddy and Valaichenai in the East. He was very progressive-minded with a will to work for the poor fishermen. As his nephew, the Hon. Dillip Wedaarachchi, who was speaking today said, his uncle did not influence him to come to his side. But, looking at things dispassionately today, I would request and appeal to my brother-like, the Hon. Dilip Wedaarachchi, in considering the vast developments taking place in the country and the present political scenario, that in order to charter your future, you will have no other progressive step to follow rather than follow the "Mahinda Chintana", which you will agree, I keep with me in Parliament in all three languages. Had Senator Dickson Silva Hendavitharana lived today, he would have followed the footsteps, which would galvanize forces towards President Mahinda Rajapaksa, towards the progressive forces in the country in order to build a united and economically-sound Sri Lanka. I hope you will take my advice seriously.

Sir, the Hon. Dickson Silva Hendavitharana served in the Senate from 22nd October, 1967 to 1st October, 1971, almost for four years. I would at this moment express my sentiments and condolence to Mrs. Prema Wedaarachchi, his beloved wife, his son, Provincial Council Member, Mr. Thilanga Hendavitharana, (, ), (), (, , ), (, ), and all other family members. Also, on behalf of the Muslims of the Southern Province,

I would also take this opportunity in this House to pay our respect to the memory of late the Hon. Dickson Silva Hendavitharana. In accord with his belief, may he attain the highest bliss hereafter!

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . , , . 1970 . .

ADJOURNMENT ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Kumara Welgama - Minister of Transport) , " " .

. .Question proposed.

EVACUATION OF PEOPLE FROM HOMES ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity to move the following Adjournment Motion on a very sensitive matter; a matter of humane nature.

I move:

The Government, in the guise of enhancing security in the Colombo District has, in the recent past, been sending letters of evacuation to people who have been living continuously and unabatedly for over 25 years in the same place.

This exercise has been expedited owing to the fact that the Government has secretively entered into an agreement with a foreign company which requires people to be evicted from houses before commencing work.

The innocent people (over 1,500 families) living on either side of the railway tracks from the Port of Colombo upto Kolonnawa, are helpless as they have been told to evacuate before the 21st of August 2010. I am informed that this

can extend to other areas as well from the Colombo District to the Kalutara Distict and finally to the Galle District.

Therefore, will this Government, that talks of human decency and projecting to be fighting against injustice, ensure that the people are found suitable alternative accommodation before inhumanly breaking down these houses

just to satisfy a requirement that has arisen owing to the fact that the Railway Department has entered into an agreement with a foreign company.
