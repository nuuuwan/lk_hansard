[. . 2.14] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed on the Vote of Condolence of the late Hon. (Prof.) Kamal Karunanayake. Sir, I knew him well because he also hails from the Gampaha District.

The most outstanding feature that was seen in his bio-data was that he was the first student to enter the university from Nalanda Vidyalaya, Minuwangoda. It was a great thing for that school at that time to have a student admitted to the university and he thereafter obtained a Degree in Economics. He did not stop there but proceeded to obtain the PhD in Economics and was considered a great asset to Sri Lanka. It was due to all those considerations that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party decided to nominate him as a Member in the National List. From his early days, he has been a very active youth leader contributing a great deal to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Also, in his record we see that he has even been recognized abroad. In some of the African countries, he has been a visiting consultant and a professor. He has also served in the Department of Inland Revenue of Sri Lanka holding a post of Assessor.

Sir, all in all, much has been said about him. I do not want to repeat. One thing that I saw in him was that he believed in gentleman politics. He was a gentleman to the very letter since he never indulged in thuggery or misconduct in his political affairs. And, we are today sorry that he is no more. His services, both in the fields of education and the politics, has been duly recognized. I wish to extend my sympathies to the family of late Hon. (Prof.) Kamal Karunanayake. [. . 2.17]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, before I start the eulogy on the late Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa, I want to express my regret that I was not able to be present today on time, during the first round, to ask the three Oral Questions listed under my name in the Order Paper. Sir, today being a Friday, you know, on Fridays Muslims have to attend Jummah prayers. As I mentioned to you in the Chamber, I would kindly request you, - to enable not only the Muslim Members in the House but also a large number of Muslim officers who are working in the Hansard Department, Interpreters Office, Table Office and other offices in Parliament to attend Jummah prayers - to have the Sittings commenced at 1.30 p.m. on Fridays henceforth, as it had been done earlier. I hope you would kindly discuss this matter with the Leaders of all parties.

Sir, I got to know about the late Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa when I went to Gal-Oya at the initial stages, when the Gal-Oya Development Scheme was mooted and was made a reality by the late Father of the Nation, Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake. My father-in-law, the late Mr. M.M.A. Sameem was the first storekeeper of the Gal-Oya Development Board. I know the Hon. P. Dayaratne, who is an illustrious figure in the House also went there from the Southern Province. He knew that our family associated with the Hon. Dayaratnes parents and the parents of late Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa, their relatives, and also with the relatives of the Hon. Chandradasa Galappatty, a former Member of Parliament. They formed a triple brotherhood in this House, I should say, at that time, because they represented the same area, the Ampara Electorate and thereafter, the Digamadulla District.

Sir, there were also three other Members of Parliament representing that area at that time, the founder of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, the late Hon. U.L.M. Mohideen, Attorney-at-Law and the Hon. H.M. Weerasinghe. Sir, the Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa developed a sense of brotherhood with the Muslims of the East. He associated

closely with many of the illustrious figures like Gate Mudliyar, M.S. Kariapper , Mr. M.M. Musthapha, Mr. A.R. Munsoor, Mr. M.C. Ahamed and Mr. M.A. Abdul Majeed who was the most senior member who represented Samanthurai and Digamadulla Electorates in this House for a very long period of over 32 years.

There, Sir, I had occasions to meet Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa and he was such a friendly gentleman. He had developed a very close relationship with the farming communities. Sir, when I visited that electorate the other day, I saw vast acres, thousands and thousands of acres of paddy being harvested. Recently, at the COPE meeting, the Chairman of the Department of Agrarian Development of the Ministry of Agriculture told us that 25 per cent of paddy will come from Batticaloa, in the Eastern Province, and there is going to be a bumper harvest this time. It is really the Granary of the East.

The Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa devoted most of his time in developing agriculture. I used to meet him with my cousin Dr. M. Haris Z. Deen and my brother-in-law, the late Mr. M.S.M. Muaffeek. When we were once travelling from Ampara to Hambantota through Tanamalwila to Colombo, he was talking to us at that time about the development of this area - a vast track of jungle land for the betterment of the community. I noticed that Hon. Bakmeewewa also had a vision, when we were travelling with him through that jungle track. I have a newspaper Lankadeepa with me which states how well His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has developed that area. It states: " - ".

He created a miracle in pioneering this massive project when, Mr. Speaker, you were the Minister in charge of the subject and you were credited with honour in accomplishing this task. I have got a document here to say that the Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa liked it. He says, "This is a novel harbour that has been built. There is no parallel to this in any part of the world". Harbours are built in water but this is a land plot utilized in order to put up this impressive harbour which will make Sri Lanka economically a strong country. The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa was also there at that time. Sir, the Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa had a keen interest in developing that area, Yala, Eastern Province, Kumana, coming up to Tanamalwila and Hambantota. Now, this is a reality. That is what I say, Sir, looking at these things and knowing the Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewas good intentions. I associated with him in this House for 15 years. We took part in several agitations and campaigns during that time. He was a very silent worker. He had a hidden talent in him. He wanted this country to be developed because he came from a remote area and belonged to almost a farming community. He studied in a school in Ampara and then he entered politics I think, as a Member in the Ampara Urban Council and later his brother Mr. M.S. Bakmeewewa was also in the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna.

Sir, Hon. Nihal Yasendra Bakmeewewa was born on 19th May, 1943 and breathed his last on 23rd November, 2006. He was in the Second Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka beginning from 9th March, 1989; in the Third Parliament from 25th August, 1994 and also in the Fourth Parliament from 18th October, 2000 and had a distinguished service. He was also a very distinguished Member in this august Assembly and he served the people being in Parliament for 12 years, 4 months and 28 days. May he attain blissful eternity, as he believed according to his religion.

Thank you, Sir.

... ... PERSONAL EXPLANATION BY HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, a reference has been made to me by the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana in this House, which was published by some sections of the media yesterday; that was on 19th August, 2010.

He seems to have said that the dates given by the Saudi Arabian Government had been taken home by me. I am happy that he acknowledges the fact that the Saudi Arabian Government has been giving me dates, not today or yesterday, but for the last several years or decades. Surely, I take those cardboard boxes and packet them at home and bring them to be distributed here and elsewhere, not only to the Hon. Members of this House, but to others too, including those of the media. Does he want me to take those boxes to his house? Crazy, is it not, Sir?

As a result of the abundance goodwill and fraternal relationship I have developed with Muslim countries, I receive gifts of dates during the holy month of Ramazan. From the time I was the Minister of Islamic Religious and Cultural Affairs to date, I am privileged to receive those luscious "fruits of the desert" from those countries. Even the earlier Speakers, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, and other Hon. Members including the Hon. John Amaratunga, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana and others have received dates from me in the past. It is not a new phenomenon. I do this because of the goodwill I have built with you.

I can give dates only to the Muslims and keep quiet, Hon. John Amaratunga, but I give it to others also in this House. I used to distribute these Ramazan gifts not only to the Muslims in Parliament, but also to the non-Muslim members, other officers including the minor employees, the police and media personnel et cetera. - [Interruption.] , - , - . .

( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) ?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) ? large boxes

. . . ? [ ] , , .

I have cultivated this habit as an expression of our goodwill and friendship shown to members of other communities.

The reference the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana made in this House is totally biased and is a matter of much regret. When he made this malicious reference in this House on 18th August, 2010, he least realized the fact that I had already distributed the dates the day before to the Muslims working in this House. After that, I have started distributing those as gifts to the other members also.

I have even given dates from Saudi Arabia to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe when he was Prime Minister and also to his beloved mother, Mrs. Esmond Wickremasinghe. In fact, she wrote to me, thanked me and appreciated the kind gesture. "They were so sweet", she said. I have great admiration for this gracious lady, Sir. I have given dates to the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, who is in this House, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera and to the then Speaker, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike. From the Chair, he wrote me a letter, which I still have with me, stating, "Azwer, you must be in this House purely for the sake of my tasting this luscious fruit, forever". - [Interruption.] I have given dates even to the people at Siri Kotha. Do you know them, Hon. John Amaratunga? - [Interruption.] , . I have given dates to Yvonne, Chithra Medagedara, Abeysekera and all the others at Siri Kotha at that time. - [Interruption.] Ask them, they will tell you.

Sir, I avail myself of this opportunity in this House to thank His Excellencies, the Ambassadors of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, UAE, Kuwait - even of Iraq - and other Muslim countries, for supplying dates from their countries to all Mosques in Sri Lanka during this holy month of Ramazan and also to the tsunami victims.

Sir, I also take this opportunity to offer the Hon. Speaker, all the Hon. Members of this august Assembly and the staff, the Blessings of the holy month of Ramazan. Now, let us go home happily - Ramalan-ul-Mubarak!

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) What about the dates for us?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) If you want, I will give you. Do you want dates?

, the Hon. John Amaratunga is asking for dates. I will give you tomorrow. Thank you.
