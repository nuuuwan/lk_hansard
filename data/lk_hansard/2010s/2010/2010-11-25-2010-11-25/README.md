Sir, again I quote:

With the launching of prudent monetary policies by the Central Bank and the end of the terrorist war in May 2009,

Sri Lanka was able to reverse the downward economic swing. The economy once again picked up with the growth rate rising. . "

It further states:

"This growth rate more than doubled with 7% and 8.5 % (on a point to point basis) in the first and second quarters of this year

respectively. Unemployment was coming down and gross official reserves reached an unprecedented level of US$ 6 billion in the third quarter, sufficient to meet cost of imports of nearly seven months".

"G-20 Summit: not fully meeting the expectations

Unwinding of imbalances is a stupendous task requiring co-operation of all countries.

. . This newspaper article further states, I quote:

"The G-20 countries agreed to co-ordinate their monetary and stimulus packages. With the crisis waning, there has been much less enthusiasm".

It goes on to state:

"... G-20 countries agreed to take action to seek more balanced growth but delayed until next year the contentious issues of defining problems that threaten the global recovery.

.

It further states, I quote:

With so much at stake, it is disappointing that the G-20 has deferred all key decisions to next year or possibly even later.

How much Foreign Direct Investment did we get for the first six months of 2010, in a full year of peace, Mr. Speaker? It is much less than what we got last year. In fact, we got only US Dollars 208 million. Compare that, of course for the full year, with other countries. Pakistan has got US Dollars 3,695 million, Cambodia - US Dollars 5.3 billion, Laos - US Dollars - 7.2 billion for 2008, Thailand - US Dollars 6.2 billion, Vietnam - US Dollars 7 billion. When Vietnam is getting US Dollars 7 billion, how come we are only getting US Dollars 200 million? Let us double it for the 12 months. That is still, US Dollars 400 million. Let us say, even US Dollars 600 million. That is one tenth of what Vietnam is getting. So, I urge you to honestly reconsider some of these policies. There is something wrong.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am glad to speak on this occasion following the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, who expressed great hope for the country. I must say that all of us on both sides of the House share that hope. We do hope that this country will come out of the mire that it has been in for several decades and become the "Wonder of Asia". There is no dispute on that; we share that vision. But, if we are to reach that goal, there are some things that have to be put right. I am glad the Hon. Minister also conceded that we are not there yet. But, we want to get there. All of us want to get there. Particularly, in the context of a country that is recovering from the after-effects of a long and protracted violence, there are some fundamentals that need to be put right before we can dream those dreams of becoming the "Wonder of Asia". What are those fundamentals? Before I deal with that, I like to state that the priority vision of a

country will always be reflected in its financial dealings, and if a Budget Estimate has been presented to this House, that definitely will show the country and the world where our priorities lie.

If you are looking forward to a better tomorrow, a tomorrow where the country has been described several times as the Wonder of Asia, and the country has left behind all the bitter conflicts that ravaged us for so long, then in the Budget we will see those priorities being reflected. But, I am sad to say that this Budget too does not reflect the professed priorities of the Government. The Hon. Minister was heard to say that the first and foremost priority was the resettlement of the people, particularly in the Vanni. Now, I like to ask a question as to where one finds that priority in the Budget that has been presented - in the figures, in the rupees and cents. You can make a speech. You can make a Budget speech and say that you are about to do this and that and the other. But, if one cannot find it in the figures that are presented to the House, then all those are mere empty words.

I am also sad that the Hon. Minister of Finance who presented the Budget is not in the House to participate in this Debate. That is a very serious issue. I raised this at the last mini-Budget that was presented about six months ago. The fact is that, in terms of our Constitution, in terms of our structure of governance, it is this House that has total control over public finances. There is no question about that. It says so, in so many words. But, that position has been undermined severely by the fact that the Executive President also holds the portfolio of Finance.

I must repeat what I said at the last Budget Debate and when I said it, there was no counter to that. No one from the Government benches disagreed with that and I take it that they were in agreement with my sentiments on this matter. It is true that the Constitution states that His Excellency the President can assign to different persons different functions of Cabinet portfolios. Even so, Sir, you will remember that there was a reference to the Supreme Court with regard to the holding of the portfolio of Defence by a person other than His Excellency the President. The opinion of the Supreme Court was, although the Constitution nowhere states that it is the President and the President alone who can hold the portfolio of Defence under our structure of governance, it must be His Excellency the President who must hold the portfolio of Defence and I agree with that opinion. Similarly, nowhere does it state in the Constitution that the President cannot hold the portfolio of Finance. But, if one were to properly look at our Constitution, our system of governance and the fact that it is Parliament and Parliament alone that has total control over public finance, then it must be a Member of this House who holds the portfolio of Finance. That is why I say it is

611 612

regrettable that this House has to debate a Budget that has been presented by the Executive. It is true that the Minister of Finance is part of the Executive, but if he is also a Member of this House, he is totally and fully accountable to this House. This House then can properly exercise its supervisory role over public finances. Unfortunately, we still cannot do that. We still cannot ask the Minister of Finance to clarify matters.

In fact, the First Reading of this Appropriation Bill was made at a time when different persons held different portfolios and when the Second Reading is taken up, portfolios have been changed. So, the Schedule to the Appropriation Bill is totally irrelevant now. With regard to Ministries listed, you find how they existed prior to the 22nd of November. When the Second Reading of this Bill was being taken up, the situation had changed drastically. It had changed because the Head of the Executive took office for a second time and the whole Executive has changed. The Head of the Executive changed and the whole Executive has changed.

I like to agree with Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who spoke yesterday. When he said that unconstitutional appointments have been made purportedly to the Executive, we do not know whether the Senior Ministers who have been classified as "Senior Ministers" are part of the Cabinet or not. I am aware that there was one response saying, Yes, they are Cabinet Ministers. But, there are no secretaries appointed to any of those ministries. There is no concept in the Constitution to appoint separately a Cabinet Minister and a Senior Minister. I am saying this and now there might be clarifications made. But, at that time an announcement was made and according to that, 10 Senior Ministers and 49 Cabinet Ministers were sworn in. So, that excluded those 10 from the Cabinet. The subjects and functions will probably be defined and given. For example, there is a Senior Minister for Scientific Affairs but there is a Cabinet Minister for Science and Technology. One does not know how that division will be made between those two Ministers in the subjects and functions that will be assigned.

That is going to be a task of the President; he might walk a tightrope again. But, it is for all to see the promises that were given - I will come to the promise with regard to increase in salary later - with regard to the size of the Executive, the Cabinet, which have been blatantly violated. Everyday more Ministers are being sworn in. - [Interruption.] No, you speak during the time allotted to you. I am not -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Let the Chair ask that. Hon. Sumanthiran, you ask from the court. This is Parliament. Sir, unfortunately he is totally misquoting the Constitution . He is also doing the same mistake that the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe did yesterday. Sir, Article 45(2) of the Constitution refers to the appointment or assignment of Members. The President can appoint Ministers outside the Cabinet.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is not a new phenomenon. [Interruption.] Please listen to me. I want to educate him. Earlier, there were State Ministers and Project Ministers outside the Cabinet.

but you cannot fool - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I was on the issue that Parliament has two important functions. One, is legislating and the other - a very important function of Parliament - is having full control over public finance and it is on that, I am speaking. I referred to those provisions in the Constitution even before. When I spoke about this last time, there was not even a murmur from the Government benches because that was the correct position. But, merely to satisfy somebody, one can stand up and say whatever comes to his mouth. That is not the conduct that is expected of any Member of this House. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is the Constitution of the country you are misquoting.

615 616

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If the priority of this Government is resettlement, I welcome what the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake said. That is a priority and that ought to be the priority. I say that because as he said, if we are to move towards being a "Wonder of Asia", first we must know where we are. And, if we want to come out of the conflict-ridden situation, then we must put right the things that initially gave rise to the conflict. One cannot sweep those matters under the carpet; one cannot merely imagine that those have disappeared overnight and then come and say that we will become the "Wonder of Asia." Unless you deal with those issues, unless the communities in this country are properly and truly reconciled, this country will always be another wonder of Asia as we have always been for the last three or four decades. We will never move from that. And, to that extent, whatever was processed in the Budget speech, there is nothing in the estimates that show that anything is being done with regard to the basic necessities for resettlement.

I am not talking about aid that the other countries, the neighbouring countries give. I am talking about the Government's own priorities. If the Government's priority is resettlement, then that must be reflected in the Government's Budget and not in the budget of the Indian Government,not in the budget of the Chinese Government and not in the budget of the World Food Programme. If that is important for us, it must be reflected in our own Budget. That is how the Government should show that this is a matter, this is a burden and this is a responsibility that we ourselves carry on our shoulders. That is how you demonstrate to those people that they matter. You cannot treat them the way you are treating them now. I am saying this with all responsibility. You cannot continue to treat those people the way you are treating them now.

The Hon. Suresh Premachandran gave you example after example the other day of the mistreatment those people are being subjected to. Many Members of this House got very upset over that and raised howls of protests, but not one of those incidents can be refuted. He told about the incident when people lit the lamp for a Hindu festival and how they were being beaten up for doing that. He told of another incident, when students in a school in Kilinochchi sang the National Anthem. Mind you, they were singing the National Anthem of Sri Lanka and they were stopped. They were stopped because they sang in Tamil and a cassette was played in Sinhala and they were forced to sing it only in Sinhala. Now, these are matters that are very important and these are the matters that show what the intention of the Government is. You profess something by words but your figures do not show anything to support that resettlement and reconciliation are priorities. You cannot mouth all these ideals and behave in another way, and the other way is primarily seen by the conduct of the military that is still occupying the Northern Province.

Now, let us talk about resettlement. There was a group of Sinhalese people who went to Jaffna and pitched tents at the old Jaffna Railway Station. If they were from Jaffna or if they lived in Jaffna, they are most welcome to come back and live. But, that is not the issue. The issue is, the toilets were constructed around the Jaffna Railway Station weeks before they came there. Who did that? Did those people first come and construct toilets, go back and then come with their families? No. This is a planned arrangement; a planned settlement. Even if those people did not want to come there, they have been brought and kept there. Two or three weeks before that, I saw with my own eyes, the toilets being constructed around the Jaffna Railway Station. I asked myself why this is happening and now I have the answer for those few hundred families suddenly landing at the railway station. Thereafter, they have gone and taken for themselves a State land in Navatkuli and have pitched their tents there. If reconciliation and resettlement of those persons, who have been displaced and whom you have interned illegally behind barbed wires for over one and a half years is your priority, then resettle them properly. Treat them with the dignity that is due to them; build houses for them; give them livelihood opportunities. Do not allow us to return to -

..... ( ..... ) (The Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana) 10 . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Deputy Minister seems to have thought that this time has been allotted to him. If this is his behaviour, then one knows that what he is talking about is also like that. The way he is forcing himself into my time without any rhyme or reason shows that he would approve going and settling somewhere forcibly. If he wants to reply, he can reply at the due time. If he is raising a point of Order, he must point to the relevant Standing Order and object to it. The Hon. Deputy Ministers very behaviour is illustrative of what I am saying that persons come and forcibly occupy. That is what we are objecting to. We are not objecting to persons of other races coming and living there. We welcome them with open arms. They must come and live with us. There has never been any objection to that. The only objection has always been to the forcible settlement that the Government undertakes with a view to artificially changing the demography of certain areas. It has been a plan that has been going on for several decades. That has been happening particularly after Independence. If one looks at the demographic changes in the entire Eastern Province, particularly in the districts of Trincomalee and Ampara, he would see that there has been a phenomenal growth of one race increasing to the detriment of others. If it happened, naturally there will not be any objection to that. But, these are planned settlement projects. The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer will realize that the number of Muslims have also decreased as a result. He is not concerned about that but we are concerned. We are still concerned that the majority rule cannot just be a simple majoritarian rule. The majority rule is democracy, subject to the fact that all others are treated equally. So, I am

pleading with you. Some truths are unpalatable to you; some truths are difficult to be digested. Nevertheless, they are truths . Those are truths that we have seen; those are truths that we have heard and those are truths that we feel. So, if you are serious about reconciliation and the march towards growth for becoming the Wonder of Asia, please listen to us. Do not shout us down like this and then expect the country to become the Wonder of the Asia.

Thank you very much. [. . 12.49]

I think I have to answer some of the questions raised by the Hon. Sumanthiran. The first issue is that my learned Friend casually stated in this House a little while ago that one of the Members of Parliament went up to the Hon. Azwer and asked him to interrupt you. It was I who went up to the Hon. Azwer and asked him whether I could borrow his copy of the Constitution. But, unfortunately the copy of the Constitution was not there with him at that time. So, I went up to the Secretary-General and borrowed the Constitution to answer your questions. So, please note that I did not ask him to interrupt you. I am not a person of that calibre.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I accept the Hon. Ministers explanation. I am sorry, I said that. Perhaps, it could be a coincidence. You would have walked up there and the Hon. Azwer started his usual story.- [Interruption.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) I just wanted to clarify that. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I raised a point of Order. He cannot say so. He cannot refer to the conduct of a Member of the House.-[Interruption.]

619 620

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) , . . , ; ; . , . . , . . . , . .

Article 44(2) of the Constitution states, I quote:

The President may assign to himself any subject or function and shall remain in charge of any subject

or function not assigned to any Minister under the provisions of paragraph (1) ...

Why did I quote that? Because, the Hon. Member, citing an opinion of the Supreme Court on holding the Defence portfolio by the Executive, with which he too agreed, said the President can hold and should hold the portfolio of Defence. According to Article 44(2) of the Constitution, I will read it again, it states, I quote:

The President may assign to himself any subject or function and shall remain in charge of any subject

or function not assigned to any Minister under the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article

, . So, there is no argument about that. Not only the portfolio of Defence, but the President can hold any portfolio according to Article 44(2) of the Constitution.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Please sit down. Now, I refer to the next issue raised by my good Friend. He was referring to an issue raised by

another Member of the Opposition yesterday in this Assembly. . .

I now quote from Article 45(1) of the Constitution. It states, I quote:

The President may, from time to time, in consultation with the Prime Minister where he considers such consultation to be necessary -

(a) appoint from among Members of Parliament, Ministers who shall not be Members of the Cabinet of Ministers... It is there in Article 45(1) of the Constitution and if you look at Article 45(3), it states, I quote:

Every Minister appointed under this Article shall be responsible and answerable to the Cabinet of Ministers and to Parliament.

So, it is my view that it is not contrary to the Constitution and especially to this particular Article. , 45.(1)() , 45.(3) .

( - () ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara - Minister (Senior) for Human Resources) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to make my intervention in English while there are empty benches in the Opposition. I had the patience to listen to the speeches made by the Hon. Members of the Opposition representing the UNP, the JVP and the TNA during the last two days. I regret very much the pathetic position that they are placed in. They all approached the Budget with venom, rancour, malice and jealousy. Through their speeches, they only exposed the bankruptcy of their economic strategies. Today, the UNP is ideologically impotent. The JVP is ideologically blind and the TNA is ideologically deaf. Most of the Speakers touched upon everything on earth except the Budget and the Hon. Members who spoke only referred to the cost of living and the salary increase. My good Friend, the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka is thorough in repeating the same speeches made during the past few years. If you refer to the speeches in Hansards made during the past Budget Debates, you would notice it. He repeated the same facts today. Therefore, it is not worth replying to his speeches.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Budget for 2011 has to be viewed and judged from the standpoint of economic strategy, economic policies, our past performances and achievements, our vision, objectives and new Budget Proposals that are now before the House. None of the Hon. Members of the Opposition touched on any one of these aspects. Sir, what is the reason behind our success story and the achievements we made during the past five-year period, from 2005 to 2010? Firstly and mainly it is because of our departure from the neo-liberal economic policies initiated by the UNP in 1977. That is the main reason behind our success story. This is what the UNP cannot self-critically admit. This is one of the causes for internal contradictions within the UNP. It is not only the crisis of the leadership but also a crisis in relation to their economic strategies and economic policies. Neo-liberalism which they hailed once, has today run into a crisis globally .

Sir, secondly, despite all global challenges - the food crisis of 2006, the energy crisis of 2007, the financial crisis of 2008 and the economic recession of 2009 - we secured an average growth rate of over 6 per cent from 2006 to 2008 and a modest growth rate of 3.5 per cent in 2009, when all the developed countries registered a minus growth. In the current year - 2010, we have come nearer to a growth rate of 8 per cent. It was possible as we made a paradigm shift in the economic strategy and readjusted our policies accordingly.

Sir, if we had continued with the neo-liberal economic strategy, we would have by today placed the entire country, the people of our country in misery, jeopardy and chaos. We secured these significant achievements in the midst of a prolonged and disastrous war provoked by the UNP in 1983. With a correct strategy, we put an end to the war within two and a half years, whilst embarking on a gigantic task of massive economic achievements. Hon. Deputy Speaker, how did we achieve these significant results? We were guided by the realities of the global economy. We were conscious of the potential international challenges. We took into account the past experiences of all previous administrations, of both periods from 1977 to 1994 and 1994 to 2004. We identified our friends and partners in the international scene. We concentrated on the domestic production and a balanced and proportionate regional development. We shifted our emphasis to the rural economy and SME sector. We made maximum use of our natural resources taking into account the potential environmental hazards. We placed our reliance on the balance developments based on the private sector and the State-owned enterprises.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, contrary to neo-liberal economic strategy, we placed reliance on the role of the Government, both in planning and coordination. It is not the mere role of the night watchman as Adam Smith, the father of capitalism once professed. We gave the highest priority to the infrastructure development using our own resources with the assistance of our friendly countries and international agencies.

Sir, contrary to the neo-liberal prescriptions of the IMF or the World Bank, we continued with subsidies and relief through our people-oriented Budgets.

In this gigantic task, both in combating terrorism and pushing forward our economic development programme, we managed cleverly and prudently our foreign policies. We maintained and sustained the economic fundamentals through our own policies regardless of the IMF or the World Bank prescriptions. We averted successfully international pressures, blackmails and threats of sanctions. To sum up, Sir, we were pragmatic and not dogmatic in the choice of our strategies and policies.

Taking a long-term view of the impending challenges before us, both domestically and globally, and also taking into account our goals, the Budget for 2011 has focused attention on the need for administrative reforms.

As in the case of infrastructure development, we should take bold steps in the sphere of these reforms. In addition to administrative reforms, we propose to push through educational reforms from primary education, secondary education as well as tertiary education. With the emerging technologies and changing markets and with the possible changes of our lives and working

patterns, the Government aims at creating a knowledge-based economy and a knowledge-based society.

For this, formation and accumulation of human capital through education is imperative. Thus, we need to achieve a manpower, efficient, effective and productive. In this context, the university is the centre of generating and disseminating knowledge. As President Mahinda Rajapaksa said once, we want our graduates who could see the world beyond their horizon. They should not be mere factories for employment.

Here again, it is critically important that Sri Lanka has the human capital need to compete with global knowledge economy. We want our graduates and postgraduates to think and act creatively. Thus, the entire university system needs complete overhaul change and revamping. Hon. Deputy Speaker, we must have a workforce with specific knowledge and skills. Thus, a demand for skilled and professional workforce is needed to meet the impending challenges, domestic as well as global. We took this need into account in the formulation of our Budget Proposals.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the modern economy can be built only through science and technological innovations in order to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor and also between the town and the village.

In this context, Human Resources Development should be given the highest priority and our vision in this context can be seen through this Budget.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, to sum up, this Budget is a Budget with a vision, with objectives based on people-oriented economic strategy and it was formulated with a sense of pragmatism, realism and optimism.

Thank you.

This House should commemorate this important day through an Adjournment Motion. Many Members are very enthusiastic to participate in this Debate. But, due to the time constraint, the Mover will get eight minutes, the reply in eight minutes and four minutes for each Member. The Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara Jayasinghe will move this Motion. ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara Jayasinghe) Sir, I move, "The United Nations General Assembly, by its resolution 54/134 of 17th December 1999, has designated 25th November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against women. Domestic violence, sexual abuse of girls, sexual harassment in the work place, sexual assault, rape and early or forced marriages are most common instances of violence against women. We, as Parliamentarians, call upon the Government and relevant authorities to take stern actions to counter violence against women and to bring about a change in mentality and mobilize public opinion with a view to eliminating gender based violence"

I would like to speak a few words on this Motion.
