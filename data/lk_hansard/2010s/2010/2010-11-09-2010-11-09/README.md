( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Speaker, I have one Supplementary Question. I did not ask for the details of the tax. I only wanted it established whether or not such individuals are liable for tax. My question is this : is there a principle in this country that Sri Lankans who are earning money in this country are liable for tax whether or not the organization they are working for is foreign-funded? That principle, I think can be answered with no breach of the confidentiality clauses, which are designed to conceal from the public, the individuals who are paying tax.

I would submit, Hon. Speaker, that the answer provided by the Ministry is unsatisfactory because this is an issue of principle and if we are to expand our tax base, we must make sure that taxes are paid appropriately and accountability is maintained even by foreign-funded institutes. So, may I ask that question again : the principle as to whether such individuals are liable for tax?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , "" . .

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Hon. Speaker, may I check on a point of information? Do I need to ask the Question again or can I ask that a clarified form of the Question about the principle, be answered?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, you can ask for clarification.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Then, may I request that clarification? The Second Supplementary Question is : are we aware of the individuals contracted to produce reports for the International Crisis Group and if so, the accountability about payments made to them? The Hon. Minister mentioned two permanent employees, but there are reports issued about Sri Lanka for which research is done by Sri Lankan citizens. How is this payment made to them?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . , . . . , , , .

)(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you, Hon. Minister. My third Supplementary Question relates to 3 (b) (iii), about the provision of visas. I think the Hon. Minister was unable to answer that Question. But, I would submit that visas needed to be recommended and how visas were recommended for Mr. Keenan and Mr. Luwis in the course of these years, and the principles of not recommending visas for more than a year at a time were followed because, I believe their visas were extended throughout with no proper checking on the work they were up to. So, I wonder whether I could request an answer to that Question.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, it is a very serious point of Order that I am going to raise. In the entire speech of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition - I must call him Honourable- he has been referring to the conduct of the Hon. Speaker and also making inferences to the certain actions that he has taken. According to the Standing Orders - he does not know even Erskine May; let him go and read Erskine May - you cannot make reference to the Hon. Speaker. He is the final authority of all decisions that are taken. Either collectively or singularly, he has all the right to consult anybody. So, you must expunge his entire speech. , - .

[. . 4.30] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Presiding Member, today I have to speak a few words on the Resolution under the Public Security Ordinance. Firstly, before speaking on the subject under discussion, I would like to say that there was complete pandemonium in Parliament the whole of the afternoon today. There were people right on top in the Public Gallery watching the situation. Firstly, there must be proper decorum and security in Parliament before we talk about the extension of the state of Emergency as far as this Island is concerned. Parliament is supposed to be a place where a certain amount of decorum and ethics are maintained, but I am very sorry to say that those ethics have not been upheld today in this parliamentary forum.

As far as the extension of the state of Emergency is concerned, many speakers from the Government side have spoken to say that there has been complete calmness, peacefulness and that many factors have been brought about for the progress of this country. If that is the position of the Government and if the Government feels that this country has progressed heavily and there is no security threat as far as the other terrorist movements are concerned, I do not see why there should be an extension of the state of Emergency. There has to be law and order maintained in this country. To maintain law and order, I do not think an extension of the state of Emergency is necessary. Law and order can be maintained by the Police, the Army as well as by the Air Force and the Navy. Those powers are sufficient to maintain public security of this country without those special provisions that are adhered to under the Ordinance.

A few days ago, two weeks ago really, you would have heard, the Jaffna Library had been attacked. I was in Jaffna about four days ago and I inquired about it from many officers there including the police officers, the security guard who was there at the premises and some members who were working there. When I walked in there, it was a bit too early; it was about 8.15 in the morning and at that time, the entire work force had not come in. But, I was made to understand from the little information I received that the officers concerned were not in a position to give a proper answer about what really happened there. The people were not willing to give a proper answer because they were sure that they would get into some sort of trouble if the correct answer was given. I am sorry to say that. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, can I make a small explanation on that please? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) When that newspaper article appeared in The Sunday Leader, His Excellency the President was in China. He immediately got on the phone and ordered an inquiry into that incident. He asked the Inspector-General of Police exactly what had transpired there, by which time an inquiry had taken place and the Hon. Douglas Devananda had also met with the library authorities. What we found was - I think the investigation is still proceeding - yes, that something had happened, but it was a crowd with some malicious intent that had come and done that. So, the inquiry is pending and in no way - I can speak for all of us - does the Government agree with what had happened. Definitely, it is wrong.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you very much, Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. I am very happy to hear that from you. If that is the position, even if there was an ulterior motive to enter the premises, these people have entered between 4.00 - 5.00 p.m. and at that time there was a Medical Association meeting going on, and they have broken the gates and walked in. What really happened is subject to inquiry because no one can respond to that question, but the only point that I am trying to emphasize here in this House is that this same situation that arose many more years ago is coming up again in the Jaffna Peninsula. This is something which is unsatisfactory, which we will not accept. As a Tamil Member of Parliament of the

United National Party, I will not accept this type of a behaviour. I am not trying to say that the Government was behind this. As the Hon. De Vass Gunawardena correctly said, it maybe some element that wants to create a confusion. If that is so, I would request His Excellency the President as well as his Government to look into this matter and give us a proper explanation on what really happened at that instance.

At the same time, as far as the Tamils who have been displaced in the Jaffna Peninsula, as well as in Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Kilinochchi are concerned, I am sure the Government is making preparations and given certain facilities to them. But, there has to be some permanent buildings built. The Indian Government has come forward with the proposition that they are going to build these houses for the displaced people. In each district, I think it comes to about 12,500 people. But, nothing has been concretely done. I earnestly request the Hon. Speaker as well as the Prime Minister to accelerate the construction of houses in the Northern Province and give these people a proper shelter. This is very important because even though shelter is given, presently only temporary shelter is given; only sheds or tents are given. Now, if there is a heavy shower these sheds are all going to be affected.

There is no proper theory or progress as far as their vocation is concerned. What is going to be their future? What is going to be their business? They have lost everything. There have been many ideas brought forward. But, as far as we are concerned, as far as the Tamils are concerned, there has been nothing laid out firmly to say what the future of this generation who have been affected by this war will be.

Now, today about 255 families have been placed at the Jaffna Railway Station. They claim that they were tenants of some premises. If that is so, if they can prove their tenancy, they can certainly be placed there without being placed at the Jaffna Railway Station. Now, these are matters which they are not very anxious to look into when the Tamil community is trying to raise its head in the Northern Province. Some may ask why we are giving to the Northern Province; why they are claiming political rights and why they are claiming many more rights. But, do not forget that as far as the Jaffna Peninsula is concerned, about 98 per cent of the inhabitants there, are Tamils. Therefore, that is the only place the Tamils have the rights and that is the only place Tamils can claim their rights and that is why they at least want to live in harmony, live in peace, and to live with some economic growth inclusive of their political gains. That is what they are asking for. People may ask why we are giving for the North when nothing is given for the South; why we are giving to the North when nothing is given to the Central Province, and why are we giving everything to them. As I told you earlier, that is the birthplace of the Tamils and that is where 98 per cent of the Tamil community is

1069 1070

living and therefore, the Tamils have a right to ask that from any country and from any Government.

As far as the Government Service is concerned, with regard to the recent recruitments, - I think the Hon. S. Shritharan has clearly brought it out - there are only a few Tamils who have been recruited in the Northern Province. Even as far as veterinary surgeons are concerned and all the other fields, it is the same. Out of about 200 people who have been recruited today, there were only about five Tamils. How can this happen? The Northern Province is a place where the Tamil-speaking community live and if you want to have some peace, harmony, progress and economic growth, we should at least have some officers who can speak the Tamil language and have some sort of a dialog with the people. But, I am sorry, Hon. Presiding Member, this is not happening. I earnestly request the Government of Sri Lanka, His Excellency President as well as the Hon. Prime Minister to look into this matter earnestly, if they really feel that there has to be a solution to the problems faced by the Tamils today.

So, these are the few issues that I wished to bring before you, Hon. Presiding Member. There are many more issues that have come forward. I think the Hon. Shritharan who spoke before me brought them out very clearly. He spelt out about the people who have been abducted, the people who have no place to reside; in fact, about how the Government Forces or other forces have taken over the premises of the Nallur Temple in Kilinochchi and the houses which were owned by the temple. Many more issues of this nature have come forward. But, I do not want to spell out all of them but at least the Government of this country knows what has exactly happened today. They know what happened in the Northern Province; they know what the people have suffered and that is the reason why the Government must look into the matter.

Sir, I would also like to refer to the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Bill, although this is not a part of this Debate. I just want to bring this out because this Bill states, "to provide for the registration of deaths of persons reported missing as a result of terrorist or subversive activity or civil commotion and of persons whose deaths are directly attributable to any natural disaster or calamity and such activity, disaster or calamity results in serious consequences at national level; and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto". I just want to bring to the knowledge, Hon. Presiding Member, that this Bill does not really look into the matter where people have died during the war. That appropriate wording has not been included in this Bill. It only says "reported missing as a result of terrorist or subversive activity or civil commotion" but it does not say whether it has been done or whether the people have died due to a

cause of hostility. I think that is the word we should use because if there has been a hostility and if there has been an armed struggle between the terrorists and the army, I think that category of people have not been brought into this. I think there will be more Members of the TNA who will also clarify this further. I hope the Hon. Presiding Member will kindly look into this matter and bring this also into the picture because there are so many hundreds and thousands of people who have suffered; whose families have suffered; whose children have suffered because their parents or fathers have died and they have no vocation or no way of living in this country.

So, when the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Bill is brought in, the Government can consider them. If the father and the mother or the father alone of a family has died, the Government can provide some sort of economic relief to them. Therefore, I earnestly request the Hon. Speaker to look into this Bill which is to be brought in and make necessary amendments where people who have died during the hostility period, are included.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, the Bill will be brought in before the House very soon. I think you can call for an Advisory Committee Meeting and make your suggestions there.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. These are a few issues that I have brought forward today and I hope and pray that the House will take them into consideration and bring relief to the Tamil community at large. Thank you.

[. . 4.52] ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Presiding Member, while extending my thanks to you for giving me this opportunity, I would like to commence by making a comment with regard to the conduct of Parliament today. Sir, you are one of the very senior Members in this Parliament and it is well within your knowledge that in a parliamentary system of any civilized country, especially when there is a Westminster Parliamentary System like ours, there is an inveterate practice and tradition that has been maintained for centuries. That is, when the Hon. Prime Minister or the Hon. Leader of the Opposition speaks in the House, normally others do not disturb. Unfortunately, today we observed that that tradition has not been maintained in Parliament. Therefore, our traditions and conventions have deteriorated and come to a very low level and all of us are finally responsible one day for this kind of collapse of traditions and conventions. The values and norms of democracy should be maintained by each and every Member of this House.

With regard to the extension of the state of Emergency, Sir, I would like to draw your attention that there is a myth in our society with regard to the concept of a stable government. If you look back at history, the late Hon. Sirima Bandaranaike came into power in 1970 with a two-thirds majority in Parliament. But, unfortunately although the government was stable, the country was ruled under a state of Emergency for five years and eleven months in the entire period of seven years. Only for a period of one year and one month, we had not been subjected to Emergency Regulations. Thereafter, the UNP Government came into power in 1978 and they remained in power till 1994 for a period of 17 years. Out of that period, Sir, again these Regulations had been in operation exactly for a period of 12 years and one month. Then, the present UPFA Government to which I myself contributed to bring them to power has been in power since 1994. Out of that 16 years, we have been subjected to these Emergency Regulations for 13 years and 8 months.

Taking all this into consideration, you can see that although the Government has whatever majority in Parliament, whether it is two-thirds or five-sixths, still it wants to continue with the Emergency Regulations but there must be some substantial and justifiable reasons for that.

Now, the war was concluded 17 months ago but what we are concerned about is why the Government is still

interested in maintaining the state of Emergency without any relaxation. It is just to safeguard the liberty of the general public of this country.

I wish to ask, Sir, that in the event we cannot show any national reconciliation within this House, how can we display to the world that the Government or even the Parliament is making a genuine attempt to have a national reconciliation? As far as politics is concerned, there is a good slogan to say, There are no minorities in this country but there are only Sri Lankans. No doubt, I concede it is a good slogan. I fully appreciate that. But, merely saying that only you cannot resolve all the issues as far as the minority people are concerned. That is being said by most of the political leaders of minority communities as they have some affiliations or some kind of support to the Government. But, that is not enough. It is true that the ordinary minority people must have a feeling in their hearts and minds that they are not being treated in a different way; that they all are being treated in an equal manner. Our political slogans alone cannot resolve the issues; on the ground there has to be some practical and pragmatic system established to ensure that no community is isolated and that there is no discrimination. Mere slogans will not help and we must practically prove it.

Sir, although we maintain a state of Emergency throughout, you witnessed what happened in the prison two days ago. While all these Regulations are in force, in full power and all the armed forces and the police have full powers under the Emergency Regulations, when the police went to do a drug raid in a prison which has been guarded for 24 hours and in which special units have been established, there was no any protection for them. The police had been hammered. Then, what is purpose of extending the state of Emergency? What is the use of it if our police are not in a position to do a raid in a prison without getting themselves injured? They, with the greatest difficulty just secured their lives. In that context, if this kind of thing happens in a democratic country in any part of the world, the Minister concerned would have to resign. That is the tradition. But, we know that that will not happen in our country and we do not expect that also.

Mr. Presiding Member, you may have seen two or three days ago media reports that a lot of tourists are flowing towards Sri Lanka and that our economy will prosper because we have established peace, there is no war and as a result of that, so many tourists come to Sri Lanka from various parts of the world.

Now, in the media, it was witnessed and demonstrated that the tourist guides and tourist agents have said that they cannot take any tourist to the Mihintale area, which is the base for the Sinhala-Buddhist culture, as so many underworld gangs and thugs are there. That has been confirmed by the chief incumbent of the Mihintale Raja Maha Viharaya. Mihintale is an archeological and sacred

1075 1076

2010 09

area. So, in that context, it seems that you cannot maintain normal law and order in this country. If so, for what purpose is the state of Emergency extended? It is only for political expediency and for abject subjugation of the liberty of the general public. The Government, in a mind of complacency thinks that since the war is over, everything is secured and there will not be any kind of conflict in our country in future. Sir, it is not so. We know that everybody contributed to end the war. That is good. The war has been concluded and whether we are in the Opposition or in the Government, we extended whatever possible assistance. That it is a good sign. But, as you know, Martin Luther King once said that the war has never resolved any human problem and it can temporarily submerge the issue. I also concede that fact. The war is over but if somebody thinks that the problems are completely solved or rooted out, I think he has been misled. The war is only a symptom but that is not the cause or the root. The cause or the root is still existing. Whether we agree or not, the minority communities, especially the Tamils in the North and the East, are suffering.

Sir, you listened to the speech made by the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan where he mentioned the plight of the Tamil people living in the Jaffna Peninsula. Even the Hon. Member who spoke before him also mentioned that. Whether we like it or not, whether we agree or not, that is a fact and therefore, if somebody thinks that with the conclusion of the war, we have achieved our targets and peace has already dawned, that is a myth. I think the extension of the state of Emergency is not the immediate issue that should be taken into consideration by the Government. There are so many other issues. I kindly request the Government to think about some kind of solution to keep all the minority people satisfied and their reasonable demands and requirements must be taken into consideration. With regard to that of course, we, being in the Opposition, are ready to give whatever support that the Government wants.

But, it is something regrettable, Sir, that today some of the Ministers and Members of this House made so many allegations against certain Members of the United National Party. I myself was in Vienna last week. Representatives of many countries, especially countries in Asia and Africa, which had been affected by conflicts during the last two to three decades had gathered there. We had some video conferencing and discussions with the people who represented Geneva and Washington DC and there was a lecture delivered by one of the rapporteurs of the United Nations. In the course of his speech, I got an opportunity to question him. I told him that when there are terrorist threats to powerful nations in the world they adopt one policy and if it is an underdeveloped country or a developing country, their attitude is somewhat different. I especially pointed out that when the Sri Lankan Government was engaged in the war, there had been so many influences on the Government and they did not exercise the same power,

exert the same influence or the same pressure on the terrorist organization. I asked him, "Why is there a duplicity in your policy? Why have you adopted two policies?" The UN Representative said, "We have condemned what the LTTE has done". I said that we do not want the United Nations to make a condemnation, the UN is not meant for that, and it can be done even by a stranger on the road. So, that is how we, the Opposition Members, protected the rights and integrity of this country at international forums and that was witnessed by the Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, who participated in the same forum. But, a good Friend of mine, the Hon. John Senewiratne.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I was told that you have done well. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Presiding Member, when we appear before international forums, we never think in terms of party policy; we never think community-wise, we never whip up the communities; we never take into consideration extreme elements, religion, race or ethnicity. But, I was so unhappy, I was really hurt, Mr. Presiding Member, that after we have done so much, the Government Ministers - I do not know whether they speak with responsibility or with some kind of understanding or sense - are saying, "This is how some of the Members of the United National Party conduct themselves at international forums. That is wrong."

Mr. Presiding Member, I want to raise some other issue. When we say the Government is keen to extend the the state of Emergency, what came to my mind is what is stated in the banner headline of the "Ravaya" newspaper of 7th November. I quote:

" "

Sir, - the Terrorist Investigation Division - is a new unit set up in the Police Department to investigate on terrorists. According to the article in the "Ravaya" newspaper, this unit was deployed not to investigate about the terrorists - there are no more terrorists and the Hon. Ministers of the Government also concede that there are no terrorists now in the country - but to monitor the activities of the Ministers; with whom they are dealing, what they are doing in their capacity as Ministers. Mr. Presiding Member, this has not been refuted, denied so far by the Government. Then, one may get an idea that the Government wants to extend the state of Emergency to gather information about the Ministers and the Deputy Ministers in the Government and investigate into their activities. That is the impression that has been given by this newspaper. The Government has

1077 1078

never denied that. That is the impression even I got. Now, some of the Ministers are talking about the "Wheat Flour Terrorism". The question I have to ask is whether there is a "Ministerial Terrorism and is it to prevent that "Ministerial Terrorism" that we are extending the state of Emergency? That is a question that the Government will have to reply.

Hon. Presiding Member, as I submitted earlier, there are very urgent issues to be addressed by the Government. I have read some of the reports of the Central Bank. According to one report, last year the Government has spent 57 per cent from the national revenue to pay salaries and pensions of Public servants. In developed countries, that is something within the range of 8 to 12 per cent. Now, the British Government has decided - there is an ongoing debate in the United Kingdom on that - to cut Sterling Pounds 130 billion from the Public sector expenditure and within five years they are going to reduce the Government employees by 500,000 because that is unbearable for such a developed country also. In our country, out of our national revenue the public sector expenditure was 52 per cent in 2008 and it has gone up to 57.6 per cent in 2009. What is left then? It is only 42 per cent. Now, when the interest on the loans obtained by the Government alone is calculated, we will have to pay over Rs. 700 billion for this year. We are expecting around Rs. 1,000 billion revenue and in the event we have to pay such a large sum of money on interest plus salaries and pensions, the national revenue will not be sufficient. In a situation like this, what we really need is to work together and find some solution.

Some of the Ministers are cursing the Western countries, the developed countries, and some were talking about removing the "plug". But, we know that if not for the IMF we had to just continue during last two-year period. So, while lashing the United Nations, the Commonwealth Association and the Western countries in Sinhala, we are depending on those countries.

We warned you on the GSP Plus. If we had adopted a proper foreign policy, we could have definitely secured the GSP Plus without any difficulty and thereby could have earned a lot of revenue while safeguarding employments of over 200,000 persons in the garment industry. Due to lack of visionary and of a proper policy, we have already suffered and in future there will be very serious repercussions that we have to face. Therefore, Hon. Presiding Member, what we need is, before you show it to the world, before you show it to the general public of this country, to establish national harmony, ethnic harmony and religious harmony and you must set some kind of example in this House. In the event we lose that reconciliation, that friendly coordination within the House itself, how can you expect this version to be accepted by the international community or the minority communities?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, I am going to wind up.

Finally, there is no doubt that the Opposition has a right to express its ideas and the Government must respect that right because democracy means nothing else but unity within diversity; it is not for division but for making unity. All the Government Members must take part in this and especially the many learned senior Members in the Government side must lead this House. We must maintain dignity and decorum; we must have reciprocal respect for each other and try to establish good values, norms and practices, safeguarding the sacrosanctity of an institution like this. We all are here not to fulfil our aspirations but to fulfil the aspirations of the general public.

Thank you very much.

[. . 6.11]

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. I had assumed that this Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency would be a serious matter. But, I was reminded during the speech of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition of the English poem Casabianca, which begins like this. I quote:

The boy stood on the burning deck

Whence all but he had fled;

But, while this was entertaining to see an Opposition with no body to it, it is also sad because any country will benefit from an Opposition that provides constructive criticism. That, it seems, we cannot get from the present sinking ship, but we will continue to have snide criticism for an international audience.

In this regard, Sir, I was saddened by the speech of the Hon. Member from Jaffna who opened the Debate for his party. When he draws attention to any problems affecting the Tamil people, it is the duty of the Government to listen and to make every effort to alleviate them, when there is indeed a genuine problem. But, what is abhorrent is nostalgia for terrorist rule and idealization of the reign of terror that oppressed the Tamil people for so long. He described the long hostage taking of the Tigers to claim that the people were driven, instead of admitting that they were dragged away against their will. Again, he seemed to regret Tiger justice, that system which claimed that all laws spring from the will of the Leader. Perhaps scapegoats could have been found for every problem through that system, with its system of horrendous prisons, which he was doubtless aware of. But, for a sane representative of the people to talk fondly of that regime suggests why we still need to keep the extension of the state of Emergency going, because while he may do so through innocent folly, there are still those - not in this country, I trust - who want to resurrect totalitarian terror and they will try to use people like him.

Sir, it is also sad that he made no mention of positive measures, for instance, the work done by the army to restore the Kandasamy Kovil for Thai Pongal last year. In a context in which the Hindu clergy have generally worked well with the Government, politicians should not sully that relationship. In this respect, the speech of the Hon. UNP National List Member was more balanced because he recognized what the Government was doing; that he wanted more of it is understandable. However, he did this country and the Tamil people an injustice in claiming that 98 per cent of Tamils live in the North, and that the Jaffna Peninsula is the only place where they can claim their rights. On the contrary, many more of them live outside the North, and they can certainly claim their rights anywhere. Conversely, they should not claim exclusive right to the North, since we must also provide restorative justice to the other longstanding inhabitants of the North and the peninsula, in particular the Muslims, who were driven out in 1990 - an act I am happy to say that all Sri Lankan Tamils have regretted, though the foreign supporters of the Tigers have tried to defend it.

Then, Sir, if I might move also to the wider canvas in discussing the extension of the state of Emergency, I should also, as has been done already, refer to the appalling incident that took place last week at the Welikada Prison. I was the more worried about it because it reminded me of what had happened in 1983, when Tamil prisoners were killed by other prisoners through what was undoubtedly official connivance. No one resigned then, and as we know that inquiry was hushed up with the magistrate prevented from asking questions.

That will not happen now, but still we must recognize that there has been some dis-functionality. We obviously need to work harder to ensure that the forces of law and order work together efficiently. We need to engage in swift reform of the prisons system, to reduce recourse to blind remanding, to save youngsters from the corrupting culture of some places of detention where drugs and other indulgences are common. We hope these are not general problems, but they could become systemic if we do not heed this wake up call. Of course, we cannot deal with the problem through summary justice, but we must work with determination to eradicate the problem through structural reforms as well as the introduction of greater discipline and accountability.

Over the last few years, the training and reforms we should have engaged in to modernize our systems of crime prevention and detection have been postponed because of greater law and order priorities. Now, we have no excuse not to concentrate on improvements in these areas. In previous discussions of the Human Rights Action Plan, we realized that reforms already suggested by the separate Ministries with regard to policing and prisons would go far towards alleviating many problems. I hope then that the Plan can be fast forwarded now since a little bit of concentrated action will help us to ensure that there will be no repetition of incidents such as occurred at Welikada last week, just as we have ensured that the horrors of 1983 have never been repeated.

Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member.
