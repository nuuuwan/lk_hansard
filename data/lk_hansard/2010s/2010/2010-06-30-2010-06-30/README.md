PRIVILEGE : NON-REPORTING OF FACTS AND VIEWS EXPRESSED IN PARLIAMENT

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am very happy, Sir, that I saw you - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, Sir, it is a question of Privilege that I am raising under Standing Order No. 19 (12).

I am thankful to you, Sir, for permitting me to raise this question of Privilege. This is regarding the very unpleasant and unparliamentary act that was enacted yesterday during the presentation of the Budget by the Acting Minister of Finance, which is unprecedented I say, because never in the history during a Budget Speech has that happened. The Opposition had brought in printed placards and other alien things. I kindly ask you to inquire into this, as to how those things were smuggled surreptitiously into the House. They polluted the air inside the House and also desecrated the whole place. That is a dangerous precedent, Sir, I want to bring this to your notice because, if that is allowed to happen in future, we would not be able to have a decent debate or presentation of a budget. It is a ceremonial occasion; it is a very important occasion. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Sir, that is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) That is a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They were throwing all norms and good conduct to the wind and that was well planned and orchestrated by no less a person than the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, we were told by them. Therefore, Sir, kindly look into the matter; how they brought all those alien matters into the House.

There shall be freedom of speech, debate and proceeding in Parliament and such freedom of speech, debate or proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached

What has happened is, there is an unseen hand which has prevailed over the media not allowing to publish what took place in the House yesterday. That is the violation of Privilege, Sir. - [Interruption.] That is my objection, Sir. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is the business of the Hon. Speaker -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, you cannot have outsiders coming and interfering. The Hon. Speaker never gave an order; the Hon. Speaker did not give an order. - [Interruption.] You are talking nonsense! - [Interruption.] Put your hat on. - [Interruption.] .

( ) (An Hon. Member) He is the Deputy Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) What is the use of the Deputy Minister? Only a Minister can present the Appropriation Bill and the person who made the Speech must be in the House. Where is he? Has he gone to Washington? - [Interruption.]

The Hon. Member is referring to the conduct of His Excellency the President. He has gone on a very important and historic mission to Ukraine. You cannot say that he left this country to somebody and went. The Hon. Member must withdraw that or it must be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Ministries of Finance and Planning, Ports and Aviation, Highways, Defence, and even the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, all come under one person. He is out of the country at the most important time, when the Budget is presented. So what is the meaning of this? I am not referring to names. I am only mentioning about a Minister. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, you will have to do a lot of jumping around if you want to move forward to the Front Benches. So, all you have got to do is to listen to what we are saying and then respond. . . . [ ] , . . . [ ] , . , . -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for allotting me time to speak on the Debate on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill for 2010. I listened to the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance and Planning yesterday when he made his Budget Speech. Going through the contents of that Speech, I am unable to see any proper budgetary position placed before this House. I would like to elaborate as to why I say so.

In the Pre-Election Budgetary Position Report published in 2010, for the purpose of the General Election which was held, required in terms of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003, the external debt and service payments was forecast for the year 2010 as US Dollars 810 million. That is a sizeable component of the total budget for this year. This shows us that what was presented is not what ought to have been presented because what ought to have been presented is the Government's proposal for the raising of revenue; for the spending that is necessary for the people. With the disclosure of the amounts as necessary for debt servicing, one finds that annual budgets, now for some time, have been merely reports of how our debts are to be serviced and that is about all. The situation is far worse than that because if you compare the actual figures with those of the previous year's Budget, there is a shortfall of more than Rs. 100 billion in the raising of revenue.

As an example, Sir, I would like to point to the figure of Rs. 855 billion as the expected revenue to be raised for the year 2009 but the actual sum raised was Rs. 725 billion, a staggering shortfall of about Rs. 130 billion. That was in the last year. So, one wonders what we are doing with the figures that are printed in the Budget Speech; whether they represent any reality at all, if there can be a difference of over Rs.100 billion last year. I can go on with the figures for three years, if necessary. In the year before last, the expected revenue was Rs. 750 billion and the actual sum raised was to Rs.709 billion. There was a shortfall of about Rs.50 billion. One wonders whether this Debate is useful at all. We have figures before us which have no bearing on the actual position. There is a reason for that. The reason, I believe, is that Parliament really does not have full control over public finance as required under Article 148 of the Constitution. At this stage of the Debate, I would like to concentrate a little on that aspect of the matter because I think that is an important issue. We have a Chapter on Finance in our Constitution and it begins with Article 148, which states, I quote:

Parliament shall have full control over public finance.

Then, the Chapter goes on up to Article 151, which I will come to in a moment. But, if Parliament is to have full control, there needs to be a Minister of Finance who is accountable to Parliament. That is a sine qua non. I am quite aware of the Constitutional position which says that His Excellency the President can retain certain subjects for himself as well as assign certain subjects to other Cabinet Ministers. Yet, this House is well aware of the Determination of the Supreme Court with regard to the portfolio of Defence. Even though the Constitution states that any subject can be assigned to a Minister in the Cabinet, it is now firmly ruled - I respectfully agree with that Determination - that having regard to the nature of the office of the Minister of Defence, it is necessary that the portfolio of Defence be held by his Excellency the President who is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Similarly, if one reads through the

245 246

Constitution, particularly with regard to the Chapter on Finance, one can come to the conclusion without any doubt that the President cannot hold the portfolio of Finance. I will read out Article 151(1) of the Constitution for that, which is with regard to the Contingencies Fund. It states, I quote:

Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Article 149, Parliament may by law create a Contingencies Fund for the purpose of providing for urgent and unforeseen expenditure.

I will come to that "urgent and unforeseen" issue a little later. Further, Article 151(2) states, I quote:

The Minister in charge of the subject of Finance, if satisfied -

There are two limbs, (a) and (b), that follow it and then it goes on to state, I quote:

......may, with the consent of the President, authorize provision to be made therefor by an advance from the Contingencies Fund.

It contemplates two persons acting in consort; one must agree with the other. The Minister of the Finance must obtain the consent of the President if funds are to be drawn from the Contingencies Fund. How can this dual safeguard ever be implemented with the Minister of Finance and His Excellency the President being one and the same person? I respectfully ask this House to consider that position very carefully because this House cannot abdicate the constitutionally-mandated responsibility that has been conferred on it, that it shall have full control over public finance. That is not a matter which can be delegated; that is not a matter which can be left exclusively in the hands of the Executive. This is the reason, as I said earlier, why I believe we have a Budget or a so-called Budget that was presented, which is really a non-event. It has no elements of a real Budget. I will give some examples before I sit down.

Sir, I urge this House to consider this very carefully because as in many other aspects of the functions of this House, the importance of this House is diminishing day by day, by this House itself abdicating its duties and functions. And, what more than this Budget to demonstrate that. In Clause 6 of the Appropriation Bill, which is before us, this is further accentuated.

At least under Article 151 of the Constitution with regard to urgent and unforeseen matters, the Minister of Finance and the President must act together to draw from the Contingencies Fund only in certain events. But, from the year 2003, this provision in Clause 6 of the Appropriation Bill repeatedly appears and that authorizes the Secretary to the Treasury to transfer unutilized funds from one Head to another. Through this authorization by the Appropriation Acts that are passed annually, provisions of the Constitution are being violated because if it is necessary for two persons, that is, for the President and the Minister of Finance, to act together - that is a strict requirement of the Constitution - how can, through

an Appropriation Bill that is made into law, the Secretary to the Treasury, and this time, the Secretary to the Treasury or a Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, make that transfer if funds are not utilized for a purpose that it is assigned?

Sir, you are aware of the Determinations of the Supreme Court in this regard when certain person challenged the Appropriation Bill in the years 2007 and 2008. In the year 2007, in the Determination that was communicated to this House, the Supreme Court stated very clearly that although it appears in that form in Clause 6, the Secretary to the Treasury must include the respective reports submitted in terms of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act when he reports to this House. That was a very clear indication of what the Supreme Court thought of this provision that has now started to become an annual feature and the next year a much stronger statement was made. In that determination, it was required that the Bill be amended and it was amended and now it appears in that amended form that there is a requirement that within two months of that transfer, that must be reported to this House. That is the way the Supreme Court dealt with an unconstitutional provision in the Appropriation Bill. Being a finance statute, ordinarily with regard to constitutionality, courts do not interfere. So, with that line of thinking, first the court gently nudged this House and thereafter made it very specific and said, "This is unconstitutional unless you amend it in this way". But, it seems to me that this House has done just that was required to be done without due regard to the responsibility of this House that has been conferred on by the Constitution that it must have full control over public finance. This kind of abdication has resulted in the present proposal. I cannot even call it a "proposal" because it is just a strategy for financing the ever-growing debt that the country is being committed to.

There is yet another very serious issue and that appears in Section 22 of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003. There it states, I quote:

22. (1) The Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance, may in writing, request any Ministry, Department, Public Corporation or Company in which the Government owns shares, to furnish to him or her, such information as is necessary for the preparation of the Statement referred to in section 4 and the Reports referred to in sections 7, 10, 13 and 16.

One of those is the annual Budget. The other is the Pre-Election Budgetary Position Report. Now, it is contemplated by an Act passed by this House in 2003 that disclosure be made in the Budget of the shares that are held by the Government in corporations or in companies and their financial positions. This House passes that law, makes it obligatory for that statement to be reflected in what is submitted to this House and then ignores it totally. That is a not a very responsible act and I believe the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance, having had a very long career in Public Service, would recognize that more than anybody else.

What about the contingent liability? There is, I believe, a contingent liability. This is at least one item that the country is aware of and that is due to the hedging deal that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation entered into which become the subject matter of an international arbitration now. The contingent liability is somewhere between US Dollars 500 million and 800 million. That would approximate Rs. 100 billion. Now, that is not reflected in anything that has been presented to this House. That is what I ask. I most sincerely ask, "Is that not a matter that should be reflected - a figure as high as Rs. 100 billion?" And, even in the financial accounts of small companies, you will find them writing to lawyers asking whether there is some action pending against this company, what is the chance of the company incurring some liability or some other kind of liability that is contingent. That is the accounting standard to disclose it, so that a full and fair picture of the financial state of affairs of that entity is disclosed properly. But, in the highest forum of this country, this House, a Budget was presented, without even a mention of this contingent liability. I believe a question was asked by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, within a couple of days after the Seventh Parliament was convened, and the answer that was given was that there is no commitment to pay that money. That is not the question. The question is whether such a contingency prevails or not. If it does, it should, and if there is an arbitration proceeding that is ongoing, - the honourable Attorney General has disclosed that already Rs. 100 million or so has been incurred by way of legal fees - is that not a matter that should have been disclosed in the Budget?

Now, all of these are examples to show that what is presented as a forecast is truly not the position and it becomes impossible therefore to later debate on the figures that are given because none of those figures are real. But, even so, one sees the disparity even in these unreal figures that have been presented to this House with regard to what ought to be our priorities. For instance, Rs. 202 billion is still the budgeted expenditure for Defence whilst only Rupees three billion is allocated for Resettlement. This House was informed by our party, after we visited Vanni, of the number of houses that have been destroyed, and in response, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, commended us for the report and stated for the record that he is happy that we have seen the real situation; that we have found out the truth, confirming thereby that our report contains the truth and the real situation that exists in the Vanni.

We have disclosed that over 200,000 houses have been destroyed. The Government itself concedes that more than 160,000 houses have been destroyed. There is no commitment to rebuild these houses. The Government says that there is no money for this. When the Government says that there is no money for this - money is like time. When someone says, I do not have time, what he really means is that it takes no priority because there are 24 hours in a day. If I tell somebody, I do not

have time for you, that means he is not a priority for me and I cannot make time within those 24 hours. So, when the Government says, We do not have money to rebuild houses, it means that it is not a priority for them. I am saddened because the rebuilding the houses that were destroyed sometimes or most often by deliberate acts, is not a priority for this Government.

During the speech of the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance and Planning, he looked in our direction several times and spoke in English and invited us to go there and see what is happening. I would like to say that we have gone and seen what is happening or rather what is not happening. We have placed those facts before this House with a heavy heart. We have urged the Government to act responsibly and give due priority to these matters. The Government has acknowledged the truth of the facts that we have presented to this House and yet in the very Budget that has been presented, there is hardly anything to show that this is anywhere near, an item of priority for the Government.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I do not want to disturb your very interesting speech but I do want to say that during His Excellency the President's recent visit to India, he has discussed this matter and I am glad to report that the Government of India has proposed to build 50,000 houses.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We are thankful - ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Some of these are now in the process of negotiation. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The Government of India - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We are thankful to the Government of India.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is only 50,000. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) We also spoke on that matter.

249 250

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is right. There is no debate on that but what I am saying is that there are negotiations going on and when we come to the 2011 Budget, we will be in a better position to give more details of that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am thankful to you.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) - [Interruption.] Of course, it is not only you, Hon. Sampanthan, but we also, because you do not have proprietary rights on the Tamil people. They are also citizens of this country. You are an old Friend of mine but you have no proprietary rights on the Tamil people.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am thankful for the Hon. Acting Ministers intervention. What I would like to tell the Acting Minister also is that, what seems to be a priority for India does not seem to be a priority for the Government of Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am sorry, you do not understand what I am saying. That is, out of the total gamut of houses, we are negotiating not only with India, we are finding funds from among ourselves; we are also negotiating with other countries. Please do not insinuate that this is a matter which is not of concern to the Government of Sri Lanka. Actually, all the activities of the last year have clearly shown that we are giving the utmost priority to the rehabilitation of the North and the East. I myself visited with the President of the Asian Development Bank; we have got further commitments; but you have to understand that funding is a negotiating process.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank you for the reiteration of that position. All what I am saying is that the figures you have presented to this House do not reflect what you are standing up and saying now. If you can show from the figures that you presented yesterday that this is in fact a priority for the Government, we will accept that.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Under rehabilitation, we have that. But, this is a

process. This Budget goes only up to the end of the year 2010. But, we will have a more comprehensive programme which will be presented for the 2011 Budget. I am sure you will appreciate the fact that this whole problem of housing cannot be resolved in a matter of a few months.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is not only housing, but resettlement -

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If you say that, it is totally unfair. You made a very good contribution. I acknowledge that. But, it is very wrong to give the impression that the Government is not giving priority to rehabilitate the North and the East. As I mentioned earlier, it is one of our top priority items.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my time is running out.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. I am told that I have just two more minutes. I would like to raise this question all over again since the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance and Planning says that the comments made are unfair. All what I am saying is that, if you look at the rupees and cents of the forecast of xpenditure that have been presented, you do not see this as a priority and there is no gain in saying that. If through the figures the Government can demonstrate, I will accept it. But, merely because the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance and Planning says it is unfair and sounds very hurt, we cannot accept that. We would like to accept your sentiments -

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I will refer to the printed estimates and show you all the details that you want.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, it is a fact that the larger segment of the expenditure is to service the external debt. In comparison to the other matters that have been provided for and even in comparison -

251 252

2010 30

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I have also shown that we have reduced the external debt considerably. You must appreciate that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Even in comparison to Clause 6 of the Appropriation Bill which I spoke about where Rs. 10 billion is set aside for the Secretary to the Treasury to transfer as he pleases, for resettlement there is only Rupees three billion. So, that hardly infuses any confidence and yet -

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) May I take just a minute out of your time? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude my speech.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But before you do that, I want to read out these printed estimates or shall I send this across to you? You can have a look at that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, your time is over. Please, wind up now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I have no difficulty with that. These are the printed estimates for the year 2010 and you will find itemized, that the money allocated to the North-East Housing Reconstruction Project is Rs. 2,417 million. Then, you can see money allocated to the Re-awakening Project, the North-East Coastal Community Development Project, the North-East Community Restoration and Development Project, Pro-poor Economic Advancement and Economic Empowerment Project and so on. So, may I just hand this over to you which you might be interested in looking at and may be somebody else in your Party can respond to that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you for that. Since the time allotted to me has run out, I will wind up my speech.

[.. 6.31] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . , .

Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is the seventeenth Budget I am taking part in this House. I entered Parliament in 1989 and first spoke on the Budget on 20th March 1989, Volume 55 - No.5 and I have spoken on budgets presented by several Finance Ministers such as the Hon. D.B. Wijetunga, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who presented budgets several times, the Hon. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Hon. K.N. Choksy and the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama who has presented budgets four times and also Votes on Account. But, in the entire history of my tenure of office in this House, I have not seen such an ugly sight as that was enacted yesterday in this House when the Hon. Acting Finance Minister and Planning was winding up his speech.

Today, Sir, we listened to several speeches in this House. But, a brilliant analysis of the entire Budget Proposals was given to the House by the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, the Minister of Economic Development. That itself would suffice to give a clear picture to the Opposition what the Budget Proposal is for, after all.

We are being dictated to be led by the "Mahinda Chintana". Now the whole world has accepted the "Mahinda Chintana". There is universal acceptance and acclaim to the "Mahinda Chintana". Why do I say so? When he first contested, he gave a pledge to the nation in the "Mahinda Chintana" before he was elected as the President.

, , . . .

285 286

. . " , ?" .

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I want to say this much. That is, we, in this House, have heard very many speeches. Now, Sir, we should understand this aspect of the whole economic process and its dimensions.

Sri Lanka's territorial exports have been tea, rubber and coconut. In later years, the Valuable Foreign Exchange - VFE - remitted by our expatriate workers too contributed considerably towards the countrys economy.

In todays context, with the ushering in of peace by our redoubtable President Mahinda Rajapaksa, enjoyed by the populace for over a year, Sri Lanka has established itself as the only country in the world to totally eradicate this menace of terrorism from the face of this thrice-blessed land by establishing a global landmark achievement in this arcane and specialized field.

Sri Lanka is now in an enviable position where we could now export expert knowledge on how to eradicate terrorism. We are exporting tea, rubber and coconut. Now, we can export expertise on how to eradicate terrorism.

There is a global demand for this commodity, if I may say so. Sri Lanka possesses the expertise and capacity to confront and conquer such a terrible and evil force which had beleaguered its people for the last three decades as it has demonstrated and shown by example in recent months.

, , . . ? , . . ? . . . . . , Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh of India, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, ? ? , ? , . , . -

The "Daily Mirror" of 29th June, 2010, states, I quote:

" Visiting Indias Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, Shivraj Singh has expressed his desire to live in Sri Lanka and has also sought Sri Lankan citizenship".

The Chief Minister of the Madhya Pradesh of Bharath

Nadu wants to come here and he was even asking for the citizenship of this country.

It further states, I quote: " 'I have gone to many countries in the world, but I have never seen a beautiful country like Sri Lanka with an environment decorated in green and yellow and I am interested living in this country.' said Chief Minister....... " " Speaking further, he said, 'according to the Rama-Seeta epic the place where Seeta jumped to the blazing flame to swear about her chastity is in this temple."

The Sri Lankan Armed Forces right royally qualify to be the next best export earner. The first is, how to eradicate terrorism? That is our first export commodity in this world today. The second is, being the best export earner by way of sharing its expert knowledge in strategy and tactics, its expertise and advice with those pitiful nations which suffer from this terrible fate of terrorism in these trying times.

Sri Lanka will go down in the annals of warfare history as the sole nation in the world which suffered terrorism for an extended period, but eventually emerged as victors which vanquished and decimated its terrible menace of terrorism. We are eternally grateful to His

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Budget Proposals for the balance year of 2010.

The previous speaker, the Hon. Reginold Cooray stated that this is only a prelude to a proper budget. Maybe this Government which has gone through so many elections and which drafted the first and second phases of "Mahinda Chintana" has lost ideas and its imagination and they are unable to produce a Budget that can propose new changes or something that can further enhance whatever they hope to do under the two phases of the "Mahinda Chintana".

The Hon. A.H.M. Azwer, during his speech, spoke very high of "Mahinda Chintana". He said that the whole world has accepted "Mahinda Chintana". But, unfortunately this Government itself does not take "Mahinda Chintana" seriously, because in "Mahinda Chintana" there were several pages devoted to development in the plantation areas but nothing has been done during the last five years. Construction of 50,000 houses was promised in Phase One of the "Mahinda Chintana". These were to be constructed within three years in the plantation areas. In 2006, they started construction of 4,500 houses when the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake was the Minister of Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development. Even those 4,500 houses have not been completed up to now due to lack of allocation of funds. So, if they themselves have abandoned Phase One of the "Mahinda Chintana", I do not know why they proposed a Second Phase and why they do not provide sufficient allocations for the implementation of the Second Phase of the "Mahinda Chintana" in this Budget. So, this is a failure. I think the Government is admitting their failure and that is why they have no new proposals in the Budget today. The whole Budget Speech was devoted to reiterating some statistics about economic development in Sri Lanka.

They were talking about doubling the per capita income. This issue was dealt with by my Colleague, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne sometime back. He said that if it was to double, then the rate of annual per capita income growth should be in the region of 15 per cent. It is true that the Government itself admits that development each year has been between 4 and 6 per cent during the last five years. Even if we assume that the development was in the region of 6 per cent, in the first year it would have gone to 106 per cent; in the second year to 112.36 per cent; in the third year to 119.1 per cent; in the forth year to 126.24 per cent and in the fifth year to 133.82 per cent. So, if the per capita income in 2005 was US Dollars 1,200, it could have gone up only to US Dollars 1,600 and it could not have doubled as the Government says. From this, we can easily see what the Government is doing. It is cooking up figures to cheat us, the people of this country and the world altogether.

In fact, even the Cost of Living Index in this country which is calculated by the Department of Census and Statistics is today manipulated. It is the normal practice

299 300

[ ]

2010 30

for the Cost of Living Index to be calculated from a base here. It is normal that a basket of goods that is relevant to that particular period is selected, the prices of those items are fixed; then you fix a base number, hundred or two hundred to start with. From thereon, as the prices of that particular basket of goods change, then the Cost of Living Index of each month is calculated and put forward as inflation in the country.

The CCPI which was introduced in 1952, at hundred base went beyond 6,000 in 2009. At the same time, they introduced a Colombo Consumer Price Index - CCPI - new. Under this price index, the Department of Census and Statistics now confesses that the baskets of goods are changed every month. The basket of goods they believe can be changed because when a particular item in the basket becomes too expensive, then the people adjust their consumption by dropping that item. If the price of sugar goes up, they say people would revert to jaggery during that period when the sugar is very costly. But, how can you say that the Cost of Living Index is based on a basket of goods? A basket of goods is selected on the basis of the natural consumption of people. If the people are forced to change their habits, then it means that the inflation is hitting them hard. That is why they change their habits. Say for instance, because of the inflation, because people cannot afford, they take only two meals. Do you then calculate your Cost of Living Index based on the two meals taken by the family per day instead of the three meals that they need? This is the question that I wish to ask this Government because the CCPI new is calculated on the basis of a changing basket of goods which is not the ethical way to do it or this is not the international practice.

The Ministry of Labour depends on the Cost of Living Index for fixing wages in some of the Wages Boards. Similarly, many trade unions have entered into collective agreements with companies where the Cost of Living Index is used to calculate the Cost of Living allowance but with the CCPI being manipulated today, those workers who are entitled to their Cost of Living allowance are being cheated of their increased incomes. Is this fair? This is what I wish to ask the Government. So, we have to see that the people are not taken for a ride by the Government manipulating the statistics and figures in such a way that they can paint a rosy picture instead of the actual picture which shows a doomsday situation. The Government has proposed that they would increase revenue from VAT by 20 per cent and they would increase revenue from income tax by 15 per cent. The income tax today is at levels that are considered to be incentives for investment.

At the same time, is the Government serious about collecting the income tax because the number of tax payers is so low whereas the VAT revenue component to

the Government is nearly four times that of the income they derive from income tax. The VAT is paid not only by the rich but it is paid by every person in the country; whether the person is rich or poor, everyone has to pay VAT. So, VAT is a tax that impinges on the living standards of the ordinary man. So, increasing the revenue from VAT by 20 per cent would be unfair to the poor man, the ordinary man. The Government is hoping to raise this extra 15 per cent from income tax by expanding the tax base. The tax base, I believe, is going to be extended to the Public servant who has not got his salary increase that was promised.

As far as income tax for the Public servant is concerned, preliminary actions have already been taken to introduce taxes on Public servants. In the past when the income tax return forms were filled, the Public servants were not called upon to pay taxes. But, from 2009, they have to send in income tax returns where they have to state the income, the tax they would have ordinarily paid and then the Government is giving a tax rebate in the form itself and the Government servant is not called upon to pay. This indicates that the Government wants to show the Public servant that he is being relieved of so much of taxes. Is this a prelude to introduce income tax to Public servants who are already drawing such low salaries?

Thank you.

(The Hon. Neomal Perera) 28. 30. [ ] 1,690 . 1,300. - A total of Rs. 1,690 million has been allocated by the Treasury for this. "Samba" is bought at Rs. 30 a kilo and "Nadu"at Rs. 28 a kilo, in case you did not understand what I said in Sinhala.

The highest amount of Rs. 1,300 million has been allocated to the Paddy Marketing Board and Rs. 180 million has been allocated to the Department of Co-operative Development. In addition, Rs. 206 million has been distributed among the District Secretaries in all the districts - not during your time, but now - throughout the country including Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Mannar. A 90 per cent subsidy has been given for fertilizer, keeping the price at Rs. 350 a bag. Even today, they are continuing to sell a bag of fertilizer at Rs. 350. In 1994, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe also promised to give a bag of fertilizer at Rs. 550. But, you know, he said at that time that it cannot be given continuously. He fought several times and stopped the subsidy. At that time, the paddy farmer would have consumed poison many times, but now they do not consume it even a single time.

Hon. Member, you also stated that there are 84,000 hectares in Hambantota, but I must mention that there are 84,000 acres in Hambantota. - [Interruption.] No, you mentioned it. If you go through your speech, you will see that.
