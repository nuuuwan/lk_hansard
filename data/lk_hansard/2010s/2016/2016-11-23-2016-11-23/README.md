' ' PRIVILEGE: "DAILY FT" REPORT OF 23RD

NOVEMBER, 2016

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I presented a Report yesterday of the Committee on Public Finance. I find this morning that the "Daily FT" newspaper of today has led with the story, Budget bungled? and the first paragraph is misleading. It is actually the opposite of what has been said in this Report. It states, I quote:

Committee on Public Finance Chairman and Opposition lawmaker, M.A. Sumanthiran yesterday charged in Parliament that 2017 Budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake didnt tally with the actual figures by which the Ministry was working on.

That is totally false because I have explained in the introduction itself that the Minister relied on actual figures but those figures are not the figures that have been distributed in those three volumes; the red books and we have recommended that the actual figures be distributed at least during the Committee Stage Debate. So, this news item is totally misleading and mischievous and I urge the Hon. Speaker to take action on this.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. I will ask the Secretary-General to bring this to the notice of that Newspaper.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You can ask any question.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) This is regarding the students who enter the universities from the war-affected areas. They are from poor families. So, in order to help them, can you give them loans? Once they get employment, they can settle those. Because hundreds of students are suffering. Even, sometimes, they will not have their meals in the morning. So, can you consider giving them loans during their period of study?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) What you say is to give every student a loan and once they get employment, let them repay. Is it not?

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Yes, that is right and that is for those who suffer. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I will consider that seriously.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) They will settle it. And also, I will give you a promise that we all take the responsibility and settle the SAITM issue. I do not want to comment on SAITM. But, the students issue there should be settled. We will support that.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The MPs in the North want two SAITMs, not one. They have told me privately.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) He is concerned about the students. That is how we also feel.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) He said, Settle it. So, let us settle it. Help us settle it. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) But, you said that they are demanding for another SAITM.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Without creating problems, help us. , .

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I would like to reveal certain facts that were recently unveiled by the Ministry of Education. We are very proud of the fact that successive governments of this country have paved the way for free education. As a result of that, the nett enrolment rate at primary education has gone up to about 98 per cent. Even though it is a good rate in relation to the regional countries like India and Pakistan, we still have 2 per cent of young children not attending a school at all. So, we will have to look into this serious matter.

Sir, this is also very important. There are about 100,000 students who drop out at the GCE Ordinary Level Examination. Unfortunately, 50 per cent of those 100,000 students who drop out from schools every year do not possess even the GCE Ordinary Level qualification or do not enter any form of vocational training institution in this country. So, 100,000 students are idling without following any vocational training programme. Furthermore, out of the 200,000 students who sit for the GCE Advanced Level Examination, only 25,000 to 26,000 are selected to enter the universities. Out of the 25,000 graduates that we produce annually, only 40 per cent are readily employable. Sixty per cent of the graduates that we produce are not employable as they do not the match the market trends in this country.

We educate our children through so much of pressure and stress during primary and secondary education; we bombard them with a lot of information, theoretical knowledge and we get them to memorize subjects. But, after 10 years of education, they drop out of schools - 100,000 students are idling and another 100,000 do not possess any tertiary educational qualification. So, this is a serious matter that we have to look into.

If our education system does not produce a person who has a decent personality, social capability and who is readily employable, then we have to look into that matter seriously. We feel that the foundation of education in this country has been gradually weakening over a period of time. So, it is not a political matter. We will have to get together and teach students at schools about the trends in the marketplace, about global trends and change their attitudes.

So, what are the areas that we should be talking about? Even though parents traditionally wanted their children to become doctors, lawyers or government servants, now the trend is rapidly changing. We talk about the Sri Lankan tourism industry. We want to get about 2.5 million tourists by 2020. If we are to cater to 2.5 million tourists in this country, we need to have another 600,000 to 700,000 skilled workforce in hospitality management - it is not a small number, it is a large number. Are we prepared to provide that to the tourism industry?

Sir, in the field of health, the private sector is largely expanding. We have a severe shortage of paramedics, medical laboratory technicians, nurses and doctors. We know that certain private hospitals in this country have their own nursing schools which give diplomas. But, unfortunately, these nurses and paramedics cannot go to other countries and work with the professional qualification they possess. We know that NAITA and some of the Government institutions are working towards this. We request the Hon. Minister to look into this matter and provide them with a qualification that is internationally acceptable.

We talk about logistics. The Colombo Port is amongst the first 50 harbours in the world. The Hambantota Port has become increasingly viable with a revenue generation of Rs. 2.1 billion in the year 2015. There are about

707 708

[; ]

2016 23

45,000 ships sailing near our maritime line. But, we have a severe dearth in the field of logistics. We will have to encourage students to get into this field of study and we have to introduce new programmes for these students.

We cannot forget the IT sector also. The Information Technology sector in Sri Lanka has seen a robust growth during the last decade or so. We need about 1,000 graduates annually in the field of IT management. But, at the moment, we produce only 450 to 500 graduates out of which we lose a significant number to the international markets in the other countries.

I must also mention the fact that IT professionals are worried about the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement - ETCA - that the Government is willing to go ahead with. If this is signed, they will lose all opportunities in the Sri Lankan market to the Indians. They are really worried about it . So, we must be very careful about that and we should support- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Yes, Hon. Leader of the House. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We are not allowing a single professional to come and work in Sri Lanka under that Agreement.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Hon. Minister, almost all professionals including doctors, accountants and IT professionals are vehemently opposing this move. So, we must be very serious about this.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We will not allow. ETCA .

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) .

We have a lot of IT professionals in this country who have obtained even patents for their products. Since this is a very important area, I hope that the Government would not deprive them of their opportunities.

Also, the banking sector as well as the telecommunication sector have expanded significantly. At this moment, we cannot forget the garment sector which has brought in so much of foreign exchange to Sri Lanka. As per the experts, there are about 200,000 vacancies in the garment sector as of today. But Sri Lankan youth are not attracted to the garment sector any more. We talk

about value addition in the garment sector. We know that the garment sector in Sri Lanka has gone ahead in branding their products, but Sri Lankan youth are not interested. Therefore, we have to have some form of strategy to ensure that profits come down to the lower levels and the salary structures of the workers are revisited. Otherwise we will lose this significant market to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia.

We will have to have a plan to ensure that we develop the skills of our youth. Otherwise we cannot come out from the middle-income trap. In this regard, I would like to quote two important indicators that the world has recognized. One is the Global Competitiveness Index where Sri Lanka has been positioned at the 68th place. Competitiveness-wise, it is not a bad place. But, they categorically state that Sri Lanka has a skills constraint. Unless we come out of that situation, Sri Lankas position in competitiveness is not going to reach 50s or 40s of that Index.

The other indicator is the Knowledge Economy Index. We have been repeatedly talking about this globally accepted phenomenon. The Knowledge Economy Index has placed Sri Lanka at the 82nd position. The parameters that they have taken into consideration are, education, IT, research and innovation.

Thanks to the efforts of the successive governments, we have free education. We have primary education, secondary education and tertiary education free, though it is not up to the level that Sri Lankan people expect. We get decent marks for that. But, what is happening in the IT sector? We have been talking about that. During the last decade, we have seen an increase in computer literacy and usage of internet. It is said that it has gone up to about 40 per cent. But the truth is only 15 per cent to 18 per cent of the Sri Lankans can use a computer.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only five more minutes. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Okay. So, in that regard, we welcome the move by the Government to give Tabs free to Advanced Level students and also to teachers. The Government is trying to do something good, but on the other hand, they are trying to curtail the use by increasing the levy or the tariff on the usage of internet. We would like to tell the Government that it is good to give Tabs but, at the same time try to reduce the levy on internet usage. I have to state that giving Tabs is a good move by the Government.

Then, the most important factor in the Knowledge Economy Index is research and innovation. Sir, we know that least attention has been paid to this area over a long period of time. I know the Hon. Minister who is in charge of this is very keen about this. He has travelled the world over. We hope that he would take necessary initiatives to ensure that we do more research in all the fields. It could

709 710

be in the garment sector, plantation sector, motor mechanic or IT sector. We have to encourage research and innovation. Unless we have our own products we would be falling behind the developed countries. So research and innovation is not an area that we have visited or invested in significantly. If we are to go ahead as a developed country, I have to state categorically that we will have to put more effort into research and innovation.

All these are linked to one key factor, which is the English language. Even though English has been taught as a subject in schools in Sri Lanka for five or six decades since Independence, most students are not fluent in English and cannot use English properly. Recently, according to a survey conducted by the private sector, most of the employers in private sector organizations wanted 80 per cent of their skilled workforce to know English. When it comes to the middle-level skilled workforce, employers wanted 40 per cent of them to know English. But we have not reached the required level. So, educationists and academics need to ensure that English is taught in schools in a way that students can grab it. I personally feel that the methodology of teaching English has to be redesigned because English is a key component for knowledge.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, we are going towards the fourth industrial revolution. We have seen the changes that took place in the developed world starting from the steam engine, production of steel, developing rail roads, electrification, telegraphs and from there to atomic energy development. All that has happened all over the world and from there, IT era has come where coding, software and automation has taken place. Unless we show our students the way forward, come together despite political differences and design a policy framework, our children, our youngsters would be falling behind. It is high time that we get together and develop such work and show the way forward for the Sri Lankan youth.

Thank you, very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Ashok Abeysinghe. You have five minutes; .

For example, . . . , - if we have money to build the roads, then we should call for tenders. I agree. But, when we do not have money, when we have to borrow it from Japan or China, we have to give the contract to a Japanese or a Chinese contractor.

[4.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Chair, today, on the Votes of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, I wish to make a special mention about the very astute Leader of the House and the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. I have known the Hon. Minister for

781 782

many years and his unflinching professionalism coupled with steadfastness and dedication to his office has allowed for a very productive and comprehensive outlook for the development of the key components in our country : higher education system and the road network.

Sir, I wish to bring to the attention of this House the issues pertaining specifically to the road network in the Batticaloa District. Over the years, especially due to the ravages of civil war, the Batticaloa District has been plagued by an unfortunate abundance of neglected roadways and poor overall accessibility. I wish to table* a copy of the letter in which the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella endorsed my request to reconstruct and expand the Batticaloa-Trincomalee A15 Highway in the Eravur Urban Council jurisdiction. This has been a long-felt need of the people of Eravur. Although the highway has been reconstructed and expanded to accommodate four lanes in the other townships of Oddamavadi, Batticaloa and Kattankudi, the portion of the road that passes through Eravur has been unknowingly neglected in the past creating a highly inconvenient and dangerous bottleneck situation in Eravur Town due to heavy traffic. As the Hon. Minister has already given his approval to my request, on behalf of my constituency, I shall request and greatly appreciate if this request is given the highest priority for early implementation during the upcoming fiscal year.

Hon. Chair, further, the recent allocation of Rs. 60 million to Members of Parliament for development work has allowed for development of several roads which we have been proposed through the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways for the Batticaloa District. However, I wish to point out an important issue that the scope of work allowed for within this Rs. 60 million allocation only permits just metalling and tarring of the nominated roads. Owing to the intermittent weather patterns in the Eastern Province, a majority of these roads are subjected to detriment in due course and will turn into their former dilapidated state quite quickly. I, therefore, request that the Ministry allows for a special allocation to ensure that some of the more important roads are asphalted or concreted to maintain its intended integral state and it will also provide significant cost savings to the paymasters over the long term.

As mentioned earlier, the Batticaloa District is subjected to several bouts of severe weather throughout the course of every year, and the lack of a proper drainage system alongside roadways creates several issues for the populace leading to heavy flooding and making the roads impassable. Therefore, I request that additional money be appropriated to local authorities to implement a drainage system, so that these problems can be alleviated. Most local authorities, especially, Eravur Urban Council during my tenure as its Chairman, developed a comprehensive

master plan that includes a drainage system alongside its roadways, and is due to be developed only when the requisite financing is allocated from the Central Government.

Further, I am ashamed to bring to the notice of this House the shabby construction of the A15 highway between Trincomalee and Navalady Junction, which was constructed during the last regime around 2011, with financial assistance of AFD of France, by China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and other subcontractors. The road is presently in a deplorable state. This road includes six important bridges namely, Panichchankerni, Kayankerni, Verugal, Upparu, Gangei and another bridge along the byroad, all of which were ceremonially opened with much fanfare by the previous regime.

However, this road, which is the main conduit of transport between Batticaloa and Trincomalee Districts for tourism, commerce and administration, is in such a bad condition that some resort to travel along alternative routes. I understand that the DBST technology has to be done properly along this road and it has to be properly asphalted. I request the Hon. Minister to direct his officials to look into this matter urgently as this road is a key component of our Governments view towards the development and upliftment of the Eastern Province.

Finally, I wish to bring to the attention of this House that the Batticaloa District is considered by many to be the granary of the entire country. Most of the paddy fields in the District are in Paduwankarai area - which is called "Hinder Land"- where the Mandur Bridge is due to be constructed, and the entire community including its farming community is highly depending on these paddy fields. Further, Paduwankarai makes up for 60 per cent of the land in the District and Mandur is considered by many as Small Katharagama with several ancient important kovils and other important religious sites present in the area. I also request the Hon. Minister to look into the development of the Kiran Bridge as well, which requires immediate attention to ensure accessibility for the farming community, who traverse the proposed bridge area heavily.

In the meantime, I must thank the Hon. Minister for allocating Rs. 255 million for the Faculty of Agriculture of the Eastern University. Also, you have planed to improve the South Eastern University through the Kuwait Fund. And you have allocated money to improve the sports activities of the students who come from remote areas.

Thank you. [4.08 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Hon. Presiding Member, though I have talked many a time in this Parliament about the fourth industrial revolution and its importance to Sri Lanka and our

783 784

economy, I decided to start again with it today, but on another aspect of it, in order to form a basis and present my proposals to the Hon. Minister of Science, Technology and Research, as I believe the new technological possibilities present us a universe of new possibilities and potential to generate foreign revenue from global markets.

I would like to start by explaining my thoughts on why industrial revolutions are so important to countries such as ours. As I understand, industrial revolutions start with new technologies that lead to new innovations. Sometimes, those innovations can change business models enabling people to do things differently or things that they were previously unable to do. Such innovations and innovation models can sometimes grow onto create an impact at a global scale. Those innovative revolutions may start even with a simple tool.

If you look at the first industrial revolution, it created a manufacturing transition from hand production methods to machines powered by steam or water and they vastly increased the output of an individual worker. The first industrial revolution empowered individual workers to produce multiple units at a time instead of single units at a time and it created the "scale effect".

The second industrial revolution was a period of rapid industrial development, generally the period between 1870 and 1914, up to the start of the World War I, mainly in Britain, Germany, United States, France, Italy and Japan. The highlights were the build of railroads, large-scale iron and steel production, widespread use of machinery in manufacturing, use of petroleum and the beginning of electrification. There were improvements in productivity advancements in industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering and business management. As I understand, we, as a country did not gain much during the first or the second revolutions as we were not in control and we were under the colonial rule.

The third industrial revolution from the 70s onward was mostly about computers, automation, digital cellular phones, and the internet. It is the change from mechanical and analogue electronic technology to digital electronics. I am not going into details of that as we all are very familiar with it since we have lived with it. But in my opinion, we missed that bus as well - again, for the third time.

One could argue that we could have ridden the waves during the third industrial revolution, had it not been for the war. I partly agree with that. The surpluses that we could have made during that time, the lost economic opportunities during that period, all that could have well been invested on new technologies and skills development. We could have become a part of the revolution and we may not be in this present situation. So, in my opinion, the cost of war for us has been much higher than what we see in actual numbers. We have all paid a heavy price with lives, blood, opportunities and also another industrial revolution. The opportunity cost is very high and much of the Western world has moved way past ahead of us and we are here today with a balance of payment crisis.

Now, a whole new revolution has started. It is the fourth industrial revolution, which is about the combination of cyber-physical systems; Internet of Things, cognitive computing and the Internet of Systems. In this fourth revolution, we are facing a range of new technologies that combine the physical, digital and biological worlds. These new technologies will impact many disciplines, economies and industries. We now have yet another opportunity.

I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for allocating funds to start up a Centre of Excellence for Genomics, which is such a forward looking decision. But, Sir, I do not believe that Rs. 50 million is sufficient for that. I believe that it may require much more than that. Also, I believe that a properly funded project may have the potential to earn billions of rupees in foreign income. I can give you a very good example to rationalize my argument. The US Dollars 2.7 billion invested by the US in the Human Genome Project from 1988 to 2003 helped drive over US Dollars 700 billion in economic impact and the generation of nearly Dollars 200 billion in total personal income over the years. I believe that it can be considered as a great return on investment by a government. Is that not a good indication of possibilities?

Sir, most importantly, what cost billions of dollars back in 2003, after only 13 years, is now available at a retail price of around US Dollars 1000. With the application of digital technology, the Moores law, which talks about cost reduction and increase of computational power over time, has become applicable to Genomics and genome sequencing. I believe that the digital technology is also about equality and democratization of economic power. We no longer have to be the first country in the world with billions of dollars to invest to conduct research, innovate products and to take them to the global markets. Tools, equipment and knowledge are available at lower costs. I believe that a Genomics institute that can create an open platform for Sri Lankan innovators may create multiple business opportunities and it may well be an incubator for biotech companies of Sri Lankan origin.

There is another critical aspect that I would like to mention here which is also relevant to the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine. The world of healthcare is changing rapidly. It is moving away from being provider centric to patient centric care. I believe that Genomics has the potential and the promise to drive the charge to revolutionize healthcare delivery through personalized medicine instead of sick-care. We must think about models to predict and prevent diseases when diseases strike. We need to be able to fight them with more knowledge about the diseases. We live in an age where non-communicable diseases are accounting for more than 70 per cent of the deaths in the country. The rates of cancer and related complications are also increasing. I personally believe that a Centre for Excellence for Genomics, through research development, collaboration and private-public partnerships with providers and payers, may generate multiple opportunities and benefits to the society in a sustainable manner.

I remember that after the elections in January 2015, many people said that it was the Facebook that led the change. Maybe it is true; maybe it is not. We do not know. But, what I know for sure is that a lot of people freely shared a lot of their ideas, views, opinions, thoughts and analysis with millions of others through Facebook, freely and free of charge for publishing. The relevance of that story with todays Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry Science, Technology and Research is not based on the election result, but the virtual, technical product that may have helped the outcome of the election. Facebook empowered anyone with a suitable device and an internet connection to create contents to share them with a global audience. Arguably, Facebook is considered the largest media company in the world and interestingly, unlike the traditional media companies, it does not even have to create its own companies, to create its own contents and its users are creating them for them and bring in more users. What a fantastic business model! What is stopping our youth with knowledge and access to technology creating the next Facebook? Is that not the promise and potential of the fourth industrial revolution?

I believe, Hon. Presiding Member, that our youth coming out of the traditional education system are not properly groomed to become entrepreneurs. Most of them are just not ready especially to become true beneficiaries of these possibilities. Estonia, the birthplace of Skype, is a good example that I can mention here.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

Sometime back, Estonia decided to equip school children with knowledge to code and they took up many initiatives to equip their students with technical knowledge. Fast forward today, it is considered the startup capital of the world.

Every year in our Budget, we invest billions of rupees into free education, but it is a fact that most the best of the best are migrating from this country. Most of those bright people end up working for foreign companies without getting an opportunity to realize their true potential. We invest money to produce great brains, but it is the western countries where they migrate to become the real beneficiaries of our investments. We need to change the system today. We need to break the silos, connect the pipelines and create an integrated platform from the primary school to university to startup incubators and I propose that the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research to be enabled and empowered in that system, the right amount of funding, support and connectivity to create nationwide startup incubators and accelerators.

Sir, I believe that the Internet is the gateway to all these possibilities and we must make it available like the air that we breathe. I am principally against increasing the cost of the Internet access and data usage. To create capacity, we must open the possibilities. When the knowledge workers are trying to harvest the fruits of their knowledge, we must not impose taxes on service exports, but we must encourage them. The Internet should be made available free of charge and let us consider that as an investment for the future of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Okay, Sir.

As I have mentioned many a time in this Parliament before, we keep talking about Singapore, becoming like them and growing up like them. I agree that it is a great country. They have achieved so much. But, I do not believe that we could become the next Singapore by doing what they did. The next Facebook will not be another Facebook, but something completely different. Technology startups, well equipped laboratories that are in line with the "Maker Movement," guidance to willing people who want to innovate and funding to start up the right ideas, may give us an opportunity to create another Singapore, but in our own way. I personally believe that the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research is the place to lead the change for this and I believe that we have the right Minister, a capable gentleman, a person who understands the education system and the countrys strengths. This is the right place to start.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I want to answer a question raised by the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake in the morning. I take time from the time allocated to me.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. E. Saravanapavan. You have seven minutes.

[4.55p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Presiding Member, the Hon. Minister of Finance said that the Ministry of Education had spent only Rs. 38,850 million at the end of the third quarter of 2016 and therefore, he has reduced the allocation of the Ministry of Education in the Budget, 2017. If the Ministry had not spent the allocation in the year 2016, we expected it to reflect in the 2016 Revised Estimates. However, 2016 Revised Estimates is same as the 2016 Budget Estimates that was presented last year and we are unable to understand this. If the allocation for 2016 had not been fully spent, we do not know where these shortfalls had occurred and what type of adverse impact it had made on the education sector in the already war-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces. We need to know which of the Provinces are impacted by this unspent allocation. This maybe due to a systemic problem of lack of capacity in the war-affected Provinces and if no action is taken to rectify such potential systemic problems, these Provinces will continue to suffer.

We can clearly see a steady decline in the performance of the education sector in the war-affected Provinces, that we may not even need universities there, in the future. No attempt is being made to study and rectify this problem in these Provinces since 1983. When the Northern Province was topping in terms of educational performance, there were several deliberate attempts to curtail the progress of education in these Provinces by direct and indirect means, such as standardization and controlling of fund allocation.

However, we also need to know which of the Provinces have been affected by the reduction of the allocation in the Budget, 2017.

We appreciate the Hon. Ministers proposal to provide an additional allocation of Rs.17,480 million to further strengthen the development in the education sector. However, we are unaware as to how this amount is going to be derived in the first place, and what programmes are going to get its benefits and how much of this amount would be allocated to the war-affected Provinces. In this regard, the Hon. Minister has kindly offered to target the Provinces that has the lowest rate of GDP to reach national average by 2020. Will he also target to lift the least developed Provinces in terms of education to reach the national average by 2020? The cause is the same in both cases and the impact is also the same. But why are we selective in GDP and not in education?

Mr. Presiding Member, the war-affected areas have specific, systemic and peculiar issues. We cannot ignore them and expect reconciliation and peace. We can assure you that peace achieved with superficial means will not be sustainable. These are the areas where the Government can win the hearts and minds of the war-affected people and express their sincere commitment to a lasting peace and reconciliation.
