( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Speaker, I just want to clarify this point. This is a commercial dispute between the cargo receiver in Port Hodeidah and the cargo supplier, Keystone Oil and Gas Company. Let me also tell you that as per the Sri Lankan Embassy in Oman and the Consul General in Dubai, the shipping company has not received any demand for ransom by any party to release the crew. So, Hon. Member, what you read in the newspapers is not always correct.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Gurunagar harbour, two three months back -[Interruption.] The other issue is, the Milady harbour. The military and your Government - I do not know whether you know it or not - have allowed a private party to anchor ships and unload there. But, your Government has not permitted the people who have been inhabiting the coastal area to renovate the Milady harbour. Hon. Minister, I request you to look into this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera) , . . . . . . .

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) However, the Ministry of Defence has failed to respond to that basic question. But, private parties have been permitted and a lot of ships are anchored there. They unload and do business there.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Basically, what happens is this. We have rehabilitation centres under our Ministry and there is also the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation. We are taking all steps to rehabilitate these people. I will give you the statistics when I speak. But, the problem here is, the decision to rehabilitate these people is made by the magistrate and not by my Ministry. The magistrate has to make the order. If the magistrate does not make the order, I am unable to do anything.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Presiding Member, -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, I just want to reply the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake.

Thank you very much, Hon. Member, for bringing these issues out. I just want to clarify three matters. Firstly, I would like to welcome you to my Ministry at any time to see whether the Ministry is congested or not.

( ) (The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I have the right to reply. Please give me only one more minute, Sir.

The second matter is regarding the building given to our Ministry. I have housed all the departments of my Ministry under one roof. As a result, we have saved more than Rs. 50,000 on this whole transaction. So, it is wrong for you to say like that. Today, you cannot get a building in Galle Road for just Rs. 150 per square feet. If you can give me a building, I will go to that building.

Third matter is regarding recruitments in the Department of Prisons. You must get correct facts when speaking. There were allegations in writing saying that there are persons engaged in malpractices and briberies. Both the first interview and the second interview are now over. So, do you want me to allow people who are engaged in briberies to be appointed to the Department of Prisons? If you want it that way, I can certainly do it. So, with the permission of the Hon. Prime Minister, I have appointed a committee comprising three members - two from my Ministry and one from another Ministry - to make it really transparent. So, those three members will prepare a committee report. If that committee report says that the completed interviews are perfectly in order, I will accept it. If it says that it is wrong, then, I will refer it to the Hon. Prime Minister so that he can take action.

So, kindly you come up with the relevant documentation when speaking, Hon. Member. Please do not make incorrect statements.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. . [.. 2.09] ( ) (The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera) , , . , . " 150 , ." . , * .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Gajadeera, I think, you were the former Minister of Prison Reforms. I wish to state that we are giving all the facilities that are necessary for the prisoners at the moment. During your term, you did not consider giving even a mattress for the prisoners to sleep. I have taken this up with the Commissioner General of Prisons and I have told them that all prisoners should be given at least a mattress for them to sleep. We are moving the prison from Welikada to Horana and that will be of international standards. I accept what you say in that regard.

The second thing I want to tell the Hon. Member is, I never made any comment on the Commissioner-General nor did I mention any names that anyone has got involved in bribery or corruption. These are documentary proof which I have got in my Ministry. It is only on that basis that I have asked for an inquiry. If the inquiry report says that this is true, it is - But I have not said that the Commissioner-General has taken any action or anything of that nature. So, please do not mention names of people and I never mentioned that.

Thirdly, I wish to say that the prefabricated houses do not cost Rs. 2 million. It is much less than Rs.2 million. It is about Rs. 1.6 million now that I am not giving furniture, fittings and all other facilities.

I have tabled in Parliament the Peradeniya University Report which talks about prefabricated houses. I do not want to talk anything further on that matter. I just wanted to tell this to the Hon. Member.

Thank you. [.. 2.30]

Whereupon THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA left the Chair, and THE HON. (DR) NALINDA JAYATHISSA took the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Sumanthiran, please give me two minutes.

Hon. Fair Member, thank you very much for elucidating all those points. I am very thankful to you. This is exactly what is happening in the prisons. And this is exactly why I am holding an inquiry. The matter of issuing documents by doctors does not come under the purview of my Ministry. It comes under the purview of the Ministry of Health. So, I am sorry, I cannot take any action on them. It is really the Ministry of Health that can take action on them.

I am very thankful to you for elucidating those points to this august Assembly today and I am also holding inquiries regarding them. Thank you. -[Interruption.]

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Hirunika Premachandra) Sir, thank you so much for your response. Actually, I am going to hand over all these documents to you and I beg you to hold an inquiry on this. Thank you so much.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. Now, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, please.

[2.58 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilittion, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs. But I am greatly saddened as I start my speech today, that this Ministry seems to be the one that is riddled with corruption, from the speeches made in this House so far from every Member of Parliament including the Government Member who just spoke before me. They all highlighted the serious acts of corruption. The Hon. Member who spoke before me related the story of how the Commissioner General of Prisons started to weep when she confronted him. I wonder whether, when we finish the todays Discussion in Parliament, that would be the state of the Hon. Minister. I say this with all responsibility because for almost two years, we have stretched ourselves, accommodated many deviations and tried to work with the Hon. Minister and have dismally failed.

The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, President of our Party, announced in this House last year that we do not have confidence in the Hon. Minister; and one year later we have nothing more to say. We can only confirm that one more year of probation, one more year of trying, has only confirmed to us what the Hon. Senathirajah said in the last Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of this Ministry.

This is a very important Ministry. It is an important Ministry for us; it is an important Ministry for the democratically-elected Representatives from the North and East and our Party commands the majority of the numbers of those elected from both the North and the East.

The Hon. Minister will recall that when he was given this task, on the very first day three Members of the Tamil National Alliance met him in his own house at his invitation and discussed how we could work together. Because, the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs concerns mostly the war-affected areas and we represent those

3079 3080

2016 06

people and it was imperative that the Hon. Minister worked in consultation with us. That is how we started. But, almost two years later, I am sad that we have to publicly say that we have no more confidence in the conduct of this Minister. There are many reasons for saying this and I wish to deal with them one by one.

The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake stated how at the COPE inquiry, the Palmyrah Development Board came under scrutiny and how a serious fraud became apparent, because the officers themselves had signed and accepted that there was a fraud; that they themselves perpetrated the fraud. I chaired that particular Meeting as he disclosed it to this House today. Those persons are still holding that office. That Board has been changed - I do not know how many times. You consulted us initially. You took some of our advice; some you did not take. But, that is all right because you are the Minister. We were happy that you, at least, listened to us partially. But thereafter, there was no consultation whatsoever. You have appointed the Chairpersons and the Board Members to an important institution like the Palmyrah Development Board which concerns the livelihood of one of the most depressed communities amongst us. The distillery that they own belongs to three cooperative societies. The very fact that that cooperative societies-owned enterprise shows that the benefit of that must go to them.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Member, can you give me - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. I am not giving way. Please, sit down! You can reply when you want. Please, do not interrupt me.

You have hung on to that distillery despite the fact that the Cabinet-appointed Economic Subcommittee, for which both the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah and I attended, almost one-and-a-half years ago, gave you directions to hand over the ownership of that distillery to those cooperative societies. To this day, you have not done that. All you say is that you want to refurbish it and infuse capital. You are somehow very interested in this "capital infusion". One would like to know what your attachment to capital infusion is. So many families of those poor people are struggling to make a living. To this day, they have derived no benefit out of that. Those are their cooperative societies. They asked us about it. We have told them that a decision has been taken one-and-a-half years ago. Several times, in the presence of the Hon. Prime Minister, you were directed to do that and to this moment, you have not carried that out.

Secondly, I want to deal extensively with this housing project of yours. On the 24th of March of this year, you stated in Parliament that the Cabinet of Ministers had granted the approval for the construction of 65,000 permanent houses for conflict-affected families in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces.

It is in column Nos. 844 to 851 of the Hansard dated 24th March 2016. But well prior to that, on the 22nd of September, 2015, you said that this approval was given. I publicly stated that one month prior to that, in August, 2015, you told me in Sampur that ArcelorMittal Construction France was going to construct these houses. I raised the issue even then. How come that you could name the company, even before the Cabinet had granted approval for the construction of these houses or this project and how a tender process could be transparent and just when the Minister was able to say who was going to do that, one month prior to the Cabinet approval? I raised that publicly. You had no answer to that.

I wrote to you a letter dated 07th April, 2016, after you made this disclosure to Parliament. I table* that letter.

In that, I sought information with regard to 15 specific items on the grant of this award and all the tender details. You went public and said, Hon. Sumanthiran does not know, did not know any of this and has basically been talking through his hat and only now he has sought this information. I sought your information so that I will have it in writing from you, not because I did not know. I knew what I was asking for. What did I get? On the 20th of April, 2016, you replied my letter not answering any of the queries that I raised. I table* that letter also.

I will give you some examples. The first question that I asked was about particulars of the 15 bidders who pre-qualified and their respective submissions responding to the call for Expression of Interest. Your reply to my first querry is, Fifteen (15) bidders were pre-qualified. Is that the answer? I have asked for particulars of the 15 bidders who were pre-qualified. Your answer is, Fifteen bidders were pre-qualified. What do you take us for?

My second querry was, Criteria of the subsequently amended EOI." You say, Please see annexure 1." There is nothing; there is nothing amended. Similarly, for every one of those querries this is the way you have answered. I tabled those documents so that the country will know how a Minister answers particularized questions that I have asked as a Member of Parliament from the Jaffna District and the kind of answers you gave. This happened in April of this year. I did not make this public because we still wanted to work with you. We tried to reason with you. We told you very specifically that there is a large scale fraud in this.

Newspapers have revealed that one Ravi Wettasinghe is a local agent of ArcelorMittal Construction France. You know more than anybody else who Ravi Wettasinghe is; the man who fled this country; the man against whom several cases were pending. You know what his involvement in privatization of Werahera Central Workshop was; and he was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport trying to get out of this country. There is no denial that he is a local agent of this Company.

3081 3082

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

I will come to this company and its record worldwide as well. There is a revelation in "The Sunday Times" of 25th September 2016, recently, and that says Ravi Wettasinghe hangs around your Ministry all the time. "The Sunday Times" states, I quote:

The Sunday Times independently confirmed that this agent had been frequenting Minister Swaminathans office, making a mockery of the open, transparent bidding process the Government has publicly committed itself to. Mr Wettasinghe is a staunch supporter of the United National Party (UNP) and has, in the past, funded it. The sources said several members of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes inner circle were also supportive of the project being granted to ArcelorMittal despite having to eventually repay a towering dollar loan".

Now you put your Party and your Leader also at peril. I like to know today from you, whether Ravi Wettasinghe is or is not the local agent or connected to ArcelorMittal. And who is ArcelorMittal? This is a company that faces criminal charges all over the world. They have been fined; they have been fined in several countries.

"The Daily Telegraph" reported in 2008 that they were fined in court 26 billion Euros and then again there was another criminal investigation pending in Paris by a court that they were involved in several hedge funds which include SRM Global, Trafalgar and Altana Wealth. There was another huge fine that they paid for cartel. This company is registered in Luxembourg. And anybody can just check ArcelorMittal in Google and it will give you the full criminal record of this company. Now, this is the company that came with an "unsolicited" or "supposedly unsolicited" offer to construct these houses and quoted, even according to your letter to me, Rs. 2,188,551 for the construction of one of these houses. A house that has no foundation!

I have produced previously the photographs of this house, having personally visited it. I have shown you the gaps that have been plugged with various other materials. In my presence you called and asked the architect or the engineer as to why this was so. I have said in this House previously that I shook the walls and it shook and I find recently your comment in the newspapers saying, Sumanthiran must be a superman. There is no need to be a superman. Not even a baby can lean against a wall of that house; it will shake.

So, why are you so intent in doing this project, when even recently, all of us from the Tamil National Alliance, 16 MPs representing the North and the East, have specifically written to the President and the Prime Minister stating our reasons - with a copy to you - why we do not want this? Then, Hon. Minister, you go around the country saying that the Tamil National Alliance is against development; the Tamil National Alliance is stopping the Government helping the Tamil people. You know all that is false. We only do not want others lining their pockets in the name of our people. That is what we are opposed to and because of this wrong and false and malicious propaganda of yours, we have, on our own initiative, worked with a group of civil society and

produced an alternate proposal which will cost less than half the amount of money that the Government was willing to pay if your proposal went through. If your proposal went through for 65,000 houses, the Government would have paid US Dollars 1 billion over a period of ten years. I have already tabled the alternate proposal in this House and your comment to that is that local banks have only given Expression of Interest. That is not so. I have here the bank letter dated 27th May, 2016, annexed to the proposal revised same date, 27th May, 2016. The local banks very clearly make this offer and one wonders why you want to indebt this country to a foreign loan twice as much when this can be done with local loans that five local banks are willing to fund and twice as many houses can be built. And not only that, 13,000 people can find employment for four years. So, even 40 per cent of the cost of the house goes to our people as employees.

It is not prefabricated somewhere else and brought and installed here. It is built with brick and mortar, the kind of houses that our people want, the kind of houses that they want to leave to their children, their grand children and their great grand children. It can go on for four generations.

So, the most curious thing is, when you have an offer like that, that has been responsibly placed by us in this House - we did it because several submissions of that proposal to you have gone unheeded; you have not acted on it. Even now after we brought this out, we have been told, "Let Minister Swaminathan have 10,000 houses." Why should Minister Swaminathan have 10,000 houses? Are the number of houses that you have not enough for you? Why do you want 10,000 houses? Why do you want this on your head? Why do you want to spend the money of this country, indebting the country to a foreign loan, whatever be the sum, and help other people make money on the travails of our people? I am not saying that you are making money. But, imagine, what the necessary inference will be. If you stand on your head like this and insist that at least 10,000 houses must be built, what will be the inescapable inference? Why are you, at this stage in your life, subjecting yourself to this kind of criticism? This is, if I might say, the proverbial "last straw". After all of us have in writing informed that not more than those two houses that were built as model houses should be built using this prefabricated material, you decide to still go ahead. You are being defiant. You are still making statements to the press and challenging saying that - I can see the headlines "

" ? You have said that there must be political reasons as to why we are opposing this. I challenge you, Minister Swaminathan, to tell us what those political reasons are.

Just two days ago, you have made a speech, where you have said that the 13th Amendment to the Constitution is an adequate solution to the Tamil national question. How dare you say that? Who are you to say that? Did the people elect you to come here and say these things? You have been appointed as a Member of the Steering Committee to draft a new Constitution. Why do we need a new Constitution if the 13th Amendment is a solution? Ask yourself those basic questions before you

speak. You do not realize the kind of damage that you are doing to the community. Merely because you bear a Tamil name, we cannot allow you to continuously damage our people's future in this country like this. We have borne enough. This must stop at some point. If you cannot, I ask with all respect, please resign your Portfolio. Take some other portfolio. Give this to somebody of another community who will do a better job to our people. I am sure there are many others capable and willing and conscientious, who will do the work of resettlement and rehabilitation to the Tamil people of this country than you are doing at the moment. So, it is our request today in this august House that you please relinquish the portfolio of, "Rehabilitation and Resettlement" and give it over. - [Interruption.] Today. Yes, today! Otherwise, we will be forced to call for a division and demonstrate this to the country. Thank you.

.. ( , , ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Sir, can I have the right to reply?

There are two issues that the Hon. Member had raised. The first issue was regarding the Thikkam Distillery of the Palmyrah Development Board. The Thikkam Distillery has, probably he is well aware, run at a loss and all alcohol that is at Thikkam Distillery will go to waste by the end of the year. I gave an assurance - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Hon. Minister. Your own Cabinet Subcommittee - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You just allow me to speak, now. You kindly sit down. Let me speak.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, I am not going to sit. Your own Cabinet Subcommittee directed you to do something. Your own Prime Minister directed you to do something. Why can you not carry out those directions? - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Presiding Member, let me speak. I did not disturb him. I have a right to reply. This question - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why are you not carrying out the directions of your Prime Minister?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You sit down. This is not your - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, I am not going to sit.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Let the Prime Minister - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, tell us, why do you not carry out the directions of your own Prime Minister?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) What are the directions? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You were told to hand that Distillery over to those people. Why do you not do that?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, that was handed over. It is not under my Ministry now. - [Interruption.] Excuse me. Let me please explain the situation. The question remains is this. I have told the 80,000 people there, who really belong to the depressed class, that I will do the Thikkam Distillery and give it back to them. I have told that in a public statement. In public, I have told this in Jaffna.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is that, "doing?" It was running. -[Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) It is not me. I am not - [Interruption.]

3085 3086

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You do not have to "do" it. Just hand it over to those people. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Excuse me. - [Interruption.] Let me reply this. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why is this Minister being so obstinate? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) There is nothing to be obstinate. I am only replying. ( ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Members, it is very nice. It is a Jaffna battle by words, nothing else. So, we will sort it out. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Hon. Prime Minister. He was not elected from Jaffna. So, do not make that mistake. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Jaffna votes were washed away. Jaffna votes went in for Mrs. Maheswaran. So, we got one Member in. You got the majority of the Members in.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) You did not get anyone in. -[Interruption.] Why are you shouting? How did you all treat the people of Jaffna?

You ask the Hon. Member what happened to the journalists in Jaffna? How many journalists are living today? What happened to the Editor of Sudar Oli? People in Jaffna can walk in peace now. - [Interruption.] Whatever problem we have with the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, our Minister, we know one thing - [Interruption.] They can shout here. During the previous Government, if they shouted at a Minister like that, that MP would have gone. What happened to the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj? At least, you can shout at this Minister and - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) What about Batalanda? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) You investigated Batalanda, but nothing happened.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Hon. Swaminathan has to take - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Do not worry men! Today, you know what happens in Jaffna? People are not safe. People disappeared. Now, we have promised to develop Jaffna. There is a difference of opinion as to how the Minister should do it. So, do not worry. I will summon both parties, we will resolve it and give more money to Jaffna.

( ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Presiding Member, may I have your permission to pose one question to the Hon. Prime Minister? Hon. Prime Minister, our people have been suffering for a long time. All their houses have been destroyed. We are in a position to get some houses. Why do you want our people to live in a cage? We want a house. We do not want a prefabricated cage built up of steel.

We want a house built of brick and mortar in keeping with our civilization, our culture and in keeping with our way of life, that will last for three or four generations. It could be built at half the cost of your steel house. Why do you want to spend double the money on a steel house, which, in fact, is a cage when you can build a house at half that cost and our people will be happy?

All the Hon. Members of Parliament from the North and the East representing the Tamil people have written to you and to the President with a copy to the Hon. Prime Minister that these prefabricated houses be abandoned, and we have come up with an alternative proposal. Five banks in Sri Lanka are prepared to finance the construction of these houses. We can build double the houses with that amount of money. Why are you not taking it? Why is that proposal not being taken? We can build double the houses. Kindly give me a direct answer and kindly stop this. Kindly stop this!

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the bulk of the houses that are being built will be of brick. There have been requests by some Hon. Members to have prefabricated houses built. So, we will have some and if there is a demand, we will have more. If there is no demand -[Interruption.] Hon. Leader of the Opposition, like in this part of the country, we will have some prefabricated houses and the bulk is going to be made of brick and mortar. I will call for a conference of all of you and brief you all on how we are going to do this. I can tell you that virtually 80 per cent of the houses will be built of brick either by self-help mode or, as you say, through contractors. Already, the army has built some houses and handed over; they are doing that.

But, I can tell you one thing; that the people in the North are not going to live in the huts into which they were confined just after 2009 without even having the freedom to move. So, I can assure you that your demands for your people will be met. There will be no problem about that. If you want, I can meet you all. We will meet you with the Hon. Minister in charge and all the other Ministers and finalize how the breakdown is going to be, so that there would be no problem at all.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Prime Minister, may I respectfully pose this question? With the money needed to build those 10,000 steel prefabricated houses, 20,000 houses can be built. Why should we spend money on 10,000 steel houses when, with that money, 20,000 houses could be built and 10,000 more families will benefit? I would, therefore, ask the Hon. Prime Minister to kindly reconsider the idea of building 10,000 prefabricated houses. I was quite prepared to talk to the Hon. Minister and persuade him. I requested for a meeting, but unfortunately, the Hon. Minister could not oblige. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) , . , , . . -

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Building those 10,000 houses, we would like you to reconsider.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you all met me and we have agreed. There were some Hon. Members who wanted prefabricated houses. So, we will assess the demand and make a final decision. But, let us start building the houses. A certain number of houses have been built. Let us start building the rest of the houses in the North.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Where is the Hon. Minister of Housing and Construction?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Why?

3089 3090

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Because nothing is happening. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) He is building houses in your areas. We are building houses. - [Interruption.] ?

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) We have enough houses. So, please help them. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) , , . . [ ] . , , -[ ] , , , , . . [ ] . , . , . [ ] ; , ; ; . . ? . [ ] . [ ] . ; . [ ] . . . [ ] . -[ ] , .

. . . , , whether it is prefabricated houses or other houses. The majority wants non-prefabricated houses. We have allowed that. So, there is no problem. Now, it is a matter of finding the money and starting it off. That is what we want. We need another billion US Dollars, minimum, to get it started in the North. I met with the Chief Minister last week.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) What about the money? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We will find the money.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) From where? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We will find the money.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you very much, Hon. Prime Minister. I want to reply to the two issues raised by the Hon. Sumanthiran. Hon. Sumanthiran, firstly, -

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Are you resigning today? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I will consider it and tell you tomorrow. - [Interruption.]

Regarding the Palmyrah Development Board, I want to clarify this very carefully. The tender of the Palmyrah Development Board is not handled by my Ministry. That is handled by the Government Agent of Jaffna. He has called for the tender and he will decide to whom the tender is going to be awarded. So, it is very wrong for you to say that I was interested in this tender. I am not interested in this tender at all. The Government Agent has advertised it. I did not advertise it; he himself advertised it. The tender has been called for in accordance with the government rules and regulations. We are trying to revive the Thikkam Distillery to the best of our ability and give it back to the co-operative society. We are not taking it over. Today, the Thikkam Distillery is running at a loss. You must know that today, the Thikkam Distillery is running at a loss. Do you want a loss-making entity to be given to you? I spoke to Hon. Senadhirajah and he said, Okay." In six to eight months' time, we will refurbish the entire Thikkam Distillery and give it back to the co-operative society. I am not going to take it over and run it on my own. That assurance has been given. The Hon. Sumanthiran was saying that I called for tenders. I did not call for tenders. The tenders have been called for by the Government Agent of Jaffna.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not say anything about the tender. I talked about -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Do not deny it. It is on record. You first told this august Assembly that as far as the Thikkam Distillery is concerned, -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not say that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You definitely told that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I said that there is money involved. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You look at your statement. So, now I have clarified that. The money involvement has nothing to do with my Ministry. This has been done by the Government Agent of Jaffna; he has called for the so-called tender. He will decide to whom the tender is going to be awarded. The Thikkam Distillery will be given out to be refurbished with new machinery and will be given back to the co-operative society. I assure that to you and I have told that publicly. According to you, there are about 80,000 votes involved there. That is what you all are crying for. The depressed class has about 80,000 votes. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Those are not votes, those are lives of 80,000 people. We are not looking at votes. We are looking at lives.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you very much. So, I have very clearly clarified that point.

The second point is - [Interruption.] You can speak to the Government Agent, Jaffna.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, we have both agreed that the distillery has to be given back. We will ask the Government Agent to specify a date by which the tender is called and we will fix a date next year when the Thikkam Distillery can be handed over. Once the distillery is handed over, get at least 50 bottles and send them to the group that call themselves Joint Opposition. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the tender has already been called for by the Government Agent, Jaffna. The tender documents are probably with him. I am not interfering with any of those procedures. You can speak to the GA, Jaffna and as soon as the tender documents are ready, we will redo the entire Thikkam and it will be definitely given back to the co-operative society. You can be rest assured of that.

3093 3094

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) They want 51 bottles. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Member, by that time, it maybe 40. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Then, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran raised another issue regarding the prefabricated houses. He said that there has been an alternate proposal-

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Hon. Minister- .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Let me reply. I must have the right to reply the questions that were raised.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Sir, the Hon. Prime Minister intervened and promised to settle the matter. He said after that we will go ahead and allocate more money to develop Jaffna. We do not want your answers. The responsibility is taken by the Hon. Prime Minister. He said, It would be settled - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) This is the point. When I try to explain and give the reply, you say that you do not want the reply. You are just getting up and shouting. - [Interruption.]

As far as the prefabricated houses are concerned, originally, the houses were going to be built with furniture, fittings, computers and all facilities were going to be given. Because of your objection, I have taken off the furniture, I have taken off the computers and I have taken off every single facility that was going to be given to those people.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Still it costs Rs. 1.6 million. Presently the Government is building a house for Rs. 800,000.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I will come to that point. Let me speak on that matter.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is double the amount. Why do you want to spend double the amount?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Let me speak and explain that. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Minister, you can answer all the questions during your time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I have got time from my State Minister. I am on his time.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) This is a vital position because everyday they are making false statements in this Assembly.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Sumanthiran, what is your point of Order? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Minister cannot get away by saying that we are making false allegations. I have given you figures. I have tabled the letter that you gave. I am saying even now, even from Rs. 2.1 million you have reduced it to only Rs. 1.6 million. That is not false. When the Government itself is building brick and mortar houses for Rs. 800,000, you want to build prefabricated houses for Rs. 1.6 million. Why? Why do you want to use twice the money? This is not a false allegation. Do not say that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Let me explain this to you, Hon. Sumanthiran. Why are you getting so excited?

3095 3096

2016 06

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am getting excited because you are calling my allegations "false allegations".

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes. -[ Interruption.] Definitely, I will respond to them.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are calling them false allegations.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Okay. Then I will say, "allegations." I withdraw the word, false and just say, allegations.

Then, secondly, as far as the tender procedure of the prefabricated houses are concerned, it has gone through the entire tender procedure for the last one year and so. Many subcommittees, Cabinet Committees have gone through this tender procedure. I have not obliged to any request when the tender procedure is going in. When the Hon. Sumanthiran had written a letter to me, I was not in a position to divulge the names of the people. The 15 people, if you want to know them, it is in the Cabinet Paper. The Cabinet Paper is given. I can table that in Parliament. I have probably tabled that earlier.

Therefore, as far as the tender procedure is concerned, it is very clear, Sir, that every single step is followed. Basically, what I am trying to say is, two years have lapsed from the Presidential Election up to now, but a single house has not been properly built in Jaffna. If any one of the -[Interruption.] Wait! I will tell you. Will you let me speak? - [Interruption.] I will tell you what the reasons are. I will give you the reasons. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are going to run away. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, I am not going to run away. I will give you the reasons. - [Interruption.] I am not going to run away. I am going to fight this issue with you all. - [Interruption.] What I am trying to do is not for you all, but for the people of Jaffna. I will give you all the reasons. So, just give me another five minutes, then I will reply. The question here remains is that all the houses that have been built in Jaffna today -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You do not know about Jaffna. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You sit down first! I know about Jaffna more than what you know. Do not come to teach me. -[Interruption.] Sir, let me reply. The documents have been submitted to the Cabinet and approved. I have got a report from the Peradeniya University in response to the report of the Moratuwa University. The report of the Moratuwa University was supposed to be one-handed. When I spoke to the Vice Chancellor of the Moratuwa University, he said very clearly that he had not given authority to the Moratuawa University to give the report. Then I went and spoke to the Vice Chancellor of the Peradeniya University. Officially, Peradeniya University has submitted a report regarding these prefabricated houses. Some say it is made of tin sheet; some say it is so warm; some say it is so cold. The report of the Peradeniya University has been tabled in Parliament.

As far as the alternate proposal given by the Hon. Sumanthiran is concerned, he has said five banks have come to build these houses, but he has not mentioned a name of a single bank. He has got a letter from the National Development Bank. I spoke to the high official of the National Development Bank, and he said that that letter is only a Letter of Intent and there was no commitment whatsoever. In that alternate proposal that was tabled in Parliament by the Hon. Sumanthiran, there is a contradiction as far as the price is concerned. It very clearly shows that there is a contradiction. I will table that later later, because I am not well prepared to do that now. So, there is a contradiction. You can take my word on that and you can even put it on record that there is a contradiction.

Then, thirdly, when I opened the tender one year ago why did this consortium not come forward? Why did these people not come forward and not try to build the houses? Why did they not bring the finances? Now, when we are bringing in all these procedures and trying to do some development in Jaffna, why are you objecting? If you all want to - [Interruption.] A tender has been called internationally and locally about one year ago. I do not understand why you all are not aware of that. You are supposed to be the Representatives of the Tamil community in Jaffna. If you are not aware of the tender procedure, then how can I reply to that?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You even knew who would win that tender. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, I knew. I made a comment in one of the -[Interruption.] Let me reply, please. When I give the -[Interruption.]

3097 3098

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) How did you know who would win the tender even before you got the Cabinet approval?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I have not said at any stage -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You told me even before the tender was conceived of. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I told you exactly. I said that there are so many companies - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) How did you know that?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Wait. I will give you the reply. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) How do you know that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I will give you the reply now. There is no point in your raising the voice. -[Interruption.] I will reply now. -[Interruption.] Sir, the question here remains is, as far as the tender procedure is concerned, it has gone through every single step. I have made a statement publicly that even a company like ArcelorMittal, which belongs to one of the Fortune 100 companies in the world, and it is not a mushroom company that came into being yesterday or day before. If you google it, you will find it. You are talking about the google. Google it and see. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You will find it all over the world with no access -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Even many of the leading companies are trading with it. Their shares are being traded internationally today. In

countries like Luxembourg, Mittals shares are being traded. If that company is of no value, how can that company be one of the Fortune 100 companies in the world? Just be frank in what you are trying to say. I am not trying to bring a mushroom company into this country. I am only trying to do a duty towards the community. I am trying to build some houses for them.

Then again I want to tell you that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said that he had submitted the documentation to the Hon. Prime Minister and His Excellency the President. I want to tell you that your own Members of Parliament have written to me. You own Members of Parliament who come from Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Batticaloa and Mannar say that they want houses - prefabricated houses. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No! No Member has asked for prefabricated houses. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You sit down, please! I have got the document in my hand.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) That is a very wrong statement. No Member of Parliament has asked you to build prefabricated houses. Please show the letter.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I will show you the letter. Do not worry. -[Interruption.] Okay, now I have explained this to you. I have made it very clear to you. I do not want to get into any conflict with you. I only want to say that these houses are built for the benefit of the Tamil people. I have got 97,000 people written to me. They have given it to me in writing saying that they want the houses. Also, your Members of Parliament have written to me. -[Interruption.] The Hon. Douglas Devananda wants 37,000 houses.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That, we know. We know what happens. -[Interruption.] We know how people - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Then there are so many Members of Parliament - your Mullaitvu Member of Parliament, your Batticaloa Members of Parliament, your Kilinochchi Members of Parliament - [Interruption.]

3099 3100

2016 06

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no. -[Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Do not say "No" to that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I challenge you, no Member of Parliament - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Anyway, Mr. Presiding Member, I have made it very clear to you. I have replied-

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have taken the entire time of the Hon. Deputy Minister. Do you want to continue with your speech?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, I will wind up. I only want to say thank you very much for giving me time to reply to these questions. Thank you for the cooperation.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara. You have thirteen minutes.

[6.20p.m.] .. ( , , ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Mr. Chairman, first of all, I wish to express my condolences on the death of Chief Minister, Hon. Jayalalitha, of the Southern part of India. She was buried today, just now. As a Tamil, she fought for the country, fought for the cause of the Tamils in this country as well and we express our deepest sympathies on her demise.

Because I have got very little time, I will speak on some important points only. After the thirty-year war, 4,446 acres of land have been released by the Government for resettlement. In this resettlement programme, we have spent about Rs. 8 billion for housing projects in 11 districts. Owner-driven houses were to be built and unfortunately this has caused the beneficiaries financial hardships. Sir, Rs. 805 million was allocated for the water project. 1,202 wells are being constructed, 3,371 new water connections have been provided and 29 community water supply schemes have been established under the water project to solve the drinking water problem in these districts.

In the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, 2,170 war-damaged houses have been renovated at a cost of Rs. 426 million. Under the Development of Sanitation Programme, Rs. 418 million has been allocated and 7,600 toilets are being constructed. Sir, Rs. 758 million has been allocated to develop the infrastructure facilities in the resettled areas. Utilizing this fund, 171 internal roads, 29 schools, 23 hospitals and 41 preschools have been renovated. Under this Project, 104 domestic electricity connections were also provided and three street lamp projects have been established in the Kilinochchi District.

In the Kilinochchi District, 122 shops have been damaged recently. Our Ministry has agreed to pay compensation and Rs. 74 million has been allocated for this year as compensation. Also, our Ministry will reconstruct the market complex at a cost of Rs. 155 million and a fire brigade will be provided in 2017.

3149 3150

After the thirty-year war, we have now started reconstruction and development with the help of the Indian Government. We must be very thankful to the Indian Government. Financial assistance amounting to Rs.1,700 million has been received from India to construct Jaffna Cultural Centre, which will support the cultural activities of the Tamil community. The Cultural Centre consists of a cultural library, an art gallery, study rooms and an open theatre. The financial assistance has been given as a grant and the Sri Lanka Government should bear the duties and taxes only. Therefore, we are very thankful to the Government of India for this financial assistance.

As far as the Department of Hindu Religious Affairs is concerned, assistance has been provided to 112,000 religious school students. Books have been given and creativity competitions have been conducted. 5,000 religious school teachers have been trained to improve their capacity. Assistance has been given to 650 Hindu temples, including war-damaged temples for reconstruction and improvement of other infrastructure facilities. Financial assistance has been provided to 30 children's homes to develop education of 1,600 children. Further, the Ministry and the Department are in the process of getting public opinion on the Prevention of Animal Sacrifice in Hindu Shrines Bill. Within about two months' time I would be able to bring it before Parliament.

As far as prisons are concerned, we have the Welikada, Mahara and Bogambara Prisons, there are two correctional centres, nine work camps, two open prison camps in Pallekelle and Anuradhapura and 20 prison lock-ups. We have had 78,198 convicted and unconvicted prisoners from January 01 to August 31st of 2016.

The telephone jamming system has been introduced to the prisons. The Official Canine Unit has been set up in the Department of Prisons with the help of Sri Lanka Police. Rs. 57 million has been spent for purchasing raw material and on other expenses for industrial work and the Ministry has earned Rs.99 million by the sale of these industrial goods.

The aim of the Department of Community Based Corrections is to make the minor offender a free person from wrong habits and make him a respectable citizen through effective correctional process while keeping him in the society. In this year 9,791 community correction orders have been received from magistrate's and circuit courts and 71 per cent is in relation to drug and alcohol - mostly reported from Colombo. 2,597 drug prevention, counselling and spiritual programmes have been conducted by the Department island wide. In addition to these, 840 free service programmes such as renovation of roads, repairs of temples and buildings have been completed by our Ministry. REPPIA has been very cooperative with us.

To reduce the narcotic drug menace in the country, we have got the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation

Centre for the purpose of caring and rehabilitating the drug addicts. This year, 1,820 persons, including imprisoned offenders, have been attached to the Rehabilitation Centre. In 2016, misguided 44 male and two female ex-combatants and 411 drug offenders have been rehabilitated and reintegrated.

Then, the activities of the Palmyrah Development Board were questioned today. We have had an independent inquiry and found out that a sum of Rs. 592,000 had been withdrawn by producing fake documents. As per the inquiry, one executive officer was demoted, three increments of two middle-aged managers were reduced and a warning was given to two staff members.

We have got irrigation schemes as well as livelihood development programmes for the next year to help the farmers in Jaffna and in the Eastern Province. After doing these irrigation tanks, there will be a major irrigation system in the Northern Province, which will cater for about 70,000 acres of land in Jaffna. We have completed these activities and hope to do much more next year. Irrigation schemes in the Northern Province include storage reservoirs which assure supplemental irrigation during dry spells in the Maha Season and irrigation facilities to a limited area during the Yala Season.

The Northern and the Eastern Provinces have a large number of major and minor irrigation tanks and canal systems. During the conflict situation, all these tanks were damaged and I will be taking immediate steps by next year to bring all these irrigation tanks into proper use. There are 54 major and medium irrigation schemes in the Northern Province under the Provincial Irrigation Department. These schemes primarily provide irrigation facilities to 70,181 acres of cultivable land, benefiting more than 28,000 farmer families in this region.

The Valukkaiaru Drainage Scheme providing drainage facilities to 2,000 acres, 34 saltwater exclusion schemes providing saltwater exclusion facilities to 7,561 acres and the Jaffna Lagoon Scheme of 20,000 acres also come under the purview of the Irrigation Department of the Northern Province. Next year, I hope that all these projects and schemes will be implemented for the benefit of the people of Jaffna.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan)

Sir, I must, in conclusion, thank all the Hon. Members, both in the Government and the Opposition, who have brought many issues to light. I must really thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition as well as the TNA Members. Although they made some criticism, I was in a position to correct them and I am sure that they will cooperate with us in the future. As a Minister, I have

3151 3152

[ .. ]

2016 06

no personal grudges against anyone. I am trying to do all this for the Tamils and the Muslims in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and also for the Sinhalese - for all concerned. It is my duty and responsibility, as an Hon. Member of Parliament and as a Minister, to take all the relevant measures. Sir, due to lack of time, I table* my speech to be included in Hansard.

Finally, I must thank my State Minister, my Secretary and the officials who have supported me during this term of one year.

I thank you very much. : Speech tabled:

The Northern and the Eastern Provinces were severely affected for more than thirty years due to the internal conflict which caused a large number of internally-displaced people in the conflict-affected areas. Resettlement of the internally-displaced families in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces continues as a significant issue in our country.

After January, 2015, the Government of Good Governance has started to release the lands of the internally-displaced families in their places of origin gradually. Lands extents of 2,990 acres in Jaffna District, 1,000 acres in Trincomalee District and 474 acres in Kilinochchi District have been released until now and 2,743 internally-displaced families have been resettled in these lands of 4,464 acres. This land release gave a respectable improvement in lives of the people affected by the conflict and a projecting change in the national reconciliation and peace building in the country.

After returning to their place of origin or the relocated alternate locations, the internally-displaced families need to be provided with housing, sanitation, water supply and other basic infrastructure to enable them to have a durable solution. In the conflict-affected areas, most of the families lost their houses and other properties. After returning, they have no way for their livelihood. Lands which were released after 25 years, need all basic infrastructure developments.

Therefore, the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs allocated Rs. 14,000 million for the Resettlement Programme not only in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces but the war-affected Sinhala border villagers in Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts also.

1. Development Projects of the Ministry for the Year 2016

In 2016, under this funding of my Ministry, Rs. 8,634 million was allocated for the housing project in these 11 districts on owner-driven basis which has caused the beneficiaries financial hardship. Rs. 805 million was allocated for the Water Project and 1,202 wells are being constructed, 3,371 new water connections have been provided and 29 Community Water Supply Schemes have been established under the Water Project to solve the drinking water problem of the conflict-affected people in the 11 affected districts.

In this year, in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, 2,170 war-damaged houses have been renovated at a cost of Rs. 426 million. Under the development of Sanitation Facilities Programme, Rs. 418 million was allocated and 7,600 toilets are being constructed. Rs. 758 million have been allocated to develop the infrastructure facilities in the resettled areas. Utilizing this fund, 171 internal roads, 29 schools, 23 hospitals and 41 pre-schools have been renovated. Under this project, 104 domestic electricity connections were also provided and three Street Lamp Projects have been established in Kilinochchi District.

The war affected many families severely and left many families without livelihoods. In order to improve the livelihoods of these

families, Rs. 1,205 million was allocated and agriculture, fisheries, livestock and self-employment related livelihood assistance has been provided to 12,050 resettled families in this year.

In addition to these projects carried out by the Ministry, certain special projects have been implemented for various purposes in the Jaffna District worth of Rs. 583 million. Special projects such as constructing a bridge between Kayts and Karainagar, providing passenger boats, constructing a jetty to Delft Island and Eluvaitivu, renovation of the road between Velanai and Kayts, and the clinical waste and solid waste management of the Jaffna Municipal Council have also been implemented in line with other projects.

In Kilinochchi District, 122 shops have been damaged due to the fire breakout in the market complex on 16.09.2016. Among these 122 shops, 62 shops have been damaged entirely and 60 shops have been damaged partly. These traders who were already affected by the conflict and resettled in the recent past are facing severe difficulties due to loss of livelihood by this fire breakout. Hence, Rs. 74 million has been allocated this year to pay the compensation in order to support their livelihood. The market complex will be reconstructed at a cost of Rs. 155 million and the fire brigade will be provided in 2017.

The thirty-year war remained a barrier to the cultural development of the Tamil people. Construction of a centre named Jaffna Cultural Centre has been started in Jaffna worth of Rs. 1,700 million with financial assistance from India to support the cultural activities of the Tamil community. This Cultural Centre consists of cultural library, art gallery, study rooms and an open theatre. The financial assistance is given as a grant and Sri Lankan Government should bear the duties and taxes only.

In addition to the Ministrys Resettlement Programme, the institutions which are under this Ministry also conduct their programmes. The institutions under this Ministry are the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs, the Department of Prisons, the Department of Community-based Correction, the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority, the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation, the Palmyrah Development Board and the Northsea Limited.

The Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs makes effort to preserve Hindu culture through awareness, improve spiritual mind of the people and celebrating national religious festivals. The Department has taken action to promote Hindu religious education, conduct Hindu research and conference, practise moral and religious values among the Hindu youth through development of Aranery Schools (Religious Schools) and provide assistance to develop children's homes, elders' homes, and Hindu temples which are war-affected.

Various assistance has been provided to 112,000 students of Aranery Schools (Religious School) to facilitate to improve their spiritual and moral activities by providing musical instruments, uniforms, books and conducting creativity competitions. 5,000 Aranery (Religious Schools) teachers have been trained to improve their capacity. Assistance has been given to 650 Hindu temples including war-damaged temples for reconstruction and improvement of other infrastructure development. Financial assistance has been provided to 30 children's homes to develop education for 1,600 children. Further to this, the Ministry and the Department are processing to get public opinion in preparation of Prevention of Animal Sacrifice in Hindu Shrines Bill to control animal killing in Hindu temples. The main objective of the Department of Prisons is to contribute to build a civilized society by means of proper rehabilitation of inmates and thereby making inmates to law-abiding humanitarian persons. Prison system consists of three closed prisons in Welikada, Mahara and Bogambara, 19 Remand Prisons, two Correctional Centres in Pallansena and Taldena for youthful offenders, nine Work Camps, two Open Prison Camps in Pallekelle and Anuradhapura, 20 Prison Lock-ups and one Prison Training School for youthful offenders in Watareka. There are about 19,000 convicted and remand prisoners under their care and rehabilitation. Accordingly,

3153 3154

9,607 Rehabilitation Programmes have been conducted by getting involving 250,215 inmates within this year. 78,198 convicted and unconvicted prisoners have been admitted during January 01 to August 31,2016.

In 2016, Telephone Jamming System which disturbs telephone calling has been introduced to stop using mobile phones from prison institutes and an Official Dog Unit with the participation of Sri Lanka Police has been set up in the Department of Prisons. Rs. 57 million has been spent for purchasing raw materials and other expenses for the industrial works within the first three quarters and earned Rs. 99 million by the industrial division.

The Government has recognized the need to undertake urgent reforms in the prisons with the view to convert prisons into correctional centres based on the international standards. The relocation of prisons from the cities to interior areas is being implemented as a public policy in order to utilize the high commercial valued prison land to urban development. Under this relocation programme, the Colombo Prison Complex, the Galle Prison, the Matara Prison, the Badulla Prison, the Batticaloa Prison, the Trincomalee Prison, the Negombo Prison and the Kegalle Prison are already proposed. In this year, Rs. 2,800 million was allocated for the construction of Angunakolapelessa Prison Complex in Hambantota and the complex building will be handed over before the end of this month. Construction of the Jaffna Prison has also been completed.

The aim of the Department of Community-Based Correction is to make the minor offender a free person from wrong habits and make them a respectable citizen of the country through an effective correctional process while keeping him in the society. In this year, 9,791 Community Correction Orders have been received from Magistrate's and Circuit Courts and 71 per cent are in relation to drug and alcohol and mostly reported in Colombo. About 2,597 Drug Prevention, Counselling and Spiritual Programmes have been conducted by the Department islandwide. In addition to these, 840 Free Service Programmes such as renovation of roads, repairs of temples and buildings have been completed with the contribution of the offenders under the Department of Community-Based Correction.

The Rehabilitation of Person, Properties and Industries Authority - REPPIA - is giving its fullest support for the National Framework in post-war recovery and development by improving the quality of life and harmonizes the civil society with sustainable livelihood in the conflict-affected areas through implementing rehabilitations programmes for the benefit of persons, properties and industries affected by terrorist activities, civil commotion and political violence.

Under the Financial Assistance Scheme of REPPIA, the maximum amount paid for the war-affected religious place is Rs. 500,000.00 and Rs. 47 million has been paid to reconstruct 307 damaged religious places until September 2016. Compensation up to a maximum of Rs. 150,000.00 is paid to the public servants whose houses and property were damaged by the terrorist activities and Rs. 72 million has been paid for 643 compensation cases for the State employees for property loss. Rs. 111 million has been paid for 1,300 compensation cases for mostly-affected persons. The Cabinet has approved Rs. 525 million to continue the loan scheme up to a maximum amount of Rs. 250,000 for the socially re-integrated trainees in 2017.

The main objective of the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation is rehabilitation of misguided men, women, children and their family units by adopting varying therapies in order to ensure effective reintegration and reconciliation, through developing socio-economic standards having identified their rights and cultural value. Our country has been successful in accomplishing the great task of socially reintegrating the misguided children and youth due to war through rehabilitation to become useful individuals with positive attitudes.

In addition to that, to reduce the narcotic drugs menace which has become a grave problem for the citizens of Sri Lanka, Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation is instrumental in settling up of the Kandakadu

Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre for the purpose of caring and rehabilitating the drug addicts. In this year, 1,820 persons including imprisoned offenders have been attached to the Rehabilitation Centre. In 2016, misguided 44 male and 2 female ex-combatants and 411 drug offenders have been rehabilitated and reintegrated. To support the livelihood of the rehabilitees, a loan scheme to provide financial assistance from the state banks at a concessionary rate of interest of 4 per cent has been initiated with the help of the Rehabilitation of Person, Properties and Industries Authority - REPPIA- established under this Ministry. Under this scheme, 1,799 rehabilitated persons have been granted loans.

The main activities of the Palmyrah Development Board are restoration of palmyrah plantations, production and promotion of palmyrah products, conducting handicraft training programmes, conducting research, operating sales outlets called Katpaham and improving the living standard of the dependent families through promotion of palmyrah cottage industries.

Further, the Ministry has taken action to rehabilitate Thikkam Distilleries to promote the living standard of dependent families by using excess toddy in a productive manner. A sum of Rs, 113 million has been allocated to the Government Agent, Jaffna to procure necessary machineries and reconstruct the buildings. In addition to this, Rs. 110 million has been allocated for Livelihood Development Project to promote cottage industries in the palmyrah-based villages . Rs. 50 million has been allocated for the Palmyrah Research Institute for research and development activities which will maintain the standard of palmyrah products. Palmyrah Development Board has organized an exhibition successfully to promote palmyrah products and cottage industries.

Northsea Limited is a hundred per cent Treasury-owned fishnet manufacturing company established with the aim of manufacturing and supplying standard fishnets to meet the seasonal demand in order to encourage fishing activities and seafood production of the country. A five-year Strategic Plan has been formulated to increase the turnover and the net profit by enhancing the sale of fishnets through phase-out replacement of old machineries with modernized machineries over a period of three years and product differentiation and market penetration to compete with competitors. In this year, Rs. 103 million has been released by the Ministry to modernize the fishnet factories by installing new machineries.

Further, the Ministry has taken meaningful action through the Cabinet to make viable the company by supplying products to the Fisheries Ministry according to their requirements considering the social responsibility of Northsea Limited. I wish to thank the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development for his support. The Ministry arranged to get a Rs. 50 million loan for capital investment with the help of the Treasury bond to recover from financial crises of the Northsea Limited.

2. Development Projects of the Ministry for the Year 2017

The present Government of good governance is more concerned towards the issues of the Tamil people, especially in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. Even though remarkable developments have been observed after 8th of January, 2015, more is needed for the people living in the Northern and the Eastern parts of the country after the thirty-year conflict in these areas.

In the Northern Province, agricultural contributions are the major share of economy and hence irrigation sector plays a vital role. Irrigation has been practised in the Northern Province since ancient times and is almost exclusively used for the cultivation of paddy. Irrigation schemes in the Northern Province have storage reservoirs which assure supplemental irrigation during dry spells in the Maha season and irrigation facilities to a limited area during the Yala season.

The Northern and the Eastern Provinces have a large number of major and minor irrigation tanks and canal systems. During the conflict situation prevailed in these provinces, due to displacement of farmer families from their cultivation areas, maintenance of irrigation schemes could not be carried out properly for more than three decades. In addition to this, severe damages caused by heavy floods have worsened the situation.

As a result, most of the schemes were found to be in dilapidated condition. This has adversely impacted the socioeconomic situation of the provinces to a greater extent.

There are 54 major and medium irrigation schemes in the Northern Province under the Provincial Irrigation Department. These schemes primarily provide irrigation facilities to 70,181 acres of cultivation land benefiting more than 28,000 farming families in this region. Valukkaiaru Drainage Scheme providing drainage facilities to 2,000 acres, 34 saltwater exclusion schemes providing saltwater exclusion facilities to 7,561 acres and Jaffna Lagoon Scheme of 20,000 acres also come under the purview of the Provincial Irrigation Department of the Northern Province.

Due to the dilapidated condition of the canal system, the water losses were very high and hence the resource utilization was well below the designed level. The malfunctioning of saltwater exclusion schemes has caused saltwater intrusion into the cultivable lands and ground water. Since most of the schemes were not fully rehabilitated for the past three decades, they are functioning below their potential level. Reduction of groundwater and polluted groundwater are becoming major issues in the Northern Province. Therefore, there is a need to implement a project to rehabilitate irrigation schemes in the Northern Province to ensure sustainable irrigation facilities in this region. Rehabilitation of the abandoned or poorly-maintained but operational schemes, to bring them back to the tank parameters, to the original designed profile is very essential. Rs. 8,855 million is needed for the development of nine major and 45 medium irrigation schemes, saltwater exclusion schemes, Valukkaiaru Drainage Scheme and the Jaffna Lagoon Scheme. There are more than 2,000 minor tanks available for water harvesting in the Northern Region. However, nearly 800 minor tanks are functional. 417 minor tanks in the Northern Region and 176 minor tanks in the Eastern Region should be rehabilitated to irrigate 31,366 acres of cultivation land and 14,268 farmers will get benefits. Rs. 2,600 million is needed for the development of the minor tanks.

Restoration of economic assets and development of infrastructure are major considerations in the rehabilitation process which will support the resettled, conflict-affected people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. In 2017, this Ministry will allocate funds for the development of minor tanks to support the agriculture and livelihood of the resettled people and to motivate cultivation in the abandoned agricultural lands.

In the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, education sector also needs developments. Most of the schools were damaged due to the conflict situation. A certain number of schools in the recently released areas of Jaffna District need reconstruction urgently. Therefore, in 2017, this Ministry will allocate funds for the development of schools in the resettled areas to care the children of the resettled families.

Almost all families living in the Northern and the Eastern coastal area had been severely affected by the conflict and lost their income-generating sources. But, the coastal area has high potential for livelihood development activities related to fisheries sector. Expansion of non-conventional livelihoods such as breeding of sea cucumber and seaweeds have to be explored. In addition to this, inland fisheries have to be developed to support livelihood of the conflict-affected people.

Deep sea fishing has already been opened in the Northern coastal areas and necessary facilities and technologies need to be provided to the fishermen to improve their business. Considering the above facts, the Ministry has planned to facilitate the non-conventional fishing and inland fisheries in the next year and funds will be allocated to support the livelihood development activities related to the fisheries sector.

Along with the above programmes, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Affairs Ministry will implement the Resettlement Programme in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and the war-affected Sinhala border districts in 2017. The Ministrys Resettlement Programme will include housing, sanitation, water supply, livelihood assistance and other basic infrastructure projects to improve the social and economic conditions of the conflict-affected people. The Ministry will also implement various projects in the coming years towards the welfare of conflict-affected people.
