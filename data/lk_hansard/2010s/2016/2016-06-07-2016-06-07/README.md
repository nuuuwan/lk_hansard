, . We expected the Army Commander to give an immediate explanation. But nothing has happened. We have only received a statement from the Secretary-Defence yesterday. But it is inconclusive of what happened. The public, the country and we are interested, because this is within our defense network. It is one of the key army cantonments and dumps that was at Salawa. It is not only the cost, but it is costing the defense of the country. So, I hope the Hon. Prime Minister will explain what the Government intends to do.

[3.40 p.m.] () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Mr. Presiding Member, firstly, I want to thank you for the opportunity given to me to speak on this Adjournment Motion. Presently, the Sri Lankan education structure is divided into five parts: primary, junior-secondary, senior-secondary, collegiate and tertiary. According to the studies done in 2013, there are 9,905 Government schools functioning with a total student population of 4 million and 15 State universities enrolling 105,127 undergraduate and postgraduate students.

Our educational system provides good opportunities for some and disappointment for others. Most of the students are unable to attend a State university as places are limited and they have to face fierce competition.

According to University World News, only 23,000 students are admitted annually to the State universities out of the 220,000 students who sit for the university entrance examination every year. National Human Development Report shows that only 15.2 per cent of the students enter State universities. The balance 84.8 per cent of the students who are eligible for higher education have challenges for their future. Twelve thousand Sri Lankan students go abroad each year for higher education and that means US Dollars 400 million goes out of the country along with those students. Therefore, it is important to give the Sri Lankan students a wider variety of educational options to entice them to stay and study at home.

Swami Vivekananda has said that true education helps a person to think for himself. So, my point of view in this regard is that the Government has to create more options for the younger generation to get free education and there should be educational freedom. Both free education and educational freedom are equally important for our younger generation in Sri Lanka. Free education is a good concept mainly for poor people in Sri Lanka. But, that does not mean that we have to restrict education to a particular percentage of students who are entering to the Government universities.

We are living in a globalized world. There are no barriers or differences among countries. The quality of education is important and the educational freedom is also important. Free education for all eligible students who are entering universities is a good concept. But, in our country, the Government is not in a position to give every student who is eligible to enter universities free higher education. The Government provides that opportunity only for 15.2 per cent of the students on a competitive basis.

In this situation, we have to think about an alternate way to compete with global education. It is important not to look at private universities as an enemy of the Government-funded universities, but as an effective

means of absorbing the remaining 84.8 per cent of the qualified student population who are eligible to enter the universities. Unfortunately, in our country, the students of the Government universities think that the students of the private universities are their enemies. But, they have to realize that the other 84.8 per cent of students who are idling without an opportunity to get free higher education would ultimately benefit Sri Lanka's labour force. Ultimately, we only need a Minister who has his heart in the right place to withstand criticism and take up the challenges. That is my view.
