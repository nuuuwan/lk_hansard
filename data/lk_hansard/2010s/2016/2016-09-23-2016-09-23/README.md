[11.21a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Speaker, I am pleased to say a few words on this occasion when this House is paying tribute to one of the former Members, the late Hon. D.M. Gunasekere, who served this House for a period of four years, from 1960 to 1964. Several Hon. Members who spoke before me referred to the rare personality that the Hon. D.M. Gunasekere was.

Sir, the Votes of Condolence in this House are certainly not mere rituals where we pay empty tributes in this Assembly to Members who have passed away. What is more important for us to look at is the Members entry to Parliament and the period in which he served the country as a representative of the people. All of us know that 1960 was a turbulent period where this House had to face two elections in the same year, in March and later in July - we now have here Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka also with us - and that was a year where the country faced an attempt at a coup to topple a democratically-elected Government. Such was the period in which the Hon. D.M. Gunasekere entered this House and served his people. What is important for us to bear in

1035 1036

mind is it is because of such people and their commitment to democracy that democracy thrives today in this country.

I am not someone who had closely associated with him, but I have heard from the people, particularly the Muslims of villages like Bakinigahawela, Kotabowa, which are ancient villages where Muslims have settled down since the glorious good old days of the Uva-Wellassa Rajadhani. The Hon. D.M. Gunasekere had been responsible to look at issues concerning the miniscule minority like the Muslims and has even been responsible to ensure that they were allocated a separate land for their burial purposes. All of us know that Muslim burial rites have to be concluded within a day, within 24 hours, and they are not in the habit of cremating the remains of the dead. Therefore, they need proper burial grounds to allow the departed to have a final resting place. In this case, the Muslims of Kotabowa have always been keeping the late Hon. D.M. Gunasekere in their thoughts for this yeoman service that he rendered those people. That was also a period - especially after 1956 - in which there was this wave of Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism sweeping across the country, a period in which there was a massive revival towards nationalist feelings. In balancing the interests of the majority and the minorities, the service of people of the calibre of the late Hon. D. M. Gunasekere have to be always remembered. We need to pay a glowing tribute to the way in which such people conducted their public life.

It is also important for us to remember here - because I as a Party Leader who has to travel past Bibile - the days in which we had to face the horrendous war against terrorism in the country, there were times when we could not go through the normal route through Mahiyangana and Mahaoya to reach Ampara. We had to take the circuitous route towards Bibile and go through Bibile to Ampara passing Namaloya and other areas. It was the late Hon. D. M. Gunasekere who had been the pioneer in making sure that that road became a reality and that road is an important bypass road for the purposes of reaching Ampara in case there are difficulties to go through the usual route of passing through Mahiyangana and Mahaoya towards Ampara. Therefore, that again is a matter that is always remembered when the late Hon. D. M. Gunasekere's name is mentioned.

I do not want to take much time in paying tribute to him, but I must also remember here that the late Hon. Gunasekere had among his offspring whom he left for the country, the boys and girls - seven of them - a son whom he allowed to join the armed forces and serve the armed forces. Therefore, he should be among those parents who have that satisfaction of having contributed towards safeguarding the territorial integrity of this country bequeathing one of their children towards the horrendous war that we had to face. Therefore, that again is another important aspect of his glorious life.

He had lived until the ripe old age of 82 years and had served his people well by having been involved in the revival of the co-operative movement, having served the

co-operative movement, having been involved in setting up the co-operative welfare establishment in many parts of the Moneragala District during the period of the late Trade Minister, Hon. T. B. Illangaratne. These are all important milestones in his glorious political career.

It is my pleasure once again, Mr. Speaker, to be involved in paying tribute to one of those parted Members who had rendered a yeomen service to his people.

May I convey my condolences to his wife and children and to the people of Moneragala on this occasion.

Thank you. [.. 11.30] ( ) (The Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma) , , , . , , .

[2.11p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to say a few words on the Vote of Condolence of the Hon. Indika Gunawardena, a former Member and a former Minister of this country. It was my good fortune, Sir, to know Hon. Indika Gunawardena in my younger days, or for us to meet each other in our younger days. I came to know him when we were both in Parliament together at the same time. And, during that time, I developed a very close relationship with him. We often talked at length. I found him to be a very liberal person with very progressive views. He struck me as being a genuine Sri Lankan who wanted all the people in this country - irrespective of whether they were Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, whatever - to be Sri Lankans and to be one nation belonging to one country on a basis of equality and justice. I was so impressed with his very liberal and progressive views that I once suggested to him that he should become the President of this country. In fact, I proposed to him, Indika, you should stand for presidency in this country, because I do not think anyone else is more qualified than you to be the President of this country and if you become the President of this country, I am sure you can guide this country on proper lines." Of course, I think, Sir, humility and simplicity were the hallmarks of the character and personality of Hon. Indika Guanwardena and he smiled at my proposal and would not take it too seriously.

We are sorry, Sir, genuinely sorry, that this country is today missing a person like him. We are today engaged in a very important exercise as far as this country is concerned. We are trying to frame a Constitution for the people of this country on the basis of consensus, not merely amongst political parties, but on the basis of consensus amongst the different peoples who live in this country. I think it is fundamental that the supreme law of this country should be framed on such consensus. It is in countries where Constitutions have been framed on consensus that there has been peace, harmony, goodwill and prosperity amongst all peoples. You have several examples the world over. I think if a person like the Hon. Indika Gunawardena was with us today, he would have played a very important role in accomplishing this sacred task that we are all engaged in, because he was one who believed genuinely and sincerely that all Sri Lankans can live together only on the basis of equality and justice.

He came from a distinguished political family in this country, Sir. His father, the late Hon. Philip Gunawardena was a leader of a political party, a Member of Parliament and a Minister in several Governments. His mother, the late Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Gunawardena, was also a Member of Parliament. Several of his brothers are in politics. They are, Mr. Prasanna Gunawardena, former Mayor of Colombo, the Hon Dinesh Gunawardena who is the Leader of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna and a one-time Minister who is with us in Parliament today and the Hon. Geethanjana Gunawardena, a former Member of Parliament who was also a Minister. I believe, the Hon. Indika Gunawardena had one sister.

We convey to the spouse of the Hon. Indika Gunawardena, Dr. (Mrs.) Pathmini Gunawardena, his children and grandchildren our extremely sincere condolences on the passing away of a great man, a person whom we can, without any reservation or hesitation, describe as a great Sri Lankan. We are all sorry that he has passed away. His demise is not merely a loss to his family; his demise is a great loss to this whole country. I am personally extremely sorry that for unavoidable reasons I was not able to pay my respects in person to him when he passed away. I am genuinely sorry about that, that I failed in my duty to pay my respects to a great individual for whom I had developed a great deal of affection.

But I want to convey Sir, to the members of his family and all others close to him, our deepest condolences and assure them that the Hon. Indika Gunawardena will always be remembered by us as a genuine, good friend.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , () . [.. 2.18] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Special Assignment) , , . . , , . - - , , . ,

. , . . , - - . , , , . [2.46p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, I had the privilege of being in the same Cabinet of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga where the late Hon. Indika Gunawardena too was a member. Before I became the Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the late Hon. Indika Gunawardena served in the same Cabinet under President Kumaratunga along with my late Leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff.

To me, the Hon. Indika Gunawardena coming from a dynastic family exuded the important qualities of not only a matured politician but also a very humane person and a person with a sense of humility. His humaneness and humility is a matter that everybody agrees upon. But for someone who had foregone his job and the profession for the sake of the Party, for the ideology to which he had taken to, it is an extraordinary trait.

His involvement with the Communist Party of Sri Lanka since 1970s resulted in him entering the Provincial Council only in 1993. Along with the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, he entered the Western Provincial Council and along with her, when she led the then Peoples Alliance to victory over the United National Party, after a long rule of repression as they said, there began his Parliamentary career. Within that short career, he held several portfolios. I must very gratefully acknowledge the assistance he gave my late Leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, to implement the drinking water scheme for the coastal areas of the Ampara District, which was begun by him as the then Cabinet Minister in charge of Urban Development, Housing and Construction.

In a Condolence Motion, sometimes, it may not be correct to digress and talk about or criticize the ideologies to which Members committed themselves. There was a minor battle a while ago over a comment made by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama about the ideology of

certain Members of Parliament and the political path they have chosen, which was frowned upon by the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. True enough but the fact is that left of centre politics in this country has had its own challenges when it came to standing up for the rights of minorities in this country. We have had a galaxy of leaders who had led the Left movement in the pre-independence and post-independence history of his country and who had steadfastly stood for justice, equality and autonomy of the minority communities in this country.

The late Hon. Indika Gunawardena was someone who, in this House and outside, steadfastly supported his Partys ideology in taking forward the efforts to grant more power to the regions in this country. After the Indo-Lanka Accord, when the Thirteenth Amendment was introduced and the Provincial Council elections were called upon, the Communist Party and all the left of centre parties came together under the banner of United Socialist Alliance to contest the Provincial Council election held in 1988. When the Sri Lanka Freedom Party boycotted the elections, they became the official Opposition. The Party my late leader led - the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress - became the Opposition in the temporarily-merged North-Eastern Provincial Council.

There were many battles, both in this House as well as in the Provincial Councils, to try and convince the then UNP administration, which had by then become somewhat arrogant and inflexible when it came to devolving power in the provinces in which they were not ruling and we had several incidents where matters went to courts to find resolutions to the problems. Therefore, this issue of devolution of power and the left of centre parties and their commitment and midway through we also found the radicalization of youth, who also professed the same Marxist ideology, which unfortunately got mixed up sometimes with the nationalist ideology. Some critics would have even called them somewhat racists in their attitude. But then people of late Hon. Indika Gunawardenas caliber were there to steadfastly stand up and speak up for greater justice for minorities in this country.

The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama referred to the three dynastic families and the manner in which they had committed themselves to public service without any allegation of corruption, which I would wholeheartedly endorse. I had the good fortune of associating with all his siblings, including the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Prasanna Gunawardena, the former Mayor of Colombo and my former Colleague in this Chamber, the Hon. Geetanjana Gunawardena. It is only their sister Lakmali with whom I have not had much acquaintance, but all of them, whatever ideology they professed, have brought honour and esteem to whatever the office they held.

Therefore, it has always been a pleasure of knowing them and when it comes to Indika, I must once again say that he was a rare human being. With such humility and with very forthright views, he was committed to his ideology and lived a simple life throughout and had been a wonderful example for anyone who would take to pubic life.

1063 1064

Therefore, it is with a heavy heart that we associate ourselves in this Vote of Condolence and I would extend my condolence to his dear wife, Dr. Padmini Gunawardena and his two sons as well as his siblings, who are present today both in this Chamber and in the Gallery.

I thank you. [.. 2.57] ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) , , . . , - - - - . . , . , , . -, - . , , . , , . , . .
