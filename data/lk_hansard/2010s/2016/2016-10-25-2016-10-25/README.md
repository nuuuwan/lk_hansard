who subjected themselves to sexual reassignment have been involved in crimes within Sri Lanka;

(ii) if so, of the number of such persons; and

(iii) of the action taken against them?

(c) Will he also inform this House-

(i) whether individuals who subjected themselves to sexual reassignment after committing crimes have been reported;

(ii) if so, of the number of such persons; and

(iii) of the action taken against them?

(d) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Hon. Deputy Speaker, when the Hon. Member asks me this Question, what comes to my mind is what President J.R. Jayewardene has said when he was the Executive President. The Question is whether I am aware that some individuals involved in certain crimes subject themselves to sexual reassignment to evade those criminal charges. President J.R. Jayewardene said the only power that he does not have is to make a man a woman and a woman a man.

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE I . INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO DEATH OF TWO JAFFNA UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for granting me leave to raise the following matter of urgent public importance.

On 20th October 2016 two third year students of the University of Jaffna were shot dead by the Police at Kulapiddy Junction, Kokuvil, Jaffna. They were both riding a motorcycle at that time.

Initially the police reported that these two young men had died as a result of a road accident. But the next morning it became clear that they had been shot by the Police on the road. The rider of the motorcycle had died from gun-shot injuries, while the pillion rider is said to have died due to head injuries sustained as a result of the ensuing crash. The Police since then have changed the position and stated that these students did not stop at the police check point and therefore they opened fire.

While unreservedly condemning this unwarranted and unlawful attack by the police which has resulted in the deaths of two university students, we demand that an impartial inquiry be conducted into these deaths immediately and the truth found out and culprits punished. This inquiry must ascertain as to how gunshots were sustained by the rider of the motorcycle and not the pillion rider, if in fact they were fleeing from the police. This circumstance would tend to suggest, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the firing could have taken place from front and not from behind.

I was with His Excellency the President on the 21st of October 2016 at Trincomalee when this news came and the President immediately ordered a special unit from Colombo to go and take over the investigations. The suspects have been arrested and now remanded.

Whilst thanking the Government for these initial steps, I wish to ask the Hon. Prime Minister as to what further steps have been taken to ensure that the culprits are actually brought to book, including through independent judicial processes, since serious doubts have been raised

in the recent past as to the jury processes through which high-profile crimes have ended with no conviction at all.

I also wish to ask the Prime Minister what steps have been taken by the Government to immediately ensure that such unlawful acts by the law-enforcement authorities are not repeated. It is imperative that the whole country knows the full truth with regard to this incident.

I thank you. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the incident which relate to the shooting and the death of the university students have come as a shock to all of us. As you know, the police itself in fact launched the first inquiry, when they received information to the contrary.

I want to assure you that all steps are taken in a transparent manner and will be put before a judicial inquiry which is independent.In addition, the Government will also, at the end of the proceeding, decide on the need for an independent inquiry. We regret what has happened. The Hon. Minister of Law and Order will make a detailed statement to the House because similar requests have been made by two other Members of the House.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Douglas Devananda, please. II . TRUTH BEHIND THE DEATH OF TWO JAFFNA UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) , .

Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, one significant fact is, the person who died of a gunshot injury was not the pillion rider, but the person who rode the motorcycle. He was seated in front on the motorcycle. The pillion rider did not die of a gunshot injury, but the person who was seated in front died of a gunshot injury. The pillion rider died of a crash and consequent head injuries. So, the question arises whether there is not the possibility that the shot was fired not from behind but from in front. That is the question that needs to be probed. If the shot was fired from in front, the position that the Hon. Minister enunciated had been the position of the police authorities would not stand the test of reason. ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) The point of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is taken. The initial report says that the entry wound is from the side of the person who has got hit. The forensic reports are being sought on it. So, we will have sufficient information on it after the inquiry. Let me assure you that we are looking at it from a very transparent point of view and there will be a transparent inquiry. As the Hon. Prime Minister said, after the police conclude their inquiries, the Government can also decide whether they want a further inquiry into it. ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon.
