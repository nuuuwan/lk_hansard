So, he could speak from there. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) Please do not take my time. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) We are not taking your time. Order, please! This is a decision taken at the Committee on Parliamentary Business. If that decision has to be revoked, only the House can change such decision.

Sir, at this moment, I wish to draw the attention of the Foreign Minister and the House to the statements made by His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena at the UN General Assembly. It seems that there is a clear

1959 1960

[ ]

2016 30

diversion from years of existing foreign policy for no apparent reason other than pleasing the West. There has always been a clear reference to the issues such as the Palestine cause and the US-led Resolution against Cuba. Throughout the years, Sri Lanka has traditionally taken a leadership role in the Palestinian issues supporting a "two-state policy" maintaining that the occupied land needs to be returned to the original State. Sri Lanka has always traditionally supported Cuba on the US-led embargo against Cuba. Traditionally, both the Palestinian issue and the Cuban issue have been mentioned in the President's statements at the UN General Assembly. But at the last two sessions, neither of the issues were mentioned while diplomatically there was no reason not to mention them. Mr. Chairman, I raised this issue because, traditionally, from as far as 1968, under different governments these two issues were mentioned in the President's statement at the UN General Assembly. They considered these issues as issues that should be mentioned and they wanted to clear the Sri Lankan position very well with regard to them. But unfortunately, in the last two statements made at the UN General Assembly, there was no mention of any of these major issues, and it is a deviation from the tradition from 1960s up to now under different governments. By not mentioning the issues of Palestine in the Presidents statement made at the UN General Assembly, the question arises as to how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to vote on the 24 Resolutions against Israeli occupation on Palestinian territory and atrocities on the Palestinian people at the Forth Committee of the UN. The Forth Committee deals with the decolonization. Will there be a shift in the longstanding policy of Sri Lanka - being one of the strongest advocators - on the Palestinian issue? But, it is disappointing that the Palestinian issue, which was historically and always mentioned in the President's statements made at the UN General Assembly has now been left out for two consecutive years. I think the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake too mentioned this issue in detail. So, I do not want to go into details. It is worthwhile looking at it and resurvey the entirety of this foreign policy including the non-aligned policy. I think the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs mentioned that they are, in fact, revisiting and re-looking at the foreign policy of these two issues including the non-aligned policy. So, I think you should also give some valid reasons for it. Also I would like to mention the Secretary of State John Kerrys statement as the second issue. John Kerrys statement really needs explanation to the public of this country. In his submission to the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, John Kerry mentioned that Obama administration spent nearly US Dollars 585 million for restoring democracy, human rights and good governance.

Mr. Chairman, in his words, the Secretary of State John Kerry has stated, I quote:

We have supported important democratic gains in Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Burma. What are the democratic gains that the US spent on Sri Lanka? Kerry himself is basically admitting the interference in the political process of Sri Lanka, and thus it is a direct interference to another sovereign nation. As MPs and citizens of the country, it is important to know how much money was spent and where the money that John Kerry was referring to has been spent. It is the responsibility of the Ministry to let the country know - leave alone the Members of Parliament who are the Representatives of people sitting here in Parliament - but the country should know where this money has been spent. There are wild rumours that they spent through India to destabilize - in their words, "to change" - the administration of Mahinda Rajapaksa. If so, please, admit that; tell the country and the world, Yes, we did so. This is a submission made by the US Secretary of State himself. Hence, I am requesting the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs - I think the Hon. Deputy Minister is waiting to answer me - and I would like to have a clear answer on the money spent during that time according to Kerrys statement. -[Interruption.] So, I am only dealing with these two issues with regard to Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because I suppose that during the entire time allotted to the Hon. Minister, he discussed only what happened during the last regime. The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne, Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations, who was also a party and in the same Cabinet of the previous regime, is here. Forty one Members who are now holding Office here were Members of that Cabinet, and I am sure all these Members would have raised their hands and approved all this. Therefore, you should pose this question not only to the Members of the Opposition, but also to the Members of the Government who are seated here holding portfolios. Secondly, I would like to deal with something more important relating to the Budget itself with regard to the Ministry of Labour and Trade Union Relations. Hon. Minister, I think it is a matter that you should take into account. It is important to note that the EPF has been the biggest contributor - 38 per cent on an average - for Bond issues relating to all investments in terms of Securities. Now, you are the custodian of three million people - the EPF contributors and beneficiaries. In the Budget Speech, in paragraph 447 under the "Corporate Income Tax", it states, I quote: "The corporate income tax rate is proposed to be revised to create a three tier structure of 14 per cent, 28 per cent and 40 per cent. Income tax rate applicable on liquor, tobacco, betting and gaming, etc. will be continued at the rate of 40 per cent. SMEs, Exporters of

1961 1962

goods and services, Agricultural sector and Education sector will be subjected to the lower rate 14 per cent. All others including banking, finance, manufacturing and trading will be subjected to income tax of at 28 per cent. Importantly, income tax rate of 10 per cent currently applicable on both EPF and ETF has been increased to 14 per cent. Also, the Paragraph 448 deals with, I quote:

Due to the exemptions on investment income, the increased share of economic activity in the country is not under the corporate income tax leading to the erosion of the corporate tax base. Therefore, I propose to remove the exemptions applicable on the income from the investment on listed securities, Dividends, Unit Trusts and other instruments.

So, it will be Notional Tax Credit. I think the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva will know that when you say Notional Tax on the funds, they deduct 10 per cent as withholding tax, and that goes on over a period of 10 years, 20 years or 30 years. You calculate it and deduct it, and then you take that to the Treasury. Hon. Minister, this Notional Tax- ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Labour and Trade Unions Relations) I would like to give a reply to that. I must say that my Ministry is not the trustee of the EPF. The trustee is the Central Bank and it is under the vigilance of my Ministry. As regard to the imposition of the taxes, the commitment towards the worker has to be performed by the Government. There is no doubt about it, because when 8 per cent is contributed by the worker, 12 per cent is contributed by the employer to the EPF. That money is returned to the employee with 12 per cent interest. So, that commitment is there. That commitment would not be varied by the imposition of any other tax outside.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is exactly the position that I am taking up, Hon. Minister. Your concern should not be under whom the EPF or ETF lies, but you must be concerned about the three million people who are contributing to it and the beneficiaries of it. So, when that is hampered, I am sure you, as the Minister of Labour and as the custodian of those three million people, have all the right to move an amendment to this. Sir, we have had this bad experience in the last Budget also. There were so many things that were agreed with the President, and said that certain changes would take place; but none of those changes took place. So, we had to suffer the entire period of 12 months with the policies that were brought in.

There were solemn guarantees and assurances given by Ministers and by His Excellency the President that changes would take place; but that never happened. The only occasion where the change took place was on the request of the SLFP group. Hon. Minister, I am very happy that you are here, today. So, it is up to you to look into those matters. But please, do not give any assurance, because with our experiences and with your experiences, you are quite aware that these assurances have never been kept. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you have two minutes more. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Okay, Sir. Now, let me move on to the Notional Tax that would be payable on the source of income. The Finance Minister is suggesting that it should be confiscated, in other words, that will not be taken into account. The 10 per cent that had been deducted over the period of time is completely taken to the General Treasury and the Government is imposing another 14 per cent tax which amounts to a total of 24 per cent tax on the workers money. That will eventually result at least 2 per cent less in their interest income in the years to come. So, Hon. Minister, I urge you to move an amendment today to take this off or give credit to this 10 per cent which is the usual practice. Usually, at the end of the financial year profits are calculated and set off against the Withholding Tax. But, that is not possible now. We had a Withholding Tax of ten per cent and now we are being taxed at 14 per cent. Although I agree that it is under the purview of a different Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, as the Minister of Labour and Trade Unions Relations, you cannot get out of the responsibility of looking after the interests of the workers. They have, in fact, robbed the workers' hard-earned money, which all of us and the whole working-class people have contributed. Therefore, I request that you move an amendment to take this off from the Withholding Tax as proposed in the Budget, 2017. Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , ... . 20 .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I would request the Hon. Member to retract that statement. This Government has not and will not practise racial discrimination. Please withdraw what you said because it is totally inaccurate. If you do not know what is going on, find out what is going on. We are trying to change what has happened in the past. Do not accuse this Government of racial discrimination. Do not do that. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) No need to withdraw. Hon. Member, you continue.

Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) I want to clarify one matter with regard to jobs in Korea. That is not done by us. Those who wish to go to Korea for jobs first have to get through the examination held for Korean language, and the selection is done by the Korean authorities. We, as a Government, do not have any kind of interference with Korean jobs. We publish the dates on which the examination is held. So, please, get your people to sit for the examination first and once they qualify, they can go to Korea.

[1.45 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Plantation Industries) Hon. Deputy Chairman, thank you very much for giving me the time. I have limited time. So, Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale, please allow me to speak. You can make your speech later. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs constitutes a vital element of the Sri Lankan State. I would like to thank the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for defending the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of this country. They have done a yeomen service. Our Ambassadors overseas and our representatives overseas have withstood 30 years of terrorism in this country, and they have boldly championed the cause of Sri Lanka overseas. I would like to ask a very subtle and direct question from the Hon. Member who spoke earlier. You highlighted racial discrimination in your speech. Is the killing of Tamil political leaders a racial discrimination? Who killed the Tamil leaders like Mr. Alfred Duraiappah, Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam, Mr. Sam Thambimutthu, Mr. A. Amirthalingam. Who killed them? Certainly, it is not the Sinhala community. So, when you talk about racial discrimination, I think you should be bold enough to speak with facts and figures on where the discrimination has taken place. I would also like to tell you and also to this august Assembly that one of the finest Foreign Ministers of this country has been a Tamil. The Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar was one of the finest Foreign Ministers this country has produced. His name should be written in gold for what he did for this country. He was the pioneer; he was the innovator and the leader who got the LTTE banned overseas. So, before you talk about racial discrimination, please be very careful in what you say because we are very hurt by the comments you made. We are not racialists. We love all communities. Tamil people are our brothers. We love them very much. We do not like to see them killed; we do not like to see them lose their lands. They need equal rights and protection in this country. This Government - the Government of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - will ensure the protection, the dignity and the self-respect of the Tamil people. Please bear that in mind when you speak in this august Assembly. When I talk about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I would like to humbly state that this Government has normalized our foreign relations with other countries. You know there was a dark period when ambassadors were assaulted by catchers of the Rajapaksas.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I was given five minutes, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) You have already taken four minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Sir, please give me three or four more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, it is difficult to give you any more time. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I want to tell you very frankly, that under this Government we will treat the Foreign Service with respect. We will ensure that Ambassadors are appointed on merit. -[Interruption.] Yes, there has to be some political appointments made, that is the norm. But we are not going to stuff the Foreign Missions with our relatives, the Presidents relatives, or the Prime Ministers relatives. It will be done in a professional manner. We have normalized our relationship with the West, which is crucial. We have normalized our relationship with the European countries and America. They have accepted the procedures we are following as far as human rights are concerned. Therefore, these are huge victories for us. Also, we are going on the forward trajectory of our relationship with China and with India. The cornerstone of our foreign policy has been the non aligned policy and it will continue to do so. I want to thank the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs who has done a yeomen service. When he took over our foreign relations were in jeopardy. They were tantamount to irreparable damage. Then, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and our Deputy Minister, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, were able to get this Ministry going again, by motivating, by leading and by collecting thoughts that are necessary for the development of this country. So, now, finally after the Rajapaksa Regime, we can look forward to a very normal, stable, and harmonious relationship with our foreign partners.

Thank you very much.

[3.11p.m]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministries that are under discussion today. I would like to correct something that the Hon. Minister of Sports had mentioned a little while ago in this House as to what the TNA is supposed to have agreed with regard to the new Constitution. In our deliberations, we have very clearly stated that we stand for one, undivided, indivisible country. That is all that we have agreed to. Now, as to how you describe that, you have to find the right words. We certainly have not agreed to what is classically known as a "Unitary State" meaning a particular system of governance. That word has been used in different ways in different places. The country that is said to be the birth place of notions of Parliamentary supremacy, of undivided sovereignty, the Great Britain, known as a "Unitary Kingdom" although they do not have a Constitution, is able to carve out parts of their territory and give it away. They did so in 1921 and created the Republic of Ireland. They recently held a referendum in Scotland asking the people of Scotland - not all the people of Great Britain - whether they want to go separate. That is possible under what you call a "unitary system" because by passing a simple piece of legislation, you can even carve out and give away a part of your territory. That is not possible in federations, because federation is a social contract where they agree to stay together. It is only possible in confederal arrangements, but not in federations. So, Switzerland has both words. They were a confederation, but they became a federation and therefore, any canton cannot separate and go away. Now, basic information like this must be known and disseminated to the people of the country before people talk about "unitary" and "federal", and seek to mislead the country on these words. I repeat, we are committed to one, undivided - not just undivided but indivisible, even in the future it cannot be divided - country. And for the Constitution to have provisions that will ensure that the country cannot be divided by any Act of Parliament or any Act whatsoever. But the form of government as to how people exercise their sovereignty must be worked out in such a way that within this one country we can share powers of governance in a meaningful way. I am not saying to share sovereignty. It is possible to share sovereignty. That is not something that is wrong. But, share powers of governance, at least at three levels- at the Central Level, at the Provincial or Regional Level and at the Local Government Level. If this is kept in clear perspective, I think, we do not have to fall into this

sloganeering without knowing the meaning of words. I am also saying this while the Discussion on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is underway, because it is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has been tasked with the responsibility of implementing various undertakings that Sri Lanka has made to the world and most important of those is the Resolution at the UN Human Rights Council that Sri Lanka co-sponsored. I must say a word to people who think that changes in various parts of the world can make it possible for us to escape from our obligations. These obligations did not come upon us or was not enforced on us or this is not even a Resolution of the UN Human Rights Council Members who imposed it on us. This is a Resolution that we co-sponsored. This is our Resolution. This is something that we have told the world that we will do to achieve reconciliation in this country because we want to be reconciled. We want all our people to feel that they are Sri Lankans, they are equal Sri Lankans and that no one is a second-class citizen in this country and to be reconciled, to deal with issues that separated us, that alienated sections of this society and become one country. For that to be done, you cannot suddenly wave a magic wand and say, All right, from today, we are all reconciled, we are one country. That is not possible. There are issues that need to be addressed. The primary one is the Constitution, because that is the social contract on which the country functions. But, there are other issues also because there was a cruel war that we all had to suffer and in the aftermath, some post-mortem of that is necessary to deal with wounds, to ensure that justice is done, to ensure that in the future we can avoid events like that and resolve whatever disputes we have amicably and in ways that are not violent. And also there were specific provisions that we agreed to implement. One of the biggest issues was the issue of missing persons and I must congratulate the Government for having taken those first steps and when that Bill was passed, I did say, it was a "first baby step". Unfortunately, that first baby step remains a first baby step; the second step has still not been taken.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Steps are being taken. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is taking quite a long time for this baby to move, but -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The baby is moving.

2031 2032

2016 30

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Is the baby moving? All right. - [Interruption.] At least crawl, but move forward. I am not being overly critical. I recognize that there is movement, but all of that must happen. Because, Hon. Minister, when that is delayed, some people get an idea that you can somehow delay it and absolve yourself from those responsibilities without actually implementing those and that is a wrong notion. No one should run away with the idea that that will ever be possible; that would not be possible. Every word of that Resolution that we ourselves said we will do, must be implemented. We will support the Government in every way possible to ensure that the Government keeps to its promises on that. There is an issue of timing, of sequencing or what can be done now, what should be done later; all of that and the constitutional reform process having now taken centre stage - we just finished the 44th Meeting of the Steering Committee. In this short time, we have had 44 meetings. The Constitutional Assembly has been presented with six Subcommittee Reports and you will see how those six Subcommittees worked. They worked furiously within a very short time span and came up with very useful Reports for discussion in the Assembly and in the country. So, that effort has certainly taken centre stage and so it must, because this is the fundamental reason for all of that that happened in the country. A Constitution, a social contract between its people, which all its people agree with is a sine qua non for the country to proceed forward. So, putting that right and laying emphasis or giving priority to that effort is, in fact, important and we do recognize that. In that process, certain other measures being delayed is understandable and we appreciate that and I must say that it has our support as well. That so long as the root cause of the conflict is addressed in drafting and enacting a new Constitution for ourselves, the other measures can come later. But again, that constructive approach and support by us should not be interpreted or taken advantage of into thinking that having relegated the other measures to be done later, that we can also be cheated in the Constitution-making process. There are people from the Government, Senior Ministers included, who have been asking me in the last couple of days, All that you want is the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment. Is that not so? The Hon. Minister of Sports also had mentioned that a while ago. Everyone in this country must realize that the Tamil people sacrificed over 100,000 lives after the Thirteenth Amendment was enacted; not before. After the Thirteen Amendment was enacted. It is not for the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment that we made all of those sacrifices. That must be clearly understood. During the period 1994 to 2000, during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time, also there

was a large consensus in the country that a fundamental change must be made and Her Excellency the President at that time was able to take it to the country saying, There is a war. I can stop the war if this is done. The country is physically, actually, on the ground, divided. I can reunite the country if this is done. Today, the situation is the opposite. There is no war; on the ground, there is no division. But, that does not mean that the issue has been obliterated, that does not mean that the issue has suddenly vanished. As we have said many times, the LTTE was not "the problem". The LTTE was a manifestation of a problem. It must be understood that removing the LTTE from the scene does not deal with the problem. You have only dealt with one manifestation of the problem and unless the leaders of this country advise the people and lead the people into knowing that truth without saying, Terrorism was the only issue and we have now vanquished it. There is no problem now, that would be wrong. I am not saying this in any threatening way; I am only stating the reality. We are willing to be very reasonable. Any Hon. Member here who has participated in the deliberations of the Steering Committee or in the Subcommittees would appreciate that. We are even willing to make compromises that do not affect fundamental aspirations of our people, but compromises nevertheless, in order to achieve consensus. That is a constructive approach. But again, some of the attitudes are making me wonder whether that is being taken as signs of weakness. That is not so. It must not be taken as signs of weakness; it must be taken as an opportunity to be grasped. Because we do have an opportunity now to change the ground rules, to change the Constitution, to move forward to create a different country for ourselves. We are ready for that and it would be a pity if the majority community in this country is not ready to take that hand from us now. If our extended hand is interpreted as something that is being stretched because the LTTE lost the war, then you are mistaken. Even right through that period, the Tamil people were willing to extend that hand and more so now than before when this Government has come together as a National Government for that very purpose. We realize that this is the moment when we must do all to ensure that that is achieved, that national reconciliation is achieved on the basis of equality, dignity, equal opportunity for all the different peoples who inhabit this country. The majority will have its own place. They are the majority. That cannot be taken away. The majority should not behave as though they are the minority and seek protection and guard themselves. That is a very strange phenomenon that you find in this country. The majority must behave like the majority with magnanimity, not with a minority complex. If the majority behaves magnanimously, like the majority that they are, a

2033 2034

substantive majority, that cannot be changed. Then, we can move forward. You have our fullest support to be reasonable and more than anything else our assurance that we will carry our people with it, that you will have the consent of all our people for that. But that must be done. If that is not seriously pursued, then there are other issues that you have agreed to do and you are delaying doing, must come to the fore because you are not doing this. If you are not doing this, all of those things cannot be even delayed. They must be done. You cannot do everything at the same time. Since you have given primacy to the enactment of a new Constitution, we can await that. Take the baby steps, as the Hon. Minister said. Take those baby steps at least, but first achieve this, because if you secure the future through the process of this new Constitution for all Sri Lankans, then it would actually be easier to deal with your past. But if you do not do that, deal with the past you must; you will have to and that will be a far tougher process to contend with. So my appeal - I am glad that the Hon. Minister is here under whom all these responsibilities come - as we have done up to now, let us discuss, let us agree together how we move forward, but let us do it with a spirit of genuineness and openness and sincerity that we do not harbour in our minds thoughts of cheating through this process, but being genuine. The process of Constitution-making must be done with that kind of clear intention and communicated to the country as such. Thank you so much.

: PRIVILEGE: OBSTACLES FACED BY SOME HON. MEMBERS WHILE COMING TO PARLIAMENT

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) , . , . ( ) ' ' , . . , , , . It is an ancient privilege - it is one of the oldest privileges - which has been in practice, that the Hon. Members can come to Parliament and return from Parliament without being in any way disturbed or in any way prevented from doing so. Today what has happened is, due to a number of agitations along Parliament Road, the Hon. Members have been delayed in coming here. If there had been a Vote, it could have made a big difference. That is why I want this matter to be brought to the notice of the police and to the judiciary through the Hon. Speaker. They should abide by the provisions of the law. Otherwise, we

2037 2038

can say, Go and enforce the law. I do not want in any way to stop any legitimate protest. That also should go on. So, maybe the Hon. Speaker can speak with the police, and the appropriate municipality and other authorities and can give the protestors a block of land, so they can have their protests there and if they want, we can ask the media also to be there and they also can be there constantly. As long as they can protest and we can come in here without any obstruction, I think both needs are met and that is the way it should be. We do not say, Drive anyone out. Let them protest. One or two lands can be given and if two or more parties want, they will have to auction the right by the hour. Nevertheless work it out. But let us have the freedom to come here and go out. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Prime Minister, I will bring this matter to the Hon. Speakers attention. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. I would like to associate myself, on behalf of the Opposition, with what the Hon. Prime Minister has just said. For the second day running, the Hon. Members have been prevented from coming to this House and I agree with all that has been said by him. From the Opposition, we also request the Hon. Speaker to look into this matter. Members of Parliament should not in any way be hindered from attending Parliament. As the Hon. Prime Minister has graciously offered space for protestors - I think that is a good thing - they can have their space and we can have our road. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all I would like to draw your attention to a point raised by my good Friend and professional Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran. He mentioned in his speech that there are things that the Government has agreed to do, but keep on delaying. Sir, of course this allegation was not directed at us. It is directed at the Government. He failed to explain what those agreements are. I think either the TNA or the Government is duty-bound to tell this House and to the people what these agreements are. Therefore, I not only urge them to do so but I earnestly hope that in very near future - if my Friend is going to explain it today itself, I am the happiest - or at the earliest possible time, they would explain what these agreements are. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, may I - ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) I would like to give him two minutes of my time, Mr. Presiding Member. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay. All that I want to say is that you can wake up a sleeping man, but you cannot wake up somebody who is pretending to sleep. ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) That is not strong enough to justify what you mentioned in this House. It is being recorded in Hansard. Whatever it is - , , " . " . . " " .

[4.35p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Mr. Presiding Member, at the outset, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my views on this all-important Votes on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, albeit only 11 minutes have been granted. Given the restriction of time, Sir, I will reserve my views on the administrative aspects of this Ministry, which I believe the Hon. Minister is very well equipped to handle, being the seasoned politician he is. That is not to say that all is rosy at his Ministry either; it is far from it. It has been reported in the popular newspapers of political appointments made, including relatives of politicians, much against the mandate given to this Yahapalanaya Government which came into power on the promise just to do the opposite. Furthermore, Sir, questionable appointments have been highlighted in the newspapers. But, as I mentioned earlier, I believe that these nitty-gritties can be handled by the Hon. Minister. I call these administrative deficiencies nitty-gritties not because they are of no importance, but certainly are of lesser importance, considering what is at stake here. So, what is at stake here? Sir, I believe what is at stake here is the fundamental mistake in shifting our foreign policy from the principle of non-alignment which will eventually lead to destabilization of this nation and more interference in domestic issues by foreign powers. Sir, at a time when the United States has stationed 60 per cent of its troops in Asia, and at a time when the United States is carrying out an aggressive foreign policy initiative called, Pivot to Asia, and at a time when China is trying to secure its future natural resource allocation through their own foreign policy initiative, String of Pearls, the policy of non-alignment for us now seems to be all the more important. Make no mistake, Sir, this is not about foreign countries' charitability towards Sri Lanka. This is about their own self-interest to secure future resources. I know the Hon. Minister will rebut this saying that the current Government's policy is to be friend with all equally. However, their actions have shown this could not be more further from the truth. If the birth of this Government is clouded with the origins from the West, as some political analysts have shown. How else could such a complex array of political ideologies be brought together for a common cause? But, now that the cause has been achieved, it is best that the interest of this country be served and not the interest of the marriage suitors. The action of this Government makes me concerned that this may not be the case. I can understand the reasoning for your pro-West policy given the circumstances, but what I cannot understand is the folly in this Governments policy of antagonizing China,

2055 2056

[ ]

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

2016 30

without fully understanding Chinas own foreign and economic policies. And now, although the Hon. Minister might argue that this is not the case, we know that this Governments policy is to interrupt Chinese-funded projects, particularly the Colombo Port City Project, and it can be seen even by you, Hon. Minister, now with the luxury of hindsight, as a mistake, particularly, when we all knew the Project would eventually have to be restarted. Yes, your Government did try to dress up the situation and claimed, We now have a better deal, but we all know that is not the case and the delay of one-and-a-half years will have terrible consequences on our economy. This will be particularly true for years 2019, 2020 and beyond, when we would have to pay larger foreign debts of over US Dollars 3.5 billion a year. If we had kept to the Project timeline, investments which would have flowed by that time to the Colombo Port City Project would have eased our burden to meet our loan commitments or, at least we would have been in a better position to restructure our loans. Now that the much-talked-about Volkswagen Company is laying off some 30,000 employees in Europe, we can no longer dream of their investments here. You have now been forced shamelessly to do a 180-degree turn in your policy on China. Though I am in no position to lecture such a senior Minister, I would humbly give you a word of caution that this might not be the best time for you to summon the Chinese Ambassador and flex your muscles; it is not as big as you think. After all, what the Chinese Ambassador did was to defend the honour of his country. Furthermore, I also doubt that it is best diplomacy for the Minister to express his candid opinion on the US elections, especially when you picked the looser. So, I humbly request you to consider the current direction of our foreign policy and our deviation from the principles of non-alignment. We should show our support to our friends who have supported us. In this regard, I believe it was wrong on the part of the Government to abstain and not to show our support to the Arab Bloc when the UNESCO Resolution was forwarded on Jerusalem. I believe, Mr. Presiding Member, we were wrong and did not do justice to our friend, Pakistan, who had been with us during our troubled times by boycotting the SAARC Summit. Pakistan deserves better and we should have handled the situation better, Sir. But the biggest concern for me is not all this, as we can still manage some damage control, my biggest concern was and still is this Governments cavalier attitude in committing Sri Lanka to the Geneva Resolution, a Resolution which we co-sponsored happily. It is a Resolution, when we have a closer look, which tells the tale of a System Change that asks for widespread changes including constitutional reforms, reforms of the military, the judiciary, the law enforcement, electoral processes, institutions such as Parliament and Ministries,

devolution of power and transfer of State responsibilities from social matters to civil society, in particular. In diplomatic circles, it is often said that country-specific Resolutions by UN Human Rights Council are nothing more than arm-twisting mechanisms to further the ulterior motives of the author and the first draft of the Resolution usually gives a true intend of the author. Although the Hon. Minister, might have been blind to see that then, now he has given another window with Trumpism taking place in the US. We now have a golden opportunity to rectify our mistakes. So, Hon. Minister, use your back door channels whenever and if the US has its interest here and if we can oblige, I say cater to them, just as much as we might have to cater to other regional superpowers. But keep in mind at all times our national interests. So, use this opportunity wisely to untwine the mess you have created by separating domestic issues from those of international commitments. Let me conclude, Mr. Presiding Member, by saying that the Hon. Minister - if he tries - can do this. He is ably supported by the Deputy Minister, another square peg in a round hole, who would have served this country better in the Ministry of Finance and the Secretary to the Ministry who is a fine officer and whose wisdom, if properly solicited, can direct us in these winds of change. Also let us remember, our motherland is at the crossroads in her destiny, and the two Southerners who are leading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do well keeping in mind how they will go down in history and be remembered as the pair that put Sri Lanka firmly on the world map or as the "new Don Juan Dharmapalas" of our generation. I pray for the former. Thank you.

, , . . , , . , . , , , . . . , , . . Sir, I would like to bring the attention of the Hon. Member to the fact that for the first time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have in fact institutionalized a division for the Sri Lankans overseas. We are doing quite a lot of work in terms of bringing the diaspora - be it Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher- together as a Sri Lankan diaspora. Perhaps, the Hon. Minister is planning even some sort of festival in the coming years. So, in terms of the issue of Tamil Nadu, exchange of visits are taking place. We need to find a solution to the fisheries issue, and I must say that a lot of progress has been made and the two Ministers are already in discussion. , Batticaloa . . . , racial discriminations . . , . . , 2015 , - Heads of Missions - 66 18 . 30. 30 , . . , . . 2016 511 . , 511 502 Consular Affairs Division .

Then, the Hon. Sumanthiran in reply to the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the TNA has thus far agreed on one undivided, indivisible country. He also said it is a stronger structure than even the unitary nature and there has been much discussion on it. In fact, my learned Friend and classmate, who is known to me for many years, also said that he is willing to make compromises and be flexible. He said that the TNA is for a constructive approach. I applaud that. That is what we need from the leaders of the Tamil people. So, let us do that. We can convince everyone here, and carry our people. He said he can carry his people who have extended their hands. Yes, we would like to do that in good faith and of their own free will. So, that is our position. So, it is through consultation, it is through discussion that we are going to be able to converge upon a solution that is going to be accepted by the majority and the minority alike. , . . .
