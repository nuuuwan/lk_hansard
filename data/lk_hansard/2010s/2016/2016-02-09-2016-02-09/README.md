(, ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim - Deputy Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine) Hon. Speaker, I would like to answer that Question.

With regard to the first question he asked, I would like to mention that in 2012/ 2013 there was no committee appointed to probe into the kidney racket.

The answer to the second question is, the Five-Member Committee had given its report to the Hon. Minister on the 05th of February, 2016. Since the investigation is still going on, we are unable to submit the report to Parliament.

In reply to the third question, I would like to say that to correct the shortcomings in the kidney transplant procedure, as a short-term measure, we are going to strengthen the methodology of the Ethical Committee. One of the long-term measures is, we are going to review the Transplantation of Human Tissues Act, No. 48 of 1987, because there are a lot of lapses in the present procedure and we have to bring in new regulations. The other is, we have to handle this issue diplomatically because it is between India and Sri Lanka; both countries have to decide on healthcare provisions and as to how we are going to regulate it.

For a kidney patient they bring down a donor too. We do not know whether the donor is a genuine donor or a money-paid donor. Presently there are committees at

625 626

private hospitals in the country. When the chairman of that committee approves the affidavit they have given, the private hospital performs the kidney transplant. So, to regulate this, very soon we are going to bring in new regulations to the law and bring this under control.

Hon. Anura Dissanayake, are you satisfied with that reply?

The Constitutional Council, if it had met yesterday, I guess, would have kept whatever the decisions as confidential. How can a Member of the Constitutional Council address the media and say, We met; we discussed and we agreed that His Excellency the President should be addressed by the Constitutional Council to name only a single person to be the Attorney-General of this country.?

Hon. Speaker, I would like to get a Ruling on that because it is not a positive procedure to adopt. You, as the Speaker and as the Chairman of the Constitutional Council could make a statement at any moment to the House, which is provided in the Nineteenth Amendment.

I would like to bring Article 41G of the Constitution to your notice, which states, I quote:

Hon. Speaker, I would like to quote an article which appeared in the Sunday Island of 7th February, 2016, titled, The Constitutional Council Fiasco by Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama - an eminent legal expert who had served as an Attorney-General of the country and as a Secretary to the Ministry of Justice. In his long article he submits that if the relevant Gazette Notification has not been issued and if it has not been placed before Parliament, the Constitutional Council ceases to function - it becomes defunct.

I may quote only the last section of the article as a reference:

The failure of the Constitutional Council to perform its initial function, namely, to determine the procedures for the performance of its duties, has eroded its legitimacy. Any inconsistency in the performance of its duties will raise doubts about its integrity. While any recommendation or approval of the Council cannot be questioned in court even on the ground of procedural irregularity, the Constitution now enables an appointment made by the President, based on such recommendation or approval, to be challenged by way of a fundamental rights application on the ground, for example, of discriminatory treatment in the appointment process. Therefore, it is imperative that the rules relating to the performance of its duties and functions are formulated and published in the Gazette for public scrutiny, and placed before Parliament. Transparency and accountability demand that this be forthwith done.

Now, this is a big lacuna and we would like to get a Ruling or a Statement from you today in the House. If this has not been done, first it has to be done before any more appointments are made. I guess all will agree, any legal luminary will agree, that that should be the position. We, in Parliament cannot be led into situations which have arisen because of a lacuna.

Hon. Speaker, in addition to that, I may once again request you to keep the House informed whether the Constitutional Council has considered the appointment of the Attorney-General. Yesterday, according to an Hon. Member who made a statement to the media, this matter was considered. Even the Bar Association has made a request that the most senior member of the Attorney-Generals Department who is acting and whose acting appointment the Constitutional Council has extended twice or thrice be appointed. Is he going to be appointed or whether there is going to be any other decision made to the contrary? Secondly, whether a decision is going to be taken in any manner before this Gazette Notification is made public and placed before Parliament? These are the two requirements that are very much embedded in the Nineteenth Amendment.

No, no, that is under the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. But, in reference to Parliament, there is no "Leader of the Opposition" in the Constitution. You read the Constitution. If you read the Constitution you can see that there is no "Leader of the Opposition". It is a convention that Parliament has adopted where the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition. That is a different position. Here, the position is that we are canvassing that we be recognized as a group in the Opposition which the Hon. Speaker could do. Sir, if you say, "I will give you more time", that is because we are not getting more time as a group; if you say, You should be seated together," then you have recognized that we are a group. That is why we are seated together. I can give you such examples from the last six months. But, the final issue is whether you are going to recognize us as a group in the Opposition or not. Otherwise, it is very difficult for us to co-operate in the day-to-day Business of Parliament. The Hon. Prime Minister accepts that there is an issue which has to be solved, but it has not been solved for the last six months.

So, Hon. Speaker, we have canvassed and we would like to get a decision from you.

[2.55 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, I consider this a historic and a momentous occasion. -[Interruption.]The female population of this country has continuously been agitating for further representation. We have been proud to have the first female Prime Minister and a female Executive President in the world. But unfortunately, we have not been able to increase female representation in this country. Globally, today, there is adequate female representation. There have been agitations in various parts of the country and His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister have been prudent to introduce this Bill at the Local Government level, whereby there would be 25 per cent of female representation.

It is unfortunate today, that certain Members have thought fit to disturb this historic occasion, especially when we are giving women of this country an equal opportunity. A few days ago, on the Independence Day, we fought the barrier of language - we gave the opportunity to the Tamil community of this country to sing the National Anthem in Tamil. Today, we have stopped gender-based discrimination in this country. If you look at the local bodies, today, the women representation is less than 5 per cent. The only way we could address this issue is by giving the opportunity to women to participate in the democratic process of this

653 654

country. However, due to the PR system, women have been hesitant to enter the political mainstream. But, this Bill will encourage women to come into politics like the manner in which the National List is created. Thereby, women will get an opportunity of coming into the political mainstream of this country and this will create a major difference. The only way in which we can uplift women in this country is to encourage them to get into politics. It is statistically proved that local bodies in India where women have entered have shown great success and great development. Therefore, the only manner in which we can empower women in this country is to get them into mainstream politics. -[Interruption.]

All of you may scream, but I am sure that all of you will agree that this Bill is needed for the country and this is going to create a major change, whereby all women of this country will get an opportunity to enter the democratic process.

All our leaders wanted to do this. Why are you disrupting this today when women of this country are given an opportunity of entering the mainstream politics? -[Interruption.] You all can scream and laugh, but I request all of you to vote for this Bill. I thank His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister for bringing in this Bill. We have produced the first female Prime Minister, but we have not been able to attract women into the system as our global friends like India and Bangladesh. Therefore, we will attract women into the politics of this country through this Bill and all of you will support to pass this Bill. -[Interruption.] You all will scream but you will support this Bill. None of the Members in this House will oppose this, especially my good Friend, the Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi has been agitating for women representation. Though she is there, her heart is with us. She is a woman who has championed for womens rights. All women in this country and all the women Parliamentarians are supportive of this Bill at this momentous occasion. Therefore, even though you all disrupt this, you all will support this Bill and it will be a very progressive move. Thank you, Sir. -[Interruption.]
