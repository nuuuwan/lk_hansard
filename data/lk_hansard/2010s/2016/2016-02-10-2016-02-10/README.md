are only talking of how they can get time to make their views known and certain other procedural matters. That is what I gathered from them. So, I would like to say that in the House of Commons, while there is time for "Private Members", there is also what is called the "Backbench Business Committee" for those who are not of ministerial status. That is a start. Then, there is the question of how they can make statements. That is another matter that we can discuss. I think all these are open for discussion. Now that they are not asking for recognition as a separate political party, the issue is how to exercise their rights. I am sure we can sit down and sort this out. So, give us a little bit of time. We will sit down and do that. Let the House carry on. That is all I am asking. I am sure we can find a way out of this. I am quite confident that we can do this. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I must also say that in the United Kingdom in 1980, the Labour Party had two divisions, but only one section was recognized in the House of Commons.

DUMPING OF COLOMBO SOLID WASTE AT ARUWAKKALU, PUTTALAM [5.01p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move, "Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) of Colombo is designed at present to be transported to Aruwakkalu dumping ground in Puttalam by rail. The dumping ground at Aruwakkalu is above the sea level and very close to Puttalam Lagoon. During the rainy season the lagoon will be polluted. The first problem of such dumping is causing leachates. The leachates will reach Puttalam lagoon through Lunu Oya and the lagoon will be polluted.

789 790

There are four main salt industries, over 500 acres of prawn farms and 9,000 families of fishermen living around Puttalam lagoon. All these depend on the Puttalam lagoon for survival. The pollution of the Puttalam lagoon will mean the death of these industries and loss of livelihood. Therefore, it is moved to stop the proposed transport of Municipal Solid Waste from Colombo to the Aruwakkalu dumping ground."

Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity.

I represent the beautiful Electorate of Puttalam. The first Member of Parliament was elected from this Electorate. It was the Hon. H. S. Ismail, a great son of the soil, who was also uncontested for the post of Speaker in 1956. The second Member from the Puttalam Electorate was the much respected Hon. M. H. M. Naina Marikar, a former Minister of Finance and Planning. The Electorate of Puttalam had the privilege of being represented by such great gentlemen. Today, I am honoured to represent such a great Electorate which had the misfortune of not being represented in Parliament for more than 26 years. That misfortune was overcome during the last General Election.

Sir, the Motion that I presented to the House today is about the proposed transport of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) of Colombo to Puttalam. Puttalam has been getting polluted from the 1960s. Firstly it was by a cement factory which, until recently, was throwing out dust polluting the environment and creating respiratory ailments to the people who were living along the path of dust. When I was the Minister of Health and Environment in the North Western Provincial Council, I discussed this issue with Holcim and somehow managed to control the pollution. But, the use of coal in that factory is yet to create more ailments through the spread of fly ash.

Then, there is the coal-fired power plant at Norachcholai. Sir, I was one of the persons sent to China to inspect a coal power plant there. Although, we saw coal dust on the roofs of the houses and on the ground for miles, our tour guide assured us that the plant designed for Sri Lanka is an advanced model which will not create such problems. But, the experience the country had with the Norachcholai plant needs no elaboration. The cultivated vegetables are recipients of the coal dust and washed clothes hung out to dry also get covered with coal dust, particularly during the South-West monsoon. The groundwater in the vicinity of the plant is contaminated and not fit to drink. Respiratory ailments in the area are on the increase. And now, Sir, the proposal to transport the Municipal Solid Waste of Colombo to Puttalam will introduce another great pollution problem to the Electorate I represent.

The proponents of the project imagine that there are big dug out pits to dump garbage as sanitary landfill.

During the time I was the Minister of Health and Environment in the North Western Provincial Council, I requested the cement manufacturer, Holcim, to fill the excavated area with top soil and to plant trees. Holcim accepted my request and filled most of the pits and planted margosa trees. Today, the trees are quite big, thus there may not be enough deep pits to dump garbage at the rate of 1,200 metric tons each day for the next ten years.

The first problem of such dumping will cause leachates. The landfill site is only 100 to 150 metres from Lunu Oya, which is a branch of Kala Oya, which is the Southern boundary of the Wilpattu National Park. Puttalam area receives the maximum rainfall during the months of October, November and December. In 1957, the Parana Elavankulam village was flooded and the Elavankulam School was completely under water. This means, the flood waters went more than 18 feet or six metres above ground level.

According to the EIA prepared by E.M.L Consultants, the garbage dump site is four metres above the Mean Sea Level. Sir, the floods in 1957 was six metres above the ground level. That is more than two metres above the dump site.

In such a situation, Sir, the leachate will reach the Puttalam Lagoon through Lunu Oya. Garbage, among other wastes, contains electronic waste such as printers, circuits of computers, torch batteries, fluorescent tubes, CFL bulbs and a host of other electronic items. Heavy metals such as chromium and other harmful chemicals including pesticides, fungicides, weedicides et cetera will definitely be washed away to the Puttalam Lagoon. As much as there is ocean currents, Sir, there are water movements in the lagoon as well. Thus, these harmful heavy metals and poisonous chemicals will definitely be carried to the length and breadth of the lagoon continuously for the next ten years.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Puttalam Lagoon provides livelihood for more than 500 fisher families. There are four salterns producing 40 per cent of the country's requirement of salt and over 500 acres of prawn farms depending on this lagoon. All these industries depend on the Puttalam Lagoon for survival. Pollution of the Puttalam Lagoon will mean the death of the said industries and loss of livelihood for more than 9,000 families and loss of foreign exchange earned from the prawn farms.

Further, the Technical Evaluation Committee has stated that the said EIA has been written in an ambiguous manner. Many statements need clarifications. Just stating, Such matters will be considered during the detailed study, or More details will be given in the design stage does not amount to a complete EIA.

Transporting garbage from Colombo to Puttalam was a political decision. It has no scientific or economic value. The EIA has not justified the economic gain. This

791 792

has been designed to hurt another group of people, namely the marginalized people of Puttalam who are political orphans, burdened with the weight of more than 75,000 IDPs from the North and the East for more than 25 years.

Furthermore, the EIA speaks of an electric fence to prevent elephants from Wilpattu entering the garbage dump site. We have seen in the print and electronic media how elephants are attracted to garbage dumps in Polonnaruwa and other areas. We see in the news everyday, elephants attacking one village after another and many men and women being killed.

The EIA admits that the landfill or garbage dump area is within the buffer zone of Wilpattu National Park. This shows that the said site is very close to the Park. The elephants attracted to the garbage dump will reach through the villages of Gangewadiya, Parana Elavankulam, Ralmadu and Mangalapura. Even the army camp and the staff in the cement factory quarters could come under elephant attack. Does the landfill proponents propose to erect an electric fence along the southern bank of Kala Oya covering approximately 25 kilometres?

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the cost factor must also be considered. Imagine the cost of collection of garbage and transport to a loading site; cost of a compacting plant; cost of compacting and packing material; cost of cranes at loading and unloading sites; cost of waste water treatment plants; cost of washing emptied containers. The cost of rail transport to Aruwakkalu at Rs. 925 per 45 kilogram wagon per kilometre into 27 wagons into 170 kilometre amounts to Rs.191,058,750 per day alone. Then there is the cost of infrastructure; compensation for damages to property and persons including death caused by elephants and the cost of treatment for people affected by environmental pollution as well. Sir, pollution of the Puttalam Lagoon and deprival of the livelihood to thousands of families is also added to the cost factor.

Our Prime Minister has directed to conserve the prehistoric site at Kuragala where human settlements had existed for more than 8,000 years - even before the arrival of Prince Vijaya.

To learn more about such settlements, I take this opportunity to request His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister to initiate exploration of the site of landing of Vijaya, the Kingdom of Kuveni and fossils belonging to the Miocene era of 25 million years ago. These fossils are in the area earmarked to dump garbage from Colombo - Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam Electorate. The fossils are found in the area known as Wedi Pitiya. Dr. Paranavitana has documented around 40 species of prehistoric invertebrates and vertebrates and marine vertebrates such as dolphin and whales there. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I ask whether it is

worth to destroy such treasured evidence of the Miocene era by dumping garbage on it.

I suggest that garbage be recycled and converted to compost or used as fuel to generate thermal electricity in the vicinity of the present garbage dump around Colombo, within the metro Colombo area and spare the Puttalam Electorate and the inhabitants there.

I also wish to point out that the residents of Meetotamulla have already filed action in the Supreme Court against dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla. As it appeared in the Daily News of 30th October, 2015, the residents have stated, I quote:

..there are persons and companies who are interested in purchasing garbage (for money) and who will recycle the said garbage at their own expense in an environmentally friendly manner.

I suggest that garbage be handed over to people like that and save Puttalam.

In addition to that, Sir, I would also like to say that lately we have started tourism in Puttalam and so many thousands of people are coming to Puttalam because of the environmental attractions. I am very happy to say that the Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment is here. I also wish to say that we started politics under your father. The Hon. Minister concerned is also here. So please be good enough to save us. If you do this, we are going to suffer for the next ten years. As I have already mentioned in my speech, the livelihood of 10,000 people depends on the lagoon. Therefore, I request you to seriously consider this. As I have already mentioned, we have been suffering right from the start of the cement factory and then presently by the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. Therefore, please be good enough to consider these facts and see that this is stopped.

Thank you very much. [. . 5.14]
