( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Mr. Speaker- ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, I earnestly appeal, through you, to both sides of the House, that an individual Member's dignity and the dignity of the entire House, depend on these matters being resolved within this Chamber, and by you as the custodian of our rights.

We need not take this outside this Chamber. You have all the powers. And then, being possessed of what transpired in the Party Leaders Meeting, I am of the earnest view that both sides must cooperate, because whatever that you proposed to do now is the most lenient punishment that we can - some of us may not agree with that - [Interruption.] Yes. Under the Standing Orders this is perhaps the most lenient punishment; it could be much more serious than this. But, since you have proposed this, I think, in preserving the dignity of this House, both sides must cooperate to put an end to this issue. Of course, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena mentioned certain issues and I think, you can have a discussion on those issues and resolve them also. So, this need not extend beyond these two Hon. Members and we will bring this to a closure.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much. .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Sir, may I be heard? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, a very unfortunate incident has taken place in this House where a Member of Parliament has been assaulted by his Parliamentary Colleagues. That happened in the

1583 1584

Well of the House and you have instructed that there would be an investigation in regard to this matter. You have appointed a Committee comprising of the Hon. Deputy Speaker and the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

They have come up with a Report. You placed the Report before the leaders of the political parties at the Parliamentary Business Committee Meeting this morning and in pursuance of that Report being placed before the leaders of the political parties, you have taken a decision that now you will bring this matter to a closure with certain action being taken by you as required.

And, I do not think we should, in any way, further damage the dignity of this House by allowing this matter to be prolonged and if there has been a finding that a Member of Parliament has been assaulted in the Well of this House by some of the Members of Parliament, that matter needs to be dealt with. We just cannot forget that matter. It needs to be dealt with in some way and you, Mr. Speaker, have taken a decision in regard to the matter. There is a Resolution moved by the Hon. Leader of the House. I think in the interest of the dignity and decorum of this House and to ensure that we do not have a repetition of such behaviour in the future, we do not prolong this matter any further and that we accept the Resolution moved by the Hon. Leader of the House and leave this matter to rest.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane)

We were able to earn more before. But according to EDB statistics in 2014 our export revenue from floriculture products had come down to US Dollars .04 million, which was not even 1 per cent of our exports. But before that, we were able to earn US Dollars 14 million. So, what are our vision and achievements? Now I am trying to rectify that situation. I am going to develop botanical gardens and promote training with out-grower systems. This is what we can do. Thereby we can create employment opportunities and earn more foreign

exchange. Our women should not go to Middle-Eastern countries as slaves and beggars because we can generate income in our country itself. There is enough potential here. That is my argument. I am not criticizing anyone. I am talking on facts. So, I have said all these based on facts. This is the situation.

Now we are increasing our revenue. We are expecting to increase our tax revenue which was on a downward trend. Our tax revenue was almost 14 per cent in in 2006. In 2014 it had gone down to 10.7 per cent but we have been able to increase it to 12.9 per cent in this year. So, let us talk.

- borrowings- . , . , . . . , . More than 80 per cent of the borrowings go to servicing of existing debt.

80 . . , . . . . .

Now look at the Government outstanding debt. Contingent liabilities stand at Rs.1,042 billion by end of 2015. The debt/GDP ratio has increased to 85.5 per cent of the GDP. So, this is the situation that we have to face. These are contracts that have been signed for which we will have to pay.

What is our vision in terms of this Budget-2016? It is based on Government policy. What is our policy? What is our mission? What is our mission to achieve our vision? We are going forward, I am telling you. We have a five-year plan. Within these five years, we will be able to achieve our vision while peace and prosperity prevailing in the whole of Sri Lanka.

I have visited Jaffna five times now. Ask your Colleagues - Members of Parliament. My Ministry will coordinate with the Northern Province and implement the development project plan. We will see that you will get equal rights as the people in the South. Then the people who go to North from the South will be wanting to spend not one night but three - four nights there. We will also take steps to make use of marine resources in the Northern Province and provide zoological parks and botanical parks. All those will be provided to you. That is our policy. We will do that, so that the people in your area will be able to earn more income. The people in the area must also be benefited by coexistence, not only the Government Departments. Handicraft products

manufactured in the area will be promoted and more employment opportunities could be generated through concepts like Jana Kala Kendraya - marketing villages. We have discussed all those. So, we are solving the problems there. We have declared and re-gazetted wildlife conservation areas. So, the remaining land will be given to the due people. That is our duty. We will do that also.

Our policy is based on knowledge-based economy, innovative economy, green economy and sustainable economy. I am the Minister for Sustainable Development and Wildlife. What are we going to do under sustainable economy? We will create medium and long-term strategies. With these concepts we will generate 1 million employment opportunities through the private sector and public sector. Low-income earners will be encouraged to engage in self-employment and also they will be encouraged to make use of their talents in self-employment at the village level. Thereby they will be able to reach the level of middle income earners. We are not targeting the high-class society. They know how to survive. We have to think of the poor man. That is why we are trying to increase the level of income of the rural people at the village level. We will do it. We have a vision in the Budget - 2016. His Excellency the President, Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe work together towards that vision. No one can break this. I will tell you that we will continue for five years and we will show the results. We have a policy with regard to ensuring land ownership; we will give lands to everyone. We are going to give one million title deeds.

, . We are going to give title deeds to Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims, as they all are same.

Then they can go for a loan and can use that money for their industries. Then, there are strategies on enhancing income levels and the development of rural economies. We are spending on those.

I can still remember the former Minister of Transport said in Parliament - I have the Gazette Notification - that a sum of Rs. 1 million was given for concreting the roads. I have his statement.

, " 10 4 , " . We do not allow that. . . 15 . . .

education 6 , 4 . Today we are spending 41.1 per cent from the Budget for education, health et cetera which comes under human

1667 1668

capital development. Then, on facilitation of micro, small and medium enterprises, we are spending 15.7 per cent; and on regional development at provincial and local level, we are spending 17.2 per cent. Likewise, we are spending money to develop the rural economy.
