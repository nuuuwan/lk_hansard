I want to bring in a few points to the attention of the House that I think we need to be discussing, so that we could look at adopting these in the future. We are talking about Sri Lankans employed abroad. But, we also need to remember that we have no moral right to talk about Sri Lankans employed abroad particularly in domestic situations, until we talk about Sri Lankans employed in domestic situations in our own country. We cannot take the high moral ground until we make sure as a Parliament that they also have rights.

There are international conventions like the ILO Convention on Domestic Workers, which is known as the C189 that must be signed by Sri Lanka. Today, I am asking Parliament to consider signing and ratification of the C189 that would protect domestic workers in our own country; domestic workers who work in our own homes. I think we should first look at protecting them. If we can protect them, then we have every right to speak about other governments in other countries protecting our workers.

The C189 was adopted by the ILO in June, 2011 and there were two points of intervention. One was the vulnerability and the dependency faced by individual

1381 1382

domestic workers and the fact that this was not regarded as a profession - it was under professionalized. So, the key elements that are needed in this is the payment of wages. Every household decides what they could afford rather than what the domestic worker actually demands - the payment of wages. There is no social security for those who work; maternity benefits are not there; hours of work are not stipulated; their living conditions are not like that of the other workers; the personal security is sometimes threatened and there are no dispute resolution methods. If a domestic worker gets into a dispute with the lady or may be the man in the house, the domestic worker will basically be sent home. So, this is the real situation. Therefore, we need to look at protecting these workers if we are going to expect other countries to protect our workers in these domestic situations.

Now, the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey conducted in 2007 stated that there were about 90,000 domestic workers in the country of which about 60,000 were female domestic workers. There is a current study underway in 2016 and therefore we might get more information and we might get more information on child domestic workers too. So, we must address these issues.

There is one other point I would like to make and that is about the problems that our citizens employed overseas face. These relate to two Conventions; they are the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the associated Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. This is on the compulsory settlement of disputes. If we sign the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Article 36 of the Treaty - I am suggesting that this is widely debated in Parliament by all sides of the House because there are other consequences that could arise as well - would allow the Sri Lankans arrested abroad to have a full consular access to the Sri Lankan Embassy or High Commission, if they request. This is a right that they will get, if they request it. So, they will be mandatorily given a right, if they are arrested abroad. The Optional Protocol allows disputes regarding the application of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to be adjudicated by the International Court of Justice.

Those are the issues that we need to understand; those are the issues that we need to discuss, if we really want to protect our citizens overseas.

According to the Protocol, "disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice." Therefore, I think, this needs to be widely debated as I said. But, if we want to really protect our citizens overseas like some other countries do, then we have to become part of these processes.

Although Sri Lanka is a signatory to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Optional

Protocol to it on Dispute Settlements, that only protects Sri Lankan diplomats who are working abroad. It does not protect a Sri Lankan citizen abroad. Ordinary Sri Lankan citizens are not covered by that Convention and therefore are at risk of receiving inadequate legal representation if arrested. I urge the Parliamentarians, who are here today, to consider these vital international conventions, which will eventually represent the difference between life and death of some citizens.

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to speak a few words in English since the Minister of Foreign Employment, the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale is also present in the House. I urge her very kindly to take into

consideration all the important points made by the Hon. Members today during the course of the Debate on this Adjournment Motion.

The number of women migrant workers in the plantation areas, especially in the Nuwara Eliya District, has increased. So, we need some arrangements made by the Bureau to attend to their issues. I would like to table* a document which lists out the shortcomings we are facing at the moment in the district, so that it will be useful for the Ministry to take necessary action.

Thank you very much. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to tell the Hon. Thilakarajah that we do not maintain offices of the Bureau district-wise. We have one office for a province and also three officers from the Ministry at every Divisional Secretariat to look into the interests of the migrant workers. So, I am sorry to say that we are not going to maintain any office of the Bureau district-wise. For you, the Central Province office is located in Kandy. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Thank you very much, Madam, for the reply. But, I do not know how far it will be effective language-wise because there are a lot of Tamil-speaking people who are migrating from the Nuwara Eliya District. So, I just want to know whether there is any Tamil-speaking officer appointed at the Divisional Secretariat. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Hon. Member, that, of course, I cannot tell you right now. But I will direct my Secretary to see to it and ensure that there are Tamil-speaking officers as well. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

, - Some time back, I attended the ILO Conference held in Geneva, Switzerland. At that Conference when the topic on migrant labour was taken for discussion, I tabled a document stating our grievances. I told them as to how our women are ill-treated and how they are sexually

harassed in the Middle-East countries. The Labour Minister of Lebanon who was present there was very angry over my statement. He stood up and said very angrily, Ah, you are from the housemaids' country. That is how he started. In a very sarcastic manner, he said that I am from the housemaids' country. I just kept quite and allowed him to go ahead with his remarks. Then he said, Our men need not go after the dirty Sri Lankan women. This is how he stated in that open forum. Then, I said, It is not your young men, but the culprits are your old men who are in the houses. They are the ones who abuse our women in your houses. You have no backbone to stop their misconduct; you have no backbone to question them. Your old men are the culprits. Then, he was very much ashamed. After the Conference, we met at the tea break. He had a cup of tea in his hand. I wanted to tell him something else also. I went closer to him and said, Look here! You said that I am from the housemaids' country. I am not from the housemaids' country. I am from the country which produces the best tea in the world which is known as Ceylon Tea and that is what you are having right now. He was very much ashamed over my remarks.

This is how they treat us. They think that Sri Lankans women are going there to make money, but it is not the fact. It is a win-win matter. Our service is rendered to them and they pay us. But they do not accept that fact. They think that because of our poverty we go and work there as slaves. This should be stopped. This nonsense has to be stopped; this should come to an end. I am sure the lady Minister who is in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Employment will take appropriate measures to stop this to save our women from these culprits.

Thank you. [.. 4.14] () ( ( )() ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs) Thusitha Wijemanna) , . . , , . . , . , .

[4.24 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to take part in this Debate.

I represent the Puttalam Electorate where, I think, almost every family has one member working either in the Middle East or in Italy. Over the last so many years, there have been many problems faced by the migrant workers working in those countries. I must thank the Hon. Minister, because after taking charge of this Ministry, most of the problems faced by these workers have been amicably settled very quickly by the Hon. Minister herself, the Hon. Deputy Minister and the staff.

The Hon. Minister is doing a very good job. I can give two examples for that, which happened in my electorate about six months back. One was a death in Saudi Arabia and the officials of the Ministry, probably on the advice of the Hon. Minister, did their utmost in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get down the body. They were able to get it down within ten days, which we could not do earlier. Also recently, a person was injured very badly in Jeddah and he is still warded at a hospital. I requested for a relative of his to be sent from here to see him and Madam, when he had gone to your officials, they had helped him. The person who went there had asked the officials, " ?" The exact words they have used were; Your relative is earning foreign currency, which is good for the country and that is why we are helping. I must thank them because their attitude has completely changed under the new Minister.

I think now one of the most important foreign exchange earners is foreign employment. The Hon. Minister has been doing a lot. However, still there are problems and I would like to point out a few. This is the information I receive from my electorate. First and foremost, there are so many job agents who are not registered, creating a lot of problems in this industry. The Hon. Minister should take note of this fact and somehow get those people registered. Unregistered job agents should not be allowed to send people abroad for jobs. But, they are doing it even now. I know that. So, somehow, they must be brought to book.

Also, the registration fee must be increased to such a level that only people who can afford and those who have the financial capability will then go into this business as there are so many problems. Now, what is happening is, those job agents come to these areas, collect people, somehow send them out of the country for jobs and wash their hands off. After one or two months, if there is a problem and if they go to the agents, it would be of no use. This is what is happening. But, of course, the registered job agents somehow manage to help them. Fifty per cent of the job agents who are not registered wash their hands off and the migrant workers and their families face many problems.

Hon. Minister, you said that there are three to four offices in each and every AGA Division. Actually, it is only after you mentioned that fact that I came to know

about it. As I have come to know about this, hereafter, I will contact them. Those officers must go to the people who want to work as migrant workers. So, these officers should know about the people who are leaving the country from that particular AGA division. That is what I am saying.

The other biggest problem that we are facing today is lack of job opportunities. That is why they go abroad. The reasons why they go abroad include poverty, low salary payment, lack of job opportunities, et cetera. If a member of a family leaves the country and works abroad for years - maybe, the wife is working abroad, the husband is here or otherwise - what will happen on their return? Either the husband or the wife who is staying in this country may misuse money. So, when they come back even after working abroad for five - six years, they will become empty-handed. This is one of the problems that we are facing today. Not only that, if the wife is working abroad, her husband who is here will be in tow with another woman or incidents like that may happen. Even there are instances where fathers who are supposed to look after the children have abused their children. This is also a major problem that we are facing today. So, we will have to put a stop to these problems. I feel that these persons who go abroad must be looked after properly by the respective officials.

As I mentioned, the person who is working abroad may waste his hard-earned money. So, Madam, I would like to request that you introduce a system for persons going abroad for employment to open a NRFC account - which they do not do today - and deposit at least 50 per cent of the money earned. That must be followed by these officers. If these officers in the AGA divisions can have a record of these people who are going abroad monthly, then, it is easy for them to go on checking. It must be a rule or law to say at least 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the money they earn is deposited so that when they come back, they will have some money to improve their future. This must be done. If this could be done, I think, the purpose of their going abroad will be fulfilled.

Further, I would like to say that the Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah, Member of Parliament, and myself attended the Asian Parliamentary Assembly in Pakistan where we met a lot of MPs from the Middle East countries. When they knew that we are from Sri Lanka, a few of them met us and said, Almost every job agent from your county is cheating us. These were the very words they used. They were asking, Why do you not send us some good agents? We do just not take them for free and it is you who earn foreign exchange. Therefore, we will have to get proper job agents who could look after them. I know that it is a difficult task, but, as they said, we are earning foreign exchange by sending these workers abroad.

Now, the Hon. Minister, as you know, the other major problem is, before these people go abroad these job

1465 1466

agents will somehow falsify their documents and send them. Once they go there, what will happen? The promised job is not given and the promised salary is not received. So, because of these reasons, the person who goes there will somehow get out of that place and work somewhere else. After that he will have to stay with some persons who are known to him and who are working there. Also, he is not in a position to send here whatever he earns. Finally, what happens is, he will get caught to the police and will be deported after six or seven months time. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

So, I think we have to look into such cases. The embassy will have to play a role to ensure that such things do not happen in future. If such things happen, we have to make arrangements either to get them deported or to re-employ them somewhere else. So, these are the problems that we are facing today.

Sir, the other matter is this. Most of the people who are sent from this country, about 75 per cent to 80 per cent, go abroad either as drivers or cleaners or room boys. Even the educated youth from poor families go for such jobs. I know that you travel to countries asking for more employment opportunities. Hon. Minister, you must make it a point to get employment opportunities for educated people, like engineers also. If we can find more and more employment opportunities for educated people, then those who are qualified can get suitable jobs. By doing so, we will get more money coming into this country.

Finally I must say again that the Hon. Minister is doing a wonderful job. We all know, Sir, foreign employment is one of the main foreign exchange earning sources. Therefore, we must take steps to solve these problems. I am sure the Hon. Minister is able to do that. Then, I think, all those who are working abroad will be able to lead a good life and we also will be benefited as a country.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. , . 5 .
