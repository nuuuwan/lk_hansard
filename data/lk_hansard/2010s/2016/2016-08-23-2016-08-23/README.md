.. . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, on the issue of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the J.R. Jayewardene Centre, I have looked at the draft Bills. We will not be able to establish the Parliamentary Budget Office before this Budget and this Committee -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We have no room because of the other issues.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right. This Committee cannot properly function without a Parliamentary Budget Office, which will feed the necessary information. So, I am just informing the House that we will not be able to fulfill some of the responsibilities given to us by the Resolution at this years Budget in November.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) But, Hon. Member, there is one thing that we can do. We can sit down with the Chairman of the COPE and others and decide on the draft Legislation.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We will have it gazetted and get it passed during the Budget, so that in the year 2017, you will be in a position to monitor the Budget and then, we also want to have discussions with the IMF on getting additional technical support and staff for you all.

We are not withdrawing from that situation. But that does not mean, when such a situation takes place, that you can completely do away with the normal procedure of the Parliamentary activities. That is what has happened in this whole issue. I, as one of the Members of Parliament who was in the Well of the House, accept that that has created a serious concern. But, at the same time, that does not mean that you should do away with all the procedures and traditions of Parliament, which has taken place. Hon. Speaker, you are aware of it and certainly, you were aware that the Hansard Department was also finding it difficult to report.

To my knowledge, out of the 31 amendments, there were only two that were moved. Therefore, this matter needs reconsideration to see as to how we could make these errors right and get it passed. As the Hon. Speaker said, the Government has 171 Members. Therefore, obviously it will go through. But in fairness to the Parliamentary procedures and traditions, I think it is best that you give an opportunity after consultation with the Minister concerned, and the Hon. Leader of the House could certainly consider it.

The Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not going to be conducive action towards reconciliation. The Leader of the Opposition spoke to the IGP and he promised that he will look into the matter within two weeks. In other words, what he meant was that the problems would be solved within two weeks. But he did not attend to the matter. I think, subsequently, it was attended to by the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

In whatever work that is taking place in the North or the East, the officers there are not cooperating. Even His Excellency the President made statements to the effect that everything will be done and that everything will be handed over within a few months time; but that did not happen. The heads of sections or those in charge are not cooperating with the politicians. Under such circumstances, how can reconciliation start as we expect? His Excellency the President, the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Leader of the Opposition and every one are together working towards reconciliation; but it looks like it is going to be a difficult task or rather a Herculean task to achieve.

I have travelled to over 40 countries in the world and have had experience of different climatic conditions. But, I have never seen a country like Sri Lanka where you get all the resources and climatic conditions suitable for animal husbandry in a small land area. All the resources are available in our country in a small land area. Therefore, we should make maximum utilization of our resources.

Thank you very much.

TAMIL PRISONERS DETAINED UNDER PREVENTION OF

TERRORISM ACT [6.27 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Sir, I move,

"Government has consistently undertaken to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act in view of the several obnoxious provisions contained in the said Act.

Several Tamil persons are held in custody under the provisions of the said Prevention of Terrorism Act for various offences arising out of the armed conflict.

It is seven years since the armed conflict came to an end. Though much time has lapsed, there is no finality to the issue of these Tamil prisoners in custody and several persons are in custody for long periods. These prisoners have been staging various protests and demonstrations from time to time demanding their release.

Several others who should have faced charges for much graver offences, have not been brought before the law while very many others have been released. This has happened recently and also after the insurrections in 1971 and 1988-89. The prisoners in custody genuinely complain that the treatment meted out to them is discriminatory and unequal. They have thus been denied equal treatment under the Law.

It is compulsory that the Government states its position on this matter and takes action to release the said prisoners. Their continuance in custody causes immense harm and harassment to their families, and impedes the process of reconciliation. The Government is seen as being insensitive to the genuine grievances of these prisoners."

As this House is aware, this is a matter which has been pending for a long time. This is a matter we have discussed with His Excellency the President and his views in regard to this matter have always been positive. We have discussed this matter with the Hon. Prime Minister and his views in regard to this matter have always been positive. There seemed to be some difficulty with the Attorney-General's Department earlier on. Now, there is a change in the Attorney-General's Department. The third person in command who may bring this matter under his control is the Minister of Justice. We have been talking to him quite frequently. He has not been negative, but I do not know whether action taken by him is not positive enough to bring about the desired and a desirable result to this issue.

We need to know, Sir, what the obstacle is to an acceptable decision being arrived at in regard to this matter. His Excellency the President pardoned his assailant and that man has been given his freedom. That really indicates his thinking.

I want to pose the question as to why others should be treated differently. It is seven years since the conflict ended. Persons have been in custody for long periods of time; some for about 10 - 15 years. There seems to be a justification for their release.

It is accepted widely that the Prevention of Terrorism Act is an obnoxious law and needs to be repealed. I want to, Sir, refer to certain matters which have been decided upon before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Paragraph 12 of the Resolution adopted on the 1st of October, 2015 states, I quote:

Welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to review the Public Security Ordinance Act and to review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and to replace it with anti-terrorism legislation in accordance with contemporary international best practices; "

So, the Sri Lankan Government has given a commitment to the UN Human Rights Council that the

1631 1632

Prevention of Terrorism Act would be repealed. Why? Because the law is obnoxious. The law contains provisions under which there cannot be a fair trial. The rules of natural justice cannot be ensured under this law. That is why the Sri Lankan Government has given this commitment to the UN Human Rights Council.

Recently, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made a statement in June, 2016 and what did he have to say? He said, The fate of remaining security detainees held under the PTA remains a major concern for the Tamil Community.

"In December 2015, the Government released on bail 39 individuals detained without charge, but around 250 detainees are believed to remain in detention. The Government has made indictments in 117 of these cases and in January, created a special High Court Bench to expedite proceedings. The Government had promised that the Attorney-Generals Department would make decisions by the end of March, but there have been no further charges or releases this year. This situation is not only traumatic for the individuals concerned. Some of whom resorted to hunger strikes and for their families but a source of growing frustration among Tamil political parties and the community at large."

"At the end of his visit in February 2016, the High Commissioner urged the Government to quickly find a formula to charge or release the remaining security-related detainees." You will see, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, even the Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner have quite clearly expressed grave concern in regard to the situation of these detainees and they say that it is a matter of concern not merely to the detainees or their families but also to the Tamil people and to the Tamil political parties. The High Commissioner is aware that the political parties have also taken up this issue not merely with the UN Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner himself but also in this august Assembly on several occasions.

There was a Statement made by the Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera also in June, 2016 at the UN Human Rights Council, where he said, A Committee is now putting the final touches to the first draft of the new counter-terrorism legislation that will replace the much criticized and the much abused Prevention of Terrorism Act, in keeping with Sri Lankas commitments and obligations to human rights and countering terrorism. Even the Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs described the Prevention of Terrorism Act as the much criticized and the much abused Act. He has said this in his Statement before the UN Human Rights Council. How can anyone be held in lawful custody under such a law? I want to pose that question. It is a law which you say is obnoxious, it has

been criticized by everyone, not merely by people in this country, by the international community, and it is a law which has been abused. How can anyone be held legally in custody under that law? How can anyone be charged under that law? How can anyone be convicted under that law? It is our submission that all persons taken into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act must be released because your Government concedes that the law is unjust, is obnoxious and is not a law that should remain on statute books in this country. This is a law that must be repealed. So, I think the time has come for all these people who were taken into custody under this law, whatever their present status maybe, whether they have been charged, they have not been charged, and even if they have been convicted, it would be my very strong submission that all persons taken into custody under an obnoxious law must be released. Sir, it is sometimes said that some of these persons have committed grave offences. Most of them have not been convicted of having committed such grave offences up to now. But, if the law under which they are being charged, the procedure under that law in regard to arresting a person, in regard to investigating a person, in regard to prosecuting a person and in regard to coming to a finding in respect of such person is deficient, then surely such persons must be released. Does that law conform to principles of natural justice? What does it matter, whether the offence is grave or not?

It maybe a grave offence. It may not be such a grave offence. But the fact of the matter is that the provisions of the law under which that person is dealt with are unacceptable. And if the law is unacceptable, it would be my submission Sir, very strongly, that those persons must be released and that there is a compulsory need to look at this matter objectively. What is worst, Sir, is different people have been treated differently. I normally do not refer to persons by name, I do not like to do so. But the prisoners pose the question, Why has KP not been charged?" He was a favourite of the former Government. Is he a favourite of the present Government? Why is the Government not taking action against him? He is a person who is believed to be on the wanted list of the International Police.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Interpol. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Interpol. He is a person who has not merely smuggled arms to this country, he was the chief arms procurer. What has happened to other persons who had held Ministerial office in the former Government - the person who held the position of Chief Minister in the Eastern Province? Have they not committed grave offences?

1633 1634

[ ]

2016 23

Why do you not charge them? You pick up some youth or people from weaker sections of society and you hold them in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. I do not think, Sir, this should continue any longer. These prisoners want to know, Are the offences that we have committed graver than the offences committed by the other people? In 1971 there was an insurrection. In 1988 and 89 there was an insurrection. A large number of persons were taken into custody. They were eventually released. They were sent home. They were pardoned. They took to arms against the State. They conducted an armed insurrection against the State. But you pardoned and sent them home. How can you justify keeping these persons in custody any longer, particularly when you admit that the law under which you are holding them in custody is not a law which conforms to principles of natural justice either by domestic norms or by international norms? Therefore, Sir, I would very strongly urge that these persons must be released. It is our duty to raise this issue on the Floor of this House on behalf of these prisoners.

The Tamil people as a whole look upon the reluctance of the Government to act firmly in regard to this matter as a severe impediment to the process of reconciliation. Even the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government released over 11,000 persons in custody. They gave them rehabilitation and released them. But this Government in the course of the past almost 18 months or more than that has not been acting in this matter as expeditiously as we expected them to.

I wish to also record, Sir, that this afternoon, I and my Colleague, Hon. Sumanthiran, had a meeting with the Hon. Prime Minister which was also attended by the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Hon.Deputy Minister of Justice and we discussed this matter fairly extensively with the Hon. Prime Minister. Then, there is a meeting to be held by the Hon.Minister of Justice this Friday with the Attorney-General and other relevant authorities to examine the question of how this issue can be addressed without further delay. We would very strongly urge, Sir, in the context of these persons being charged under a law which you, yourself concede as being unfit to remain in the statute books of this country, that all these persons are entitled to be released irrespective of whether they have not been charged, they have been charged or even those who have been convicted. It would be my submission, that if you accept that basically, your law is not a just law that entitles them to their release.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now, the Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan will second the Motion.

[7.20 p.m.] . . ( ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I am also very thankful to the Hon. R. Sampanthan for raising this issue today regarding the suspects who have been kept under the PTA and their present situation.

1645 1646

[ . ]

2016 23

There were a number of speakers who substantiated the fact that these suspects have been kept in custody for a long period of time, but no proper steps have been taken to release them. I will give certain statistics to this august Assembly to show that this Government under the leadership of His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister has taken all steps that may be necessary to see that the suspects who have been kept in custody are released at the earliest. It should be acknowledged that there had been a delay in the Attorney Generals Department sometime ago. As the Hon. R. Sampanthan very clearly said, there has been a change in the system in the Attorney Generals Department and I must thank the officials of the Attorney Generals Department, because now they are expeditiously trying to solve these issues that are pending in the High Courts in this country. These suspects have been kept under the PTA and the Hon. R. Sampanthan very clearly said that this is an obnoxious law, which cannot prevail in this country today. I think our Government is also of the same view and taking that into consideration he said that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs had mentioned in this august Assembly in June that steps will be taken to repeal this Act.

I wish to very clearly say that I had a meeting with the Hon. Minister of Law and Order this afternoon. He made it very clear to me that this Act is going to be repealed and all steps have been taken with regard to that. There will be be another meeting tomorrow and a new provision will be brought in under the Counter-Terrorism Act to abolish the PTA. The Government had given an undertaking and that undertaking will be upheld by this Government. All relevant steps have been taken to repeal the PTA - Prevention of Terrorism Act - and to bring the Counter-Terrorism Act into force. This Counter-Terrorism Act will be in accordance with all the international standards. All provisions, which should be embodied in it have been considered and the Bill will be presented to Parliament very soon. So, I wish to give an assurance on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka that this Act will be repealed and a new Act under the term Counter-Terrorism Act will be brought in.

Secondly, there has been a number of issues raised. I think the Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan raised a very pertinent question that the prisoners in the Anuradhapura prison should be brought to the Vavuniya prison because they are having some issues there. I have already spoken to the Commissioner General of Prisons. So, I thank the Hon.Member for reminding that. I will recheck that tomorrow and get back to you. When I spoke to the Commissioner General of Prisons, he said that he would immediately take steps to rectify the situation.

The other matter is regarding another suspect who has been given the right of rehabilitation but rehabilitation has not been given to him. I am sorry, I am not in a position to reply to that question immediately, but I will check

with the Attorney Generals Department and take immediate steps to see why this suspects has been kept.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I just wish to bring to your kind notice that the total number of files received by the Attorney Generals Department for advice in the year 2015 were 112. If we take the total number of files concluded in the year 2015, 57 suspects were recommended for rehabilitation; 42 suspects were discharged from criminal proceedings and nine indictments were forwarded to the High Court. The total number of files received for advice in the year 2016 is 16. The number of suspects recommended for rehabilitation was 9; the number of suspects discharged from criminal proceedings was 27 and the number of indictments forwarded to the High Court was 7. The total number of trials pending under the PTA in the High Court islandwide, inclusive of the two special High Courts with regard to Tamil suspects, is 78. The number of files pending advice of the Attorney-General's Department as at 9th of August, 2016 is only 15.

As I mentioned very clearly, presently, the Attorney-General is taking all the relevant steps to see that he clears these files at his earliest. Commencing 11th of November, 2015 to date, 39 suspects who were in remand custody have been enlarged on bail with the sanction of the Attorney-General pending the final decision with regard to their cases. In fact, here, I wish to say that there were certain suspects who were recommened for rehabilitation, but, unfortunately, their counsels had not accepted the same. Due to that, there had been an unwanted situation where the prisoners who underwent rehabilitation were not in a position to enjoy the rehabilitation facilities. But, I think, now things have been remedied. The Hon. Sumanthiran is also well aware of it and he has given special instructions to the counsels appearing for these cases to conclude the matters at the earliest.

Further steps have been taken to reconsider, review and revisit the cases under the PTA pending before the High Court. In the month of August this year, three such cases have been concluded reducing the charges to less serious offences to facilitate the expeditious conclusion of these trials.

Hon. Sampanthan, the Leader of the Opposition, we have taken your position into consideration. In fact, about three weeks ago, the Hon. Minister of Justice and myself were present at a discussion with the Attorney-General and I raised this issue with the Attorney-General, that the suspects who have been detained under the PTA have been kept for so many years, maybe, for ten - twelve years without charges, without evidence and without their cases being concluded or them being discharged. In fact, the Attorney-General himself accepted the position and told me very clearly to inform the Government that by the 15th of September this year-

1647 1648

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, just give me one minute. Can you elucidate as to why, if the PTA is to be repealed - as you gave a guarantee today - new indictments are being filed under the PTA? You said nine indictments were just filed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, I think I will need a few more minutes from you to explain that.

The number of files pending the advice of the Attorney-General is 15 in 2016. I did not say that 9 indictments were filed. - [Interruption.] The number of suspects recommended for rehabilitation was 9. - [Interruption.] No, not to my knowledge. The number of indictments forwarded to the High Court was 7.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In any case, I am aware that new indictments are being filed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) The indictments forwarded to the High Court is seven. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, if the Act is being repealed, why are new indictments being forwarded?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) You yourself is a lawyer. Until that Act is repealed, it is in force.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That, we know. But if you are giving a serious assurance to this House that this is an obnoxious Act and it is being repealed, in the meantime, why are you forwarding indictments under this Act?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) As far as I am concerned, it is not my duty to answer that. The Attorney-General will have to reply to that question. At present, the Prevention of Terrorism Act is in force. And once it is repealed, there will be transitional provisions in the new Act that will come into force. Under those provisions, the Attorney-General will advise as to what steps will have to be taken.

Sir, please, give me another couple of seconds. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , 7.30 .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I have been given a very short period of time to reply to these questions. We have given the assurance to you that all the necessary steps will be taken and the Attorney-General's Department has also given us the assurance that by 15th September, whatever charges that can be reduced to lesser offences will be reduced and that whoever suspects that can be recommended for rehabilitation or be enlarged on bail will be considered. Also, the matters raised by the other speakers will be taken into consideration and will be discussed with the Attorney-General. Certain provisions would be made expeditiously for the prisoners in custody to be released at the earliest.

Thank you. . . 7.30 .
