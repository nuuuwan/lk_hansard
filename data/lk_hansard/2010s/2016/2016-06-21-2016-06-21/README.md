( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, if I may refer to Standing Order No. 17.(1), it states, I quote: "(1) A Motion for the adjournment of Parliament shall not be made until Public Business has been entered upon (except by a Minister of the Cabinet) unless a member rises in his place at the end of questions and asks leave to move the adjournment of Parliament, for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance and state the matter. (2) Such a Motion by a member shall not be made unless- (a) written notice of such motion is given to Mr. Speaker before the commencement of the sitting on the day on which the motion is proposed to be made and his consent obtained; and....." Which I have done by submitting it to you.

Then, it goes on to state, I quote:

"(b) the member obtains the leave of Parliament; or

(c) the leave of Parliament not having been given, not fewer than twenty members rise in their places to support him:"

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes, 20 Hon. Members. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) So, Sir, 20 Hon. Members have risen to support me. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sit down! You all have done enough damage to the Hon. Members of Parliament. It is not about one particular Member we are raising this. It is on behalf of all Hon. Members of Parliament that I have stood up today.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees gave me permission. Standing Order 17. (2)(c), further states, I quote:

Provided where Mr. Speaker has refused his consent or is of opinion that the matter proposed to be discussed is not in order, he may allow the member raising the question to read the notice of the motion and thereafter Mr. Speaker shall state the reason for refusing consent or holding the motion as being not in order. "
