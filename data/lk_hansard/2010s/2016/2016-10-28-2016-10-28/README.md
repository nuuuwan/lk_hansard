We have certain principles in the Westminster System. Never has a Chairman - [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Speaker, we must understand that there are certain traditions and practices in the Commonwealth. The moment you become a Chairman of an Oversight Committee, you have to keep your political differences outside the Committee, and I know the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti has conducted himself very honourably. Until this moment, there has been no aspersions cast on him. The fact that he left that day out of stress is also understood by all of us. None of us have taken a political stand on this. But, the right of certain Hon. Members to have differences of opinion and that opinion to be reflected within the Report is totally all right. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay. Your position is clear. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) So, my request is that these portions of differences could go even to the extent of being expunged from todays Hansard in order to maintain the dignity of the House. -[Interruption.] Otherwise, none of us, Hon. Members - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

() . QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE I , , RESOLUTION BY UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for granting me leave to raise the following matter of urgent public importance under Standing Order No. 23(2). I would like to address this question to the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The Daily Mirror of 14th October reported that, on 13th October, Sri Lanka abstained from voting on a resolution by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization - UNESCO - which denounced Israeli violations in and around the al-Haram al-Sharif - also known as the Temple Mount - compound in the occupied Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. Since August 2015, Israel has restricted the entry of Palestinian worshippers to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third most holy site in Islam. Israels occupation of the area is not recognized by Sri Lanka or internationally.

The resolution, which was submitted by Palestine, was supported by Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Lebanon, Oman,

Qatar and Sudan. Twenty four countries, including Algeria, Brazil, China, Iran, Russia and South Africa voted in favour of the UNESCO resolution on Thursday, while the six countries, the United States, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Estonia opposed it.

The resolution confirmed the retention of the walled area of the Old City of Jerusalem - al-Haram al-Sharif-, which is home to very important Muslim, Christian and Jewish holy sites, on the list of endangered world heritage. On 26th October, the UNESCOs World Heritage Committee approved a new resolution. The Palestinian delegation emphasized that the UNESCOs vote aimed to reaffirm the importance of Jerusalem for Christianity, Judaism and Islam and to preserve the status quo in the face of encroachment and destructive actions by extremist Zionist groups.

Both Tzipi Hotovely, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister and Carmel Shama-HaCohen, Israels chief envoy to UNESCO were reported in the Times of Israel of 14th October as noting the additional countries abstaining in the vote had a positive aspect for Israel, while Hillel Neuer, the Head of the pro-Israeli UN Watch said that the Palestinians suffered a significant defeat in the international arena.

Sir, Sri Lanka had a long-standing, bipartisan policy of supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people for equity, which it has affirmed in international fora including the United Nations by voting consistently for the preservation of legitimate Palestinian rights. It has also had a policy of preservation of the religious and cultural heritage of the human race from destruction.

My question is,

(1) Why did the Sri Lankan delegation to the UNESCO abstain from voting for this resolution which was proposed by Palestinian delegation and the other countries? Does this vote mean that the Government has abandoned or reversed Sri Lanka's long-standing policy of support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people?

(2) Does this vote mean that the Government has abandoned or reversed Sri Lanka's long-standing policy of support for the preservation of human heritage?

(3) Does this vote mean that the Government has abandoned or reversed Sri Lankas long-standing Non-Aligned foreign policy?

The Head of State did not participate at the Non-Aligned Movement Summit for the first time this year. We have deviated from the Non-Aligned foreign policy of having friendly and cooperative support extended to the Arab countries in the Non-Aligned Movement.

I hope that the Hon. Minister would answer this Question.

Thank you.

1223 1224

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, do you want to add something? - [Interruption.] . Do you want to answer now, Hon. Deputy Minister? () ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) We appreciate the question raised by the Hon. Member. At no time have we withdrawn the support for the Palestinian people. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Are you answering the Question today itself? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No, I will not answer today. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) In that case, we could ask the Hon. Rauff Hakeem whether he wants to add something, or else you can answer later. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I will answer at the next Session of Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay. Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I must thank the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena for raising this Question. This has perplexed some of us in the Government also. Having been showing solidarity with the Palestinians, at least, on an issue of this nature, we should definitely have voted for the Motion. We have betrayed the long tradition of support for solidarity for Palestinian people by refraining from it. This is a matter regarding which we are also perplexed and we would like the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs to give a proper explanation.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I would appreciate the question raised. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Deputy Minister, are you going to answer now? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I would answer at the next Session of Parliament. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Since the Secretary to the Sri Lanka-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Association would also like to add something to what the Hon. Rauff Hakeem said, you can answer the Question raised under Standing Order 23 (2) on the next Sitting day.

, . . . . , , . . . . 71 . , . [1.38p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Presiding Member, it is with a deep sense of sorrow that we are participating in this Vote of Condolence on the demise of one of our distinguished Members, who during the short period in which he served in this Chamber, was able to prove beyond doubt the traits of his conviction relating to patriotism. I do not think anybody would dispute the fact if anyone says that he was a patriot in the true sense of the word. There is a famous saying in English; "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel". But, when it comes to the Hon. S.L. Gunasekera, he was not of that kind. He was a man of his words from the very early stages in his life. His classmates and his teachers in S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, his lecturers in the Sri Lanka Law College and his colleagues in the profession in Hultsdorf Hill would all testify to this mans integrity in his professional career.

The late Hon. S.L. Gunasekera wrote a famous book - I forgot the name - in which he carries many interesting anecdotes about life in Hultsdorf and the way in which the principles of governance and the culture of impunity had affected the civil fabric of this country. He was a prolific writer who wrote very often to newspapers, journals and magazines. He was also a critic of judgments, he has critiqued many judgments in a very constructive way. The late Hon. S.L. Gunasekera had a very lucrative practice in the District Courts of our country and was often seen in the Superior Courts arguing many appeals. All his clients would testify to the fact that he was a Counsel who would do the utmost for his clients. He would not leave a single stone unturned in his endeavour to do justice for his clients, so was he in this House.

1243 1244

He is known for his rebellious nature and character. Particularly, one incident comes to my mind. He was one of those members of the team that was sent on behalf of the J.R. Jayewardene Government for the Thimpu Talks where the destiny of this country rested on the shoulders of a team of eminent lawyers. The late Hon. S.L. Gunasekera was one of those people who were hand-picked by the late President J.R. Jayewardene. But, finally, when the Indo-Lanka Accord was entered, he was able to walk out on President J.R. Jayewardene, in keeping with his own convictions, criticizing the Indo-Lanka Accord and its contents.

As I told you, the late Hon. S.L. Gunasekera was a prolific writer and his writings bear testimony to the convictions he held very dear to his heart. He had carried away many prizes in school. In S. Thomas' College and in the Sri Lanka Law College, he won prestigious awards for his unrivalled oratory. He won the Address to Jury Competition in the Sri Lanka Law College and proved to be quite adept at even practices before the High Courts in criminal law. So, he was a very versatile lawyer in that sense. He could very ably conduct both the criminal cases and the civil cases in the country.

He also served a very short stint in the Attorney-Generals Department as a Crown Counsel and having left the Attorney-Generals Department, he chose journalism as a profession. I think, he served a very-short term, may be about two years, as the editor of the then famous national daily "Dawasa" newspaper until the "Dawasa Group" was banned subsequently and closed down.

Being a patriot very true to his convictions, he was also at one time the President of the Sihala Urumaya Party. He was not a Buddhist and that was one of those intriguing features at that time - that a person who was not a Buddhist was embraced by the Sihala Urumaya to lead the Party and the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, who is a descendent of his in his foot steps carrying on the legacy of the late Hon. S.L. Gunasekera in this House, would bear testimony to the fact that he, perhaps was a Christian, but who observed the five precepts of Buddhism. I do not think it would be wrong to say that apart from his own religious convictions, he was a man of his conscience and he had this enormous reservoir of courage to stand up to the powers that be to criticize what he saw in the happenings of this country. Particularly, during the dark years when the State had to respond to terrorism with harsher measures, while criticizing the Government for its conduct of law and order in the country, he would equally be adept at justifying the right to use Emergency Regulations to counter-terrorism in its proper sense.

So, he was a man of multifaceted ability and personality. To lose someone like him is a great loss to the country, the profession and as well as to this House. It is with a heavy heart that I participate in this Debate and pay tribute to a true son of the soil.

Thank you very much.

Gunasekera but also of the Hon. George Pelpola, for which I could not be here, and the next Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. K. N. Choksy.

I knew the late Hon. S. L. Gunasekera for a long time when I was in the university. I knew his brother. I knew his wife's family. I got to know him well in the UNP when he worked with us as a lawyer. He worked in the UNP. We worked together. We worked for the 1977 elections. There were many occasions that we fought the same political battle, but he was a person of an independent mind. He was selected as one of the members of the team headed by Mr. H. W. Jayewardene which had to negotiate with India from 1983. He took part in the drafting of the amendments to the Constitution. In the Thirteenth Amendment he played a very useful and a critical role, I must say. Actually, the parting of the ways came with the Indo-Lanka Agreement. Whatever reservations he had of the earlier Thirteenth Amendment, he went along finally and supported it. But when the Indo-Lanka Agreement came, he said he could not support that any longer. A few days before President Jayewardene signed the Indo-Lanka Agreement, I happened to meet President Jayewardene in his office in the President's House when both Mr. H. L. De Silva and S. L. Gunasekera walked in accompanied by Mr. H. W. Jayewardene. We had very cordial relations and discussed, but they said that they just could not agree with the Indo-Lanka Agreement and that is where the two of them parted company.

Thereafter, Mr. S. L. Gunasekera went and he worked along with the SLFP, which had opposed the Indo-Lanka Agreement and came to Parliament in 1989. He was a strong critic of some of the issues that the Government took; supported the Government on others. He was an independent Member. Even within the SLFP he would not tow the Party line all the time. Finally, he was not returned to the next Parliament but he continued to express his views. He was a good criminal lawyer and a politician. He was able to balance both. I used to meet him from time to time. There were times we agreed. There were times he came to meet us and disagree. I remember during the peace process he came many times. He offered his views and there were also disagreements as much as there were agreements. We always had a good personal relationship though I did not see him in the last few years when he was ailing. He made a contribution, not merely on the issue of ethnic relations but on how to tackle terrorism and in regard to devolution and also on many other matters. On legal matters he was outspoken. He certainly was a strong personality in the Bar. I join the other Members of the House in expressing my condolences on his death.

The late Hon. George Pelpola, as you know and I know, was from Gampola. He was from a leading family and the Pelpola family was always well-known for its support of the UNP. They were some of the pillars of the UNP in the town and I must say George Pelpola helped us, when I was the leader, to organize both Gampola, Nawalapitiya electorates and he was active, Mr. Chair, in your electorate and in many other areas. He worked for Central Finance. They had a family company but he

worked with Central Finance. He was in this House as a Member for a short time. Then he resigned from the House to accept an ambassadorship and he served as an ambassador during the time of the UNP Government. He still worked very closely after I became the leader. He made a tremendous contribution for the development of the UNP in the Kandy District. He also worked closely with the Catholic Church. He used to be one of my key representatives to meet with the Lordship the Archbishop and he kept in touch with the Catholic community but he was well aware of the needs of the District and also of the tea industry.

Mr. George Pelpola led an active life. I happened to meet him in the latter stages when he was ailing and finally he passed away. He was a good friend; a good member of the Party; a good supporter and most of all, he was a good Sri Lankan. I would like to have my words of appreciation on the Hon. George Pelpola recorded here. Actually, we are meeting rather late to pay condolences to the late Hon. Pelpola.

Finally, I would like to say a few words about the late Hon. K.N. Choksy, whom I got to know as a senior lawyer in the Bar. He used to practise and after we formed the Government, he became one of the legal advisers to the late President Premadasa. He had a very, very fine brain and as the number of cases increased - there were more occasions on which legal issues increased - I used to meet Mr. Choksy. He always tried to see how you could balance the issues.

Then, he took part in President Premadasas campaign and came into Parliament. We know the contributions he made as a Member of Parliament. He was a very conscientious Member of Parliament. He used to take part in all the activities and he was also responsible for appearing for Hon. Premadasas defence in the election petition that was filed against him. I know the amount of work that the late Hon. Choksy put in for that case and he was successful. He finally entered the Cabinet as a Minister under President Wijetunga and he served for a short time as a Minister. Then all of us went into Opposition. He was a valuable asset to me as a Member of the Opposition.

When I was leading the Opposition, there were many issues that came up regarding the political solution put forward by the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. There were also many other issues that came up. At each occasion we had negotiations with President Kumaratunga, the Hon. Choksy was available. He was the person who made the initial draft of the Seventeenth Amendment. I want to record that in this House. When we talk of Independent Commissions, I would like to say that without the Hon. K.N. Choksy, we would not have had that draft, which was then taken up by the JVP and finally, President Kumaratunga had to agree to the Seventeenth Amendment. He operated the Seventeenth Amendment for some time.

When I won the Election in 2001, I asked the Hon. K.N. Choksy to be the Minister of Finance. He said, I have not handled finance before, Ranil. I said, I want a

sharp mind. What you need to be the Minister of Finance is a sharp mind. You need not be an economist. President J.R. Jayewardene was a lawyer, who became a Minister of Finance. So, you can come from different backgrounds. All you require is to have a sharp mind. He was able to do it and I must say that he performed quite well. As the Minister of Finance, he worked with me to ensure that we restored growth in this country. When we took over, the growth was at minus 1.6 per cent. Then, as a result of the Hon. Choksys endeavours, together with the other Ministers, we brought it around. The IMF agreed with us; the World Bank agreed with us and he was partly responsible for the plan which we put forward at the Tokyo Conference, which got Sri Lanka so many billions of dollars that was pledged as foreign aid.

In addition, he was also available in many other legal issues that arose. He used to give his mind to the negotiations that went on during the peace process. He was an active and a conscientious Member of the Cabinet. We were very proud because he represented Sri Lanka and he was a member of the Parsi community who rose to a very high position. His father was also a well-known lawyer. His brother was a well-known businessman. But, I think he achieved the highest of all; the highest achievement was by the Hon. Choksy as Minister of Finance. He served another stint in this Parliament and thereafter, he used to advise me from his home. We could not accommodate him at that time in Parliament as our numbers had gone down. The 2010 Election itself resulted in the reduction of Members of Parliament of the UNP. But, the Hon. Choksy used to talk to us; he used to send his views along. Finally, as a result of his illnesses, a lot of people witnessed that the Hon. Choksy was declining and he passed away peacefully.

He has a young son who is now continuing the family tradition of a legal career and here in this House, I would like to pay my tribute to the Hon. K.N. Choksy, a member of the Parsi community who made an outstanding contribution to the modern history of Sri Lanka.

, 1989 2010 21 .. , , . [2.36p.m.] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, I rise to second the Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. K.N. Choksy, a very distinguished Member of this House and a very erudite and celebrated lawyer of our nation.

The Hon. K.N. Choksy had a very colourful career in the Bar. Having entered the Bar in 1958, he was soon recognized as a rising star of Hulftsdorp and had distinguished himself in being involved in some of the most celebrated cases in this country. If you take our law reports, it is replete with cases in which the late Hon. K.N. Choksy had appeared as a counsel. His mould was not that of a politician, but, he was brought to this House as a National List Member of Parliament and the late President R. Premadasa appointed him as the Minister in-charge of Constitutional Affairs. I had the privilege of attending the All-Party Conference on behalf of my Party from the year 1989 and had the benefit of the wisdom of the Hon. K.N. Choksy in his deliberations when he participated on behalf of the United National Party. He was, in fact, the leading counsel who appeared on behalf of President R. Premadasa when the famous election petition was filed by the former Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. That case was heard for almost 525 days and thousands of witnesses were called to testify through affidavits and he was ultimately successful in defending the election of the late President R. Premadasa.

Then, subsequently, he adorned this House as the Minister of Finance in the years 2001 to 2004. In all, he served this House for almost 20 years and his contributions in the Debates would testify to the fact that his sharp intellect has enriched the Debates in this Chamber.

His grandparents came to this country in the late 18th Century and have contributed immensely to the

preservation of a minuscule communitys cultural traditions. As a matter of fact, it is his maternal grandparents who donated the Navroze Baug, which is the religious centre of the Parsi residents in Colombo.

His involvement in preserving the cultural traditions of one of those small religious communities in the world, the faith of Zoroastrianism, is being continued by one of his eminent children, Prof. Jamsheed Choksy, who is now a Professor of Central Eurasian Studies and History, a Director of Middle Eastern Studies and a scholar in Zoroastrianism. He has published many books on religion. His second son Khursheed is in the United Nations system and his younger son Vishtasp is presently an eminent lawyer following the footsteps of his erudite father.

This House is poorer by the absence of individuals of the caliber of the Hon K.N. Choksy whom we very dearly call as, Cassy" and he was a man who had always been a tower of strength to many leaders of the United National Party. That was very evident from the manner in which his counsel was sought on all difficult occasions when the Party had to face many legal battles. He served his clients with meticulous care. I had attended many consultations in his chambers on behalf of clients as well as a litigant myself when we had to face election issues. I have observed his meticulous attention to detail on every matter of fact and law. It is a well-known fact in Hulftsdorp that he was a very conscientious counsel and had contributed immensely for the development of law, particularly the public law.

With those comments, I finally wish to convey my condolences to his dear wife, the three children and the other family members.

Thank you. [.. 2.43] ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , .. .

[3.05p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity to say a few words on this occasion when we are remembering one of Sri Lankas legal luminaries, a former Minister of Finance, a former Minister of Constitutional and State Affairs and above all a gentleman.

The late Hon. K.N. Choksy was one of the first to be appointed as senior Attorney-at-Law under the 1978 Constitution. The Senior Attorneys-at-Law were later re-designated as Presidents Counsel. It is also important to note that his father was also a Queens Counsel in Sri Lanka.

The Hon. Choksy came from a very tiny community in Sri Lanka, the Parsi community, but I believe he was nominated to Parliament through the National List not to represent that small community but rather in recognition of his services as a lawyer and because of the contribution he could make in Parliament and which he did to the utmost. As a lawyer, he excelled in several fields; the civil law, commercial law and also in public law. Later in life he took up a number of important public law cases.

The Law Reports of this country bear testimony to the contribution that the late Hon. K.N. Choksy made to the development of the law.

I had the opportunity of interacting with him closely in the year 2000 when the talks were on between the UNP and the Peoples Alliance on a new Constitution under the former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Government. I happened to be the Secretary to the talks. I remember, at one stage, the then President Mrs. Kumaratunga requested the late Hon. Choksy to draft the first Chapter of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka Bill, presented to Parliament in the year 2000, which I have with me today. Chapter I of this Bill - this is not known much - which is on The People, the State and Sovereignty, was drafted by Hon. K.N. Choksy. He readily agreed when the then President Kumaratunga requested him to draft that particular Chapter and I was able to interact with him. I also contributed in my own small ways and found him to be very flexible. Also he was prepared to take our views into consideration.

Today there is no People's Alliance but there is the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Unfortunately in 2000 the People's Alliance and the United National Party were unable to come to a complete agreement on the new Constitution. That was also because the General Election was just a few weeks away. Another lesson that we have to draw from the attempts of Constitution making in Sri Lanka is that you cannot adopt a new Constitution in the last year of Parliament.

Now we have the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the United National Party, the Tamil National Alliance and various other parties, which have a base in the Muslim and the upcountry Tamil community working together. Today all these parties are working together. So, this is a golden opportunity to honour people like the late Hon. Choksy, who did his best to contribute to Constitution making in the year 2000, although that Constitution did not come through.

He was a very friendly person in Hultsdorf and also he was quite a popular person. He was not a man of many words, but he was very popular and we know he treated his juniors very well. In fact, there is a story to say that he was a man of perfection. On the table in his Chambers, there was a particular place for everything. For instance, this book has to be placed here; that book has to be placed there; the pens are here and stationeries in one place and so on. So, while he has gone out, juniors used to change those places. They would keep the pen in another place and the pencil in some other place. So, his juniors told me that he would come back to his chambers, sit in his chair and immediately notice that something has been changed. So, before he started discussions with his juniors, he would put everything back into the original places. He was so particular as to how his table should be arranged.

His son also joined the profession and he is a senior lawyer now.

I take this opportunity, on my behalf especially as a legal practitioner and also on behalf of the Lanka Sama

1265 1266

[ () ]

2016 28

Samaja Partys majority group, which I represent in Parliament, to convey my deepest sympathies to the family of the late Hon. K. N. Choksy, at a moment when we have lost a legal luminary and a person who has contributed to the development of law in this country.

Thank you.

[3.11p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on the Vote of Condolence pertaining to the late Hon. K.N. Choksy.

I had known the late Hon. Choksy, Sir, before I came into Parliament and long before he came into Parliament. When I was a regular practitioner in the District Court of Trincomalee, the late Hon. Choksy used to come frequently to the District of Trincomalee.

He used to be the junior to Mr. C.G. Weeramantry, who was a very respected and a senior lawyer in this country and who subsequently became a Judge of the Supreme Court and also served on international courts and tribunals before he returned to Sri Lanka. He is presently in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Choksy's father was also a very leading lawyer, a very senior Queens Counsel at a time when we had Queens Counsel, not Presidents Counsel. He used to be in the company of persons like Mr. H.V. Perera, Mr. R.L. Pereira and Mr. N.E. Weerasooriya, Mr. E.B. Wickremanayake, Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam and Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. I am taking my mind back to the most senior, much-celebrated lawyers in this country who were not Presidents Counsel, but Queens Counsel. Mr. Choksys father, the late Mr. N.K. Choksy, was one such eminent person.

Mr. K.N. Choksy himself was a very eminent lawyer. He was appointed a Presidents Counsel and appeared in many important cases. He was associated with the United National Party. He appeared in a number of important cases on behalf of the UNP. I believe he also appeared for President R. Premadasa in all the cases which President Premadasa had to face or contend with in the course of his political career. Having been a Member of the United National Party for a long time, Mr. Choksy was nominated to Parliament several times on the National List. He served in Parliament. He was one of those persons who were appointed on the National List for the reason that he was an eminent person and it was believed that his contributions in Parliament would bring about healthy changes and would contribute substantially to achieving what Parliament is intended to achieve - that is good legislation. I think Mr. Choksy was appointed a

Member of Parliament by the United National Party for that reason and he served in Parliament for several terms and for a long time. During his time as a Member of Parliament, he was a Minister in the UNP Government, Minister in charge of Constitutional and State Affairs and also a Minister of Finance and one must say that he discharged those functions with a reasonable measure of competence and in a manner acceptable to all the people.

Mr. Choksy, by nature, was a very kind person; he had a very kind disposition. He was a very pleasant person to deal with. He was a much-respected person both at the Bar and by persons who were associated with him. Even in Parliament, he was a much-respected person. We all sincerely regret his demise because persons like him are not easy to find. His demise has indeed been a loss to everyone who had known him and also a loss to the country.

I join my Colleagues, Sir, in extending our deepest condolences to the family of the late Hon. K.N. Choksy and we would like them to be assured that Hon. Choksy will always be looked upon and also be remembered by us with respect.
