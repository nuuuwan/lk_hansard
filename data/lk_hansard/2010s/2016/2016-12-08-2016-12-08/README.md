2016 08

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Minister. ()

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) I am very thankful to the Hon. Member for having brought to our notice certain incidents which might lead to religious disharmony in the Trincomalee area. Certainly, I am willing to discuss with you and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I will go there very soon and discuss with the parties concerned, and I am sure we can resolve that. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you very much. Hon. John Amaratunga please. [10.29 a.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga - Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs and Minister of Lands) Mr. Chairman, I am thankful to the Hon. Thurairetnasingam for having said many nice words about me. I deeply appreciate your compliments. Sir, Sri Lanka is one of the most sought-after travel destinations in the world today. It has become very popular, . I have experienced this personally when I represented the country at some of the leading travel -tourism fairs in the world such as the ATM, ITB, WTM et cetera. It is a travel hotspot among the global travel community and the results of this popularity will be seen in the coming months and years. This situation has come about largely due to the wide publicity Sri Lanka has received from the respected international media such as Lonely Planet, Fox News, Traveller Magazine, New York Times, Harpers Bazaar, Sunday Times of London, BBC Travel, The Guardian, ABTA, Conde Nast et cetera. In addition, many international organizations have showered accolades on Sri Lanka such as Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; BBC which ranked Sri Lanka as one of the most generous countries; Conde Nast which ranked Sri Lanka as one of its best destinations; ASTA Worldwide Destination Guide

and Elite Traveller have heaped praises on Sri Lanka. All this has helped to push tourist arrivals above the 2 million mark - - for the first time in the history of the country. I am anticipating 2.2 million arrivals by the end of this year, which is an all-time record. This is a significant improvement from the 1.78 million arrivals recorded last year. So far this year, arrivals have grown on an average by 15 per cent compared with last year. In terms of revenue, last year tourism revenue stood at US Dollars 3 billion. This year tourism earnings are expected to be over US Dollars 3.5 billion. The total revenue earned by the public sector institutions from tourism last year stands at an impressive figure of Rs. 8.3 billion. Sigiriya alone has earned Rs. 1.6 billion revenue from foreign tourists during 2015 while the other heritage sites in the Cultural Triangle have earned another Rs. 2.5 billion revenue from foreign tourists. In addition Rs. 1 billion was earned from the entry fee to wildlife parks, Rs. 1 billion from the tourism development levy and another Rs, 2 billion from the embarkation tax paid by the tourists. Based on the current growth projections, my Ministry has set a target of 4.5 million arrivals by the end of year 2020. We are also targeting tourism revenue to grow up to US Dollars 10 billion by this time, making it the number one foreign exchange earner for the country. A matter of concern has been the anticipated shortage of rooms to accommodate the growing arrivals. In this regard plans are already in place and in fact work is currently in progress to increase the current room inventory from 25,000 rooms to 45,000 in the formal hospitality sector in the next couple of years. The required investments are already in place, driven entirely by the private sector. Meanwhile the rapidly growing informal sector continues to add a sizeable number of accommodation units for tourists. My Ministry is making every effort to encourage these establishments to register themselves with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and fall in line with the established framework. The response so far has been encouraging and this is a task that my Ministry is pursuing with added vigour in the national interest. In fact, just a couple of days ago, I along with the Minister of Finance, met the representatives of all the online travel agents such as Agoda, Bookings.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, TripAdvisor et cetera to enlighten them about our intentions and seek their assistance to regularize the informal sector so that they too, like the formal sector, will directly contribute to the countrys economy by paying taxes. I am happy to inform you that the leading global hotel chains are continuing to invest in Sri Lanka. Just a few days ago, the world-renowned Radisson Hotel of the US announced the plans to construct two or three hotels in various parts of the Island. This is in addition to the current investments by Movenpick, Sheraton, Grand

3423 3424

Hyatt, Shangri-La, ITC, Marriot, Anantara, ONYX, RIU et cetera. Those investments show the confidence the international business community has in our tourism sector. In addition, we are looking at the growing niche markets to attract high-end tourists such as yachting, golfing, kitesurfing and ballooning. Another area which is focused upon is the medical tourism with a special emphasis on Ayurveda. I am happy to note today that Lanka Hospitals has been accredited internationally for medical tourism. Sir, we are also looking at attracting large cruise liners with thousands of passengers on board. Already we have had several calls from the mega liners in Colombo and Hambantota, bringing in thousands of passengers on Turnaround Tours. In fact, a few weeks ago, a mega cruise liner docked in Colombo with 3,000 passengers and next week another luxury cruise liner is due to call over in Colombo with 700 passengers, each of whom are paying nearly US Dollars 7,000 a night on the cruise. This is the kind of niche clientele we are focusing on. While also encouraging all other categories starting from the backpackers, we are also encouraged by the re-emergence of charter flights to Sri Lanka. As you all know, charters used to be the bread and butter of our tourism industry until the escalation of the war. These charters are now resuming operations to Colombo and especially feeding some of the big new resort hotels on the South coast such as RIU in Ahungalla and Shangri-La in Hambantota. This brings us to the subject of connectivity. I am happy to inform you that my Ministry is working closely with some of the other line ministries to develop our inland air connectivity. In this regard, we have earmarked developing some of the key domestic airports located in places like Palaly in the Northern Province, Hingurakgoda in the North Central Province, Batticaloa in the Eastern Province, Weerawila and Koggala in the Southern Province and Puttalam in the North-Western Province. In addition, we are also linking the hill country in the near future with an airport in Badulla. On the international front, we have many new airlines linking Europe with Colombo and the latest is the KLM, which commenced flights last month. Many other airlines are currently in negotiations to commence operations in Colombo which has adopted an Open Skies Policy. It must also be pointed out that many of the existing airlines currently serving the country have doubled their frequencies to cope up with the growing demand. Now, Emirates, for instance, has two daily flights coming to Colombo. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management, which comes under the purview of

my Ministry has made arrangements to double its output this year in order to cater to the growing demand for skilled personnel. Thereby, the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management will train 6,075 personnel this year as opposed to 3,000 last year. In addition to the introduction of the craft courses for specific skills at the existing facilities located in various parts of the Island, arrangements are being made to further expand the training network by opening new facilities in Jaffna and Polonnaruwa in the near future. Further, the Institution is making arrangements to collaborate with the Don Bosco Training Institute, Aquinas University College and the Gangaramaya Temple to both enhance training and increase the output of trained personnel for the hotel industry. The SLITHM being mindful of industry requirements introduced a new course just a few days ago, titled, "Certified Hospitality Finance and Management Accountant Professional Qualification" developed in association with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Arrangements are being made also to begin similar courses in Human Resources, IT and Marketing as well. These are very important in order to upgrade professionalism into the tourism industry. I am happy to say that every student who has received training at this Institution has found employment in the industry. According to statistics, nearly 650,000 individuals are directly and indirectly employed in the tourism industry. My Ministry is also in the process of streamlining the approval process for new projects and also fast-tracking the process of renewing annual licences and permits by introducing an online process. As a result, hoteliers no longer need to visit the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority in Colombo to obtain renewals, permits and licences. They can do so in the comfort of their own establishments, offices or their homes. During 2016, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau planned 122 country-specific promotions in 22 markets, including 58 travel fairs and road shows. Much of this work has successfully been completed. Among the highlights is the currently ongoing global outdoor promotional campaign in the UK underground. An international destination marketing campaign, which has been on the drawing board for some time, will soon see the light of day, probably in the first quarter of next year because the Ministry has to adhere to various Government regulations. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has mobilized its resources to develop tourism infrastructure facilities in many parts of the country. Tourism facilities in the East coast, especially in Pasikudah, were developed at a cost of Rs. 126 million. Also, for the first time, regulations for the classification of hotels was gazetted in

3425 3426

May this year. Last week, I was able to present the star classification to some of the hotels that complied with these regulations, out of which four were from the five-star category. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have only five more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I think, I can get a little more time. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) He will accommodate me. I must also state that Sri Lanka received wide global publicity for the UNWTO Conference held in Pasikudah in May this year and also the highly successful SNAV Congress in October, where 300 top travel agents from France attended the Congress in Colombo for the very first time. These programmes and other promotional activities carried out by the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau have given MICE traffic to Sri Lanka a much-needed boost. My Ministry is currently on the lookout for a suitable space to construct a 3,500 seat convention centre in Colombo. Such a facility will help attract MICE traffic from both India and China. Recently, the Lions Club in Southeast Asia held an international conference in Colombo with over 3,000 members in attendance. Very unfortunately, there was no proper venue in Colombo to hold such a large conference. We have also seen a growing interest among the Chinese to hold mass weddings in Sri Lanka so as the Indians as well. This is a growing segment and we need large venues to accommodate these events. Reservations have already been made for 200 Chinese couples to conduct a mass wedding in Colombo. Meanwhile, the minimum rate regime currently in effect in Colombo hotels will be allowed to continue till the end of 2018, at which point we will review the situation and make suitable amendments. With all the institutions under my Ministry working together to achieve the objectives that have been set, I am very confident that we will be able to realize the dream of making tourism the number one foreign exchange revenue generator for the country by 2020.

The policy framework of the Unity Government consisting of the two main political Parties headed by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has deeply contributed to achieving the targets and objectives I mentioned earlier on tourism arrivals and revenue generation. I must thank the Deputy Minister, Hon.Arundika Fernando for his support, the Ministry Secretary, Additional Secretaries, Chairmen of Boards - Mr. Paddy Withana, Mr. Sunil Dissanayake, Mr. Prema Cooray and all other officials who contributed in achieving the positive results. I also wish to thank the Ambassadors and High Commissioners both in Sri Lanka and in various parts of the world who have given me their utmost support in order to achieve our objectives. Sir, it is also my responsibility to speak a few words on Christian Religious Affairs. Otherwise, I will not be able to go to heaven. , . We work in harmony with both the National Christian Council of Sri Lanka as well as the Catholic Church. - three churches were gazetted as national shrines and we were able to give full State honours at the time of their feasts. . . . , , . - - . . . . .

Several lands have been occupied by the military in the Walikamam North area of Kankesanthurai and there are a lot of churches that have been demolished by them. By now, 51 cases have been filed in the Supreme Court, but no response has been given. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No determination has been given. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Yes. Since you are the Minister responsible for Christian Religious Affairs, can you intervene and settle this matter? I think Rev. Gnanapragasam, Bishop of Jaffna and the Bishop of Vavuniya have written a letter requesting you to intervene and settle this matter. So, it is very important. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay. Hon. Minister, please look into that matter.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I accept the request made by the Hon. Member. The fact is, since the matter is before the Supreme Court, we may not be able to interfere very much. However, we will try to expedite and get a ruling in order to restore them. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Since you are the Minister in-charge of Christian Religious Affairs, you can request HE President, who is the Defence Minister, and also the Defence Secretary to release these lands and to reconstruct the churches soon. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Certainly I will request them. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay. That is fine. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I have much more to say. I will table* the rest of my speech to be included in Hansard. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay. You have already taken about five minutes extra.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, I will take one or two minutes. Unfortunately, when I was speaking in the morning, the Hon. Member was not in the House. I addressed all these issues. It is not that the Government is reluctant to enforce the law. I explained in the morning that since this

is a sensitive issue, we do not want to have any ramifications by enforcing the law. First of all, we will make an attempt to have some understanding among all the religious groups. That is why, two days ago, we had a meeting headed by His Excellency the President with the participation of all the four Ministers in charge of Ministries dealing with the four religions and all religious leaders. Now we have come to some agreement that we will resolve all these things through dialogue. We are going to set up a secretariat also to address these issues. In fact, there had been a circular earlier which lays down the procedure to be followed when you set up a new religious place. I think it needs some amendments. We, all the Ministers, will discuss and let you know. Just give us a few days to settle all these issues. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran) , . .... ( )

( .... - ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hizbullah - State Minister of Rehabilitation and Resettlement)

Even though the dialogues were held, yesterday there was a press conference and they were criticizing Islam very badly. We cannot allow this. The Hon. Minister of Justice and Minister of Buddhasasana knows that. You have to enforce the law. You cannot say that you cannot enforce the law because they were having dialogues with you. How are you going to stop this? You have to arrest them and control this.

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation)

Mr. Presiding Member, at the very outset, I wish to convey our appreciation to His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, the President, and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister, for appointing four Hon. Ministers in charge of Ministries dealing with the four major religions. This is a very practical move. Religious leaders and the laity play an important role in our society. Unity and understanding among the religions is extremely important in the country. If the country is to achieve economic progress, there must be unity among the followers of the four religions. Ministers who have a clear understanding of the sensitivities of each of the religions can play a positive role in creating unity among them. We have four Hon. Ministers, adherents of their respective religions, in charge of the four Ministries. It is, therefore, extremely important that the four Ministers regularly meet and pave the way for unity. Hon. Minister in charge of Islamic Affairs, the Hon. Abdul Haleem, is an active Parliamentarian. He understands the religious tensions that have recently re-emerged in the country. He has taken steps to engage with the community activists, consult them and follow up

the issues. No one should be allowed to insult the religion of anyone else's. Hate speeches can only aggravate the tensions. It can lead to painful conflicts. Our country cannot afford another July 1983. The country will get isolated and condemned. The great image of Buddhism will be tarnished forever. The Hon. Haleem must engage with the other Hon. Ministers, the Hon. Prime Minister and His Excellency the President and diffuse attempts at creating problems. Hon. Abdul Haleem and his officials in the Ministry and the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, including his hard-working brother Fahim, are doing excellent work in this regard. Last year Hajj arrangements, for instance, were appreciated by everyone. As a senior Minister of the Muslim community, I wish to assure the Hon. Ministers of the four religious Ministries my fullest co-operation to solve the problems. Let me now address some of our more serious issues. Sir, I speak today with great trepidation and a heavy heart, a feeling I have never had before as a peoples representative of this august Assembly. I am sure most of us here must be sharing my own anxiety and fears as our beloved nation is facing extreme levels of religious tensions. It is my view that these are being unnecessarily and deliberately created. Are we heading for a bleak future, an impending doom? All this is because of an uncontrolled small band of extremists who are hell bent to create havoc by starting conflicts, by using sick communal slogans and slanders. These are attacks on religious freedom which will boomerang on the country. I am not the first person to voice my concern, but I do not want to be the last person to suffer in silence and ignominy when my community and the nation are under attack. I must put on record my disappointment, gloom, and foreboding as a Sri Lankan and as a Muslim, and above all as a world citizen. But this is not a mere speech on the exercise we are engaged in Parliament. Whatever we speak must be heeded for the good of our country. Our good intentions must be translated into affirmative action. The end result must pave way for the greater protection of our people, not just for tomorrow, but forever if we are to enjoy peace and tranquility of our great country in years to come. What is afflicting my nation? Why are our people incited to cut the throats of others in their neighbourhood? Do we not have enough to share in this blessed land? In a way, we are the envy of foreigners. We have earned the name as the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean" - a land of splendor. Our country is well endowed with abundant natural resources; be it water, earth, greenery, mineral wealth, land, plantations as well as an educated, skilled working force, and above all an illustrious historical past. But, today, we are allowing a tiny minority of people to make a mockery of our nation.

3523 3524

Are we going to step back and slide us into an abyss of hatred and ill will by choosing to adopt a path of no action towards a small band of irresponsible elements in our society? Why should anyone engage in destructive behaviour in the name of religion - sacred Buddhism? After all, that religion, Buddhism, is one of the best things that ever happened to Asia, so much so the learned people of all hues call the great reverent Buddha as the "Light of Asia". Yet, these unruly elements draw the religion to the pavements, I may say, just to instill hatred towards all other minority communities of Hindus, Christians and Muslims, who have come to regard this wonderful isle of Sri Lanka as their country of birth. Do we all have no rights to live in this country? Are we not destined to give our best for the prosperity of our nation and make use of the opportunities for the opulence of the unborn generations? Why have hatred speech and occasional violent behaviours suddenly erupted in the island? Many naive thinkers tend to believe that it is a sponsored movement by some unhidden hands and external forces. So much conspiracy theory abounds as if the sponsors of communal hatred play the agenda of some vested interests to sow discord and disharmony, so as to push back the progress we have achieved since the end of a long ethnic war and just to grab political power. Whatever the case maybe, I cannot overemphasize the fact that because of the latest unpleasant communal hatred sewn in the country led by a handful of monks, many of our cherished political ideals and institutions are facing utter danger, if not collapse. We know that these monks do not have the support of the vast majority of the monks and the Buddhists in this country. Our country has faced more than its share of communal violence in the past, and worst of all, a devastating ethnic war. Are we trying to recover from them or do we want to worsen the already fragile atmosphere prevalent in the island? We are slowly winning the confidence and goodwill of foreign governments. If the current trend of communal infighting is once again highlighted, I do not need to remind you that we are going to be big losers. Our top priority now is nothing but to rebuild the country, strengthen our infrastructure, rejuvenate our education and health sectors, create job opportunities and stand tall in the international community of nations. In short, we must now give priority to development goals. What good is there by rousing communal discord? Will it accomplish redemption for our people and coming generations? By inciting innocent people and spreading lies and untruths about other peoples religion, you may create

mayhem of communal riots, which may well fit into the agenda of those are waiting to grab power. But, what good it can do to our country? If we take one step ahead, we will be forced to take ten steps behind, and you may destroy some property and kill scores of people by arming the goondas to do the job for you. So, what next? In the annals of our history, any and all such past vendettas against the minorities have caused nothing but abyss. Sri Lanka has not stepped forward one bit just because the Tamils and Muslims were attacked, killed, maimed and their properties were destroyed. Neither did these dastardly acts of violence advance the cause of the great religion of Buddhism except it brought bad name to its devoted practitioners and to the country. Let me come directly to my point. Today, the activities and utterances of Bodu Bala Sena and its cohorts have emerged as the greatest challenge to my community, the Muslims. Nay, it is one of the biggest challenges to the very existence of our Government and the State. They cut into the fundamentals of the very basis of our State and the Constitution. Reverend Gnanasara Thero has gone to the extent of hurling scorn on our Parliament, Ministers and even the Head of the State. He is becoming a one man opposition leader of rabid virulence; a one man critic who thinks who poses off as the saviour of the Sinhala people. But, his utterances are steeped in lies, untruths and poisonous ideas which do not fit into our mainstream of liberal viewpoints. But, they can easily mislead the people because they appeal to low emotions as regards allegations against minorities. All in all, the Thero claims as if this country only belongs to the Sinhalese Buddhists and at times he even dares to challenge the other minorities to go home, to their so-called motherland in India or Arabia and so on. Why are we tolerating this nonsense and poisonous statements? Is this not the country of ours, the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims which include the Moors, Malays, Borahs, Memons and others who are born and bred in this country for generations? The Muslim history goes back to as early as the 10th century when they were welcomed with open arms by the historical Sinhalese rulers who considered the Muslims as trustworthy in trade, commerce, international relations et cetera. This country always had benevolent Buddhist rulers who brought great respect to Buddhism world-wide. Did we ask for any special privileges which our Sinhalese brethren do not get? Have we created troubles or destroyed Sinhalese properties? Can we not pursue our religion and grant the same respect to all other religionists who inhabit this Island? Today, we, the Muslims are subjected to ignominious insults. Never before their Prophet and God were subjected to ninda, the blasphemous insult as we witness today. The other day we heard and saw from a

3525 3526

[ ... ]

2016 08

film clip as to how Gnanasara Thero stooped to low level hurling insult of the Muslim God, the Almighty Allah. He dragged Gods name in a most insulting and hateful speech. In any other circumstances, the Muslims react when their God and the Prophet are insulted. Probably, that is what his advisers wanted. They want the Muslims to react violently for the hoodlums following them to commit arson, rape and robberies against the innocent people. We, the Muslim seek political and peaceful solutions to ward off such hate speeches and provocations. We have Constitutional safeguards and criminal laws against hate speeches. Above all, our National Leader, the President, has assured the punishment for hate speech. Let it be anybody. Whether he is a Muslim, a Sinhalese or a Tamil, he must be charged. We believe in our security institutions to secure and maintain peace in this country and among the communities by instantly punishing the wrongdoers so that others would not dare to repeat it. In one sense, the Thero is not insulting just the Muslims, but as I said, the entire gamut of our Government. If anarchy breaks out, it only helps those who want to grab and run in a burning house and those who work for a regime change. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Sir, give me one more minute. As a responsible Government Minister, I urge all forces who love the stability and the prosperity of our country to come forward in droves to stop this mayhem by dangerous and destructive racial inciters. Our security and armed forces are ready to defend the sovereignty and peace of Sri Lanka. Above all, the Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, the Prime Minister and the President in particular must act in time with resolve to nip these unsettling movements in their bud. If not, all of us will be losers. The international community is following on these matters carefully. So, please heed to my call as a senior Minister who has worked hard with all the communities to establish peace in this country. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 5 .

. , , , , . , , . Sir, we talk of unity in diversity. Unity and understanding among the religions is extremely important. If our beautiful country is to achieve economic progress, there must be unity among the followers of the four religions. The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, when he was speaking, said, "The Ministers who have a clear understanding of the sensitivities of each of the religions can play a positive role in creating unity among them. We have four Hon. Ministers, adherents of their respective religions, in-charge of the four Ministries. It is therefore, extremely important that the four Ministers regularly meet and pave the way for unity." Having said that,
