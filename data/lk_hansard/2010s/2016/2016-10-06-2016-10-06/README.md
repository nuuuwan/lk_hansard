I would like to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister about the non-implementation of some of the expressed provisions of the Constitution pertaining to lands. One of the primary difficulties we face is the non-appointment of the National Land Commission. The Hon. Minister must pay heed to this request. We, of course, have the Provincial Land Commissioners and they play a very pivotal role. It was only yesterday that I was at your Ministry - the public day - and I saw what a lot of people come and how harassed you were in resolving their problems. We also understand the type of varied and difficult issues pertaining to livelihood of the people and they face many of them as a result of different regulations and rules that we have imposed in trying to distribute land in an equitable fashion.

The Hon. Member who spoke before me spoke about the inequities when it comes to communities in the Eastern Province. As far as I am concerned, we conducted a mobile service in Attalachchanai, in his own District, a few days ago. We distributed some of the land permits to most of those people who had gone to land kachcheries through the Divisional Secretariats. We spoke to the Government Agents of all the Divisional Secretariats in the Ampara District, particularly in the coastal areas and got it arranged through the Provincial Councils. The Chief Minister was also there. We distributed permits and grants to all community members in all the Divisional Secretariats in the coastal areas of the Ampara District. About 400 such recipients were able to get those allotted lands through the mobile service I conducted under my leadership with the approval of the Ministry as well as the Government Agent and the Provincial Land Commissioner.

Another important factor that we must bear in mind is a salient issue that the Hon. Kaveendiran Kodeeswaran, Member of Parliament, raised a while ago concerning the Forest Departments attitude towards innocent farmers. Now this is a very acute problem all over the country. Everybody who is in this House, I am sure, will agree with me when we say that the Forest Department is now virtually in a new incarnation after the war. During the war none of these people cited any of the forests to preserve them. After the war, the Forest Department is now acting as if they are the guardians of every bush in the country. Even the minor bushes are now declared as "conserved forests" and this has become a big issue. Somewhere in 2006, the former regime had gazetted even the -

[6.01p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity. I must also thank the Hon. Minister of Lands for bringing these Regulations under the Land Acquisition Act. I come from the Puttalam District and I was listening to all the Hon. Members of Parliament speaking about certain problems relating to land, but mine is entirely different.

Sir, the Cement Factory of Holcim (Lanka) Limited operates in Puttalam and I have here with me the Gazette Notification allocating land for that factory. Sir, only 1,900 acres had been allocated to the Holcim (Lanka) Limited, but, today they own 5,200 acres. Sir, that is the real situation. People in that area are suffering because their lands have been acquired by that company, which has not been properly done. Therefore, my plea is, give that company what is due to them - 1,900 acres - and the balance must be taken back. To tell you frankly, 700 acres of LRC land is also included in that 5,200 acres. They started this company 30 years ago. Only 450 acres of limestone remain today. Probably, they have been making use of the other 300 to 400 acres. All land belonging to the LRC as well as to the people have been taken over by them. Sir, I would like to table* this Gazette Notification for you all to go through.

So, give that company whatever extent of land that had been allocated to them and take over the balance for other purposes.

Then, Hon. Minister, the Government had allocated only 1,000 acres in the Kalpitiya area for the Navy and the Air Force to practise target shooting. For the last two to three years, they have taken over almost 3,200 acres. When they start practising shooting, the people in the adjoining villages have to face problems. But, if they stick to the 1,000 acres that had been allocated to them, those problems would not crop up. Now, they have acquired 3,200 acres, which means almost all the land in the surrounding villages have also been taken over. So, please be good enough to look into this matter. That 1,000 acres should be allocated to them and the balance should be given back to the people.

Then, Sir, I would like to say a few words about the issue in Madampe. The Hon. Mujibur Rahuman also spoke about it. In fact, I also went there. There is a plot of land where Muslims are living. Unfortunately, for a place of worship, they are trying take over that land, when there are other lands available: lands belonging to the UC and so on. But, they are trying to take over this particular land. Hon. Minister, I also table* a letter addressed to you as the Hon. Minister of Lands signed by the occupants of that land and will hand over the relevant documents to you, for you to go through and solve this problem.

Then, I would like to mention about the complaint that has always been made against our Leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, that he is taking over land belonging to the Wilpattu National Park; land in Marichchikatti and so on. Since I am from the Electorate next to Mannar, I can assure you that, that particular land in Wilpattu is entirely different from the land abandoned by the villagers 25 years ago. Those villagers who left Mannar 25 years ago have gone back to their own lands, which, by now, have turned into a big forest. Therefore, I can assure you that our Leader, the Hon. Minister Risad Badhiutheen, has not taken over a single plot of land belonging to the Government or to the Wilpattu National Park. Sir, when those people have gone back to their villages, some officials inspected the area and chased them away.

They have been the owners of those lands for the last 300 or 400 years. Therefore, it is with strong evidence that I say that our Leader has not taken over a single plot of land from the Government.

Finally, Hon. Minister, I would like to mention about the Land Reform Commission. The officials of the Commission cover a vast area from Negombo to Puttalam, but unfortunately, they do not have the necessary vehicles. As you are aware, there are so many problems, land matters, to deal with in that area, but they

485 486

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

are unable to move about without vehicles. Therefore, I request you to provide them with necessary vehicles so that they could attend to those problems.

Again, I must thank the Hon. Member for bringing in these Regulations, because there are so many problems. Now in Puttalam, sometimes, the Forest Department or other departments take over the lands of the people. It does not matter. But what has happened is, because, all of a sudden, they have gone and taken over the lands, those people who have been cultivating in that area for so many years - 40, 50 or 60 years - are now unable to cultivate those lands. Therefore, I request you - I am not against the taking over of lands - to allow these people to cultivate those lands, which were owned and cultivated by them. With regard to the land issue involving Holcim Cement Factory, please see to it that these lands are given back to the people.

I thank you, Sir.
