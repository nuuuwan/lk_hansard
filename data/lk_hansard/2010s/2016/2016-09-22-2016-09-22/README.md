( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have five minutes.

[6.15p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. I must also thank the Hon. Minister. I know him for many years. I am very happy that the future of the students who are studying in universities is in your hands. It is not an easy task to look after the students in universities. However, when we compare your work with that of the earlier governments, I think you are doing a great job.

Actually, I want to speak on the private medical university - SAITM. Now, only a very small percentage of the students who get through the GCE (Advanced Level) Examination enter Government universities. The others, even though they are qualified, are unable to enter universities. Then what happens? Their parents spend millions of rupees and send them abroad. Our money is going out. Once they complete their studies in countries like Russia, they come back; sit for Act 16 examination and finally they are taken in. So, if we can allow students to study abroad, come back and sit for Act 16 examination, what is the harm in having a private medical university here? When we do that, definitely, parents who can afford will send their children who could not enter Government universities to those private universities.

Actually, now, there is a shortage of doctors. In Puttalam, in my electorate, there are three hospitals. I had been the Provincial Minister of Health, so I know the problems at those hospitals. Still, in the Kalpitiya Base Hospital, there are not enough doctors. There are not enough doctors in the Karaitivu Hospital also. In the Puttalm Base Hospital there is a shortage of doctors. So, there are problems like this. We cannot take in all the students who are qualified in to the universities. So, we can have not only one private medical university, but many.

993 994

Now, take international schools. When parents do not get a chance to send their children to leading government schools, they send their children to international schools. If we can have international schools for O/Ls and A/Ls, what is the harm in having private medical universities? What is the harm in having universities which can bring out engineers and doctors? So, you will have to think about that. Now, the world is advancing. So, we should not stick to one thing. We did not have this problem 30 - 40 years ago. The population has grown up at such a rate that the Government finds it so difficult to find a solution to this problem.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, just give me two minutes, please. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Minister, I have been following what you have been telling about private universities. Please go ahead. We are with you. This is the biggest problem you are facing today. Now, there are private universities and the Open University is also there. There is a Regional Centre of the Open University in Puttalam where about 13 courses are conducted. Hon. Minister, I have been discussing with you regarding the increase of programmes. Please be good enough to do that, because there are a lot of students who cannot enter State universities and they would be able to do other studies there and come up in life.

There is another problem we face in our area today. Our area is an agricultural area. There are more than 16,000 acres of land that produce agricultural products and we also have the fisheries industry. The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara, State Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training is trying to establish training centres. I need your help to form them in our area also, so that poor people can come up in their life by obtaining proper education.

Thank you Minister of Higher Education. Whatever decision you take on the SAITM, private medical college, we are with you. Go ahead with that decision. You have to establish not only one medical college but more private medical colleges to produce more doctors in future. So, more students can come up in their lives.

Thank you.

PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE SYRIAN CONFLICT

[6.23p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mujibur Rahuman) Hon. Presiding Member, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

"The Arab uprising started in December 2010 in Tunisia. By the end of February 2012, longstanding rulers had been forced from power in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Civil uprising had erupted in Bahrain and Syria and protests had broken out in a dozen other Arab countries.

Except for Tunisia, the Arab peoples cries and struggles for freedom and democracy have either been brutally suppressed or have resulted in civil war involving major global and regional powers. The price has been paid mostly by the civilians, the ordinary people whose lives have been devastated.

The situation in the Middle East has rarely been as desperate as it is today. We see large-scale civilian suffering in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Palestine.

Two weeks ago, in a briefing to the Security Council, the Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Stephen OBrien, said that the suffering in Aleppo, once Syrias commercial epicenter, was the apex of horror.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! .. .

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) , .. .

. . Question put, and agreed to.

) .. .

, , .. .

Whereupon THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA left the Chair, and THE HON. J.M. ANANDA KUMARASIRI took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Mujibur Rahuman) The situation in Syria continues to be one of unspeakable suffering for the Syrian people who are killed, forced to survive under bombs or flee to less-ravaged areas. Estimates range from 250,000 to 500,000 killed in the five-year old Syrian war. The ongoing civil war has created more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees dispersed in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan Lebanon and Turkey and 6.6 million Internally Displaced Persons as of 2015. Syria has 160,000 stateless persons as of 2015.

UN humanitarian agencies and partners are currently operating within a very large humanitarian response plan which calls for US Dollars 3.2 billion in funding and of which just 33 per cent has been received as of August.

In this hour of urgency and need, we, as the Sri Lankan Government should stand by the ordinary Syrian people and call on the international community to bring a halt to the violence and gross violation of human rights that is taking place in the Middle East especially in Syria. It is unfortunate that recent talks between the United States and Russia on Syria have failed to bring about positive results.

So, I propose that this House call on the global powers and the international community to take immediate steps to address the urgent humanitarian situation and get all parties of the conflict agree to a peaceful resolution to the conflict which ensures freedom, justice and prosperity to the Syrian people."

Thank you, very much.

[6.27p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you Hon. Presiding Member. Actually, I must thank the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman for bringing in this Motion at a time like this. Thousands of children are homeless today. There are thousands of women living without their husbands, who have been killed by this devastating war.

I would like to go back to the history of this crisis. When you think of all the Middle East countries, actually they were very peaceful. Those countries were rich and they were helping almost all the poor countries. There were not many problems. They had great leaders. Take for instance people like late Muhammad Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein and Hafez al-Assad. Those countries were doing very well; people were looked after very well and they were helping almost all the poor countries. But, today, what is their position?

In 1976, I can remember, we had the Non-Aligned Summit in Sri Lanka. Almost all the leaders of the Middle East countries came to Sri Lanka and they took part in that Summit. After that, they started helping us by providing employment to our youth. Today, I must say, it is from the Middle East countries that we get the maximum amount of foreign exchange. This was the situation earlier on.

I can remember, the big countries that were against Saddam Hussein said that he was having mass destructive weapons. Then there was a war organized by the people against him. But once the war was over and once he was killed, did they find these mass destructive weapons? Where were his planes? After that, they started to attack Muammar Gaddafi. The same problem was there. Finally, what happened was they took away their oil and wealth and these countries are suffering today. Hafez al- Assad was one of the best leaders in the Arab countries. What happened to him? They got rid of him. Today, his country is suffering. Who are suffering most are the poor people. They are homeless. As the Hon. Member said, millions of people are suffering.

Now, when you take the Syrian war, 5,000 people were killed; 4 million refugees are in the adjoining countries; over 6 million people were internally displaced and over 150,000 were made stateless.

We had a war here for 30 years. So, we can understand their difficulties. We know the problems that we face even today. How many people were displaced? How many people were murdered? The same situation has arisen there to people who have been helping us.

What happened in Turkey? They tried their best, but unfortunately they could not achieve what they wanted. The people of Turkey got together and they saved their country. Why are all these things happening? The reason is, they want the oil of these countries to be successful.

They want these people to be under them. They want to sell their weapons, arms and ammunition to these countries. But, they are not at all worried about the poor people. Today, what is happening? When you go to those countries, you can see how many people are homeless today and how many people are suffering. If the husband is alive, the wife is not there. Thousands and thousands of young men and women have become widowers and widows. All these things are done just to get their money, their oil and to sell their arms.

Take Palestine for instance. We, as Muslims, know that the two biggest Mosques are in Mecca and Medina and the third biggest Mosque is Al-Aqsa in Palestine. Today, we are unable to go there. The people of Palestine are suffering today. They are unable to move about and in their own country and they are getting killed. When we go through the newspapers, we can see such things are happening at the moment also. If a young chap throws a stone at a soldier, he gets killed. Now this is the position there. Today, we are unable to go to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

Therefore, I think, this is a very timely Motion. Our Government must also pay attention to this. What we have been facing for the last 30 years should not happen to those countries, which have been helpful to us and which have been with us when we were in difficulty. When we were short of something, there were so many countries which helped us. I can remember especially those Arab countries helped us and looked after us. Today also they are prepared to help us.

Therefore, I would like to second this Motion and request our Government to take this forward and draw the attention of the big leaders to bring peace to Syria.

Thank you.

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, let me at the outset thank you for permitting me the Floor of this House to share in my capacity as the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, the views of the Government on this important Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman, Member from the Colombo District, seconded by National List Member, the Hon. Mohamed Navavi and also supported by the Hon. Ishak Rahuman from the Anuradhapura District and the Hon. Sandith Samarasinghe from Kegalle District.

Even though I do not necessarily agree with everything that was said by the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman of the origins of ISIS, I do not intend to go into that matter at this point. To get to the substance of the Hon. Rahumans Adjournment Motion, let me tell you that Sri Lanka maintains a longstanding and cordial friendship with the countries in the Middle East. Our relations encompass both people to people contacts as well as active measures for mutually beneficial economic and commercial collaborations. Therefore, the prevailing situation in the Middle East region is a matter of serious concern to the Government and the people of Sri Lanka.

Mr. Presiding Member, the growing threat of terrorism and radicalism has added to the complexities of the violent situation in the region. The longstanding conflict in the region is the Israel-Palestine conflict as mentioned here. That remains strained with the peace talks suspended for over two years now. The situation appears to be getting worse as the violence in the region has escalated over the period due to the absence of a credible peace mechanism.

Sri Lanka firmly believes that the unresolved issues of Palestine remain a serious threat to international peace, security and sustainability. Therefore, it is imperative that a comprehensive and just settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict remains a priority of the international community.

Mr. Presiding Member, Sri Lankas articulated position on Palestine is; Only a negotiated settlement between the parties to the conflict, leading to an

1003 1004

independent and democratic state of Palestine based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 1397 and 1515 with East Jerusalem as its capital, existing side-by-side with Israel could bring peace and stability to the region.

Sri Lanka has since 1968, as Chair of the United Nations Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, been one of the most significant voices at the United Nations on the subject of the unfortunate conditions of the occupied territories.

Sri Lanka also supports Palestines application for admission as a full member in the United Nations.

Sri Lanka strongly believes that the two-state solution is the only viable option for sustainable peace and stability in the region. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the two conflicting parties to ensure that they move closer into a solution rather than moving away from it. Towards this end, Sri Lanka stands with the others in emphasizing that the international community must be firm and consistent in its resolve to assist the people of both sides. Continued commitment of Sri Lanka towards the Palestine cause and Sri Lankas friendship with the people of Palestine is reflected in the continuous engagement with the Palestinian leadership.

Mr. Presiding Member, escalation of violence in Syria has brought sufferings to the Syrian people and seriously affected peace and stability in the Middle East region. According to the UN, the ongoing conflict in Syria has claimed more than 250,000 lives, while over 6 million people have been internally displaced and 4.8 million Syrians have left the country. As a result, Syria now constitutes the largest refugee population in the world - 2.1 million in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon and 2.7 million in Turkey. Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about the situation in Syria and firmly believes that a political settlement is the only realistic way out of the Syrian crisis.

Sri Lanka welcomes the recent peace initiative on Syria effective from 12th September 2016, initiated by the US and Russia after months of negotiations. Even though the UN was compelled to suspend all its aid convoys in Syria after the devastating attack on its aid convoy near Aleppo on 19th September 2016, we firmly believe that the key players of the Syrian peace process will take appropriate action to strengthen the already initiated peace process when they meet in New York this week on the side-lines of the UN General Assembly.

It may be noted that Sri Lanka voted in favour of the UN Resolution on Syria entitled, Situation of Human Rights in the Syrian Arab Republic adopted at the UN General Assembly on 23rd December, 2015 promoted by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and co-sponsored by 61 countries.

Sir, according to the United Nations, over 10,000 people have been killed due to the devastating situation in Yemen during the last 18 months. Over one million have been displaced and approximately 14 million out of the 26 million population need food aid and seven million are suffering from food insecurity in Yemen, as earlier mentioned by the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman. It is unfortunate that the long-running negotiations to end the conflict in Yemen, between the Government forces, backed by an Arab coalition and Houthi rebels have failed without a solution. Sri Lanka is of the firm belief that all the conflicting parties involved in the devastating situation in Israel, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and other countries in the Region should amicably resolve to find consensus-based solutions.

Sir, Sri Lanka welcomes any efforts that will reinforce and strengthen internal domestic processes and efforts aimed at finding durable solutions to internal crisis through international cooperation and dialogue while respecting national sovereignty and independence of the country and its territorial integrity. Sri Lanka is, therefore, of the view that any measures envisaged by the international community should be constructive and develop in cooperation with the respective countries with a view to enhancing its capacity to resolve the crisis. Therefore, such action thus contemplated, should be fundamentally aimed at safeguarding the civilian population. Sri Lanka also urges the respective governments to take all appropriate measures to ensure safety of their civilians.

In conclusion, Sir, may I once again reiterate with all emphasis at my command that Sri Lanka desires nothing but the best for the affected people of the Middle East Region. We, therefore, are very clear that the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the countries affected should be fully respected. Our stance is in full consonance with the principles of nonalignment. It is our fervent hope that peace and stability will be restored in the Region at the earliest possible.

Once again, I thank the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman for having brought in this Adjournment Motion and giving us an opportunity to state the official position of Sri Lanka in this context.

Thank you very much.
