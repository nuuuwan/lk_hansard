( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Speaker, the Hon. Chief Minister has denied making those statements. He has denied it. It is very unfair of you to raise this issue once he has denied this. -[Interruption.] Please let me speak. Please sit down! ..[ ]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the House, you go ahead. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ., , . .He has denied it.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Now, Hon. Member, you have raised that. We will ask the Hon. Prime Minister to give a reply. .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . .[] .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, the Hon. Prime Minister will give a reply to that.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes, the Hon. Prime Minister will reply to this. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. Leader of the Opposition, please. ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Sir, I do not want to make this matter controversial. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, we did not participate in this event and we had good reasons for not participating

57 58

in this event. We are presently engaged in discussing with this Government various matters and we would like a consensus to be arrived at amongst all of us in regard to all those matters and for the matters to be resolved on the basis of consensual arrangements, discussion and dialogue.

But of course at the same time, the people living in the Northern Province, Jaffna in particular and also in the Eastern Province, have undergone immense difficulties over a long period of time and they have various grievances; some of which are very justified and some of which need to be addressed very urgently. I have complained in this House on a number of occasions that I am dissatisfied with the pace at which the Government is functioning and that the Government must do those things more expeditiously.

Sir, in so far as this event is concerned, I think, Mr. Vigneswaran's speech is in print and it came on the electronic media. I do not think that he said all the things that are being attributed to him. In fact, subsequently, he has denied having made those statements that are attributed to him. I think, I must say this in fairness to him, because he is not here. He is a very responsible person. He is the Chief Minister of the Northern Province duly elected by the people of the Northern Province. He is a retired judge of the Supreme Court. He was elected by the people of the Northern Province by a very substantial majority. And when he says that he did not make the statements attributed to him, before he is once again hauled over the coals, I think, one should verify and try to ascertain the true position. I have read his speech in Tamil, I studied his speech in Tamil, and I am of the view that many of the statements that are attributed to him were not made by him and are not contained in that speech. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much Hon. Leader of the Opposition. -[Interruption.] I do not want to have a debate on this, please. We have already passed the time. -[Interruption.] I have allowed the Opposition to talk about it. Then I gave the opportunity to the Government.

SABHA FOR ODDUCHUDAN: STATEMENT BY

MINISTER OF PROVINCIAL COUNCILS AND

LOCAL GOVERNMENT

( ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Sir, this is the reply to the Question raised by the Hon. Douglas Devananda under Standing Order 23(2) on 07.07.2016.

1. Yes.

2. A number of requests had been forwarded to this Ministry on the constitution of local authorities and former Ministers of Provincial Councils and Local Government have appointed committees at provincial level to submit recommendations on some of them. I have observed that although committee recommendations have been received on such proposals, gazette notifications have not been published on constitution and upgrading of local authorities.

Further, some instances of constitution of new local authorities and upgrading of local authorities without any basis have been reported to me. However, it was observed that a proper methodology has not been followed and general criteria have not been recognized or applied for the constitution of local authorities up to now.

Hence, it was apparent that specific criteria are required for constitution and upgrading of local authorities. Therefore, I appointed an Expert Committee with the chairmanship of Mr. Chandaka Jayasundara, Attorney-at-law, and the officers of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Department of Census and Statistics, Department of Survey and some of the Attorneys-at-law to develop criteria for this and the report of the said Committee is to be submitted to me on 15.10.2016.

The constitution and upgrading of local authorities, in future, would be based on the criteria developed on the recommendations of the said Committee. Hence, the proposal submitted to this Ministry would be considered based on those criteria and the proposal for the constitution of Odduchudan Pradeshiya Sabha also can be decided upon based on the said criteria.

3. Does not arise.

4. Requests have not been submitted to this Ministry on alteration of these boundaries.

5. Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .

201604

[3.08 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me an opportunity to speak on these two Bills that have been presented - one to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure and the other to amend the provisions of the Law Commission.

With regard to the Code of Criminal Procedure, we welcome the amendment that has been moved, to make it easier for the owners of movable properties,that are said to have been involved in commission of crimes, to have them released. This has been a serious problem anywhere in the country. If you go to any Magistrates Court, you will find, so many vehicles, furniture and various items lying around rusting, of no use to anyone, because those are said to be productions in cases that are being heard. Laws delays being what it is, those can never be used again when the case is over. So, there is already a provision and I believe, the Government will move a Committee Stage amendment as well to make it two months instead of six months as has been stated in this Bill - for owners to make this application - to have them released.

I have had an experience of a friend of mine whose gas cylinder was once stolen. Because of space issues, the gas cylinder was released to him with the warning that every day when the case came up he must bring the gas cylinder to the court. So, I found this friend of mine taking the gas cylinder to court. As we all know, the gas cylinder changes. It becomes empty and it is replaced by another cylinder and so on and so forth. So, every three months, when the case came up, it was a different cylinder that he had. But he dutifully took it to court; whichever the cylinder that he kept, he dutifully hired a trishaw and took it to court, little realizing what the intention of that warning was. When I asked him about it one day, he said, No, I was told to bring the cylinder and I am taking it. So, each time, it was a different cylinder. This poor chap hired vehicles and took it to court. So, sometimes, no one really knows what the objective of these provisions that we have is. Mechanically we go through these processes which does not really mean anything. So, I welcome this move to make the procedure easy for persons to have their properties released.

Talking on the Code of Criminal Procedure amendments, since the Hon. Minister of Justice is still present in the Chamber, I wish to bring to the notice of the House, the other amendment about which serious concerns have been raised all around the country. It was on the Order Paper two weeks ago, but was not presented to the House. I am sure the Hon. Minister of Justice, having been a key member of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka - its President, in fact - is also aware of the background to the present provision where there is a circular sent by the Inspector-General of Police, which states from the time of arrest, a suspect is entitled to the services of an attorney-at-law. As to how this came about

was when that was denied to an attorney-at-law - I believe, in the Bambalapitiya Police Station - when an attorney-at-law was ridiculed, a fundamental rights application was filed. It was in that case certain arrangements were arrived at and the Supreme Court also looked into the matter and advised that suitable provisions with regard to attendance of attorneys-at-law be made more certain. The Bar Association also intervened in that case and after several drafts, a circular which was approved by the Supreme Court was sent by the Inspector General of Police which is in force today; which enables any person arrested to have access to an attorney-at-law.

There is a lot of misunderstanding with regard to this particular right. Some people, particularly, the police think, that the attorney-at-law will interfere in the course of investigation and in the course of the suspects first statement being recorded and so on. Having access to a lawyer who can advise a suspect of his rights is very different to that attorney-at-law having the right to interfere or meddle while the police question the suspect or even record his statement. Both are different roles. I have had to play this role at times, very rarely though, but I think it is being implemented well. You advise the suspect so arrested, but you stay well away when his statement is recorded and you do not interfere. If that needs to be clarified, that can be clarified rather than take away that right which has now come to be practised and relegate it to a time beyond the recording of the statement of the suspect. Because as we know, it is up to the recording of the statement that various violations take place. Everyone here knows how the police extract statements. It is to guard against this that the present practice was brought in.

I would urge the Hon. Minister of Justice and Minister of Buddhasasana - I know he made a statement recently with regard to the rights of the victims of crimes and I think both do not contradict each other. The victims of crimes do have rights and that must be protected. But, that does not mean that you can allow investigators to ride roughshod over suspects who also have rights and access to legal counsel from the time of arrest. It is a necessary right that must be guaranteed.

When the country is in the process of democratization, some of these rights have been highlighted as important rights. The country is trying to regain the GSP Plus concession and you will find that this is one of the key conditions attached to that. It is not only that. Because of the abuses that happen, the State must take these steps and that also brings me to another piece of legislation that will replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which is said to be ready now to be presented. When it is repealed, and serious concerns -

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, may I -

85 86

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Minister.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, in response to the Hon. Sumanthiran, I would just like to make a clarification. As both of us are aware, while being in the Bar Association, especially during the tenure of my presidency and prior to that, there had been some unpleasant incidents reported from the police stations such as the lawyers have been ridiculed and sometimes they have even been attacked. Taking all these into consideration and also as a result of the FR Application in the Supreme Court, we were able to get the assistance of the Judiciary as well as the assistance of the Attorney-Generals Department and the police to make some ad hoc arrangements - that was an administrative arrangement.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Accordingly, there was a circular issued by the Inspector General of Police to all the police stations to permit the legal representations - to meet or advise the suspects in the police custody. Now, the problem was that it was not a statutorily recognized right; that was an ad hoc arrangement. The basic understanding, even after discussing with various international organizations and various other stakeholders, is that we agreed in principle that we will have to recognize that right in the statute. As a result of that only this Amendment came in. Then, of course, there was a lengthy discussion with law enforcement authorities at what stage that the access should be permitted. There were various views. The Department of Police, the Attorney-Generals Department and so many other agencies were finally of the view that if that access is given before the recording of the first statement, there can be some prejudice to the victims and there can also be some obstacles for the administration of justice. But, finally there had been some consensus that it should be done after the recording of the first statement.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am thankful to the Hon. Minister for that clarification and I am aware of this. But, may I suggest that when you have it in this particular form, the time at which that access can be afforded is also not certain. If it is 48 hours before going to the magistrate, the police can say, Tell the lawyer that we have still not recorded his statement. For two days, they may not allow him to have access to the lawyer. Just prior to him being taken to the magistrate, the statement may be recorded and it is during those times that all the abuse take place.

I do concede that the police or the investigators will face certain difficulties. If that is the case, why do we not clarify it - that the lawyer cannot interfere or the lawyer cannot be present by the side of the accused when the statement is recorded rather than deny access entirely until such time as the statement is recorded. I will leave it to the Hon. Minister. He will probably discuss it before the Bill is presented again.

With regard to the other piece of legislation that will replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act also, serious concerns have been raised. I am aware that the Law Commission was asked by the Government to make a draft. I was interviewed by the Law Commission and so were several people separately and together. I believe that the draft has been made available to the Government; I have not seen that draft, but some draft has been made available to the Government. I am aware that that draft has been put in the dustbin. With persons who are mostly from the security establishment, another draft has been made. From information available, it seems to suggest that the one that is coming will be worse than the one that you are repealing. With preventive detention; with confessions made admissible; all of those draconian, objectionable provisions are still being retained.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am saying this today, well in advance of the draft coming out. If the information that I have is true, we are going to have very serious issues. The Hon. Minister knows the assurance that has been given to repeal this piece of legislation. When that comes out and if it is going to just come back with another name, that is going to have a severe repercussion on the Government. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake. You have 12 minutes.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) , .

I am thankful to the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara for the matters raised. What he said is exactly correct. According to our law, bail is the rule; rejection is the exception. When you go to a court, bail is granted. Whereas a person who has committed a similar offence - identical offence - when he goes to the next court, just behind the other wall, bail is not granted. One court grants bail and the other does not. So, there is a very serious confusion in the minds of the general public.
