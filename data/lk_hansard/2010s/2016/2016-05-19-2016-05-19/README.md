They are fugitives of Sri Lanka at the moment. So, why is the INTERPOL not asking them about those fugitives? They should have questioned Mahinda Rajapaksa when he came back to Katunayake. So, these are things on which we would like to ensure clarity and confirmation. Therefore, I hope the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption uses the money allocated by Parliament in the correct manner for that type of prospective activities. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) One of your Ministers has made a complaint to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. But, that is not being investigated. I am referring to the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweeras complaint. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I beg your pardon? ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera has made a complaint to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. That is not being investigated. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why not? Every single case - [Interruption.] That is why they wanted the money allocated. We have allocated more money because they say they do not have enough staff. This is what we inherited. There had been a Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption in name only. There were more people working outside than in the Commission. So, now we have fortified that: we have ensured that 70 new staff have come in; they have got the vehicles; there is computerization and that all the things required have been provided with to ensure that all those involved in bribery and corruption are brought to justice irrespective of whether they are in the Opposition or in the Government. All we want to do is to ensure that we walk the talk. So, that is the difference.

Sir, I basically look forward to the fullest support of Parliament in order to ensure that we get these Items approved and I am also sure that those would be unanimously approved without any vote because all these are for the collective good of the country. All I could say is that we are financially well-disciplined. Every rupee that is earned in this country is being spent on Capital Expenditure and not on Recurrent Expenditure. We are going through some turbulent times at this moment for no other reason than the brought forward and not the carry forward. We can only say that during the tenure of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe we will ensure there is financial discipline, the growth factor takes place and that we will once again integrate into the world as a country or a force to reckon with in the SAARC Region.

So, I look forward to everybodys support to ensure that we get our economy back in good order. Let us stop colourizing the economy. We want to make a national economy. That is why we have a National Government. The voice of just a handful of people - 30 or 40 - who have basically missed a step and gone in different directions is not sufficient to offload us on the journey we have embarked to put Sri Lanka back in good order. So, I look forward to everyones support to ensure that we will make a new economy for Sri Lanka before too long. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I do not want to disturb the Hon. Member in any way. What I want to ask is, is there any way that we could finish this Session early, for the simple reason that people are saying we are not in our electorates at a time when there is heavy flooding. So, I would greatly appreciate if the Opposition can look at finishing the Session around 11.30 a.m. or so because people are asking where the Members of Parliament in those relevant electorates are. There are Hon. Members from Colombo North, Kolonnawa, Avissawella, Aranayaka in Kegalle here. Really, it was the Hon. Kabir Hashim who reminded me this. So, I would urge you, Hon. Speaker, if you can accommodate this, it would be wonderful. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, several requests came to me. In fact, I thought of discussing this in the afternoon at the Party Leaders Meeting because it is up to the House. So, if the House decides by all means- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you can finish by 1 o'clock - we have got Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka to speak and I am sure the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane may also want to speak - it would be greatly appreciated because this is national-oriented. Otherwise, we are shouting in Parliament while people are languishing, when their houses are 8 to 10 feet under water. It is not ethical. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena also spoke to me and made the same request. So, we will see what we can do. I will also ask the Secretary-General to - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane wants to speak and we have got Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka due to speak. I am sure all others will concede to our request. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Bandula Gunawardane what would you think? ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , 10 15 . . , . .
