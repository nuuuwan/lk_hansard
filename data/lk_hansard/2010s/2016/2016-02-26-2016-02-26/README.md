Hon. Presiding Member, fish production in Sri Lanka is a very critical component of our nations economy, contributing around 1.8 per cent of the GDP, of which the Eastern Province contributes 27 per cent of the total fish production in Sri Lanka - one of the largest contributors overall in the sector itself. Of this, the Batticaloa District is the primary producer of fish production, with nearly 32 per cent of its populace engaged in the industry.

At this juncture, Hon. Presiding Member, it is noteworthy to highlight that the centric factor is primarily the sheer potential of the fishing industry and the communities in which it is ensconced upon coupled with their work ethic in the Batticaloa District is unmatched. With its abundance of waterways and fishing grounds, both coastal and inland, it is indeed a haven for all engaged in the industry.

In the aftermath of the 26th December tsunami and the cessation of hostilities in 2009, there was a renewed hope amongst the fishing communities for development and upliftment of their livelihoods after 30 long years. However, Hon. Presiding Member, the economical and infrastructural developments in the fishing sector, particularly in the Battacaloa District, have been scarce, with there being negligible developments and effective economic empowerment programmes not being directed primarily towards the fishing communities to this date. The fishing communities resident within the Batticaloa District whose aspirations gradually diminished, now yet again have renewed a sense of euphoria and hope with our new Government in place.

Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to highlight a few of the shortcomings faced by the fishing communities, and also in addition, provide tangible proposals to ensure and uplift the development of the fishing industry in the Batticaloa District.

At present, the Valaichenai Fishing Harbour is the sole adequately equipped fishing facility in Batticaloa. However, this harbour is equipped only to service a mere 50 boats per day, with there being close to 450 boats plying in the vicinities of the harbour. This creates huge shortcomings to the fishermen and the communities dependent on the sector, as the remaining boats have to fend for themselves to find appropriate landing sites and the necessary infrastructure to service their trade. In addition, the renowned fishing grounds of Eravur, Punnakudah, Chaukadi, Kaluvankerny and Palayadithona, which have proven production yields that exceed other areas in the District, let alone the country, are not adequately or effectively equipped to service the fishermen domiciled in the area.

Another pertinent issue is that due to the fishing communities native to the area being economically

underprivileged and the sparse and inequality of regulations and policies being in place, these communities are compelled to compete with the migrant seasonal fishermen, primarily from the South, who take over the waters in their multi-day boats, and due to having been bestowed with comparatively advanced and innovative technologies, tend to overshadow and overpower the innocent and far less-able native fishermen and unfortunately do so by forgoing legal permission. It is imperative that the relevant authorities look into introducing policies to regulate the quantum of migrant seasonal fishermen entering the waters of native fishermen as it creates a significant, no less severe, disparity in the economical outlook and development of the native fishing communities in Batticaloa and the Eastern Province.

It is important to note that these sweeping policy changes should not discourage the migrant seasonal fishermen from fishing in the Eastern Province, but it should regulate their presence, and on the contrary it should in fact develop and provide efficient and adequate packages to develop and equip the native fishing communities to fish competitively on par with those who migrate seasonally to the area.

Hence, in addition to the policy reform it is also imperative to include tangible developments pertaining to infrastructural and singular empowerment programmes to ably equip these fishing communities to uplift their livelihoods. These fishing communities are so harshly deprived, that they lack even adequate fishing nets to trap their catch, let alone the provision of multi-day boats via adequate financing programmes to suit their income. In addition, the other supportive facilities are minimal or non-existent. Even the sole ice factory in Kallady is non-operational for an extended period of time, despite numerous appeals for this to be looked into.

In addition, Punnakudah Bay is renowned as a natural harbour, and at present it is, in fact, used as an effective ad hoc landing site for communities in the vicinity. I propose that the officials look into this very fact, and assess if credible advances could be made towards in fact accommodating Punnakudah as a fishing harbour as well.

Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to bring to the attention of this House that this is in fact sheer oversight or negligence on the part of the authorities and the respective officials in the past that have led to the deprivation of our countrys best fishing grounds. This House has to be made aware of the fact that should we effectively exploit resources that are readily present. Sri Lanka as a whole can be on the road towards economic freedom and self-sufficiency. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana Seyed) The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the very capable Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development brings a sense of renewed hope to the fishing communities in Batticaloa, and the Hon. Dilip Wedaarachchi, the State Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, would in fact be personally aware of the ground situation in Batticaloa having lived and studied a significant part of his childhood in Batticaloa, and also hailing from a family that was involved in the fishing industry in Batticaloa. I request very strongly that the Hon. Minister and the relevant officials, ensure and enact their respective offices to allow the upliftment and growth of the fishing communities in the Batticaloa District.

Thank you. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera - Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development) , ? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 9 . [.. 6.20] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera) 20 . . . , .
