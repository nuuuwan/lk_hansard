[10.13a.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, the Hon. Speaker.

This Budget has been presented by the current National Alliance Government comprising of the two main political parties in this country - the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headed by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the United National Party headed by the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs. The Cabinet of Ministers comprises of representatives of both political parties.

It is the objective of these two political parties to give the country a new future - not merely economically but also politically and socially. That indeed was the verdict of the country at both the Presidential Election held in January, 2015 and the Parliamentary Election held in September, 2015. The former regime and its leadership were prominent participants in both those electoral contests. They sought at both elections a further mandate to govern the country. The mandate so sought by them was denied by the people. The people, in the exercise of their sovereignty, have given President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the mandate to govern the country for a period of time as stipulated in the Constitution. That is the sovereign verdict of the people which can only be dislodged in accordance with the Constitution and in no other way. Everybody in this country wants this country to be governed in keeping with the tenets of genuine democracy. These values, the Hon. Speaker, are sacred and need to be protected and preserved.

I want, Sir, in this regard to quote from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations to which we have acceded. May I quote Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:

"1. Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.

2. Everyone has the right to equal access to public service in his country."

Unfortunately, that rule is not observed in Sri Lanka, particularly as far as the Tamil people are concerned.

The subparagraph (3) states, I quote:

The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.

That is what, Sir, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contains in regard to the will of the people and the consent of the people in regard to the governance of a

1411 1412

2016 17

country. The will of the people as expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage shall be the basis of the authority of Government and that Mr. Speaker, is manifestly clear. In terms of our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, the term of office of Parliament and the President unless earlier terminated lawfully, in keeping with the Constitution, is six years. Under the Nineteenth Amendment, which the President was instrumental in introducing in Parliament, he reduced the term of office of the President to five years though he had been elected by the people for a period of six years. Through the Nineteenth Amendment which was passed in Parliament after the Presidential Election held on 08th January, 2015, the term of office of the President was reduced to five years.

The Hon. Minister of Finance, in the course of his Budget Speech, defined this Governments economic, political and social vision. May I read paragraph No. 2 of his speech. Sir, this is what he stated, I quote:

We will continue to progress in the noble endeavor to strengthen democracy, fundamental rights, reconciliation and development for lasting peace, freedom and national integration. Fundamentally, the country is guided by a new vision of lasting peace, built on mutual respect and dialogue. To cement this process, we have formulated an ambitious reforms agenda encompassing all major spheres including social, political, economic and international relations. This national government of Yahapalanaya will focus on reforms to the constitution, restoration and strengthening of the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.

The vision of the Government, Sir, in my respectful statement, has been very lucidly stated in the statement made by the Minister of Finance in the course of his Budget Speech. Sir, the Government, as I said earlier, is committed to giving this country a new economic, political and social future. We are, for the first time, seeking to evolve a Constitution with the consent of the two main political parties, which alternatively have ruled this country from the time we attained Independence. It has been either the United National Party or the Sri Lanka Freedom Party which have ruled this country from the time we attained Independence and there is a joint effort now for these two parties to come together to frame a Constitution for this country with the consent of other political parties and the people of this country.

This, Sir, is something new which had not happened before. It will be based on the maximum possible consensus within the framework of a single, undivided and indivisible country. We have had three Constitutions earlier. The first Constitution in 1947 was framed at Independence by our colonial rulers. The second Constitution in 1972 was framed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and its left alliance partners without the consent of the other major political party, the United National Party, or the political party substantially representing the Tamil people. The third Constitution was enacted in 1978 framed by the United National Party without the consent of the other major political party - the Sri Lanka Freedom Party -or the political party substantially representing the Tamil people. In other words, Sir, both the 1972 Constitution and the 1978 Constitution were partisan and framed by one single

political party with a few alliance partners, without the consent of the other major political party in the country and more particularly, without the consent or the consensus of the Tamil party substantially representing the Tamil people in this country at those points of time.

It is anticipated that, for the first time, within the framework of a single, undivided and indivisible country, a Constitution evolved on the basis of a wide consensus, will emerge and that this Constitution will reflect the will of all the people in this country, and be the basis of the authority of Government as stated in Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For the first time, Sir, in the history of this country the political party substantially representing the Tamil people - that is the Party which I happen to belong to, the Tamil National Alliance - particularly in the North and the East of this country, will be a party to the Constitution-making process. This would enable the realization of the future vision for this country as enunciated in Para 2 of Part I of the Budget Speech of the Minister of Finance.

Mr. Speaker, I might say a few words on the Budget. Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion has been the theme of the Budget speech. This, Sir, I think is an arduous task.

Growth is difficult when you are neck deep in debt. Our debt stock, according to the statement made by the Finance Minister, is a little over Rs. 9 trillion and a very substantial part of our income, I think almost 90 per cent of our income, goes into debt servicing.

It will be relevant, Sir, for the country to know how such debt was incurred: losses incurred by State-owned enterprises; vast expenditure on massive so-called development projects; for personal kudos which have turned out to be white elephants; infrastructure development at exorbitant cost frequently at more than double the real cost; corruption; extravagance and waste. These are the factors that have contributed to the massive debt that this country has incurred. It may be good for the country to know the truth. When you have to service excessive debt, growth and development is not easy. Important sectors such as education, health and agriculture will inevitably receive much less than what they would be entitled to.

The Government has ambitious programmes to accelerate growth. The Government plans to enter into Free Trade Agreements with several counties - India, China, Singapore, South Korea and several other countries. The Government hopes to receive a great deal of foreign direct investment. One must acknowledge that the world is friendly towards Sri Lanka today: very different from the past and our expectations could therefore materialize.

If that happens, we would manufacture and export to countries with large markets and to other countries too and we should concentrate on enhancing our exports. Traditional exports such as tea, rubber and coconut have declined. We should restore and improve on our earlier performance.

1413 1414

Our garment industry has done well. We should explore new markets for export in different fields. Our Embassies could play an effective role in identifying such markets. We should enter markets close by. I had earlier urged that India was very much in need of various types of pulses and that we should produce such pulses in large quantity and export same to India. That could indeed be a large market.

We do not seem to appreciate the value of our being an Island surrounded by the sea. We do not seem to be fully exploiting our fisheries resources. Properly developed and properly utilized this resource should be one of our biggest exports. We have several lagoons in many parts of this country. We have several lagoons in the Eastern Province particularly in Batticaloa. We do not seem to be exploiting these resources at all. This together with our maritime fisheries is an area that needs careful study and the evolution of programmes of action aimed at export. I do think that there is much potential for export in this area.

We should take lessons from other countries that have developed. Take for example Singapore. After Singapore attained independence, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister, stated that he wanted to develop Singapore on the model of Sri Lanka. He was so happy with the development taking place in Sri Lanka at that point of time. Where has Singapore gone and where are we today? I do not think that our per capita income is equal to one tenth of that of a Singaporean.

Germany was a country, Sir, devastated by the war. In fact, Germany was divided into four parts. One part was controlled by the United States of America; one part by the United Kingdom; one part by France and one part by USSR. The country was divided into four parts. Sometime later, the three parts controlled by the USA, the UK and France came together and the Russian part and the part controlled by the Western powers remained separate for a long period of time. There was the Berlin Wall which came down only about one and half decades ago dividing East Germany and West Germany. Today how extensive is the development they have achieved?

Japan was destroyed by the war. Japan developed after the war. Today, these countries are amongst the biggest economies in the world. Sir, they are not miracles. They are success stories. Commitment to principles and values, intelligent planning, firm implementation, commitment to progress and success are the reasons for the success in these countries. That, Sir, is patriotism. Patriotism is not promoting exclusion, division and tension within the country so as to survive politically and in the process, derive the maximum personal benefits. This country can be turned around and made a different country. What is required is commitment, honesty and hard work. Our services need to be revamped. Firstly, the Public Service. The Public Service seems to have lost its way. The will to perform at optimum efficiency seems to be absent. Whether this is due to politicization and the Public Service being divided into camps, I do not know. That

there has been political meddling is a fact. There is a need to re-energize the Public Service by inculcating in them a sense of duty to the country. Some remedial action needs to be taken. It should not be merely cosmetic. There needs to be deep introspection and the formulation of a programme through which they can be reactivated to serve the country. The Public Service is an important and a valuable instrument in Government activity. We can allow it to further deteriorate only at our own peril. The same applies to the Police Service. The Police Service needs to be transformed into a service committed to observance of the rule of law. Here again, there needs to be an action plan to enlighten them in their duty by the country and their obligation to uphold the rule of law. Politicization has been a malady here too. If the country is to take a new direction politicians too must realize that they should not impede progress in that new direction by interfering with institutions that should function independently.

Education and health are two vital sectors in any country. It is not merely sufficient to say that we provide free education and free health. That is undoubtedly appreciated, but we need to also provide quality education and quality health. I am not for a moment suggesting that the services in these areas are bad, but there is definitely room for improvement, particularly in the rural areas. Inadequacy of financial resources could be the reason for insufficient allocations, but if the country is to move towards real progress it is imperative that education and health services must at least be as good as they need to be and the Government should bear this in mind as a very important component in the new direction that this country proposes to take.

We also need to examine whether the standards of teaching in our schools have dropped. Do we need to restructure present procedures pertaining to recruitment, training, conditions of service and even emoluments to be able to have a more competent and committed Teachers Service? I am not for a moment seeking to blame anybody, but it is a question that has consistently arisen in my mind, as to whether the standards of teaching have dropped. We remember our teachers and our days in school. And we know how committed our teachers were, how much we gained from them. Our students need to be provided with the best educational facilities if the country is to do well in the future. Investment on the future generations is the best investment we can make for the future. And we have to address that issue in a practical way. I think, Sir, we should concentrate on the well-being of our students. Our university education needs to be diversified so as to stop producing unemployable graduates and to produce graduates for whom there will be a demand. Vocational training and technical education is another important sphere. If there is foreign direct investment, development and production, we will need a substantial work force with necessary skills and we should prepare for that eventuality by providing our youth with the necessary opportunities to acquire those skills.

I want to refer to some areas where, in terms of the Hon. Finance Ministers Speech, we import at

1415 1416

[ ]

2016 17

considerable cost various items which can be produced locally. On the importation of sugar we spend US Dollars 250 to 400 million. On the importation of food products and agriculture-related needs we spend approximately Rs. 200 billion annually. We import at considerable cost 81,000 metric tons of milk powder.

We are a small country and we should be able to produce with proper planning all the food items we need. The state of our economy is such that we should try through local production to avoid such imports. This is within our capacity.

We need to promote tourism. It is an area with potential for much development. Our beaches and cultural sites have proved to be an attraction. We need to attract quality tourism, tourists who are big spenders.

I wish to say a few words, Sir, about the North and the East. It has been a much neglected area for a long time, both before the war and after the war. Resettlement on their lands from which they were displaced in the entirety of the North and the East, whether it is Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu Trincomalee, Batticaloa or even Ampara, is a prerequisite, is a necessity. Rehabilitation, housing, livelihood including farming on their own land, fishing, animal husbandry, livestock development, should be fully accomplished in 2017. The deprivation and suffering of these affected people cannot be a continuing phenomenon. People are tired of waiting patiently with expectation and now want things to happen. Of the 18 Tamil Members of Parliament elected from the North and the East, 16 are from the Tamil National Alliance, which is more than 90 per cent. Having been elected by the people to represent them, though we are not in the Government, we want to and are willing to work with the Government to accomplish the task that I just outlined. We would like the Government to formulate a programme of work to accomplish that task. I am happy that at least the Leader of the House is here. He is a person with a sympathetic ear. I think the Government needs to formulate a comprehensive programme of work for the North and the East and the Government needs to work with the elected representatives of the people, 16 of them from my Party, in order to be able to accomplish that task. We insist that this happens, and we will take every step that we can to ensure that such a programme of work is started early. It is a task that we cannot ignore any longer; we will play a constructive role in it.

We would also wish tangible progress in the matter of the resettlement of the Muslim people in the North. At a conference with Muslim Civil Society members of the North held recently, it was decided that representatives of the Muslim community, an official representative of the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, together with an official representative of the Chief Minister of the Northern Province would work together in order to overcome difficulties and thereby assist in the resettlement of the Muslim people displaced from the North. This is also a matter that needs urgent action. There seems to be a grievance amongst the Muslim people that they have been

neglected. I do not think that grievance should continue because it is the policy of the Tamil National Alliance and also of the Tamil people that the Muslim people who were displaced from the North should return and that they should be resettled on their lands with all facilities.

I want to say few words about Trincomalee, which is my constituency and my district, which I have had the privilege of representing in this Parliament for a long period of time. There has been Rs. 1000 million allocated for a Trincomalee District development programme. Meaningful development would be development of the people, development of their quality of life: housing, resettlement, rehabilitation, restoration of livelihood; facilities and equipment for the restoration of livelihood; fishing, farming, livestock development, animal husbandry, small industries, cottage industries, medium-scale industries. This is what we need.

I want to refer Sir, to two large irrigation schemes which have much potential in Trincomalee. One scheme is called Peraru, in the North of Trincomalee, where a substantial amount of water flows into the sea and the water is not utilized. All the lands in that area are largely, as we call in Tamil, Manawari Lands, depending upon rain-fed cultivation. We should provide those lands with irrigation facilities in which event they can be cultivated in both seasons.

The other scheme, I want to refer to, is a scheme called, Kalarippu, in the South of Trincomalee, in Verugal Eachchilampattu area, where again a substantial amount of water flows into the sea. If that water is utilized, several thousands of acres of lands presently under Manawari Cultivation, rain-fed cultivation, can be irrigated and the people will be able to cultivate for two seasons. This would lead to the quality of life of several thousands of families in these areas improving in a very substantial way.

These two schemes have been in the pipeline for a long period of time. For one reason or another they have not been implemented. I think, with this money allocated for development of Trincomalee, these two schemes must be given priority and the work must be undertaken. We would impress upon the Government - in fact, I would persuade the President and the Prime Minister, the President is also in charge of the Mahaweli Development and major irrigation schemes - that these two schemes are a priority. They have been pending for a long period of time. In fact, I spoke about Peraru in this Parliament when I came here for the first time in 1977. On account of the war, on account of the conflict, on account of the disturbed situations, things have not taken off. But it must happen now. Before the end of 2017, we want to make substantial progress in these two areas.

Another area of concern in Trincomalee Sir, is coast conservation. There are some vital parts of Trincomalee town and its suburbs facing the grim possibility of early destruction by sea erosion. I wish to identify those areas: Division No.10, Thirukadaloor, Manthottam, Veera Nagar, Palla Thottam and Salli. These are coastal areas, which are facing the grim possibility of destruction as a

1417 1418

result of sea erosion. A substantial amount of expenditure is required to save these areas where thousands and thousands of families live and we must ensure that we are able to complete that work and that these people are safe in those areas and they are able to carry on living in those areas.

Before I conclude Sir, I want to refer to a segment of our society which needs the care and attention of all of us. I refer to the poorer segment of society. I noticed that the Minister of Finance in his Speech has reduced prices of seven items which have been detailed in his Speech. He has also tabled a list indicating reduction of prices of several items between January, 2015 - the price that prevailed then - and November, 2016 - the prevailing price now. There are reductions, though not very major, in regard to many items. All these things Sir, nevertheless seem to be quite minimal, compared to the extreme hardships undergone by weaker sections of society. I do not want to specifically refer to any recent actions on the part of Government in this regard.

I do realize the difficulties faced by the Government, which inherited an economy reeking with debt. However, whatever the difficulties faced by the Government maybe, it should not impose greater burdens on poorer segments of society. Our efforts should always be to alleviate their sufferings. Indirect taxation, Sir, largely impacts on the poorer sections of society. All of us have a responsibility not to harass and thereby alienate the poorer segments of society. We cannot and we should not be insensitive to their difficulties. Those segments of society which are better off, can be called upon to bear greater burdens. They can afford to bear those burdens and will not suffer pain as much as the poorer sections of society will have to bear when they are called upon to bear burdens that they cannot afford to bear.

There is an air of disquiet and discontent in the country pertaining to the economic plight of the poorer segments of society. This is an issue which needs to be addressed urgently. I would urge the Hon. Minister of Finance and the Government to consider this issue before this Budget reaches a state of finality.

We are hoping Sir, that this country will shortly have a new Constitution which has been a dire need in this country and which had been elusive for a long period of time. It must be a Constitution that is substantially acceptable to all segments of Sri Lankan society, to all sections of Sri Lankan society within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka where all Sri Lankans whether they are Tamils, Muslims, or Sinhalese will be able to call themselves Sri Lankans with a sense of pride and honour and be Sri Lankans in the true sense of the word without in any way forgoing their identity, their cultural identity, their linguistic and religious identity as distinct people.

Thank you.

[2.20p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in my speech during the Budget Debate for the year 2016, I emphasized that both a lasting political solution and immediate actions to redeem our people from their long suffering are important. We were told that a donor conference would be convened in Japan to address the immediate concerns and we were hoping for some positive push in post-war recovery of our provinces.

A year ago, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, in his 2016 Budget Speech announced that he was extremely mindful of the grievances of the war-affected areas and recognized that people of the North and the East have been requesting for basic facilities for the past seven years and the donor conference will enhance the rehabilitation of the North and the East.

So, now a year has passed and the donor conference did not happen; the Government has even closed down the Resettlement Authority itself. The budgetary allocation for accelerated resettlement has now been reduced by Rs. 5 billion for the year 2017 and the capital allocation to the Ministry of Resettlement has been reduced by Rs. 10 billion.

1475 1476

2016 17

If we look at the outcome of the year 2016, only 2,382 families were resettled in the Jaffna District, whereas still 10,458 families need to be resettled. At this rate, it will take another five years to complete the resettlement in Jaffna, even if we had the same Budget as last year. Similarly, it will take more than two years for the remaining families to be resettled in Mannar. What message does this send to us?

Today, I want to speak exclusively on behalf of the war-affected vulnerable people of the North and East. They have been at the receiving end of all the misaligned livelihood development initiatives, complex and sometimes conflicting policies and procedures, and the bureaucracy. The biggest problem was, there being no ownership or responsibility for the ineffectiveness of all the livelihood initiatives. There was no resettlement policy or standard. It had been free for all to carry out unsustainable livelihood programmes resulting in continuous handouts and welfare destroying communities resilience to get back on their feet. This situation cannot continue.

Piecemeal isolated initiatives which are uncoordinated and carried out by diverse people with diverse agendas became a waste of money, time and efforts of already depleted human resources.

This must be interpreted, not only as a waste of national resources; it also has further marginalized the people who were desperately awaiting to get back on their feet again. There has been no major change to the framed condition required to create sustainable livelihood.

The war-affected, the most vulnerable, were seriously inflicted on further pain by unscrupulous microcredit vultures with no concern for further trauma and agony piled up on the people who were already traumatized for many years. The interest rates for these microcredit facilities ranged from 20 per cent to over 60 per cent with no mercy when it comes to repayment. We do not have the statistics of the number of suicides caused by these vultures.

We applaud the Hon. Minister for his initiative to establish a Consumer Financial Protection Authority - CFPA. This was a long overdue but the Hon. Minister has now acted.

These people were vulnerable, easy pickings and such practices should not continue with them. These vulnerable people were listed in the CRIB not giving them any chance of participating in livelihood ventures ever again. We would like to thank the Hon. Minister for taking steps to restore their capacity to engage in economic activities by placing restrictions on CRIB not to provide the credit history of loans less than Rs. 500,000.

Now, I will come to the rest of the initiatives in the Budget for the year 2017 to create one million jobs in the rural areas. We are very much encouraged by the shift and focus in approach and the emphasis made in unleashing the engine of growth in the private sector. We propose to

encourage Micro and SME businesses with the view to creating sustainable rural jobs for the war-affected people.

The Hon. Minister of Finance said in his Budget Speech, I quote:

We will formulate a cohesive policy to facilitate an equitable and inclusive level of social development in Sri Lanka. Social inclusion is a matter of prime concern and the participation of the entire population in the journey for development is a noble objective being a society for all. Accordingly, accelerating growth with social inclusion forms the broader theme of the 2017 National Budget.

We are glad and applaud the theme of the 2017 National Budget. We are people, who were continuously marginalized and discriminated by every measure imaginable and we very much welcome this Budget themed, Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion." However, the question must be, how will this be implemented?

We fully agree that the Northern and the Eastern Provinces need to feel that there is social inclusion. Due to the Colombo-centric centralized top-down actions of the past several decades; authority, responsibility, accountability and State institutional structures have all been muddled up and have mainly become dysfunctional and unproductive. We needed to develop a novel mechanism to ensure there is input and ownership and the provinces are empowered to achieve social inclusion.

Centralized development plans on national averages will not be effective in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. They are at a totally different level of economic and social maturity. They will not be able to participate in most of the initiatives developed in such a manner. They must get back on their feet first, before they could participate in any serious development agenda, such as, becoming a beneficiary of "Asian Growth Story." The basic requirement to benefit from such regional growth is the competitive capacity and maturity of our local economy and its potential linkages. We have been denied the opportunities to even get back on our feet, but now we are expected to be competitive and take advantage of this Asian Growth Story."

We say very clearly that we are not looking at such prospects negatively. However, we are only asking for a fair chance and space to get ready not just to participate and benefit, but to defend our ability to survive as equal members of this country navigating through all the complexities including that of the global economy.

This year, the Hon. Minister of Finance said in his Budget Speech, I quote:

"We will continue to progress in the noble endeavour to strengthen democracy, fundamental rights, reconciliation and development for lasting peace, freedom and national integration. Fundamentally, the country is guided by a new vision of lasting peace, built on mutual respect and dialogue. To cement this process, we have formulated an ambitious reforms agenda encompassing all major spheres including social, political, economic and international relations."

The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, Member of Parliament, in his speech said last week that he had met the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance, ahead of the Budget presentation, with a detailed proposal for the North and the East with regard agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry. He also added, Those three together are the main livelihoods of our people. People have to get back on their feet. I am deeply saddened that those proposals have not been considered." This does not bode well with the Ministers statement that he is being guided by a new vision of lasting peace built on mutual respect and dialogue.

The Hon. Minister of Finance further said in his Budget Speech, I quote:

"The medium term strategy of the government is focused on generating one million employment opportunities, enhancing income levels, development of rural economies, ensuring ownership of land to rural and estate sector working class, the middle class and the public sector employees, thus creating a strongly vibrant much wider middle class. Strong emphasis on all policies and programs will be placed on the alleviation of poverty in all manifestations beginning 2017.

We very much welcome such initiatives. Our people need something to hold on to and some hope of recovering from their long-suffering lives.

So, we now want to focus on the implementation. We are very much used to hear a lot of what we want to hear or simply the words never been implemented or dragged on until we give up.

The Hon. Minister said, I quote:

"Strong emphasis on all policies and programs will be placed on the alleviation of poverty in all manifestations beginning 2017."

We would like to know what these policies are and who is developing the policies for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces?

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, further said, I quote:

"Hon. Speaker, we have continued to address issues pertaining to the Northern and Eastern Provinces on separate basis in the past. I wish to lay emphasis on the fact that the government is committed to eliminate existing socio-economic gap between North and East with the rest of the country by 2020."

Sir, the post-war socio-economic environments and its developments in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces have been hampered for several decades and I fully agree that it should be approached on a separate basis. My question is, what is this basis and who is deciding this basis; why not ask the people who are affected, what such basis should be; why not consult the very people with whom you say that the Government is taking noble endeavour to achieve lasting peace, built on mutual respect and dialogue and when will such dialogue take place?

We need local civil society actors, who would professionally deal with these in facts and knowledge-based manner, make submission on behalf of our provinces and be engaged and heard by the central planning body. Such capacity must be developed as a matter of urgency so that we get an opportunity to make this noble endeavour of social inclusion a reality.

The problems of these provinces at the grass-roots level cannot be understood by sitting in offices in Colombo. It must be gained by sitting in the war-affected villages and speaking to the war-affected people who are mostly vulnerable. Otherwise, their needs would only be interpreted by people who are centrally located and they will conceive solutions from privileged positions removed from the realities of life with a centralized control mindset.

The Hon. Minister emphasized the fact that the Government is committed to eliminate the existing socio-economic gap between the North and the East with the rest of the country by 2020. I thank the Hon. Minister for recognizing this socio-economic gap in the first place. We would also like more data and information of these gaps so that we could develop programmes that are specific to resolving key issues.

The first step in any post-conflict development strategy is a holistic and comprehensive post-conflict sustainable development policy framework developed in a participatory manner, empowering people and encouraging ownership. If there is no ownership for recovery and economic developments at the local level, effectiveness of initiatives carried out to create sustainable livelihood will be questionable and will certainly lead to economic disempowerment and social injustice. The issues are unique in each affected district of the North and the East. Opportunity for a bottom-up planning is critical for such endeavours to be effective and it should contribute to what this country needs to achieve and is trying to achieve.

We assure that we will fully cooperate and support such actions with the help of professionals who are ready to engage and make this a reality. Our people have suffered long enough. Even though we are disappointed that the donor conference did not take place last year, we are once again prepared to stretch our hands in a positive and progressive manner.

Let us engage professional civil society organizations who have the capacity to represent the war-affected vulnerable people in a professional and socially responsible manner, to air and express local views on economic affairs and empowerment challenges. Such civil society actors can and must play a serious role and national and international peers must build their capacity and assist to engage and empower them. This would signal the very first level of gesture to give positive and productive view on the trajectory of the journey towards peace.

Last week the Hon. Prime Minister said that consensus has been reached to a great extent to devolve power, however, the continuing centralized Colombo -Centric administration and control will not give the signal for people to start feeling that peace and reconciliation is taken seriously.

The Hon. Minister of Finance said that the income of the majority of the 2.5 million engaged in agriculture is around Rs.25,000 per month and is less than the average income in the country of Rs.41,000 per month. Let us take Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu, the population of which is with the recent internally- displaced returnees who are 96.7 per cent and 98.2 per cent respectively. I dare to say the income of the majority of those engaged in agriculture would be around Rs.15,000 and certainly far from Rs.41,000 per month which is the national average income.

As a part of decentralized development, Hon. Finance Minister has allocated Rs.1,000 million to improve rural sanitation facilities, agro-based industries, agriculture support services, et cetera in the Southern Province. The same amount has been allocated for Jaffna for a vertical building for mixed development which will include office space, recreational facilities and entertainment facilities. We believe this is an expression of Colombo-centric views offered as a solution to a war-affected economy and kindly request the Minister to reallocate this to rural sanitation and sustainable livelihood development of the Northern Province.

A great view from Jaffna town is totally different to that from the other districts of the Northern Province, however tall it may be. Was there an environmental study done to assess the impact of this project on the quality of drinking water, water resources and underground aquifers? We need to understand the kind of challenges that we have to face due to the environmental degradations caused by such ill-conceived projects on the day-to-day life of our people.

Our people cannot even participate in the economic process in constructing such buildings. We do not have the capacity or a single local company that can employ local personnel and construct such buildings. The entire high-rise building will be built with external resources including all labour with hardly any social advancement or economic stimulation. We want development. However, we want development that is appropriate to the environment and we need to restore our communities before we could start development.

Similarly, the socially inappropriate 65,000 houses that was thrust down to the war-affected provinces where the local people are unable to participate in the construction, has no linkages to social advancement or economic stimulations. Such insistence of top-down initiatives ignoring local views signals the Colombo-centric views and controls and do not fit well for expression of social inclusion.

There is also a lot of confusion as to what peace is. We say, peace is when the war-affected people are standing on their feet again and are at peace with themselves. Once these people are at peace with themselves, there will be a wider peace.

We view the Trincomalee District Development Programme, Siri Sara Pivisuma initiated by His Excellency the President involving the Triforces and the

Civil Defence Force and other stakeholders as one of the most insensitive to say the least. Why would a district development be carried out directly by an Executive President? If you must involve the Triforces in something useful, then why not deploy them in districts that did not experience the 30 years of war with them. What does this say about devolution of power? We suffered bad experience and treatments in the previous administration and in some cases this is being repeated under good governance government.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this Budget is a welcome departure from the traditional budgets that focussed only on welfare. This Budget aims to create sustainable and enabling business environment for the micro and small and medium enterprises and have the capacity to create rural employment opportunities. However, for these to be effective, budget implementation will be the key.

The Hon. Finance Minister proposes to appoint a committee constituting of members from both the private and public sector to oversee budget implementation and execution. We believe that we need to have representatives from the provinces that have the lowest GDP too, so that they could ensure achieving the governments target for these provinces for 2020. This could even work as monitors of implementation and feedback mechanism.

Sir, from the point of view of creating an environment to help develop sustainable livelihood for the rural area and creating jobs, we support most of the measures addressing them. The nature of war-affected economy requires flexible policies, framework and mechanisms to convert these Budget measures to results. Business incubation, mentoring and handholding will be the key to achieve 2020 target for the lowest GDP provinces to be as the rest of the provinces. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. , ! .

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Presiding Member, in the first instance, I heartily congratulate the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake for presenting his second Budget in this House as the 21st Minister of Finance and this is the 71st Budget since 1947. In a most befitting manner, I could describe it as a Super moon Budget. The Proposals in the Budget will herald a new era towards the economic prosperity of our country.

Our country is in the forward march to usher economic revival and reconciliation and to build up a strong nation. As the State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, it gives me a great satisfaction to observe that the Budget will give relief to all sections of the population in this country. We must build up a strong nation where the East and the West, the North and the South will be one in all respects. Therefore, Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays, Burghers, Boras, Memons, the Indian population and all other ethnic groups will live together as one people. Then, we will feel happy and contented as we belong to one family. This is the dream of every one of us and to make this dream come true, this Budget paves the way. I say this with confidence because the second Budget of the "Yahapalana Government" really boosts feeling and comfort among all people in this country paving the way to make reconciliation and social integration a reality.

The task of preparing a budget is not that easy. No Minister of Finance in the recorded history had ever

presented a budget to satisfy everyone. The legacy that the previous Government had left us was a big yawning gap of foreign loans and borrowings. If this burden is not cast upon us, the Finance Minister would have felt quite comfortable to present a budget giving much more relief to the people.

Sir, the payment of Rs. 10,000 for Government servants is a welcome move. This was promised at the last General Elections and now it has been fulfilled. This "Yahapalanaya" will not run away from problems, but would make every endeavour to satisfy the day-to-day needs or the requirements of the common man. Though this pay rise is a huge burden on the indebted country, the Government had upheld and honoured its election pledge.

The country in general and the public servants in particular, must be ever grateful to His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister. In the run-up to the Budget, the Minister of Finance, in his wisdom and forethought, called on experienced leaders in this field like Hon. Ronnie de Mel and Hon. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to obtain their advice and get their blessings. This is a rare act of statesmanship shown by a Finance Minister. He has gone further and consulted the working class, the trade union movements and the common people among others to get their opinion. This makes the Budget very meaningful and gives satisfaction to all. The Minister was thereby encouraged to give priority to empower the people. This is a Budget seeking to fulfil the aspirations of all people and to empower them to march forward keeping their heads high.

The redeeming feature in the Budget is the price reduction in dhal, potatoes, sprats, green beans, kerosene and gas that would give relief to the common people. The Proposal to provide free Tablets to 175,000 A/L students and 28,000 A/L teachers from next year and the allocation of Rs. 5,000 million for this project would help the nation to keep abreast with the modern technological advancement that is sweeping the whole world, even though the increase in the Telecommunication Levy would be a burden.

In the sports field, I welcome the move to allocate Rs. 250 million to develop cricket in 1,000 outstation schools. This is a move in the correct direction as over the years, Sri Lanka has made vast strides in the cricketing world bringing glory to our nation, beginning from the One Day World Cup, defeating the powerful Australian Team in Lahore, Pakistan up to the whitewash of Aussies in Tests at home recently and the victories over Zimbabwe in Harare at present. But, please make sure that the outstation schools in the North and the East are beneficiaries of this allocation.

May I also remind the Hon. Members that the first Sri Lankan to win a world championship was the late Mr. M.J.M. Lafir, who gave a new image to our country by winning the World Billiards Championship.

It is a healthy sign that the Hon. Minister has proposed to augment the infrastructure of universities and

1535 1536

2016 17

privenas and the capacity development of the pirivena teachers in this country. While agreeing with this Proposal, I would also urge the Hon. Minister to take into consideration the religious institutions and schools of other ethnic communities and avoid possible allegations of discrimination. Muslims have a long history of conducting Ahadiya Schools purely based on Islamic religious teaching.

Funds must be allocated for maintenance and development of religious schools for minorities. In the same manner financial assistance must be extended to religious institutions and schools belonging to Christians and Hindus. Since our Government is committed to treat all communities equally, it is incumbent upon us to treat them alike when giving monetary assistance. As the Minister in charge of National Integration and Reconciliation, I am duty-bound to stress upon this matter.

I welcome the Proposal to allocate Rs. 250 million to host the official Vesak festival of the United Nations next year in our country. As a community, Muslims would extend their fullest support to make this historic event a success. In this regard, I recall the successful efforts taken by one of our distinguished leaders, late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar to convince the United Nations to declare the Vesak festival a universal event.

At this moment of speaking on the Budget, I should also bring to the notice of all Hon. Members that certain misguided and evil elements are trying to disturb communal harmony by making hate speeches, hurting the religious susceptibilities of the Muslim community and other minorities. We promised the nation at the last Presidential and General Election that what happened during the previous regime will not be allowed to take place under our Government. It is important to take immediate action to stop all forms of hate speeches from whatever community or persons directed at attacking or humiliating any other community, persons or religious dignitaries. Hate speeches are against the law and they are criminal offenses. Police must take prompt action to deal with the offenders. Police are now empowered under the Government to act on their own. They do not need approvals, except from the Hon. Attorney-General. If no action is taken to stop hate speeches, the functions of my Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation will be adversely affected.

To build up national harmony and social integration, I firmly believe that speedy action should be taken even under the existing laws to bring the culprits to book and ease the tension prevailing in the country. Muslims have always been an integral part of this nation and had been throughout the history a loyal and patriotic community, taking the side of the Sinhalese Kings to protect our country from foreign domination from time to time. Great names such as M.C. Abdul Rahuman, A.W. Abdul Rahuman, Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, Hon. N.H.M. Abdul Cader, Dr. T.B. Jayah, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Sir Razik Fareed, H.S. Ismail, Mudliyar M.S. Kariyapper and Dr. Badiuddin Mahamud comes to my mind, and today I pay my respect to all these national-minded great men

who helped the majority community right along to safeguard our sovereignty, integrity, self-respect and freedom - the fruits of which we are enjoying so much today.

Thank you. [5.42p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, the 71st Budget for 2017 presented to this House by the Hon. Minister of Finance upholds the truest reasoning behind the formation of this National Government of Yahapalanaya. That is, to create a united front towards the creation of a new economic and social order for Sri Lanka through sustainable and meaningful growth.

This National Government has delivered laudable progress just in its first year, and this Budget is testament to the Governments commitment towards continuing such progress effectively, serving our citizens and our country with the intention of building a better, stronger tomorrow.

Sir, I wish to highlight as to how the implications of this Bill, when approved, will directly affect and empower the people of the Eastern Province and especially, those in my electorate of Batticaloa.

As a cross-section of the populace is engaged primarily in agricultural activities, I applaud and firmly stand behind the line items pertaining towards development of the industry. I commend the Proposal to encourage forming farmer cooperatives and the adoption of the out-grower model of small producer-large purchaser to facilitate an improved and seamless integration of the value chains.

The Proposal to allocate Rs. 300 million to create a Dedicated Economic Centre in the Eastern Province enabling farmers and SMEs to showcase their products will create opportunities for trade and employment generation for at least 1,000 people.

Moreover, I sincerely commend rehabilitation and amalgamation of the Kithul and Rugam Tanks to create a bigger reservoir for irrigation and for flood mitigation in Batticaloa. This has been a long-felt need of the farming community in Batticaloa and I am proud to state that it is by this Government that the need of the hour of farmers in my electoral district has been met.

Hon. Presiding Member, with Batticaloa being renowned for its fishing commodities, I am very familiar with the debacles faced by my constituents in the fishing communities. Hence, I commend the Governments recognition of the potential of export-increment through value addition including canning and processing.

1537 1538

The Proposal to allocate Rs. 500 million to promote Aquaculture Industry Zones in Batticaloa is testament to that and further, allocation to improve livelihood facilities in fishing villages in ten coastal districts including Batticaloa is well received.

I highly commend the Proposal to grant incentives to companies that make investments into the Eastern Province, such as the Proposal to provide 100 per cent capital allowance for businesses which make investments in the Eastern Province of over US Dollars 3 million and generate new employment opportunities for 250 people and the Proposal to provide a three or five-year 50 per cent tax holiday for business which will create 500 or 800 new employment opportunities respectively.

With cessation of hostilities, the Eastern Province is a new haven for tourism providing a new untapped arena in the area of economic growth. The recent past has seen the development of tourist corridors in Pasikudah, Kuchchaveli and Arugam Bay and has brought in an influx of tourist-based investments.

I highly endorse the Proposal towards encouraging MICE tourism exhibition centres in Batticaloa on a PPP basis.

Further, I commend the Proposal for allocating Rs. 300 million towards providing scholarships and incentivising skills development of youth who are keen to join the hospitality industry catering to the void in skilled personnel currently prevalent thereby increasing employment opportunities and further infrastructural development in the region.

I am pleased to note, Sir, the Budget Speech states that the Government will implement steps to transform and upgrade the development in the Eastern Province for tourism industry as there presently is a requirement for recreational and accessibility options to be provided for tourists who are keen on travelling to the region.

This Governments Budget clearly depicts education as centric in its development model. Its proposed investments address the issue of poor infrastructure for which it has allocated Rs. 7000 million. For teacher training, its allocation was Rs. 700 million and for curricula development and smart class rooms, it has allocated Rs.10,000 million more importantly.

Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that people in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka, those in the districts of Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Ampara, are a populace of simple, yet dedicated and hardworking. These farmers, fishermen and small business owners are domiciled in the only Province in Sri Lanka that truly represents an accurate cross-section of this countrys ethnic diversity.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) It is that pre-requisite of living alongside fellow brothers and sisters of diverse array of backgrounds and beliefs that strengthened the ideologies of unyielding resilience to the freedoms of democracy even in our nations darkest days.

I wish to remind this House that these freedoms we enjoy today were under attack in various forms in the past. Our countrys history has shown the world that we are a band of strong people; people who are resilient and people who are steadfast in our commitment to democracy, good governance, and to the freedoms that couple such. It is thereby important to cherish these freedoms and move onwards in reconciliation without tolerating those who discriminate, as we are all united citizens of one nation.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . [5.49p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Thank you Hon. Presiding Member. A country's budget is not just a collection of numbers, but also an expression of our values and aspirations and an action plan to convert vision into reality. The vision of our leadership is clearly visible - to propel Sri Lanka to be a strong high-income economy in the Asian region; whilst in the medium term, focusing on generating one million employment opportunities and enhancing income levels, development of rural economies and ensuring land ownership.

The approach is to recover from the past and reach the vision of becoming a green, innovation-based economy while providing relief. As a result, the 2017's expected budget deficit will be 4.6 per cent, down from 5.4 per cent in the year 2016. The reduction in the budget deficit is expected to slow down the rate of increasing national debt, and hence it may lead to a lesser percentage of national income being spent on debt and interest payments.

The Sri Lankan people elected and entrusted this Government the task of improving a challenged economy, a huge unemployment and getting the Sri Lankan economic machine working again. Under the leadership of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, this Government has been able to change the direction and set course towards a new horizon, a better future. Our country's profile has gained tremendously in the international arena and His

1539 1540

2016 17

Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena has done so much to regain and rebuild broken relationships. However the task is far from complete, but the actions show genuine intentions.

After decades of political cynicism amongst the two major political parties in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party, the two main parties of this country have not only come together to form a National Government but also jointly proposed a national budget with the best of both ideologies. This is indeed a treat and a new experience to us as Sri Lankans. This Budget focuses on a number of issues such as agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, entrepreneurship, investments, education, infrastructure development and innovation. This way, the economy built on a number of sectors is more stable, more dependable and is less vulnerable to surprises.

Sir, as I have mentioned before in this Parliament, for generations we have looked up to the first world countries and have always wanted to be like them and be one of them, but it has mostly been talking about catching up to them without any realistic long term plans based on our strengths and opportunities. I believe that trying to replicate decade-old models that brought success to them is not the way forward. I do not believe that we can achieve our dreams by doing what they did 30 - 50 years back or by working only with our traditional industries. No, we as a country need new strategies, new models, new industries and we need to plan ahead today and we have to find our success in our own way.

This Budget unlike previous budgets sees a revolutionary new direction on the concentration of fund allocation towards Science, Technology and Innovation. I am a firm believer of digital revolution. The power of connectivity, integration, cognitive computing, application programme interfaces - APIs- big data have disrupted many traditional businesses across the world and are continuing to create new economic frontiers, new industries, new business possibilities and opportunities. This is the way forward for Sri Lanka. This is our time and our opportunity to play a very crucial role in the fourth industrial revolution. Land, buildings, capital and traditional wealth will not make the next big economy of the world. It will be based on knowledge capital, technical products and global markets.

Though there is an ongoing discussion over Budget cuts in education and health, in my opinion, the capital expenditure versus recurrent expenditure is what really matters. In the case of both education and health, I would like to invite the Hon. Members of Parliament to analyze the percentage increment in capital expenditure over the decreases in recurrent expenditure as it is an important key performance indicator. Capital investments that have been proposed could lay the ground work for innovation as well as productivity in the future. These investments help drive growth thus enabling a more sustainable economy.

Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to make a quick request from our Minister of Health in the best interest of our country. As I understand, for decades, our

healthcare system has been investing on descriptive sickcare instead of preventive and predictive care that can not only generate savings but also a productive, healthy nation that can contribute to the development. I believe that digital health is the answer, and it is the way to truly democratize healthcare in developing countries such as Sri Lanka. I intend to discuss more on this subject in the future debates.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Sir, give me two more minutes, please.

This Budget addresses the biggest problem that we are facing in the North and other rural areas in the country. That is the shortage of Science, Mathematics and English teachers. Hence, there is a shortage of young eligible candidates for jobs that require qualifications in Science, Mathematics or English at the Advanced Level. This has affected the North in a very bad way. For instance, the basic entry qualification for nursing is Science at Advanced Level. Since there are no entrants with this qualification, the hospitals see a massive shortage in nurses. This has affected the quality of healthcare in the North. I have appealed at numerous times for a remedy to this issue for a long time. I am now happy that my voice, along with all these people from these affected regions, has been finally heard.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, now wind up please. ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Sir, I think I have got ten minutes and I have used only five minutes by now.

The Proposal to give a 100 per cent subsidized loan of Rs. 500,000 to students who wish to follow the Bachelor of Education in Science, Mathematics and English will encourage a lot of our students to get into these fields, which will in turn benefit them to get into teaching in these rural areas.

Sir, what stops the students of the Moratuwa University from building the next facebook? What stops the students of the Colombo Medical Faculty from starting up a biotech company? What stops our entrepreneurs from building the next Dollar Shave Club? If we really analyze these businesses and their models, we can see that they are built on knowledge. If we can equip our young generation with the right knowledge, right competences, this is the time for us to shine. For decades, we have maintained an impressively high literacy rate and it has generated benefits to the country,

1541 1542

but let us now step it up and teach our students how to code. That is the essential skill and literacy that is now in demand.

To conclude, Sir, we must prepare our country, our people, the infrastructure, education policies and framework thinking of this future possibilities. I decided to talk about future and the long-term programmes for the specific reason that we cannot suddenly decide to become an attractive place for investors and industries to come and set up industries in the country. Therefore, I strongly believe that preparing ourselves for the future opportunities is very crucial. Let us work towards that.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .
