( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister, please. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The Hon. Member asked me a Question regarding an Army camp in Mannar. I must say the Army camp has been established in Mannar in June 1990 occupying a building belonged to the District Co-operative Council after taking into consideration the LTTE terrorist activities which largely disrupted the day-to-day lifestyle of the people in the area. The Ministry of Defence has received a request to release the building occupied by the Army and action has been taken to acquire a State land to relocate the camp. The request in this regard has already been submitted to the GA, Mannar by the Sri Lanka Army and the acquisition process is currently underway. Once the State land is acquired by the Army, action will be taken to release the co-operative building.

Hon. Speaker, I must say that I am unaware of any vegetable sales being done by the Army, but we can certainly look into it.

I feel a Question like this is more appropriate at the Oral Question time than the Prime Ministers Question time because this is actually fact finding and that really can be achieved by asking an Oral Question from the relevant Minister. .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) As I told, Hon. Member, I have to find out about that vegetable business, but the question here was, will the Army give up the building. Yes, the Army wants to give up the building and they are getting some land nearby for

another building. Since it was only a question of the building, I did not get a situation report as to the location of all the Army camps and what they have been doing in the area. But, if he had asked the Minister and there has not been a reply, I will certainly look into it. I think questions like this should be answered in Parliament by the relevant Minister because these are very detailed and technical questions which are best known to the Minister himself. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) So, we will take action accordingly, Hon. Prime Minister. () . () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr) Nalinda Jayathissa) , .

. , , , , , . , , . That is the human nature: no one is willing to be ruled by another man or a woman. That is the issue that has been there since the inception of the human civilization. But, people are willing to be ruled under the rule of law. If the rule of law is to be upheld in a country there is a basic principle - people are willing to be subject to that rule of law provided the basic criterion that not only those who are ruled, but also the rulers are subject to the rule of law.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, I was mentioning the development of the rule of law. With that interpretation by Judge Henry de Bracton, people also started thinking that the conservative type of system based on the concept "The King is under no man" is not correct, but the King is under the God and the law. That is how the rule of law emerged as a very strong principle of democracy. As result, when there was a charge against King Charles I of the United Kingdom, the Chairman of the Jury was John Bradshaw, who believed in that principle, and he passed the sentence to hang King Charles I. Later on, this principle was widespread all over the world. That sentence was executed in 1649 and the King was hanged. That was because the rule of law was powerful than the King.

, . . . ; . . . , we must look at the needs of the country and then, have these constitutional changes. ; Soulbury Constitution . 1972 .

1972 . 1977 .. , . It was there in the President J.R. Jayewardenes UNP manifesto that he will bring in a new Constitution. 1977 . 1977 .. .

He wanted to expedite the development process in this country and that is why he brought in this very strong Executive Presidency. You have the French model; you have the American model and ours is an adoption of the two models. That is what happened.

Then from 1977, we saw concentration of power in the Office of the President - I personally think that is very bad - because of that we saw a decline in certain democratic institutions and functions. We have to accept that. Then, it went on from 1977 to 1994. When the Hon. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga came to power, she also said that she was going to abolish it; but nothing happened. Then, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa also said that he was also going to abolish it; but nothing happened - actually he extended it. Now, we have come to a crucial juncture in the history of this country. How are we going to move forward? I think the Hon. Prime Ministers idea is a very good idea. He has got all of us together as a Constitutional Assembly. So, we can take time for this.

. . . . . 1977 , . We must be a mature democracy. , .

, . 1956 . The year 1956 was a crucial juncture, a very important year for Sri Lanka where the nationalistic forces came up rightly or wrongly. They came up for some reason.

1977 . Sir, I consider the vote at the 1977 election as an "economic vote". People wanted economic development; they wanted an end to hunger and that was the result of the 1977 election. And after that, there were massive development projects that happened. But, on the other hand we also can argue that there were some issues with regard to democracy. I can remember Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaikes civic rights being taken away. That was very wrong; my father opposed that; the Hon. (Dr.) Anandatissa de Alwis opposed that. But, those things also happened.

Then, we have seen excessive power being used under the Executive Presidency. For example, the way our Colleague, General Sarath Fonseka, was arrested and thrown in prison was completely illegal. But, those things happened. We cannot whitewash those incidents. All I am saying is that the due legal process must happen all the time. That is guaranteed by the Constitution. Article 12 and 14 of the Constitution give fundamental rights to the people of this country, whether they are Sinhalese, Muslims or Tamils. So, those freedoms must never be compromised. So, I think, in the long run, when we are a bit older - we see this new Constitution making process happening - perhaps, we will be able to rectify the mistakes of the past. That is very important because I feel that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the United National Party, the JVP, the Hon. Arumugan Thondamans Party and the TULF, all must come together. This is a crucial juncture that has come after thirty years of war; after friends of the Hon. R. Sampanthan were assassinated; after people like my father and the Hon. R. Premadasa were assassinated. Their lives were taken away from the bottom of our hearts; in front of our eyes - we saw how they were assassinated.

Now, we have a fresh beginning. So, we must get this right; we must get the combination right; we must get the matrix right. If we can do that, I think we can have a democratic and a prosperous Sri Lanka.

. . . . , . I remember the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali telling me, Navin, once you sit in that chair, after three months, the promise that you made to abolish the Executive Presidency is forgotten." Those were his words to me.

[5.23p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Presiding Member, let me first thank you for giving me a few minutes to speak on this Resolution to appoint a Constitutional Assembly to adopt a new Constitution. This is a momentous day in the history of Parliamentary democracy. We are assembled here today to consider changes to be effected to our present Constitution. Making Constitutional Reforms is like changing the anatomy of a body of a person. It is such an important and a serious matter. Changes in a Constitution can bring good results or ill effects to the people of a country.

In the long history of political reforms introduced from time to time by the British rulers or our own governments, precautions have been taken to fulfil the aspiration of the people. The Manning Commission, the Colebrook Commission, the Soulbury Commission and subsequent Commissions appointed during the post-independent era took cognizance of the fact that the people of the country should derive greater benefits than in force before.

As promised to the voters during the last Presidential Election, our President Maithripala Sirisena had the magnanimity to reduce the six-year period of his term to

275 276

[ .. ]

2016 09

five years. Today, he is also seeking to reduce his powers and transfer them to the Prime Minister and to Parliament. This is the moment of real blooming of flowers in our "Yaha Palanaya."

Appearing before the Select Committee on the Revision of the Constitution on behalf of the Muslim League, Al Haj Mohamed Abdul Bakeer Markar, a former Speaker of Parliament, argued that the interest of the minorities would be safeguarded and that they would not be overlooked or thrown overboard.

We are very happy that His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena has assured that Buddhism, the major religion of the country, would be protected in every form and the unity of the country would be strengthened. We are also happy that the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, has expressed a clear view on this matter while ensuring protection of the minorities in our society which is multiracial, multi-religious and multilingual.

While reflecting back, we should give thought to the fact that the due recognition and protection was given to the minorities by the Soulbury Constitution. Section 29 of this Constitution adequately ensured rights of the minorities. It is called, "The Entrenched Clause," which could not have been amended even by a two-thirds majority in Parliament. There was also an upper Chamber called, "The Senate," which checked hasty legislation while providing sufficient protection to the minority interests. I would urge the House to take into consideration this insulation of protection.

Sir, it was universally agreed that the present character of the Presidency should be changed. No individual should command dictatorial powers that would estrange peoples aspirations.

At this stage, I would appeal to the entire Opposition to support the efforts made in good spirit by the President in placing before the House the proposals in the interest of the whole country and not to arouse communal feelings and plunge the country into chaos. We have suffered enough in the past due to communal disharmony as a result of power-hungry politicians. Let us throw lock stock and barrel of all communal propaganda, but unite together to build a peaceful country and promote communal harmony, national integration and reconciliation.

I am particularly insisting upon this fact as I am in charge of a Ministry which deals with this subject.

It is in this context that we should applaud the President and the Prime Minister in seeking to effect proper and meaningful changes in the Constitution so that Parliament would enjoy its true constitutional status.

I wish the praiseworthy actions taken by the President and the Prime Minister a success and the people of the country good luck!
