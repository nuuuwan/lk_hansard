( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. . . Constitutional Council Election Commission Prof. S. Ratnajeevan H. Hoole has written an article which appeared on the centre page of "The Island" newspaper on 23rd August, 2016 which is very critical of the Constitutional Council as well as the conduct of the Election Commission. Hon. Prime Minister, he refers to the Nineteenth Amendment and the relevant Articles that are not being implemented and some other Articles that are being violated. So, this is a serious issue because it is being raised by a member of the Election Commission.

. I quote:

The Delimitation Committee says their report will be ready by 31 Aug. We have said we can hold elections 90 days thereafter. The relevant Minister and President say elections will be next year. It is easier for the government to prevent the Commission from holding elections when only one person is present at meetings.

Hon. Prime Minister, according to this article, apparently, it is only one person who is conducting the whole affairs of the Commission. Prof. Hoole says that he has no allowance to attend; he has no travelling allowance to attend. Another section states, it is interesting, I quote:

I understand that the Delimitation Commission was meeting at the home of a member with her making tea and serving lunch because there was no budget. Perhaps,......

It goes on like this. It is a very critical section. Either the Parliament - Hon. Speaker is the Chairman of the Constitutional Council - must approve this budgetary provision. Of course, Prof. Hooles argument is that there is no need for a Cabinet Paper as Parliament can approve it according to the Nineteenth Amendment. So, this is the position he has taken. We all know that he is a very respected person, irrespective of some of the other views

he holds. So, I would like to bring to your attention that relevant Articles of the Constitution have been quoted by him. Therefore, it becomes a Constitutional issue where there has to be some comment or some explanation given by the Hon. Speaker or by the Constitutional Council. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker,- ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I have not seen this article. I will read it. But, I would ask the Hon. Speaker to go into it and then we can discuss the issues thereafter. There were some requests made about certain facilities for members, I think we have agreed for some. But, like providing housing was difficult because we already have a shortage of housing. So, I think the Hon. Speaker will inquire on those matters. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) An allowance and a travelling allowance are being paid. But, we are not paying for hotels. He is not living in Colombo. So, we will see what kind of a solution can be found.

Thank you very much for bringing up this matter. ( ) () ( ) () REGISTRATION OF DEATHS (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL . . Order for Second Reading read. [.. 11.02] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Nimal Lanza - Deputy Minister of Home Affairs) , " " .

, 2010 19 ( ) , , " " . . . . Question proposed. [11.04 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Speaker for the opportunity given to say a few words on the occasion of the Bill titled, Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) is taken up.

This is an important piece of legislation that this Government is moving consequent to the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill that was passed recently. This has been necessitated, as the Hon. Deputy Minister of Home Affairs said, due to certain types of deaths that have occurred for which there is no usual evidence as one would find in ordinary circumstances. This Act was brought in for different purposes at different times - after

the tsunami a similar provision was brought in, and after a period of intense violence that this country had to face unfortunately where several thousands of its citizens died, it has become necessary to enable the surviving members of the families of those who met with such deaths to get on with their lives, to move forward, deal with property, deal with various other obligations and therefore, the ordinary law as to how certificates of death can be issued had to be amended.

Now, along with this, the issue of missing persons became a very serious problem. The Government through several means try to ascertain the fate of people who had gone missing. Initially in 2010, when the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission was appointed by the then Government, when that Commission held sittings in various parts of the country particularly, in the North and the East, thousands of complaints were forwarded to that Commission by the relatives of people who had gone missing during the conflict. Although the mandate of that Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission was somewhat broader, I think more than 90 per cent of the complaints received by that Commission related to persons who went missing over a period of time, most notably, during the last stages from the middle of 2008 to the middle of 2009. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission in its report has brought this out and made very important recommendations. Unfortunately, the Government of the day, which appointed the LLRC, did not think it appropriate to implement the recommendations of the LLRC and although several actions were taken to compel, to persuade the Government to implement those recommendations of the LLRC, most of those recommendations remain unimplemented. There were even Resolutions in the UN Human Rights Council and I think the country needs to know this - that the UN Human Rights Council did not in one move adopted the LLRC recommendations. It was specifically mentioned in the Resolution that was adopted in the year 2012. Thereafter, it was reminded again in 2013. However, as we all know, the Government was lethargic, if not totally unwilling, to put into practice what its own Commission had recommended.

Some of those important recommendations related to the case of missing persons. Thereafter, in order to show that this important aspect of the LLRCs recommendation is being looked into, the then Government appointed a Commission headed by a former High Court Judge, Mr. Maxwell Paranagama. The LLRC recommended that an Investigative Commissioner be appointed with respect to the missing persons. But, what was done was yet another Commission which held sittings all over the country and forced - I am using the word forced although there was no physical force - people felt compelled to go before that Commission also all over again and make complaints with regard to their next of kin who had gone missing or who was forced to disappear.

1821 1822

These relatives have gone before several such fora. They complained to the ICRC, they complained to the nearest Human Rights Commission Office, they made complaints to the police station. Invariably, each of those families has a file full of these documents that they have forwarded to various different authorities who, they think, will assist them in some way to resolve this question of missing persons. So, they went before the Paranagama Commission also, repeated their stories. I, myself attended some of those hearings in Mannar, in Mullaitivu and so on. I have commented on this in this House as to how those hearings were far less than satisfactory that people sometimes were asked questions leading them to answer in a particular way and there were occasions when several mothers reacted to those leading questions. They were invariably asked about compensation, whether they have got chickens, whether they have got goats, and many a time mothers would scream at the Commissioners and say, I want my son back. I do not want a goat. I do not want chickens. I want my sons back. The conduct of that Commission was so unsatisfactory in everybodys eyes that one of the Resolutions adopted in the UN Human Rights Council called for a termination of the proceedings of the Paranagama Commission. For some inexplicable reason, this Government too continued to extend the mandate of that Commission. But, I believe, it has now come to an end and some of those recommendations of that Commission are also being made public.

When that Commission started its sittings in the District of Kilinochchi, close to the place where the Commissioner sat, there was another tent put up and the son or "a son" of the former President was personally present there dolling out cash to people who were going to the Paranagama Commission to divert them to this other shed - giving them cash asking them to apply for a death certificate of their loved one. We raised that matter in this House even at that time. People were being bribed to admit that the persons who have gone missing and about which they were going to make complaints had actually died; and to accept such deaths. There was a huge reaction to this and then that practice of overtly coercing people to accept death certificates was done away with and people continued to make their complaints. Over 20,000 complaints have been made even to the Paranagama Commission, the conduct of which no one was satisfied about. So it is tens of thousands in numbers who have met with this fate.

In amending the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Act, now, there is provision to issue a different kind of certificate and that is a certificate of absence. This is a most welcome move; one about which we would congratulate the Government because by this, firstly, there would be an acknowledgement that a person has gone missing - the person is absent - without forcing those families to accept that the person is dead.

There is "presumption of death" in our law, but that is only when there is a question as to whether a person is living or dead becomes an issue in a legal proceedings. Then, if those people who would otherwise have ordinarily heard of him have not heard or seen him - initially it was for a period of seven years; then, it was brought down to a period of one year - then, there is a "presumption of death". That is very different to saying that the person is dead. That presumption is a legal fiction for purposes of determining whether a person is alive or not in those legal proceedings - it is a very narrow compass that presumption exists. But, here, people refuse to accept that the person has died. Why? Because in most cases they themselves have handed over that person to authorities. And then, if the same authorities ask them to apply for a death certificate, naturally, they will not do that. When I say "authority", it is the Government, whoever the agency is. Their question is, We handed him over to you. How dare you now tell us to obtain a death certificate? Tell us how he died, if he died. Tell us what happened. You have an obligation to answer. Without that answer being given, we will not accept a death certificate. Here, now, there is another option: the certificate of absence. By that they do not have to accept that the person is dead. But it is accepting the actual state of affairs - the person is missing. In fact, he is missing. That is their complaint also. So, therefore, they get this certificate. I must say this to the relatives of those persons that there is a mischievous campaign being carried out telling them not to accept the certificate of absence.

, . , " " . . " " " " . . , " - " ! , .

Initially, a certificate of absence can be given because that is a mere acknowledgment by the Government that in fact that person is not around. That is your complaint as well. That does not extinguish your right to have an inquiry into the fate of that person. There must be a determination at the end of it whether the person is dead or not or whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the person is dead. If there is sufficient evidence which the family can actually accept, and if you can tell them All right, this is what happened," then, whether it

1823 1824

[ .. ]

2016 25

is right or wrong they will accept it and there can be a closure and they can move on in their lives.

The other implications of such a death can be dealt with differently but this amendment to the Act addresses the issue of the family knowing the fate of the missing person. If there is no evidence, if it is unascertainable as to what happened to that person, then you still have the certificate of absence, the legal incidence of which will enable you to continue to move forward in life; deal with property, marriage rights and you can deal with various other aspects. Although this is not the total answer to this huge humanitarian problem, this is something that can be done and that step has been taken so that there would be some solace for those people who have gone from pillar to post complaining for several years and not found any answers to their complaints up to now.

I have given notice to move an amendment at the Committee Stage and I wish to say a few words with regard to that. There was an incident that I spoke about where people were forced to accept death certificates. The information we have is that several people have taken those death certificates unwillingly on account of various coercion that was practiced on them. Now, there is a mechanism that is being put in place with respect to missing persons; now that a new law has been enacted; now that through this amendment, there is the option of accepting a certificate of absence instead of a certificate of death, even those persons who have already obtained death certificates must have the option to exchange it for a certificate of absence and have their cases also investigated. That is the amendment that I am proposing. I urge the Government to kindly consider this because this does not change anything. It only extends the relief that you are extending to the families of the disappeared and for those who have been doubly jeopardized by this coercive practice to have the right to have an investigation. At the end of the investigation, if it is found that the person is actually dead then they may be given a death certificate, but to have in the interim the right to withdraw the death certificate and instead be given a certificate of absence in that period of time.

When this Act is implemented we hope that this very important issue, the huge issue of people who were forced to disappear; who were made to disappear; who have gone missing primarily during the conflict in the North and the East, as it is defined here, but also otherwise, will have a remedy and it is our prayer that this scourge of missing persons will totally be eradicated from this land.

Whilst the Government takes steps with regard to non-recurrence, we will fully participate in that as we are now doing in the drafting of a new Constitution. One has to deal with these unfortunate people who had to face this issue. So, these are some measures that the Government has taken and we urge the House to pass this into law and

I urge the House also to consider the amendments that I will move at the Committee Stage.

Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. [11.27 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning of the speech, I would also like to echo the sentiments of the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran when he said that this Bill along with the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill will eradicate the question of missing persons forever and hopefully confine them into the pages of our history and the era of disappearances and white vans that we hope will never raise its ugly head again.

Mr. Speaker, we have before us in this House today, an important piece of legislation which has been presented by the Hon. Minister of Home Affairs. Like the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill passed in this House on the 11th of this month, this too is a landmark legislation in our reconciliation process and also in our transitional justice scheme. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair. , [ ] . , , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELVAM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please continue, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , , 1990 - -

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this Bill to amend the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 2010 which enables the issuance of Certificates of Absence addresses, as the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran just mentioned, a long-felt need of this nations grieving mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers and wives and husbands whose loved ones have gone missing.

In fact, according to the ICRC, in the past period, there are 16,008 persons missing. According to the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, this number is about 12,000. In the Paranagama Report, they claimed that nearly 24,000 have gone missing and also we understand nearly 5,100 security personnel also reported to be missing.

Where any person is reported missing and has not been heard of for a period exceeding one year by those who would naturally have heard of him, had he been present and his disappearance is attributable to the conflict which took place in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces or its aftermath or political unrest or civil disturbances or enforced disappearances or is a member of the armed forces or police who is identified as missing in action, a relative of such person may apply in the manner referred to in the Bill, to register such person as missing and to have issued to him a Certificate of Absence in respect of such person.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the legislation before us has been carefully crafted. Part IA details the process of registration of missing persons including the procedure for application, verification and supporting documentation required.

The Certificate of Absence will enable the family members of those who are missing to apply for benefits under social welfare schemes and temporarily manage under the supervision of the District Court, the property and assets of the missing person and act as a provisional guardian for dependent children of the missing person. Sir, some raise allegations that some of these people who are claimed to be missing are alive or may have died. Provision has been made in this Bill to deal with such situations. The Certificates are valid for two years. If the remains of the missing person are recovered or there is conclusive evidence regarding the death of the missing

person, the Certificate will be annulled and a Certificate of Death will be issued in its place. Similarly, if a person is found to be alive, the Certificate will be cancelled. Moreover, after the initial two-year period, for which the Certificate is valid, the District Secretary is required to inquire from the relative who is issued with a Certificate of Absence of the status of the missing person and take action accordingly to either extend the period by another two years, direct the relative if willing to apply for a Certificate of Death or cancel the Certificate where the relative does not intend to extend its period.

Sir, the agony that families of those who are left behind when security forces personnel or others go missing or their children or husbands go missing, defies emotional comprehension. When one sees a corpse, no matter how traumatic death may be and how unbearable the pain of loss may be, there is closure, because there is knowledge that ones loved one is no more.

When a person is missing, however, it is certainly not the same. The fact of having a relative missing is a continuous source of pain, uncertainty and incomprehensible agony. The uncertainty of a persons fate makes ones alternate between hope and despair which never really goes away.

In fact, I know, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, of several mothers who lost their loved ones in the South, in the late 80s and early 90s who still believe, after 30 odd years, that their sons are still alive and well, living somewhere. They will not admit to closure unless they know for sure what really happened to them.

While trying to cope with this tragic state of mind, these people have to also cope with many difficulties that they are bound to face relating to legal and administrative needs. For example, claiming social benefits, claims relating to family matters such as dissolution of marriage, guardianship, inheritance, obtaining legal documents and dealing with property. Most often the only alternative they have is to obtain a death certificate which leads to more mental agony because they obtain such death certificates without clear proof or information of the death of a person and many therefore, actually refuse to accept death certificates. Therefore, their psychological trauma is compounded and they suffer thereafter, feeling that they have betrayed the missing person whose actual fate they are unaware of by accepting a death certificate.

A Certificate of Absence acknowledges the fact that people are missing. For the families concerned, this is a form of official recognition that will also contribute to reconciliation efforts that our country requires.

Approval of this Bill by this House today - certainly, I hope that the Hon. Member will pass his amendment to the Hon. Minister concerned and we will certainly consider that amendment this evening - will help in some

1827 1828

small way to alleviate the pain and agony that the people of our country have suffered for long years. It will recognize a phenomenon that had been a part of our lives for the past 30 years or so and help ensure its non-recurrence so that at least in future, generations to come will be finally free of this curse that this nation has suffered many times since Independence - every few years, in fact, over and over again. The curse of this nations children, from all walks of life and from all parts of the country going missing will hopefully cease once and for all as a result of our collective efforts today. As I said at the beginning of my speech itself, we hope that tragic phase of our history will be forever confined to the pages of our history books.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this House, on the 11th August, approved the Bill to establish an Office on Missing Persons which you signed into law on the 23rd of this month. Regarding that also, as I have time, I would like to correct some common misconceptions which have been raised by various Members of the Opposition in the media.

Clause 2 of the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill very clearly says, "....for the registration of persons reported missing as a result of the conflict which took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces or its aftermath or political unrest or civil disturbances or enforced disappearances or of Members of the armed forces or police identified as missing in action:..."

To bring a closure to the losses the people who have suffered is the objective of this piece of legislation, Mr. Presiding Member.

Therefore, I would like to finally say that we have to move several amendments to the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill and I think, the appropriate term for this Act in my opinion should be, Registration of Deaths and Missing Persons (Special Provisions) Act" because it also covers Certificates of Absence for those who are thought to be not among the living. Their families have not given up hope that they would one day return. You know there are certain families who live in eternal hope.

Sir, one of our Provincial Council Members, Mansoor, was abducted on the 30th of January, 1990. The LTTE came and abducted him. They shot him and took him away and he never returned. Up to now his old mother whenever I go there says, "

." That is what she keeps saying. So how do we bring a closure to the suffering of these hundreds and thousands of mothers in this country?

Then there was Mr. U.L. Dawood of Aligar Central College. He was a former principal. He was also abducted and he never came back. It was on the day of Haj Festival that he was abducted. So there are hundreds and thousands of people from different communities who have gone missing. So we have to bring a a closure to that pain of mind. Some of the families are desirous of at least doing the last rites for those people according to their own religious beliefs. That has been prevented. So, it was with such lofty intentions, a very innocent and ordinary piece of legislation such as this has been brought about and I believe, this should not become a political tool in the hands of those people who want to use emotions and unnecessarily rouse emotions when a responsible Government is trying to be transparent about its conduct in front of the international community. It is time for us to stand up and be counted as a responsible international citizen before the international community. And that is the objective of this legislation, Mr. Presiding Member and I conclude my comments with those remarks.

Thank you. [.. 2.40]
