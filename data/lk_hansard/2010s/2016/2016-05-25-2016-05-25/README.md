) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, before we get on to the main item, there is an issue of Privilege that I want to bring to your notice. You can give a Ruling later because we have summoned Parliament today for the specific purpose of discussing the floods and the disaster that has taken place.

I want to bring to your notice that a petition has been filed and notice has been served on me contrary to the Constitution by Rear Admiral (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera and Prof. Wimaladharma Abeyewickreme against me and another number of Hon. Members of Parliament, on whose behalf I would like to take this up.

Hon. Speaker, on the 3rd of September, 2015 in Column 117 of Hansard, you made a Ruling on the Resolution regarding the National Government and what are the Parties for that. In accordance with that, I presented a Resolution and that Resolution was carried by the House. So, all that is over now. Your Ruling cannot be challenged now. It is part of the powers of the House and the Resolution has been carried.

I have been noticed to appear before courts or my counsel to appear before courts to answer something that I have done under the Ruling given by you, Hon. Speaker. It is very important to know what the petitioner has said in paragraph 1.7. He has said that he was the only Member of Parliament who voted against passing of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. He challenges this whole Resolution on how a National Government should be formed. But, he does not mention here that the Resolution has been passed. He has said that the purported determination made by Parliament is of no force or effect in law.

All these amounts to challenging the Ruling given by you in the House in exercising our powers under Article 4 (c) of the Constitution. When the decisions of the House are challenged it is a breach of privilege. It is done, I would say, wilfully because the petitioner does not disclose the Ruling given by you, Hon. Speaker. He is aware of it. Having been a Member of Parliament, he cannot say that he is not aware of it. It does not disclose the powers of Parliament that judicial power is vested in

us and it is through us the powers of Parliament have to be disclosed, even on a Fundamental Rights procedure. This is mala fide and wilfully done. Therefore, I would like you to go into this matter and give a Ruling on the breach of Privilege by Dr. Sarath Weerasekera and Prof. Abeywickrema and let this also serve as notice to the Supreme Court that the House is in cognizance of the matters raised by me. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Give me time to look into it, Hon. Prime Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) In relation to the matter raised by the Hon. Prime Minister, we would like to have a copy of it, so that we can express our views also. - [Interruption] No, that is another question that you are asking. I am only requesting you to give a copy to the Hon. Members or to the Party Leaders because if it is a matter in relation to the Privilege of Parliament we should have a copy, Hon. Prime Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) It is a breach of Privilege by a former Member of Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We will look into that. We will give you a copy of that. Thank you. .

There is a very important article written by Mr. Anton Nanayakkara, who is one of the eminent engineers in the field of irrigation in Sri Lanka; in which he quotes from our Cabinet Paper submitted for the development of the Kelani Valley. In that, there are two main areas where it was proposed to have outfalls, which have been ignored by the Megapolis Development Plan. So, all these matters should be taken into consideration.

Also I would like to make a proposal. , , . Our Soil Conservation Act has not been put into effect. It is virtually a dead document today and we have to revive that.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, please now wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) , , , . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you can table that. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) * , . : :: Rest of the speech tabled: According to findings of studies carried out for the Greater Colombo Basin an area of approximately 380 hectares of retention areas should be reserved together with Madiwela South Diversion and New Mutwal tunnel in order to maintain a safety flood level.

One of the main long-term remedial measure proposed aiming at reducing storm water runoff to the Parliament Lake catchment is the Madiwela South Diversion Scheme. The scheme envisages diverting storm water runoff from the upstream basin to the Bolgoda Basin. This scheme once implemented will result in a satisfactory drainage mediatory solution along with the Weras Ganga Scheme.

New Mutwal tunnel was proposed by the JICA study in 2003 for enhancing the draining out capacity of the Greater Colombo basin. A tunnel section with a 4.0m diameter and a length of 740m is proposed to run from Walls Lane to the outfall to the sea located on the seaside of the Muthwella Mawatha.

The construction of Gothatuwa pumping station is also identified as a vital solution for recession of flood in the Colombo Basin. This will reduce the water level of the downstream of Parliament Lake so that flow rate at the outlet of Parliament Lake will significantly increase giving rise to quick recession of floods in the Parliament catchment.

Widening of bridges in Wellawatta canal at High Level Road and Galle Road would significantly contribute for quick recession of floods in Colombo Basin which is a great hindrance to flow at these locations especially during floods.

Metro Colombo Urban Development Project is aimed at (i) reduce flooding in the catchment of the Colombo Water Basin, and (ii) strengthen the capacity of local authorities in the Colombo Metropolitan Area to rehabilitate, improve and maintain local infrastructure and services. One of the components of the project is flood and drainage management through improvements to flood and drainage management infrastructure in the Colombo Water Basin.

Recent floods

Swelling of the Kelanin River resulted in the severe flooding of the areas coming within the unprotected areas such as Kolonnawa, Gothatuwa, IDH etc.

Two flood protection bunds constructed along the banks of the Kealni River retains the water of the river during heavy rains. Bunds were constructed in the 1940s by the Department of irrigation. Bunds run from Nagalagam Street up Kaduwela along the banks of the Kelani River.

While the right bank bund is built along the river the left bank bund is built at a distance of about two kilometers of the left bank of the river. The area between the left bank of the river and the bund is designated as unprotected area covering approximately 30-square kilometer area in extent. The areas affected by the recent floods come within this area and is highly urbanized and densely populated.

Options

Possibility of constructing a protection bund along the left bank of the Kelani River to protect the unprotected area. The Climate Resilience Improvement Project (CRIP) is studying this. However this should be carefully assessed on the basis of impact that would be caused to upstream areas such as Hanwella and Awissawella.

Relocation of people and assets from unprotected area to mitigate the effects of floods. However relocation would be at an enormous cost and requires massive movement of people. Next best option is to build a protection bund along the left bank of the Kelani River and make the unprotected area as protected.

Zoning of the unprotected area to identify vulnerable levels and provide solutions.

Other matters

Damaged to life, property and other assets run in to thousands of millions and the rehabilitation and reconstruction effort would take months if not years. Restoring the civil life of the affected, relief measures, payment of compensation, repair and replacement of infrastructure requires well coordinated and concerted effort involving all stakeholders including the affected.

In addition persons affected by the recent floods are unable to exercise certain rights and enjoy certain benefits as a result of their inability to comply with certain existing legal requirements a special legislation is necessary to provide for -

1. the issue of death certificates to missing persons.

2. the exclusion of period of dispossession of property during floods for purpose of prescription.

3. special protection to land and property (tenants and leases)

4. any other incidental matters. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you. Hon. R. Sampanthan, please. You have ten minutes. [2.18a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

Sir, at the commencement of my speech, I wish to pay our deepest and most sincere sympathies to all the people who have been affected by this disaster that has occurred recently. A large number of people have died; a large number of people have gone missing; several tens of thousands of people have been displaced; a large number of houses have been destroyed and other assets have been destroyed. We feel very intensely for the people who have suffered this natural disaster and I think it must be acknowledged that the people have suffered immensely.

Most unfortunately, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as is usual, it is the weaker sections of the society who have suffered the most. That is what invariably happens. But that makes our responsibility even greater, because we have indeed a very sacred responsibility to look after the weaker sections of the society. Therefore, I would urge the Government to make its best efforts and to do everything that needs to be done to ensure that the suffering of these people is mitigated to the maximum possible extent. I would even go thus far and say that if the affluent sections of our society have to be called upon in some way to provide for the amelioration of the immense harm and difficulty that has been caused to the weaker sections of the society, the Government should not hesitate to take such action. Currently, we are concerned with relief and what needs to be done. I have not the slightest doubt that all concerned would do the maximum to ensure that these people are looked after as best as is possible. In due course of time, when we discharge our obligations by the people who have been affected and they themselves for the present come out of their difficulties, we all will begin to once again forget the natural disaster and the fact that a natural disaster can occur once again. I wish, in that context, Sir, to look at the larger picture.

Natural disasters are inevitable. They have happened in the past and they will continue to happen. The question I want to pose is to what extent are we prepared to face these natural disasters? To what extent are we prepared to give protection to the weaker sections of the society who are invariably the victims of these natural disasters? This is not something which can be done when the disaster is at our doorstep. It has to be accomplished in advance. Would it not be correct to say that the country faces the consequences of such disasters, and that such consequences of such disasters would be considerably mitigated if we were prepared to face the disaster in advance. Whether it be a flood or a landslide, advice should be sought from experts and plans must be prepared in disaster-prone areas to provide protection to the people - the poorer sections of the people - to enable them to be protected from such disasters. It is not sufficient for everyone to become active after the disaster has happened and people have suffered. What have you done in the past to mitigate the consequences of the disasters that have happened? What are the lessons we have learnt

consequent to what we have experienced in the past? Have we taken any steps to mitigate the consequences of these disasters? These are the questions that need to be answered. Specific plans should be implemented to avoid or at least minimize their impact. This, of course, Mr. Deputy Speaker, requires a great deal of study, a great deal of planning and a great deal of preparation, based upon the advice of experts, persons who are knowledgeable and we will require resources to implement these plans.

This is where I think, Sir, we are in a state of inability, because the fact of the matter is that we do not have the resources to be able to implement plans which can avoid or mitigate the disasters that happen naturally and the victims have been generally the poorer sections of the society. We are a heavily indebted country - both domestic and foreign. Our debt service ratio is in excess of the income that we derive.

We invest heavily on grandiose schemes, which we want implemented for one reason or another. Sometimes, for personal glory, we want these schemes to be implemented - airports, ports, airlines and various projects on which precious money belonging to the people is dumped - which do not generate income that such investments should normally generate. Consequently, the country is lacking in resources. Even in the matter of providing protection to our people from natural disasters, even if we do the studies and draw the plans we do not have wherewithal with us to implement those plans. That is why we have not been able to do anything in the past.

Therefore, I would urge, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that if we need to get over these difficulties we need to come together; we need to stand together. This country needs to be developed; this country needs to progress economically. The people should be prepared to invest in this country without fear; the people should be able to contribute to the development of this country both local and foreign. There must be foreign investment, and if foreign investment is to come, there must be stability in this country; there must be permanent peace in this country and the people must be confident that they can invest in this country. It is only then that we will be able to muster the resources that would enable us to accomplish such programmes. This country needs to be put on a better footing, Sir, and that can be done only when we come together and we all get together in the better interest of this country.

Sir, before I conclude, I want to make just one small point. That is, the districts that have been badly affected have been identified by international sources and we must ensure that all the districts that have been badly affected are included in any special programme that will be implemented in regard to providing the necessary relief to the people and those districts.

Thank you.

VELU KUMAR took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie please. [3.14p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Sir, we are destined to witness one of the greatest natural calamities during our lifetime. The ravages of floods and landslides have rendered lakhs of people homeless and their dwellings washed away and lives lost.

We have seen the worst destruction as a result of the Tsunami on 26th December, 2004.

Some of the worst affected areas fall within the administrative units of Kolonnawa, Kaduwela, Biyagama, Malwana, Akurana, Aranayake and Kadugannawa. We have also witnessed people overflowing with the of milk of human kindness. The operation of massive relief work undertaken by the Government and the voluntary organizations cutting across race, caste, religion and other boundaries have displayed a great sense of urgency mounting extraordinary charitable disposition in helping the victims of this calamity.

If you harm the nature, the nature would harm you. This is the axiom that environmentalists follow the world over. There are "Green Clubs" formed in other countries to protect their environment. Cutting down trees indiscriminately, building unauthorized houses along the banks of rivers, filling up paddy fields and other such lands were the main causes for floods. This must be stopped forthwith. I am happy that His Excellency the President has declared these affected areas as "High Security Zones" so that the people will not be able to create environmental problems.

We, as the Government, are committed to serve those who affected by the disaster and we express ourHhhhHHH gratitude and respect to all those voluntary organizations and individuals who have rallied round to extend their genuine help to their brethren who yearned for immediate help. Whilst thanking the Government, particularly the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Police for the great humanitarian services they carried out so magnificently, I think, it is also the prime duty of the Government to take immediate action to prevent the occurrence of such disasters in the future.

The Divisional Secretaries and their staff also should receive our appreciation for the untiring services they are rendering to afford redress to the victims. Disaster also struck with ferocious velocity to the mountainous region of Arnanayake, Kadugannawa and surrounding places and the up-country plantation areas, completely burying human lives with their houses.

As instructed by President His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, all government machinery should be geared to speed up the rehabilitation and reconstruction work, providing house equipment and clothing and paying compensation to the flood and landslide victims.

I am personally aware that a large number of people have lost everything in life. They went to office in the morning and returned home to see their houses submerged in flood waters and all their belongings gone forever. They were left with only the clothes they were wearing. Action must be taken to rebuild their houses and household equipment and utensils should be provided. The affected government servants, employees in corporations and private sector employees should also

437 438

2016 25

be helped. Teachers, doctors, media personnel and all of them must be given immediate relief. I know several media personnel have not only lost their dwellings but also their cameras, video equipment and other wherewithal due to the floods. I know personally that some media personnel had lost equipment to the tune of millions of rupees. It is our duty to help them all. Attention should also be drawn to the thousands of school children who have lost their uniforms, books and other school equipment.

I suggest that all the government servants, corporation employees, doctors and teachers in the affected areas must be given leave covering the whole period. Scientists have predicted that in 2060 there will be a massive flood drowning the whole world and the United States will suffer most. We have to be very careful of that prediction.

I also pay a compliment to the friendly countries such as Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia and other Arab States, Iran, Australia, Japan, the United States, China, Nepal and the Maldives who displayed a great sense of charity in pouring assistance to about 600,000 people. Let us all get together and look after the interests of the poor people.

Let us in a somber mood remind ourselves of the saying of Al-Quran Sura Al-Zilzaal. The Sura 99 states, I quote:

When the Earth is shaken to her (utmost) convulsion, And the Earth throws up her burdens (from within), And man cries (distressed); What is the matter with her?

These natural disasters give us ample ideas of that supreme world-shaking event. May we pray for the mercy and blessings of the Almighty! Thank you.

! [4.50 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity. First of all, I would like to convey my deepest sympathies to the families of which members have passed away and all those who have been suffering. I must thank His Excellency President, Hon. Prime Minister and especially, the Hon. Minister Risad Badhiutheen. I know him for a long time. He is a hard worker and has been doing very well.

Sir, I come from the Puttalam District, where over 4,000 people have been affected by this disaster. There, the Government Agent along with the officials and the NGOs have been doing a very good job and so far the situation has been satisfactory.

Sir, I would like to bring to your notice the problems in the Puttalam District. Every six months, we have to face this problem. There are three major rivers and five irrigation schemes carrying all the water that comes down from Anamaduwa and Kurunegala to the lagoon and the sea at Puttalam. We have been really suffering as a result of frequent floods. I have informed the Hon. Minister also. There are well over 16,000 acres of agricultural land in Puttalam. In every flood situation, we have been suffering. It is not a problem of coconut plantation only, but also other agricultural lands, where 50 per cent of the farmers have been suffering severe losses.

Sir, as you know, Kala-Oya flows into the lagoon through Puttalam and in addition to this, when it overflows, the two villages, Gange Wadiya and Eluwankulama, always go under water. I have pleaded and I have informed His Excellency President and the Hon. Prime Minister that we have to relocate them. That will have to be done. The Hon. Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa also knows about this. We have been representing Wayamba right from the start. We know each other.

469 470

[ ]

2016 25

This 16,000 acres of land, which supplies 25 per cent of the agricultural products must be protected. That is my request. Last time also, when we suffered losses, I informed the Hon. Minister. I propose that additional interest be taken regarding this to help us preserve this 16,000 acres of agricultural land. I have already informed my leader, the Hon. Minister Risad Badhiutheen, and we hope to meet him because the loss suffered by farmers is not a small amount. If it is coconut, rubber or whatever, they invest about Rs. 2 million to 3 million and if the water stagnates for just two or three days, the whole crop will be lost. It is a big amount and as I said, 25 per cent of the agricultural products are coming from that area. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister also to look into this and help us.

I thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. The next speaker is, the Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah.
