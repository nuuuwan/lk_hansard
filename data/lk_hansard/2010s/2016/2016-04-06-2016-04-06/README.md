Hon. Speaker, as you are aware, during the last three decades, period commencing 1st of May, 1983 till the 18th of May, 2009, there had been so many persons who had been affected and whom we have defined as disadvantaged persons. They have lost possession of their immovable property long before, but still, they could have vindicated their rights by filing for vindicatory action or through some other remedy in the normal course of the law. But, as a result of their inability to go for such action, which was beyond their control, or their inability to go to court within the limited time period as permitted in the Prescription Ordinance - which is within ten years - they could not either take over the possession of their property or acquire their title. We see this is as a very unreasonable situation as the law had been drafted as far back in 1871 by adopting the Roman-Dutch Law in relation to the subject of prescription, under which they have fixed the restrictive time period as ten years to acquire the title in respect of immovable property. That is a reasonable time period; it is a lengthy time period. But,

taking into consideration the time period of the war spanning over almost three decades in our country, that ten-year period is not sufficient. Therefore, we have suggested certain exclusions in the operation of the Prescription Ordinance with regard to people who have been disadvantaged or with regard to those who have been affected as a result of the war or the ethnic conflict, that they must be given the right to vindicate their title for the lands they have been owning, sometimes, from generation to generation. Therefore, Sir, we are making this special provision in the law to safeguard the rights of the disadvantaged or the affected people as a result of the war. I hope the Hon. Members of this House will support this Bill, which will give relief to a substantial number of people who have lost their properties during that period. Thank you very much.

. . Question proposed. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, might I just get a clarification? In Clause 6 of the Bill, there is an interpretation which states " 'activities of any militant terrorist group' means any act which is defined as a 'terrorist act' in the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005;". Now, I have that Act here with me, but that Act has no such definition. The Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 does not define a terrorist act. So, there is a serious flaw in this as the Clause throws it back to this Act and that Act does not have it. Neither does the Convention. I just looked at the Convention itself adopted in December, 1999 in the UN. Even that does not have a definition. So, insofar as the reference in Clause 6 that the definition of "terrorist act" should be as defined in Act, No. 25 of 2005 is erroneous, will you look into that before the- () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Certainly. I am thankful to the Hon. Member. This is a Bill that had been presented to Parliament initially in 2014, but we could not have it passed. Subsequently, during the 100-day period of the last Government also, we were trying to adopt it, but we could not do it because we did not have the majority. Now, I am thankful to the Hon. Member. If it is so, we can look into the definition

1085 1086

2016 06

at the Committee Stage. We will discuss it with the Hon. Member and the other Members also. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In view of this lacuna that seems to be there in the definition, if I may raise one other matter, in the Bill, the time period that has been specified is from May 1st 1983 to May 18th 2009. There is obviously a reason why you have started it from May, 1983. But, the events that happened in 1983 may not be caught up and the persons disadvantaged in July, 1983 and the following months may not actually get any advantage through this Act, although that seems to be the intention, because of the restricted interpretation that you find again in Clause 6.

So, if you can look at these two matters, we can bring in appropriate amendments at the Committee Stage. The first matter I raised is a serious issue because if there is no definition in the other Act, you cannot enact it in this form. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Certainly, we will include that interpretation. We will discuss it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) And also, if you include the persons who were disadvantaged in 1983, then the definition will have to be slightly broader than this. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) That is correct. We can do it, Hon. Member. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. [1.53 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity given to speak on this subject. I thank the Hon. Minister for clarifying the issues that I raised. This is a very important piece of legislation, I agree, and I am thankful that the Hon. Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana has introduced it today. As he rightly said, this has been in the offing for a long time in a form of a Bill, at least from

2014 or even before that. But I remember, in the late 1990s itself - particularly the ten-year period from October, 1990 - that is the time in which several persons were forcibly driven out of the Northern Province and when they could not get back to their original habitats for a period of ten years, in 1999 very particularly, this issue came up because they were forcibly kept out of the Northern Province for almost ten years and all of their properties would be prescribed too by others and that even if this situation is changed, they would not be able to get their properties back. I remember a proposal was made and the Law Commission actually drafted a Bill and promoted it. For some reason or another, that was never enacted at that stage. October, 2000 came and went and that disability continued.

Now, it is sixteen years after that, and almost 26 years after that forced eviction of the Muslims from the Northern Province, we have at least this Special Provisions Law which would enable not only them, but several others. As the Hon. Minister was pleased to point out, many people in the North and the East were forced to flee the situation that prevailed during that time and as a result their rights in relation to their immovable property became extinguished because of the application of the Prescription Ordinance which has a time limitation for vindicating the rights in relation to immovable property - different periods of time in relation to different rights. Ownership right, as the Hon. Minister pointed out, goes out in ten years, but there are other rights, servitude rights et cetera, which have shorter lifespan and all of them would have been extinguished due to the protracted conflict, a situation in which - for reasons beyond their control - they could not go to court to vindicate their rights.

By this Bill, there is a window being given now - it is a (Special Provisions) Bill - a window of one years time, which I think is a salutary thing. It does not actually seek to amend the Prescription Ordinance for all time, but makes a dent in it, opens a window as it were, so that those who were disadvantaged and left without any remedy, can, within this period of one year, vindicate their right if they are interested. There may be several persons who may not be interested, but there are others who probably had just one piece of property or only land that they could have their livelihood on and so on and so forth, and they are enabled now to exercise their right within the period of one year; from the date this Bill, if enacted into law, becomes operative, within one year, to go to the appropriate court and vindicate whatever right that they may have had.

I have a few concerns which I just clarified with the Hon. Minister. I am also raising the same concerns from a slightly different angle as well and I would urge the Hon. Minister to please consider those concerns as well and if amendments are necessitated at the Committee Stage by what I said earlier, then, take in these concerns also.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair. , [ ] . , , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. THILANGA SUMATHIPALA] took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, please continue. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. I was saying there are some other concerns associated with this phraseology. I will read the Preamble. Whereas certain persons have been disadvantaged and therefore unable to pursue their rights in court for the recovery of any immovable property including land.."

And then it says,

"..due to the activities of a militant terrorist group during the period ..

It becomes incumbent, then, on any plaintiff or petitioner or applicant who goes to any particular court to establish that they were unable to pursue their rights in court due to the activities of a militant terrorist group. Now, I would urge the Hon. Minister to consider the fact that that is a very high order. How does one prove that it is not due to any other attending circumstances, but almost as though a militant terrorist group came and held a gun to your head and chased you out of your land?

It is not due to a particular condition that prevailed or some deaths that occurred in that area. If your neighbours were found dead one morning, you may have fled the area. You will not be able to prove that those were only due to the "activities of a militant terrorist group" and how does one define that? That is why I refer to the "Interpretation" - Clause 6 of the Prescription (Special Provisions) Act - which says 'activities of any militant terrorist group' means any act which is defined as a 'terrorist act' in the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005". Lo and behold, there is no such definition in that Act! So, it makes worse when we do not have a definition for the word, "terrorist act", which is supposed to be the same meaning as the "activities of any militant terrorist group". Anybody for that matter would be able to first pass that threshold. This is a (Special Provisions) Act to enable certain

disadvantaged persons to now have a remedy. This is the gateway through which they can enter the court. Otherwise, they are out of time; they are woefully out of time. Even the longest possible time period prescribed is ten years, that maybe 20 to 25 years late. When they have to enter through that narrow gate that is provided in this section, that narrow gate says, You must show that you were unable to do this due to the activities of a militant terrorist group. Now, what is a "militant group"? What is a "terrorist group" and what is a "militant terrorist group"? Can there be a terrorist group that is not militant? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, can I make a clarification? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, please. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, when I made my speech, you raised a very important point with regard to the definition of certain words given in the Act. The Hon. Member said that there is no definition for "terrorist act" in the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005. But that Act has been subsequently amended by Act, No. 3 of 2013. In that amended Act, there is a definition for terrorist act. I quote Clause 5 (2) of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No.3 of 2013 for the convenience: terrorist act means- (a) an act which constitutes an offence within the scope of or within the definition of any one of the Treaties specified in Schedule I to this Act; (b) any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury, to civilians or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities, in a situation of armed conflict or otherwise and the purpose of such act, by its nature or context is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization, to do or to abstain from doing any act; or (c) the use or threat of action- (i) which is designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public; and (ii) which is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological purpose, and such action, (aa) involves serious violence against a person; (bb) involves serious damage to property; (cc) endangers the life of another person, other than the person committing the action; (dd) creates a serious risk to health or safety

1089 1090

2016 06

of the public or a section of the public; or (ee) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system..

This is the definition given. I agree with Hon. Member because that definition is not in the Act. No. 25 of 2005. It has been brought in to the Act by Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 3 of 2013. As a matter of clarification, we can insert the term that the original Act has been amended by Act No. such and such. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am thankful to the Hon. Minister for that clarification given so immediately and, I must say that the definition read out by the Hon. Minster is fairly broad. My other concerns as to the narrow gateway are widen a little, because it seems to catch-up the activities of any militant group.

Nevertheless, would the Hon. Minister also consider not attaching it to the activities of a group, but to the general situation that prevailed? Now, this, I say from the second concern that I raised at the end of your speech, of which, the intention is to take in the disadvantaged persons from 1983. And also, the Hon. Minister would remember that at one stage, this draft confined the applicability of this legislation to the North and East. Then, it was considered "not good legislation" to have a law applicable only to some parts of the country, and I agree. I think, at the Consultative Committee during the last Parliament, we discussed it and we all agreed that a law cannot have territorial application within a country. But, if the intention, which is very clear, is to catch-up 1983-situation as well, then this definition of "activities of a militant terrorist group" may not suffice to grant relief to those persons, because there was countrywide violence. That violence was perpetrated not by a particular militant group, but broadly speaking - in insurance language it was riot, strike and civil commotion. The situation in July, 1983 was not confined to one militant groups activities. So, the intention in the Preamble, I say, would not be met if we still maintain this definition of "a militant terrorist group" because disadvantaged persons in 1983, will not be caught up in that.

While thanking the Hon. Minister for acting swiftly on my earlier concern, might I ask him again to please consider that aspect of the matter also before the end of the day, and if possible, since you are anyway going to bring in a clarification and say, "as amended by Act, No.3 of 2013" do some other revision which actually enables your intention to be met with regard to the timeframe that you have specified in the Preamble.

With those comments, I will conclude my speech and hope that at the Committee Stage, we can agree on an appropriate language to this definition.

Thank you, Sir.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, I am glad that you said that the tender procedure is going to be looked into again. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We raised some concerns. When you raise concerns of propriety, that does not mean that we are refusing the offer. That is far from it. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Then, why are you getting up? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All what we say is that we are very grateful that the Government is doing this - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Very good. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, do it in a manner even without any appearance of fraud, so that we can also receive it with a clear conscience. So, we are thankful to the Government, but we want it done properly. Under this project a house costs Rs. 2.1 million. We have built houses for Rs. 700,000; houses that last for three generations have been built for Rs. 700,000. I have visited one of these model houses. I have shaken it and it is shaking. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Is that so? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In a year, it will break and fall. I have tabled in this House the pictures where the joints have come apart in that model house. I have already tabled that picture. If it is a temporary shelter, then it should cost much less than Rs. 700,000. Why is it costing three times the value? And, it will not last even one-third of the time that the other houses will last. So, we are raising those concerns.

1093 1094

When we raise those concerns, do not tell us, If you do not want, then leave it. I do not think that should be the spirit with which the Government should approach this subject. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Do you appreciate the fact that these houses will be given to the people? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. John Amaratunga, you are running short of your time. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is all right. This is a valuable discussion. He is raising some valid points. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Governor of the Northern Province has written raising his concerns. The Northern Provincial Council has passed a Resolution and written a letter. We will also write, as the Hon. Minister said when I spoke the other day - I have already spoken on this. Take those concerns into consideration. That is all that we are saying. Do not rush in and do this. The questions that I am raising are valid questions. How can a house that will not last 10 years cost three times more than a house that will last three generations? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is one factor. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Plantation Industries) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Navin Dissanayake. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)Hon. Member, I agree with everything what you say. This was discussed in todays Cabinet Meeting also. I

have just one point to tell you. That is, the current offer comes with a very attractive financial package where Rs. 2 million is also given for the house. If we go for another offer, we may not get that financial package and the Government will have to commit the building of the house, brick house or whatever. So, given the financial constraints, you appreciate that - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is true that financial constraints are there. But take everything into consideration. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)That is right. We are fully cognizant of your views, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We appreciate the concerns expressed by you. You are on the spot. We are outside. So, it is your remarks and your ideas that the President and the Prime Minister will go into and certainly they are concerned to ensure that there is quality in whatever we do. Otherwise, we have to have moneys worth. But, you must understand that the people of the North and the East are very happy that the Government has decided to put up these 65,000 houses. - [Interruption.] Therefore, as he says, do not allow it to get disrupted also. We will do it with responsibility.

. . Hon. Minister, I request you to introduce alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, because most of these disputes happen to be between people at the grassroots level. Therefore, in addition to the benefit that is sought to be conferred on the people, I urge the Hon. Minister to consider introducing additional alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to resolve some of the problems that are at the grassroots level of our society.

, , "secondary occupation" . .

Sir, in conflict environments it is common to experience secondary occupation of property. In countries like Bosnia, Kosovo and Rwanda secondary occupation posed a serious threat to reintegration and reconciliation in post-conflict situations. This applies to Sri Lanka as well. It has also been found that secondary occupation of land and houses raises social tension among members in a society as well.

The subject of secondary occupation of property has been subjected to extensive discussion and research in Sri Lanka and other parts of the world. Bosnia, Herzegovina, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Guatemala are some of those countries. In some countries like Bosnia and Kosovo, the agencies have successfully implemented property restitution programmes. Here, they follow strictly the guidelines set out in the "Pinheiro Principles," which have been adopted as guiding principles on land and housing restitution.

One of the incidental issues arising out of secondary occupation of property is the impact of restitution which will have on the secondary occupant.

, , . . Although the occupation of property belonging to others is an unlawful act, there are other circumstances that necessitate a more flexible approach to the resolution of this complex issue.
