In the last decade, investments were maintained at 30.1 per cent of GDP, but the bulk of it came from the public sector. This resulted in the country carrying a debt burden of almost 76 per cent of the GDP, which is higher than that of our peers. At the same time, private sector investments have been stagnant. However, given the fiscal constraints that the large debt burden has imposed on us, I do not think that it is prudent to continue in the same vein and pile up more debt. The alternative is to facilitate more private sector investments and partnerships between the private and the public sector. We must promote investments in areas where the impact to the economy is high, due to value addition and employment creation. We will support domestic entrepreneurs especially in sectors such as Agriculture, Manufacturing, Fisheries, Ornamental Fisheries, Solar Panel Manufacturing, Rolling Stocks, Livestock, Poultry and Tourism.",

The challenge is therefore to ensure that the net earnings from tourism increase. It is in this context that the Government has identified the key tourism corridors from Trincomalee to Pasikudha to Batticaloa to Arugam Bay, the Monaragala Ella corridor, the Chilaw - Kalpitiya zone and the corridor from the Dedduwa Lake to the Akurala area. Further, Ella, Bandarawela and Haputale have been identified as an eco-tourism triangle. We will create the enabling environment by providing the necessary infrastructure and the regulatory framework. In fact, to support the eco-tourism triangle, we have already initiated feasibility study on a domestic airport in the Badulla District or simultaneously we are also exploring the process of linking Badulla District to the Southern Expressway.",

Given that the banks must start meeting the requirements of Basel III by 2019, the Government is of the view that consolidation of financial institutions will be beneficial in the long-term and as such, encourages voluntary consolidation especially for the private banks. Such consolidation of banks will enhance the size of the banks, facilitate the fund-raising from diversified sources, enhance risk taking capacities and enable banks to participate in large state and private sector projects to a greater degree than at present and derive scale benefits with regard to operational costs. In this regard, we must ensure that our banks are well capitalized. Hence, I propose to increase the minimum capital of Licensed Commercial Banks to Rs. 20,000 million, Licensed Specialized Banks to Rs. 7,500 million and Primary Dealers to Rs. 1, 500 million.",

In addition, funds were also released to facilitate rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged houses under this insurance scheme. This enabled the Government to meet the cost of emergency relief during the recent floods and landslides without creating an unnecessary impact on the Government fiscal operations. Given the success of this innovative venture, I propose to increase the coverage to Rs. 15 billion and as such, I propose to allocate an additional sum of Rs. 200 million to meet the cost of the premium.

There is significant potential to increase the export proceeds at least by fivefold in the next 3 - 5 years, through the export of not only raw crabs, lobsters, prawns oysters, etc. but also through value addition, including canning and processing. In this regard, to promote Aquaculture Industry Zones in Hambantota, Mannar and Batticaloa, I propose to allocate Rs. 500 million. I also encourage the introduction of new technology to multi-day boats with the aim of improving operational efficiency and reducing post-harvest losses. To support the fishery industry further, I encourage the construction of a cold room with a capacity of 1,000 metric tonnes, on a PPP basis at the Dikowita Fishery Harbour. At the same time, to uplift the infrastructure of fishery harbours and anchorages, a sum of Rs. 1,350 million has already been allocated. Further, I propose to allocate Rs. 100 million for the Gandara Fishery Harbor Development Project.",

Statistics indicate that only around 35,000 students out of the balance 150,000-200,000 students will pursue higher education at the Open University, in foreign universities, or at private non-State higher education institutes. This would mean that almost another 150,000 students annually will not be able to pursue higher education. However, given that we are aggressive in implementing a strategy of becoming a knowledge hub, we must expand the opportunities for more of our young men and women to pursue higher education. This calls for urgent action. Since coming into office, we have increased the funds allocated for education significantly, but one must be pragmatic if we are to expand the opportunities for university education.

These students will be required to work in rural schools for at least 3 years. However, should they leave such rural schools before the end of the 3 years they will be required to pay the loan with interest. Our initial aim will be to extend this loan scheme to 5,000 students and as such, I propose to allocate Rs. 100 million for this purpose.",

In the modern service industry, given our competitive advantage, we are best placed to attract the Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO), Legal Process Outsourcing (LPO) and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry into the country. However, the KPO, LPO and BPO industry requires flexible labour hours, including work at night, part time work and work from home. Already the wages of the IT and the Tourism sectors are quite high, and given the potential growth prospects, the wages will only see an upward trajectory. We must acknowledge that with the development of technology, the employment opportunities too have changed drastically. However, to unleash the significant potential that technology affords us especially in the service industry, revisions to the labour laws are necessary. Such revisions, let me assure you, will not compromise the security of jobs but will instead ensure the creation of well-paid jobs, which we must make available especially to our young men and women. I am encouraged by the response of the Jathika Wruthiya Samithi Peramuna (JWSP), in recommending changes for the rapid development of the labour laws, given both the employer and the employee agree to;",

In the last decade, investments were maintained at 30.1 per cent of GDP, but the bulk of it came from the Public Sector. This resulted in the country carrying a debt burden of almost 76 per cent of the GDP, which is higher than that of our peers. At the same time, private sector investments have been stagnant. However, given the fiscal constraints that the large debt burden has imposed on us, I do not think that it is prudent to continue in the same vein and pile up more debt. The alternative is to facilitate more private sector investments and partnerships between the private and the public sector. We must promote investments in areas where the impact to the economy is high, due to value addition and employment creation. We will support domestic entrepreneurs especially in sectors such as Agriculture, Manufacturing, Fisheries, Ornamental Fisheries, Solar Panel Manufacturing, Rolling Stocks, Livestock, Poultry and Tourism.",

Given that, the banks must start meeting the requirements of Basel III by 2019, the Government is of the view that consolidation of financial institutions will be beneficial in the long-term and as such, encourages voluntary consolidation especially for the private banks. Such consolidation of banks will enhance the size of the banks, facilitate the fund raising from diversified sources, enhance risk taking capacities and enable banks to participate in large state and private sector projects to a greater degree than at present and derive scale benefits with regard to operational costs. In this regard, we must ensure that our banks are well capitalized. Hence, I propose to increase the minimum capital of Licensed Commercial Banks to Rs. 20,000 million, Licensed Specialized Banks to Rs. 7,500 million and Primary Dealers to Rs. 1, 500 million.",

As a result, during the recent floods and landslides, NITF paid almost Rs. 3,000 million to the Government to cover the costs of providing emergency relief to around 400,000 people who were affected. In addition, funds were also released to facilitate rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged houses under this insurance scheme. This enabled the Government to meet the cost of emergency relief during the recent floods and landslides without creating an unnecessary impact on the Government fiscal operations. Given the success of this innovative venture, I propose to increase the coverage to Rs. 15 billion and as such, I propose to allocate an additional sum of Rs. 200 million to meet the cost of the premium. I understand that this scheme is now being looked at by the World Bank as an innovative mechanism.",
