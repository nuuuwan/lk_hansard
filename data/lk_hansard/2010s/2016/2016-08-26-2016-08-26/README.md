asked the Minister of Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs:

(a) Will he inform this House-

(i) whether refugee camps are maintained by the Government in the Northern and Eastern Provinces;

(ii) if so, separately, the locations of the said camps and the number of people and families housed in them;

(iii) separately, in respect of each camp, the amount of money allocated for the people in the said camps; and

(iv) separately, the assistance given to each of those individuals and families per month?

(b) Will he also inform this House-

(i) separately, if the lands or houses belonging to these refugees are occupied by the Government, private institutions or other individuals, details of same and the number of refugees to whom such houses / lands belong; and

(ii) separately, in respect of each camp, the number of persons amongst these refugees who do not have a land or a house for residence?

(c) If not, why? .. ( ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Sir, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) Yes.

(ii) There are 31 welfare camps situated in

seven Divisional Secretaries' Divisions of Jaffna District. Nine hundred and thirty six families consisting 3,260 members are living in these welfare camps.

(iii) Ministry allocates funds annually to provide

sanitation, electricity, drinking water and garbage cleaning facilities to the welfare camps and implements it through the Divisional Secretariats. To provide drinking water, sanitation and electricity facilities to welfare camps, Rs. 3,798,867 has been allocated in 2016. Details are as follows :

Tellippalai Welfare Centre - 1,415,000.00

Point Pedro Welfare Centre - 531,752.00

Nallur Welfare Centre - 37,975.00 (iv) Provision of dry rations to these families

who are living in welfare camps was stopped from 2011. A Cabinet Paper was submitted on 10.01.2016 by this Ministry for the provision of dry rations and approval was also obtained. But, instruction was received from the Treasury that only Recurrent Expenditure could be utilized for provision of dry rations. Dry rations were not provided because of the shortage of Recurrent Expenditure of the Ministry. However, some selected families were given livelihood assistance under the Ministrys Livelihood Support Programme after considering their poverty. Most of the families are now engaged in fishing and labour work as their livelihood. So, really speaking, they are earning their living on their own by doing labour work. (b) (i) Lands of 254 families out of 936 families

who are living in the welfare camps have been occupied by State forces and these lands have not yet been released. The Annex consists of all those particulars. Sir, I table* the Annex. (ii) Six hundred and eighty two families out of

936 do not own lands or houses. Actions are being taken to provide lands with housing facilities to those landless families in the welfare camps.

(c) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) .

" 31 32 . " . . " . . ." . ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Member, as I mentioned, livelihood provisions have been made to certain families who really live in

poverty. That has been done. If there are any other facilities that they need, they should write to us and we will provide those accordingly. It is better for them to write to the Ministry so that we can look into the matter.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) But, in your Answer, you mentioned that you are not giving dry rations.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, we are not. I gave you the explanation why dry rations were not given. It comes under Recurrent Expenditure and as such, I am unable to provide that with this years allocation. But, if these welfare camps continue into the next year - I hope not because we are trying to get rid of all the welfare camps as soon as possible - I will make provisions to give them dry rations from the allocation given to my Ministry.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) .

. . ? ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) But, in the Question you have asked, you have not specifically mentioned about the Poonthottam Camp. That is why I have not answered that question. If you specifically ask me another Question on another day, I can certainly reply to that.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) I have clearly mentioned "North and East", not only in Jaffna.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you only referred to the North. So, maybe, you can clarify that later, if you do not have the data now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) That is correct, Sir. I will clarify it and reply later. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Is that all right, Hon. Member? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Shall I table that later or shall I clarify and give it to you, Hon. Member?

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) You can table it at the next Sitting day without any questions from my side.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) There was a key person from the private sector. He was virtually an honorary member of the committee.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) He was an honorary member by law. I must say in fairness, I know, that they were told to do this. When they came in, they said, We had approved it. So, they had gone along with it. I think that statement should suffice for his case. I regret what has happened to him. He is a friend of mine. But, that was a court order. The fact is, here, we are not talking about the private sector man. The Hon. Member is talking about the people who went in from the Treasury. So, I do not think this is a big issue in the country and they should not make it an issue. At some stage, the court order did it, not that we did these things. FCID . .

asked the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply:

(a) Is he aware that - (i) although mass-scale drinking water supply projects have been implemented by the Government to solve the drinking water problem, one of the serious problems in the Anuradhapura District, those have not yielded the expected results; (ii) over 25,000 people in this district suffer from chronic kidney disease and 11,000 of them lead their lives in fatal condition; (iii) diseases of this type occur as a result of chemicals such as cadmium mixing with drinking water; and (iv) the water purifiers installed at present with a view to combatting chronic kidney disease are not sufficient?

(b) Will he inform this House -

(i) whether a new programme would be implemented to provide drinking water to the areas affected by the drinking water problem;

(ii) if so, the date it will be implemented; and

(iii) the date when water purifiers would be provided to the areas where chronic kidney disease patients are found in abundance?

[2.13 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I had the good fortune of knowing the late Hon. M. K. A. D. S. Gunawardana for a long time. He and I represented the Trincomalee District in Parliament and I had the good fortune of being able to develop a close relationship with him and to maintain

2005 2006

close contact with him as co-Members of Parliament from the same District.

He was a simple person who maintained a close contact with the people in the District. He maintained a close contact not merely with the Sinhalese people who voted for him, but also maintained a close contact with the Tamil people, particularly the Tamil people who live in the Seruwila Electorate and there are a considerable number of Tamil people who live in the Seruwila Electorate. The late Hon. Gunawardana always made it a point to maintain a close contact with those people in different parts of the Seruwila Electorate in the Trincomalee District. He tried his very best to get along with the people. He sometimes talked tough, but he was basically and essentially a soft and simple person easy to get along with.

He was also a person who was guided in his political conduct by certain principles. He endeavoured to stand up for what was right. I think that was demonstrated when the Presidential Election in 2015 came about and when there was a split in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and our present President became the joint opposition candidate and walked out of the SLFP Government led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The late Hon. Gunawardana was one of those Members of Parliament of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who walked out with him and supported him at that election, which took place in 2015. I think the Hon. Gunawardana was guided by certain principles when he took that decision. There was no guarantee that the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena would be the winner. The Hon. Gunawardana was holding a position already as a Member of Parliament in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party under the former Government and there was an element of risk in that decision he took, but he nevertheless took that decision because I think he realized, as many of us did, that the country was moving towards a dictatorship, the country was ceasing to be a united country and people felt excluded. All the people who lived in this country did not feel included, part of an inclusive society and part of a country in which they had a place. There was inequality, there was injustice amongst the different people who lived in this country and it was in that background, I think, that the present President, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena walked out of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and became the joint opposition candidate. It was also in that background that Hon. Gunawardana himself took a bold decision to abandon his party, to leave his party and come out and oppose the candidate of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party at that point of time - His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. That was a bold decision and a decision indicative of his character, his determination and his will to do the right thing. I remember, I met him at that time and he was very firm in regard to the decision he had taken.

Well, Sir, we are moving now in a different direction. It is our expectation that we will be able to complete this journey successfully, that we will be able to transform this country into a country in which all people who live in this country have a sense of equality, a feeling that justice

is being done, that they are part and parcel of this country, that this country belongs to them, that they belongs to this country and that they can live in this country as equal citizens. I think the Hon. Gunawardana played a remarkable role in bringing about the situation where we commenced that journey.

Sir, I have many thoughts about the Hon. Gunawardana. He was a person who was generally very kind and though he sometimes appeared to be a tough person, he was essentially a very kind and simple person.

I join this House, Sir, in expressing our deepest condolences to Mrs. Gunawardana and the family members over this sad bereavement in their family and may I request that condolences of this House be conveyed to the family.

Thank you.

[4.21 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to take part in the Vote of Condolence of my dear Friend, the late Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana.

In 1978, after the victory of the UNP, under the leadership of the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, he came into politics. We, the late Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana and I, started our politics under the leadership of the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Actually, it was a very difficult time, but without any fear, he started his political career. I too was with him.

In 1989, I remember, we contested and even though I lost by a few hundred votes, he was elected to Parliament. Till 1994, we built up the party; he was responsible for building up the party. Then onwards, he rose up, organized and helped the party and he was always there. Later on, I remember, due respect was given to him with a place in the Governments of Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike and President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Not only did he organize the party and form the Government, but also looked after the interests of the people in the party.

However, during the last SLFP Government, under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, due respect was not given to him. We were grumbling in frustration. That is why after being in that party for such a long period, for almost 25 to 30 years, I remember, that every time we met, he used to say, I do not know, the party that we organized and formed, we may have to leave. Finally, due to the problems and frustrations, he left the party, for which he suffered for so long, along with His Excellency the President.

I went and helped him at the last Provincial Council Election. I was put to Kinniya. When I went to his electorate and to his house, I was shocked to see that he was living in a small house. I asked him, Amathithuma, why is this? He said, I am a villager. I want to lead the life of a villager. That is why I am living in this village. Until I die, I will live in this village. I can still remember that. We were friends right throughout. During that election, I was put to Kinniya and Mutur, both of which are Muslim areas. There were a lot of Muslims who were

saying, "Definitely, our first manape will go to 'M.K.A.D.S'." The reason why they said that was because during the time of the war, Kinniya was facing a lot of problems created by the LTTE and every time the village was affected, whether he was a Minister or a Member of Parliament, he was one of the first Members of Parliament to go there. He helped not only the Muslims, but all communities living in that area. That was the attitude of this late gentleman, whom the people of Mutur and Kinniya will never forget.

I remember, when he was a Minister, I used to go to his Ministry. There, I could see many people from almost all over the country. Even then, he was sick. But, sometimes, he used to go for his lunch around 3.00 p.m. or 3.30 p.m. I also stayed with him. I used to ask him, Why is this?" He said, "People come from places miles and miles away to meet me. So, my going out for lunch is not going to help them. That was his attitude. Every time, he used to tell his officers, "I do not want to see these people coming back again with the same problem. So, try to solve their problems". That was one good characteristic I saw in him.

He also helped me with the political activities of my electorate. I can remember, during the last General Election, the Hon. Prime Minister came to Puttalam for an election meeting. The late Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana was not scheduled to speak at that meeting, but suddenly, he came to Puttalam and told me, You have been a friend for a long period and have been together with us in politics. During the last two elections, you came to my electorate and helped me. Therefore, it is my duty to come and help my long-time friend.

So, Sir, I not only lost a good friend, but also a good politician. Therefore, I take this opportunity, on behalf of my Party, the ACMC, and my Leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, to share our sorrow with the family of the late Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana and express our sympathy to them.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

Investigations reveal that 305 outsiders sat GCE (A/L) at schools in Nuwara Eliya."

. 2 16 6 2 16 26 Daily Mirror * .

. This article states, I quote: "Nuwara Eliya Zonal Director of Education Amarasiri Piyadasa informed the District Coordinating Committee that the ongoing investigations had revealed that 305 students from other districts had sat the GCE Advanced Level Examination this year from Nuwara Eliya schools and that this number could increase to at least 500 as the investigations continued.

.

"State Minister of Education, the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan said, 'the Principals involved in the racket had taken up arms against him and that they even threatened legal action against him'. He said an organized group was preparing to stage a protest by raising black flags against the exposure of the racket, but he was determined to prevent such examination malpractices from taking place next year. He said he would streamline the procedure applicable to examination to prevent the recurrence of similar irregularities."
