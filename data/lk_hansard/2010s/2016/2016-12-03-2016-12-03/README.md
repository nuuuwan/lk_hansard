Vijitha Herath) Yes, I understand that. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) We have given our views and observations prior to the preparation of the Budget. But, if there are issues with regard to the Budget, we will take them up and sort them out. But, that does not mean . . ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) That is right. I understand that. But, my question was, why did you not question about the allocations for the rural roads before preparing the Budget? That is my question. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) , . . . . . ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The Hon. Member mentioned in this House that the SLFP and the UNP got together and prepared the Budget. Consequent to that, he said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys ideas and observations have been disregarded. I never said that. But, he has stated that I said that our recommendations were not taken into consideration. All what I said was that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party gave certain proposals which we wanted to incorporate into the Budget. ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) I did not say that you said it. I only mentioned the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekeras name, not your name. You must understand that. But, I wanted to raise that question.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I know as to why you wanted to raise that question.

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) Yes, that is because I want to know about that.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You want to tell the public that there is a problem between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the UNP. ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) Yes, that is correct. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) But, there is no problem as such. If there are any issues, we will sort them out. ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) Now, you are saying that you can sort them out. But, we see that they have not been sorted out yet. -[Interruption.] Okay, there is no problem. Now, I will continue with my speech.

. , . - , -, -, Kandy North Water Supply Project, , . These are major projects. . , . , . . . , . , . . [ ] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) , . . 2017 - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . .

At least, I hope and pray that you will get the money to start this Project. The whole problem with this is that - I know that you would like to start it - there are obstacles

somewhere. So, all these projects are getting delayed as a result of such obstacles.

In regard to Megapolis development - how can you talk about Megapolis development, when you ignore the whole belt from Beruwala to Matugama? You have to give pipe-borne water to that area. Because of the Megapolis Project is being called off, Homagama has not yet got the required quantity of water. Therefore, the people in that area have to bring water from the Horana Water Supply Project all the way. These Projects have to be completed, Hon. Minister. I know that you would like to initiate those, but you do not get the necessary resources for that. There has to be foreign funding. It was previously available, but it is not being canvassed today. As a result, those projects are not taking off.

. - . . ADB . . Also the Kilinochchi Water Supply Project has not yet been completed. During our time, we completed the water projects in Vavuniya and islands such as Kayts and Delft. So, priority has to be given where priority is necessary. Otherwise, you will have to ask the Chief Minister, Mr. Vigneswaran, to give you some money. That will be the best shortest cut, if he agrees. I do not know whether he will agree. He might say, No water. I am not ready to give money to Hon. Rauff Hakeem's Ministry. But, you all are facing these problems due to lack of funds and because of that, we are going into a serious crisis. I do not want to make predictions, Hon. Minister because the Hon. Prime Minister is not here. But, I would like to inform the House that your Budget is going to go for a six. Because next week, USA is going to raise interest rates. What will happen when interest rates are raised? All the money invested in bonds in other countries will start flowing back. This is going to cause a serious financial crisis in our country. . . .

The Labugama Water Supply Project is almost completed and there is a 100-year old Labugama Water Treatment Plant which operates on water, but not on energy. Now, what is the Board trying to do? They are trying to dismantle it and sell it off. Please stop that because it is one of the main areas where you could use water for regeneration of electricity. . .

Then, if you take the Colombo Port City Project - , "Colombo International Financial City"

2657 2658

2016 03

; - there is a serious water problem. Can you tell this House whether you are going to use the water that is available or being planned for the distribution of the Colombo District to be taken to feed that Project or are you going to have a separate water project by recycling seawater? This is going to be a very serious issue and you have to get it into the plans, if you are going to save the water that is available for the Colombo District.

. . . . . , you will be able to save at least 40 per cent of water, not as drinking water, but for other purposes in the hotel industry. But, it has not yet been implemented and that is why we have to bear an extra cost. projects . 20 40 save , , . . .

, , , the famous Municipal Councillor in Colombo. What has happened to the Colombo Municipality today? There are no elections conducted. It is supposed to be the fortress of the UNP. But, the UNP has got cold feet today. They cannot hold elections in the commercial capital, Colombo. This is the condition to which you have brought the Colombo City today.

, . . . The Ward System, which will contribute to a local member, a working member, is what is being delayed today.

- the crematorium opposite the Leisure Park is not yet commissioned. Why? Months and months have passed. Why can you not get this commissioned so that people will benefit? That was the purpose of erecting this.

Then, Sir, the Seethawaka-Hanwella Philip Gunawardena Library building has been completed. Months and months have passed. Why are you not allowing even the Special Commissioner to inaugurate this? Or else, you should come and inaugurate this. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . . , - . , ' ' . .

Member says that we have taken away the pipe network that was meant for Sinhala areas to the Tamil areas in the Batticaloa District. There was no such thing. Since this was in the scope of the Project, it was extended to the Tamil areas. So, this is a very racial kind of comment that should not be made. Those people also must get water. We do not have to give it only to the Ampara District. It was extended because it was in the original scope. So, it is very, very unfair to say so. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, Hon.

You cannot go and handover the Report to his house. The National Delimitation Committee Report was gazetted by His Excellency the President in August, 2015. Therefore, three years have been taken for it. Before that, Hon. Chairman, you were the Minister. You took steps to rectify matters which do not fall within the ambit of the Act. You advertised and you put a public notice to clarify matters. But consequent to the Gazette being published, there was a public outcry that this Delimitation Report was done for the benefit of one individual and not even for the benefit of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.-[Interruption.] Therefore, all political parties requested me that I should go for a -

Now, Sir, I will go into the other matters of my Ministry. As most Hon. Members think that the ambit of my Ministry deals with - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . [Interruption.] It is a right. Order, please!- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) 1947 29 , 1939 61 1987 15 .

All these Acts are archaic laws. I have appointed a Committee to go into it and to bring in new legislation, because the Municipal Councils Act, the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, all these Acts are archaic laws. So, we are taking steps to bring in new legislation.

As you know, there is a request from all Hon. Members of this House with regard to upgrading of Councils. That also has to be done in a very clear-cut mechanism. I have appointed a Committee to evaluate and give marks to them. So, whenever a Council needs upgrading, we will take steps to upgrade it. As you know, a former Minister in-charge of Local Government and Provincial Councils upgraded his area, Akkaraipattu and Dambulla, but people in those areas have not benefited by those two being made Municipal Councils.

And also, Mr. Chairman, we have brought in 25 per cent female representation with regard to Local Government Elections. This is a very progressive step. All the Hon. Members of this House supported us and therefore, we will have female representation of 25 per cent and, I think, that is in a form of a National List, so that they will not be contesting directly and thereby women could get into the political stream. As you know, we have female Members in Parliament but they come from a political background.

We have started a Front Office System. We have reduced the human interface in local bodies because we consider the human interface as a cause for corruption. Also, we have taken all steps to eradicate corruption.

. . . Hon. Chairman, we are trying to introduce a mechanism where one can download an application and pay the bills using technologies.

As you know, the Pradeshiya Sabha Act does not allow local bodies to work in the estates. So, we have taken steps to amend the Pradeshiya Sabha Act. We have got Cabinet approval and we will present it to Parliament in the near future.

. Fifty Questions relating to provincial councils have been asked from my Ministry and those have been replied by us with utmost responsibility.

In addition, there are issues which concern the public like the stray dogs' issue. We have coordinated with the local government bodies and the provincial councils to deal with that.

As you know, this Ministry has embarked on a task similar to the Victoria Project. Through the Iranamadu Irrigation Development Project, 8,455 hectares of land can be cultivated and 10,000 families in the Northern Province will benefit.

I would also like to mention this to the House. .

Hon. Chairman, I will now move on to answer some of the questions which have been raised. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, now you have to wind up. You have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, can I have two more minutes, because I have to respond to some of the questions? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, you can table the rest of your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I will table* the rest of my speech, but there are some questions to be answered. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Then, answer those quickly in one-and-a-half minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, a question was raised with regard to the Stamp Duty in the Northern Province, which has to be sent to the local bodies. Before the Northern Province was constituted, those monies were sent to the Treasury and now, directions have been given for those to be sent to the local bodies in those provinces. Also, the Cabinet has approved an amendment, whereby the Stamp Duty would be paid directly to the local bodies. At present, the monies have to be paid through the Provincial Council. Also with regard to the monies which have to be paid to the Provincial Councils, the Treasury has agreed to pay all that before the 10th of December.

Sir, I thank all the Hon. Members who participated in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Vote of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government and we take note of all the ideas and concerns expressed by them.

Also, I will conduct the local government election as soon as possible. That election has been delayed due to no fault of mine, but due to a faulty Delimitation Report which has mandated an appellate process and I believe - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Chairman)l Thank you, Hon. Minister. Your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Then, I will conclude my speech, Sir. : : Rest of the speech tabled:
