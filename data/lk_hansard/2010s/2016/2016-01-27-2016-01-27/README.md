(c) If not, why? . . ( , , ) ( . . - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Sir, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) I am well aware that not only the residents of Mullikulam, but most, if not all of the residents, particularly of the North and also of the East were affected by the effects of the Sri Lankas ethnic conflict. That is why this Government is committed to addressing the causes and effects of the conflict to ensure that our people will never experience and have to endure a violent conflict again.

(ii) This is not relevant to my Ministry and needs to be addressed by the Ministry of Defence.

(iii) Accordingly, those have been displaced would be considered as internally-displaced persons and the Government is aware of the regrettable suffering that they undergo. Therefore, this Government is committed to eliminating the word, IDP and "internal displacement" from Sri Lankan national life within the term of this Government in the shortest possible time.

(iv) The matters brought by the peoples representatives have been conveyed to relevant Government authorities and are being addressed by the new Government.

(v) Measures are being taken to provide redress to the people in Mullikulam.

(b) (i) The following actions are taken to resettle the displaced Mullikulam inhabitants:

one hundred and sixty nine displaced families (169) were given alternative land close to their native Mullikulam village at the rate of 80 perches per family;

while 183 families have registered for resettlement, 108 families out of the same, are permanently resettled in alternate land; and

of this 108 families, 27 families have received permanent houses built by the Navy and 83 families have received Rs. 50,000 worth temporary shelters, which were provided by the Northern Provincial Ministry of Fisheries, Transport, Trade and Commerce, Rural Development, Road Development and Motor Traffic. Another 80 families have received 12 sheets, 8 cement bags per family with the funds provided by my Ministry.

(ii) Further, the following facilities are provided for displaced Mullikulam inhabitants: while 34 families were provided with toilets (one toilet per each family),

315 316

five common toilets were built in various places with the cooperation of the UNHCR;

one big drinking water well in Malankadu, five hand pipes and several gravel roads in few other areas were also built at a cost of Rs. 2.9 million;

twenty-seven permanently resettled families were provided with electricity;

provision of electricity to temporary internal roads of the area is complete;

the school which was under the Navy hold was released and is functioning with seven teachers. It has classes from grades one to nine. The school has one permanent building and another temporary building. Rs 3.6 million was allocated for renovating the school which is now complete; and

the Northern Provincial Ministry of Education is in the process of constructing a new school in Mullikulam of which the physical construction work has already begun. This will clearly benefit the children of the area.

The livelihood facilities provided include:

provision of 30 boats and fishing machinery and equipment to 60 beneficiaries with the monetary assistance of the Australian Government;

provision of three boats and fishing machinery and equipment to six beneficiaries with the monetary assistance of the Indian Government;
