Sir, I will conclude very quickly.

Today, we are witnessing a global descent into extremism and bigotry, whether it is in America, Britain, Hungary, Poland, Sri Lanka or wherever in Asia. Recent inflammatory comments made, sometimes by members of the clergy show the religious intolerance in the country. But, both our President and Prime Minister have taken a strong stance against this and against those who engage in hate speech. This is not a call for banning offensive speech. In fact, dissent and disagreement is often desirable in a multifaceted country. I do, however, firmly believe that speech that incites violence must be banned and legal action must be taken against those who perpetrate it. We do not lack the legislative framework to

2147 2148

[

2016 01

do so against hate speech because we know that Section 3(1) of the ICCPR Act of 2007 is there and that Section 79(2) of the Police Ordinance provides, I quote:

Any person who in any public place or at any public meeting uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour which is intended to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned, shall be guilty of an offence under this section.

So, my point in closing is this. Hate is a moral crime. It is difficult to legislate against a moral crime. But, if a speech is intended to lead to violence, then I think that speech should be banned and the State has a responsibility to take action against those who provoke violence.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma) , .

[12.35p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, in fact I am going to refer to a few matters that have to be very seriously considered, but unfortunately, not many Hon. Members of Parliament are here to listen to that.

I really want to be positive and productive. However, no matter what we speak or do, the results seem to be the same. There will be enough attempts to justify why things could not get better and why we should be more and more patient. When the international community speak about human rights, social and economic justice, Sri Lanka takes cover under Sovereign Sri Lanka not up for lecture and try and shut them up.

Unfortunately, implementation of human rights in Sri Lanka is at the mercy of corrupt judiciary, bureaucracy, security forces, and politicians and is suffering due to lack of political conviction. Human rights champions are still being intimidated even under the good governance in this Government. The way the minority is treated, will express who we are as a country and as people. Changing political climate of an unassailable majority and a corrupt State system has the luxury of dispensing human rights at their convenience and it is also able to justify it as democracy at work.

I want to very clearly place on record that national reconciliation is not just a matter for Colombo to contemplate and conjure a success path to achieve. The victims of war are the minority. I do not believe it requires statistics to prove my statement. In every facet of our lives, we were decimated.

We realize that there is a sense of frustration in some extremists in the majority community because they were not able to finish the business and are gearing up for another pogrom to ensure that there is no such thing as "Tamil-speaking Sri Lankans" in Sri Lanka.

According to the ONUR website, His Excellency the President at the launch of National Programme on Reconciliation recently said that he witnessed how anti-Government forces branded the programme as federal reconciliation. He forecast that those who cast such insults will have to cry someday.

Sir, I quote from the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. In page 387, it states:

"The process of reconciliation requires a full acknowledgement of the tragedy of the conflict and a collective act of contrition by the political leaders and civil society, of both Sinhala and Tamil communities. The conflict could have been avoided had the southern political leaders of the two main political parties acted in the national interest and forged a consensus between them to offer an acceptable solution to the Tamil people."

We do not seem to be improving and the victims of all these are the minorities. I want to list out some of the landmark events in our post-independent political history, but due to lack of time, I am only going to mention a few.

The Sinhala Only Act in 1956 and subsequently, the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1957 tried to find a solution. But, the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact never took place. The late Hon. Dudley Senanayake sought to address this problem in 1961, but once again it did not materialize.

2183 2184

(6th start)

2016 01

Then, the Government of the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1972 adopted a new Constitution and that removed Article 29 of the Soulbury Constitution which protected minorities. The Government also introduced standardization to limit the number of students who could enter university, especially from the North and the East.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Mujibur Rahuman will now take the Chair.

, .

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. VELU KUMAR left the Chair, and THE HON. MUJIBUR RAHUMAN took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) The sad episode to this is, now 65 per cent of the Science Faculty students in the Jaffna University are not from the Northern Province.

Tamils were set upon by the extremists whenever we protested in 1958, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1977, 1981 and in 1983. We must also remember the burning of the Jaffna Library with over 97,000 books and rare manuscripts. The purpose of reminding all these is, we can see that a carefully orchestrated replay of these events are being attempted and the opportunity that we have now for a political resolution also may be squandered and we will be asked to suffer one more time.

We need true statesmanship and political will for meaningful and sustainable reconciliation and national integration. No amount of superficial measures and fancy ceremonies are going to achieve national reconciliation.

The first step in reconciliation is to list out the types of impact of war on the people that are still unaddressed especially of the women. These people are suffering in silence, their voices are not heard but we have ceremonies in large auditoriums shaking hands and doing dances.

These people are unable to feed their kids. They do not have any hope for a future. All and sundry is taking advantages by them. They do not even see these pretty pictures of the dances and handshakes.

They must first get back on their feet; they must have some hope for a future; they must get a stable and sustainable livelihood and their confidence must be lifted before we achieve national integration and reconciliation. Until such time all these dances and handshakes are

playing into the hands of extremists so that they could make it an issue.

In our view, peace will be achieved when the suffering people are at peace with themselves. This will apply to every single poverty-stricken person of this country be they Sinhalese or Tamil. Otherwise they will be pawns in the hands of the corrupt politicians and manipulators.

His Excellency at that recent ceremony said, It is a pity to underestimate the activeness and necessity of national unity and reconciliation. What the country imperatively needs today is the implementation of a common agenda to build the country with the support of everyone". He added that the future of the nation should not be dominated for personal agendas. He called on those who underestimate this work, not to play with the lives of the innocent citizens of this country.

ONUR is mandated to lead, facilitate and support initiatives related to national unity and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Its website does not list out what has been done so far, how many people have been helped, what plans have been developed, how and how many vulnerable women have been helped. However, we see the pictures of the dances.

The last of the eight programmes listed by ONUR is Livelihood Development and under that it says. ONUR is already working with several organizations who are active at grassroots level to facilitate livelihood development initiatives for female-headed households who were deprived of opportunities due to the direct impact of the conflict. Listing the numbers who were helped, what measures were taken and what the success rate is et cetera would help to raise confidence and reconciliation.

There are countless victims of the war such as school children, teachers, war widows, orphans and people who have been emotionally and economically marginalized due to war. We need to create a safe community and provide psychological and livelihood support to those who are being further marginalized and are on a steady decline.

The villagers need facilities for personal transformation, capacity development, confidence building, psychological and physical spaces and systems enabling people to come together as community groups and to inspire them to make collective decisions to protect each other and drive them to action. They must be guided from poverty and dependency to independence and self-sufficiency that will lead to peace and reconciliation.

Reconciliation is also not just a matter for senior politicians to visit the most vulnerable people of this country and promise to give them some immediate relief or offer redress for specific injustices. That is good for evening news and not for sustainable reconciliation. There must be deeper commitment and real intentions, otherwise we will continue to have a festering wound in the Sri Lankan body.

2185 2186

We were asked to feel the graciousness of the nation when the national anthem was able to be sung in Tamil; we were asked to feel good when the white vans stopped coming; we were asked to feel good when a few political prisoners were released and we are now continuously being asked to feel good when some politicians utter some reconciliatory speech.

If we look at the website of the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, it does not seem to have a subject matter that has a sense of urgency. There is no information in it about what specific action needs to be taken to lift the lifestyles of the victims from the hopelessness they are suffering. We need to lift their confidence to hope for a better future. No point in asking them how they feel about reconciliation because they will not know.

Please do not keep announcing a whole lot of good things. Just promise a few and fulfil it. No one is being mesmerized by the intended lofty words of the Government when the implementation track record is not very good. We need coordinated and cohesive actions that will strengthen reconciliation and peace. Also we need commitment and leadership. We are left to feel again that there is an orchestrated campaign being engineered and we do not know the scale and shape of it, but we certainly know that the victims will be Tamils. We have been seeing all these happening over and over again over many years. Attacking the Tamils is a stock-in-trade for corrupt politicians for many years and they always try to stop sharing power to fellow Sri Lankans. These dramas generally take place at critical junctures. We are once again reminded of all broken promises of the past and the potential repetition of a popular drama is appearing in the offing even now.

Even at this juncture, some politicians of the two main parties are resorting to their popular drama script sowing the seeds of discontents and divisions.

The previous Government announced, several years ago, to the whole world that the war is well and truly over. The formidable defence posture of conventional forces stationed in the kind and scale present in the North-East, cannot be justified as for national security needs. What kind of war are you expecting from the Tamils? It is disingenuous to try and argue that the presence of such a large security force is a national security requirement.

Although the State of Emergency, which had been in place for almost three decades, was lifted in August, 2012, many of the extraordinary powers of the 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act - PTA - still remains. John Fisher, Director of the Human Rights Watch Geneva said on the 15th of September, An early test of the governments sincerity will be if the Prevention of Terrorisms Act is repealed, and not simply replaced by another bad law with another name.

There were a number of promises made to release all the political prisoners and it is still not taken seriously.

Addressing the socio-economic needs of the war affected North-East is a fundamental prerequisite to facilitate post-war reconciliation in this country. We recognize that the ground realities and the context have been changed. We recognize it is time to be looking forward and give this great opportunity for permanent peace, because putting our best efforts we helped to elect our President and we owe it to our people and for that matter for all the Sri Lankans.

The promised Tokyo Donor Conference to address the needs of the war-ravaged North-East has not taken place and there has never been any announcement made as to why it has not taken place or of any alternate arrangements. Promises are too easily being ignored and more and more lofty words are being stated, but very little results are achieved.

Absence of war is not peace. All the State structures that were the cause of the conflict and the mindset are still intact. We are reminded of this fact frequently.

Sir, a comprehensive needs assessment must be carried out in the war-affected North-East as a prerequisite for regional rehabilitation and development for these reasons - to improve the availability of accurate, quantifiable information on residual humanitarian needs. The needs assessment should not simply a matter of finding out a wish list and it must reflect a holistic approach to uplift our war-affected society.

Capacity-building at all levels of our society is the key to reconciliation. Targeted initiatives for regional development with initiatives tailored specifically to individual villages and districts by engaging the beneficiaries in a participatory manner with community consultation in designing and execution will be the key for sustainability.

Large infrastructure projects and large-scale businesses will take a long time to benefit the people directly in the war-ravaged North and the East. These projects will only have a limited ability to engage locals, particularly women, the disabled and other vulnerable groups, in rebuilding the areas. What is required are solutions that address the specific needs of the people, which will lead to actual community restoration at village levels. Human capacity development at individual, village and institutional levels is paramount for sustainable development in our regions. Vocational and skills development training should be provided to households, persons active in the trade sector and youth in construction-related services to increase livelihood opportunities.

Let us look at the local government system. In order to revamp the local government bodies and to prepare them to take over higher responsibilities, the previous Government, in 2009, developed and gazetted a National Policy on Local Government after the war. But it has not yet been implemented. As a Government geared towards developing the rural economy and committed to a greater devolution and power-sharing, it should implement the recommendations in that policy document forthwith.

2187 2188

The TNA is committed to achieving a brighter future for the Sri Lankan Tamil community in a united Sri Lanka, where all citizens can live with dignity, equality and self-respect. To this end, we are working for a durable political solution through meaningful devolution of power.

Sir, in conclusion, I wish to outline a way forward. We announce that we are constructively engaging with the Government in its reconciliation and devolution process. Therefore, we ask the Government to be sensitive and not to give mixed signals that could damage the creditability of this process as we too cannot miss this opportunity to achieve permanent and lasting reconciliation. We recognize that the 30-year war has destroyed the human capacity to even engage in this mammoth task of rehabilitation and development in a meaningful way, but it is an important step in reconciliation that we all must try and find ways to take. We will require significant external professional expertise in the planning process for recovery at every level of our society.

We have had expression of many noble intensions for reconciliation and rebuilding from various Sri Lankan Governments and leaders. In our history of reconciliation, we have had a long list of resolutions, recommendations and action plans, every one of which would have benefited the people, but have never been implemented. The major issue in the past had been the lack of political will to look beyond immediate political gains. What is required is to think of the long-term interests of the country and broad consensus on the subject. We believe that the Government of today is in a position to do this and has the impetus to do so.

Sir, a Buddhist monk in the Batticaloa District is disturbing communal amity and unity fanning the communal flames by his impetuous acts.

If no prompt measure is taken to dissuade him from committing such dastardly acts, what he does will adversely affect the process of national reconciliation, for which concerted efforts are being made now.

If you are going to concentrate seriously on the national reconciliation process, first and foremost, update ONUR with information of what you all are doing genuinely and not merely with information that you have given so much here and so much there. That is not going to satisfy us.

Secondly, how long are you going to allow this Buddhist monk's problem to go on in Batticaloa? Why are you not taking any notice of that? Then, what is the big idea of talking about reconciliation? The people in Batticaloa and the entire East are in a panic situation. Communal violence could erupt at any time.

Not only that, there are so many other commitments made by you, which you have not fulfilled. Without concentrating on development, what have you done? You are talking about the average development at provincial level, but it will never happen unless you allocate more finances to the North and the East.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) You have to consider providing a number of basic requirements. Without those, why are you having a Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation? There is also an Office for National Unity and Reconciliation. What is the big idea of having all that? Therefore, start from the bottom if you are serious. Hand over the lands that are under the custody of the forces back to the owners. Hand over those first. Without doing that, how can you go and convince the people? You can never convince the people unless you do that.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) Step by step, lands are being released, are they not? . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) The President gave a time limit. But, it is not being adhered to. That is why I am repeating this. So, the President or the Hon. Prime Minister must answer this question of giving back the lands.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Have the President and the Hon. Prime Minister given you anything in writing?

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) It was stated in a speech made in Jaffna. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, just give me one more minute, please.

What I am trying to say is - Hon. Minister, it is good that you are here - start from the bottom. You cannot jump up and have reconciliation overnight. You have to start from the bottom. You have to satisfy -

2189 2190

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara - Minister of Sports) The Government is gradually releasing all the lands to the people.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Minister, I am not talking only about lands. -[Interruption.] Being the Minister of Sports, you can see that the Northern Province is at the ninth place in sports. You can easily see that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Okay. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. The next speaker is Hon. A.H.M.Fowzie.

[1.03p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Presiding Member, let me thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain briefly the programmes and challenges of the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.

You are well aware that this Ministry is headed by His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka with myself as the State Minister. We are a young Ministry; we are yet to complete the first year of the Ministrys effective establishment.

We, in the Ministry, do clearly understand the importance of the issues and the role of this Ministry. The previous speaker made a number of requests, which will be considered by us. As our Ministry is still young, very soon, we will be able to fulfil all his requirements.

We are also conscious of the challenges before us. We are being guided by His Excellency the President himself. In addition, the former President, Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Hon. Members of Parliament from all political parties, have encouraged us in fulfilling this national responsibility. The problems on the road in achieving national integration and

reconciliation are no doubt many. These problems need careful handling. They are, however, not insurmountable.

If we look around our Asian Region, we can see a large number of countries which have achieved all round advancement. The people in several of these countries have concentrated on economic progress more than on religious or racial or similar issues. They have already achieved better living standards for their people. Race, language, culture and religion are respected in those countries. But, they are not the main or the national issues facing them. Here, in Sri Lanka, issues relating to race, religion, language and culture are often being exploited to divide the people instead of using them for uniting the people. We talk less of common Sri Lankan identity but talk more on our religious, communal, linguistic and regional identities. No doubt that all communities have problems. The Government is committed to solving them. The Government is addressing them issue by issue. However, we cannot achieve reconciliation or national integration without unity. The main task that the Government hopes to achieve through our Ministry is to establish in Sri Lanka social cohesion and national unity while respecting our differences.

At the January, 2015 Presidential Election and the August 2015 General Election, the people of this country had given a clear mandate to achieve durable peace through reconciliation and national integration. The Government led by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, together with the people, will take this country towards economic prosperity and national integration.

Since ancient times, people belonging to different communities lived in peace and harmony in this country. Sadly, after attaining Independence, our inability to sustain and manage the spirit of that brotherhood paved the way for a disastrous conflict. As a result of this brutal conflict, we have gone back by a few decades while other countries have progressed.

Nevertheless, today we have a golden opportunity to be united as a single nation, keeping aside all our differences. Hence, it should be our ardent desire to make full use of the given opportunity to lay a firm foundation to raise our country as a strong, reconciled and prosperous nation. It is also obligatory that the victims are relieved of their grievances without any deferment. It is also our firm responsibility to prevent re-emergence of another dark era in our country.

National integration is the feeling of togetherness or oneness towards ones own country irrespective of individual differences with regard to religion, race, culture, language, region or caste. When individuals are nationally integrated, they may feel a unique sense of pride and patriotism. Sri Lanka is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual country. Despite these diversities, the people of Sri Lanka feel that they are the children of Mother Lanka. This is unity in diversity. The misunderstanding is caused by poverty, illiteracy, lack of integration, disrespect for diversity, isolation and disparities. National integration is a process of

2191 2192

2016 01

establishing national consciousness and a feeling of loyalty and patriotism for the Motherland.

Today, no country in the world can claim a single ethnic identity. Different communities live side by side in a province or district and all of them belong to the same nation. A wide range of diversity in dress, language, culture, food, behaviour and ways of living can be easily noticed among the people of different regions and religions. It is our responsibility to make the people aware of the importance of national integration. The process of national integration is under threat due to diverse forces such as communalism, racism, regionalism and extremism. We need to deal with these threats effectively and urgently. We appeal for your sincere cooperation in handling these challenges.

We are thankful to His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, the President of the country, for closely monitoring the progress of our Ministry despite his busy national schedule. We are also thankful for the assistance readily rendered by the officials of the Presidential Secretariat, officials of the Hon. Prime Minister's office, officials of our Ministry and State Ministry and the Office of the National Unity and Reconciliation - ONUR, Parliamentary staff, the religious and civil society, principals, staff and the students of schools and the media.

We have set out the Projects already executed and the Programmes which are under consideration for implementation, following necessary approvals. The Projects and the Programmes are as follows:

1. Promote national integration and reconciliation among school community (Sisu Diviyata Nawa Aruthak - A new meaning for student life):

Schools can play an effective role in promoting and nurturing national integration and reconciliation among younger generation and future leaders of the country. The Programme identifies school children as "change agents" in their family and society.

a) Assembly speech programme:

In schools, on the assembly day, a student is given an opportunity to deliver a speech on national integration and reconciliation for five minutes to create awareness among school children and teachers, which is expected to have an immediate impact through the family to the society.

b) Art and essay-writing competition for

school children:

This helps creativity and firm-up the concept of national integration through drawings, essays, articles and cartoons, giving a broader and deeper understanding for school children. A competition is held at different levels, district, provincial and national levels, providing winners with certificates and other prizes to promote national integration.

c) Short stories and poem-writing competitions for school teachers:

The teachers who are champions to create "change agents" are given opportunities to expand their knowledge, talents and skills on national integration and reconciliation through innovative, creative, attractive and effective short stories and poems to communicate and mainstream the concept. The winners at district, provincial and national level are given certificates and prizes to promote and encourage national integration.

2. Inter-village Exchange Programme (National programme to hold hands to promote reconciliation):

This is an interactive programme conducted for the Northern and the Southern community whereby different communities from different villages get connected. People will stay in a particular village to understand the villagers' food habits, culture, way and style of living and exchange cultural and religious beliefs with a view to eliminate the misunderstandings and ensure integration and harmony. Initially, village leaders including business leaders, religious leaders, professionals, civil society representatives and Government officials will participate in the Programme. Such a Programme is organized covering Matara and Jaffna with 42 leaders visiting Jaffna. Similar Programme is organized between Jaffna and Hambantota.

3. Daham Pasal Teacher Training Programme:

The objective of this Programme is to provide knowledge on integration and reconciliation to Daham Pasal teachers so that the teachers in turn could impart the knowledge so gathered to the Daham Pasal students. The children and the youth are targeted so that it leads to change their families and community. Already 1400

Daham Pasal teachers have been trained in Moratuwa, Ratmalana, Dehiwela, Maharagama, Homagama, Kaduwela, Colombo, Kolonnawa, Thimbirigasyaya, Kotte et cetera.

4. Office of the National Unity and Reconciliation:

7. Education for Social Cohesion

Reconciliation and integration is to be integrated into the national education curriculum with a view to ensure sustainable peace and harmony.

Future Programmes

The future directions and programmes of the Ministry will tend to focus in the following areas:

1. Targeting of youths and school children: The school and university material should be revised to focus on national integration. Involving school children and youth in national integration helps to mainstream the concept and practices into the society.

2. Declaration of National Integration Week: The government should initiate a National integration week as India has done. India observes November 19th, the Birthday of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as national integration day. Main aim is to promote among people unity, peace, affection and brotherhood. In Sri Lanka, the date of assumption of office by HE the President Mithiripala Sirisena where unity and national integration was identified as an important theme. The national integration week should identify many programmes to promote national integration and reconciliation.

3. Equitable Regional Development: Disintegration can be caused when development take place without equity. The Western Province has the lion share of the GDP and as a result many other provinces of the country suffer from high levels of poverty even though country has moved to middle income level. Hence, equitable regional development to reduce disparities should be focused to ensure meaningful integration.

4. National Policy on Integration and Reconciliation: It is important to formulate a National Policy on National Integration and Reconciliation.

5. Use of media for national integration and Reconciliation: The media both electronic and print should be used in combination with social media to promote the national integration and reconciliation.

Religious Leaders, business community, academic community can be used to convey the message on the importance of national integration. Youth and children should be encouraged to involve in speeches, essay and art competitions, films and dramas and cartoon development on national integration. Awards should be provided for best proposals on national integration.

6. Inter-village exchange programme - connecting villages from North and South,

East and West to promote dialogue, interactions and sharing of life experiences specially targeting community leaders to promote national integration and reconciliation.

7. Launch programmes to educate public on the Constitutional reform proposals related to national integration and reconciliation.

8. Corporate Social Responsibility - CSR Programme - The corporate sector should be encouraged to use the resources meant for CSR to promote national integration and reconciliation.

9. Establish at Divisional Secretariat Level a grievance redress mechanism on national integration and reconciliation with the participation of religious leaders, community leaders, academia civil society organizations and government officials to resolve problems.

. Sir, I will speak in English because I cannot speak in Tamil. . , . , .

Sir, I am trying to list out a series of actions the Government has taken for reconciliation and good governance since this Government came to office.

In January 2015, we discontinued the practice of issuing a Presidential Proclamation under the Public Security Ordinance declaring a State of Emergency, calling out the armed forces and giving them extensive powers to regulate civilian life.

Then, again in January we appointed a Tamil person as the Governor of the Central Bank. That persons term was not extended, but ironically it was yet another Tamil person, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, who was appointed as the new Governor of the Central Bank.

Then, we removed the military Governors of the North and East and replaced them with civilians. We restored and enhanced media freedom. In fact, we ended the censorship of websites, withdrew restrictions on foreign journalists visiting Sri Lanka and invited exiled journalists to return to Sri Lanka with promise of safety. We see how those cases are now being heard in courts. We, then appointed Justice K. Sripavan, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, again a Tamil person, as the Chief Justice.

Then, the NGO Secretariat which was under the purview of Ministry of Defence, was moved to the Ministry of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages which comes under the Hon. Mano Ganesan. We lifted the ban on foreigners visiting the North and East, and also restrictions on the transportation of goods to and from the North.

Then, we placed the Attorney-Generals Department under the Ministry of Justice, rather keeping it under the purview of the Presidential Secretariat. Then, the Department of Immigration and Emigration, which was under the purview of the Ministry of Defence, was placed under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where it should theoretically be. We also invited all refugees to return to Sri Lanka.

Then, in February 2015, we passed the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill in this House. It was passed unanimously, without a vote, Sir. Then, again, in February, we departed from the triumphalism of the past and the Government made a declaration of peace. At the National Independence Day celebrations, a declaration of peace was made in all three languages resolving to ensure non-recurrence and to grieve for all who had succumbed to violence since Independence.

2197 2198

In March 2015, we released a number of people detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. We sent circulars to all the Ministries stating that there is no prohibition for singing the National Anthem in Tamil. The practice of singing the National Anthem in Tamil had been stopped under previous governments. Then, certain people were arrested in connection with the murder of the TNA MP, Mr. N. Raviraj and the case is currently being heard. We created the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation - ONUR - which is run under former President Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

Then, in April 2015, we all passed the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and re-established democracy through the reduction of Presidential power, re-introduction of term limits and the introduction of independent bodies for appointment and oversight of key intuitions.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Deputy Minister, you have three more minutes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, this is very important. Can I have some more time, please?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We can give him a few more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) So, we have to deduct this extra time from some other Member.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Then, in April 2015, we received, at the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice and Non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, in a technical advisory capacity.

In May 2015, the "Victory Day" was renamed as, "The Remembrance Day." People all over the country were also allowed to grieve, which had been denied before.

In June 2015, we ratified the Palermo Protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

In July 2015, the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with regard to the five fundamental rights petitions against police inaction during the clashes at Aluthgama in 2014.

In August, 2015, we closed the last checkpoint - the Omanthai Checkpoint - in the country.

In September, 2015, we co-sponsored the Resolution 30/1 titled, "Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka." Again in September 2015, the TNA Leader, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, Member of Parliament, was appointed as the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. Also, the Cabinet approved the introduction of Certificates of Absence for those reported missing. This was a serious defect and we have been able to rectify it. Then, in the same month, we endorsed the Kigali Principles on the protection of civilians. The Constitutional Council, the body responsible for appointing members of the independent commissions including the Police Commission and the Human Rights Commissions, was appointed.

Then, in October 2015, Sri Lanka joined the Open Government Partnership and we were the only South Asian nation to join the OGP. Then, the Udalagama and Paranagama Commission Reports were made public and we tabled those Commission Reports in Parliament. Also, independent commissions such as the Police Commission, the Human Rights Commission and the Public Service Commission were appointed. In October 2015, we also announced that Sri Lanka will maintain a moratorium on the death penalty. Then, the Jaffna High Court convicted four soldiers for sexually assaulting two women. Also, we invited civil societies to submit ideas on how to conduct the public consultations process for the development of mechanisms for truth-seeking, justice and reparations. These happened in October, 2015.

In November, 2015, we de-proscribed eight diaspora organizations and 269 individuals. Then, we informed the UN Secretary-General of the termination of all derogations previously notified under the ICCPR. The UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances visited Sri Lanka in November, 2015.

In December, 2015, we signed the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances. Also, the Cabinet Approval was granted for the Right to Information Act.

In January, 2016, Mr. Pablo de Greiff, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparations and Guarantees of Non-recurrence visited Sri Lanka for the second time on a technical advisory capacity. Then, we destroyed publicly the ivory tusks confiscated by the Sri Lanka Customs from elephant poaching in order to prevent its trade in the black market. Also, we had the Consultations Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms appointed.

Then, in March, 2016, Mr. Todd Buchwald, the US Special Coordinator for Global Criminal Justice, visited Sri Lanka. Then, we appointed a high profile and respected individual as the Secretary-General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms. The first transgender person was appointed as the Governor of the Central Province which is a high-level post.

2199 2200

[ ()

2016 01

Then, Parliament resolved to sit as a Constitutional Assembly and that was again in March, 2016. Then, the Right to Information Bill was presented to Parliament. Then, the Technical Working Group of the Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, which was appointed to work on reconciliation mechanisms, visited South Africa to study the Truth and Reconciliation Commission - TRC.

Sir, there is a whole list of activities undertaken by the Government of Sri Lanka in order to promote reconciliation, human rights and accountability in Sri Lanka from March, 2015 to the end of September, 2016. Sir, since I am running out of time, I table* this document, which contains the activities undertaken by the Government from January, 2015 up to the end of September, 2016.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. Thank you.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I move,

That Parliament do now adjourn. . . Question proposed.

CONDOLENCES ON THE DEMISE OF REVOLUTIONARY LEADER COMRADE FIDEL CASTRO, FORMER PRESIDENT OF

CUBA [5.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to move the following Resolution for this Parliament to pay its highest respect to one of the world's most respected and honoured leaders who has passed away, Comrade Fidel Castro, former President and Leader of Cuba.

"Sri Lanka Parliament pays its deepest sympathies on the demise of exemplary Leader Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz.

Comrade Fidel Castro, from the day he led and stormed the Moncada Barracks to the day when he retired from position of active leadership, stood as one of the greatest examples to the oppressed masses of the world.

The victorious Revolution that he so bravely led in Cuba inspired Cuba and all continents across the world, as he liberated his country and built Socialist Cuba. For over fifty years as President of Cuba, he led Cuba to great new achievements and was an international champion for the cause of sovereignty and independence of nations.

Comrade Fidel Castros leadership overthrew the puppet regime of Dictator Fulgendo Batista and restored to the people dignity and sovereignty of the motherland. From the victory of Playa Giron, he continuously stood up against the bullying of imperialist allies."

Form the day he and his comrades landed by "Granma" on the soil of Cuba, to the day the Cuban Revolution was victorious, it was exemplary dedication and leadership of Comrade Fidel Castro that brought the victory of the Revolution.

His leadership inspired Cuban professionals as volunteers to serve people in Africa, Asia and Latin America to help people achieve better standards of living as Cuba had already attained very high standards in many areas of its economy.

Sri Lanka will always remember how Cuban doctors were sent to our aid and served our people during most difficult times in our history and the support given by Cuba in at international events.

"Comrade Fidel Castro gave exemplary leadership to Cuba, to battle and defeat imperialism, is undoubtedly a historical brave leadership given to an entire world. His memories will always continue to truly inspire a whole new generation to carry forward victories of the Revolution in Cuba across the globe.

Inspirational words spoken on the Cuban Revolution by Comrade Fidel Castro on the eve of 50th anniversary of the attacks on the Moncada Barracks will always continue to reverberate throughout human history.

'History has proved that nothing could defeat our people in its noble endeavours and that weapons are no more powerful than ideas.

We are today, as nothing could be preventing that, from the proletarian spirits of a country built over centuries with the blood and sweat of slaves and workers, the deepest yearning for freedom and justice that our national hero demanded would flow with inextinguishable strength and justice that will live on like an eternal flame.'

We, together with the people of Sri Lanka join in solidarity with the heroic people of Cuba and Government of Cuba in paying our deepest homage and our eternal salute to the Founder of the Cuban Revolution, exemplary Leader Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz."

Sir, he inspired all continents of the world.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

At the time we discuss the resolution on behalf of the former President of Cuba, Fidel Castro, we have the presence of the Ambassador of Cuba to Sri Lanka, Her Excellency Juana Elena Ramos Rodriguez, in the Speaker's Gallery. We feel honoured to have you here, Madam.

The next speaker is Hon. R.Sampanthan, Leader of the Opposition.

[5.18 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I consider it a privilege to be able to say a few words about the great leader Fidel Castro, the former Prime Minister and President of Cuba. Fidel Castro's rise to prominence began in the early 1950s when he commenced his political struggle against then General Fulgencio Batista. He was imprisoned for his rebellious actions against the regime and later fled the country and was in exile. Even in exile Fidel Castro never gave up his vision and the plans that he had for Cuba. In 1956, he returned to Cuba and continued the freedom struggle. In 1959, the revolutionary leader was able to become the Prime Minister of Cuba. He continued to give leadership to Cuba as Prime Minister till 1976, when he became President and continued as President till 2008. His return to Cuba and continuous struggle epitomized the commitment and vision he had for his country.

There were many significant achievements in the history of the Cuban people during the tenure of President Fidel Castro. His regime was able to open 10,000 new schools and increase the literacy rate in Cuba to 98 per cent. Cubans today enjoy a universal health system, a system that has helped decrease infant mortality to 11 deaths in 1,000. Another great achievement of his regime was that he was able to stamp out racism from Cuba and bring the different people together. Fidel Castro also had a special concern for the poorest in society and he was committed fully to uplifting their standards of living.

Fidel Castro never failed to attract attention on the global scene. The former Cuban President played a key role in the Non-Alignment Movement and served as its Chair between 1979 - 1982. His speech during the Havana Declaration in 1979, when he was elected as Chair of the Non Alignment Movement, will be remembered forever by the Non-Alignment Movement countries for his articulation of the role of the Non-Alignment Movement.

Fidel Castro was renowned for never failing to address the disparity between the world's rich and the poor; whether it be at the UN Assembly or at any other forum. The points he made in his speeches are still very relevant even to our country. The comparison he made between Socialism and Marxism, in his speeches, are truly noteworthy.

Fidel Castro was always an outspoken leader. This made him a leader who stood by his convictions. In addition, the late Cuban President was an example not only for his role in Cuba's Freedom Struggle, but also for the role he played in uniting the country. During his governance, he was able to unite the people of different races who inhabited Cuba.

It is not a secret, Sir, that Fidel Castro was a close ally of Sri Lanka. He worked very closely with the late President J.R. Jayewardene and continued to stand by and support Sri Lanka throughout the years. On that note, we can all agree that Sri Lanka has lost a good friend and supporter.

The world has lost one of its most courageous and charismatic leaders. I join all the others in this House in paying tribute to him and expressing our deepest sympathies to the Government and people of Cuba.

Thank you, Sir.

2281 2282

Hon. Deputy Speaker, this House is moving this Adjournment Motion today to pay our tribute to one of the most influential world leaders who shaped the history of many nations in the second half of the 20th Century. Comrade Fidel Castro was such a charismatic revolutionary Leader that his brand of revolution was exported to many countries. His ascent to office in 1959, had resulted immediately in many countries resorting to radical approaches towards nation building. His inspiration was such that his struggle was taken as an example to change and fight dictatorial regimes and change the world order in many parts and many continents. Be it Nicaragua, be it Angola, be it Vietnam, be it Algeria - many countries shaped their ideology based on his leadership and his example.

We must say that we have lost a very charismatic, idealistic and iconic leader of the last century.

He was also a close friend of the Palestine people. His inspiration was such that the Palestines struggle was further boosted by the courage given to the oppressed people. In the entire second half of the 20th Century, all of us, the nations which had suffered under long periods of colonialism, took inspirations from leaders such as Castro.

As a matter of fact, except for his silence on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in the rest of the Islamic world, he was revered. It was understandable that he kept silent on the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, since he was an ally of Russia. Though he was seen as an ally of Russia, during the period of the Cold War, he was seen as an iconic leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. His inspiration among the Non-Aligned leaders was such that his presence, his stature and his charisma prevailed on many leaders and some leaders and other party strongmen would visit him and seek an audience with him for his advice.

Today we feel that his ideology, his revolutionary zeal and his leadership theories had influenced many leaders all around the world. The adversity of the long and arduous embargos imposed on Cuba by imperialists in the neighborhood, did not deter his determination to rise above all these adversities and provide that nation with one of the best literacy rates in that part of the world.

So much so, as many speakers before me mentioned, child mortality rates was lowered to such enviable levels in Cuba and it is maintained up to date. Cubas achievements in educational sphere as well as in international sports arena have reached such heights that it became the envy of many nations.

It is with a heavy heart that we join the other leaders in this House to pay homage to one of the outstanding figures of the latter half of the 20th Century, who had influenced many nations and many revolutionary movements.

Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, in the wake of the passing away of the former President of the Republic of Cuba, Fidel Castro, the Government and the people of Sri Lanka join the Government and the people of Cuba, including members of the bereaved family, in mourning the loss of a towering personality of the 20th Century; in fact, a political icon of our generation.

Sri Lankas deepest condolences were expressed formally through the messages sent by His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and my own to the Republic of Cuba. A Senior Minister of our Government, the Hon. Susil Premajayantha, will participate at the funeral in Havana next Sunday, on the 4th as President Sirisenas special envoy.

2295 2296

2016 01

Former President Castro became prominent, as was mentioned before, in the politics of Cubas revolutionary movement and was the architect of the new Cuba that came into being in 1959. He remained true to his convictions and chartered a new journey for the people of Cuba. The journey was not easy as he faced formidable external challenges that affected the very core of Cubas economic development. However, President Castro rallied his country and people passed his obstacles with great resolve and tenacity and ushered new ethos of development. As a result of his pragmatic vision Cuba began to make advances in science, health and education and soon became on par with the developed world in terms of human development. Sri Lanka along with many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America continue to benefit from the advances Cuba has made in these areas. The Government of Cuba has given us valuable technical assistance in the area of biotechnology and epidemiology to eradicate malaria, dengue, filariasis and Japanese Encephalitis. Therefore, his legacy of scientific advancement and social development will be cherished by the Cubans and others for many decades to come. I also remember that way back in 2005, over ten years ago, just after the tsunami, we also had the benefit of having many Cuban doctors who came to serve in the areas concerned.

Sri Lanka and Cuba, as two successful island nations in human development, enjoy a special friendship and a deep sense of solidarity. Our enduring bond of friendship was based on our shared interests within the Non-Aligned Movement and Sri Lankas continued support for the removal of the longstanding economic embargo imposed on Cuba.

In fact, I am glad to see the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa here because it was way back in 2006 that I had the pleasure of accompanying President Rajapaksa then to the Non-Aligned Conference held in Havana and also had an opportunity to have a glimpse of this great leader.

Late President Castro was a sincere friend of our country and people. His hand of friendship was reflected in the steadfast support Sri Lanka received from the Government of Cuba in the challenges it faced in the multilateral fora. With his passing away, Sri Lanka truly has lost a great friend.

We hope that his unalloyed courage, determination and sense of purpose would inspire the people of Cuba to face the challenges of the 21st Century, but his demise, no doubt, would leave a great void in Cubas national arena.

I thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) ... . [6.28p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation)

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am indeed thankful for this opportunity to speak about the former President of Cuba, the legendary leader Fidel Castro.

I wish to pay my respectful tribute to one of the most extraordinary political figures of the 20th Century. He is reported to have survived the largest number of - 638 - attempts in all, on his life. These attempts included poisoning the cigars that he was going to smoke. Surviving such a colossal number of attempts on his life by itself made him an extraordinary personality.

Fidel Castro is more importantly referred to as a unique personality who inspired world leaders across the globe. That included leaders of his time such as Nelson Mandela and Ahmed Ben Bella. Indeed, Nelson Mandela honoured Fidel Castro with the highest civilian award given by South Africa to a foreigner - The Order of Good Hope.

He had his detractors as well. No leader can claim exception to criticism, some fair but often unfair. Critics referred to Castro as a dictator. He refuted this branding. He responded by saying that he constitutionally held less powers than most Western liberal democracies. He had never declared war on helpless third world countries using democratic powers that never existed.

I must add that the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka has placed His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena as a Leader who follows the footsteps of Fidel Castro, if I might be permitted to respectfully say so.

The Cuban leader is remembered by his own countrymen for imposing zero tolerance for acts of racism. He was, at times, dictatorial in eradicating this menace of racism and communalism seen as a terrible threat to the countrys economic advancement. We are probably one step behind Fidel Castro in that regard.

The Cuban people also remember Castros firm grip on reducing illiteracy and improving public health standards substantially. It is likely that people appreciated Castros firm control on the countrys administration. He delivered the goods to the people amidst threats and challenges. The threats, I must say, were, Himalayan in proportionate to the standard of living of the Cubans at that time. The Bay of Pigs invasion was a major issue. The subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world

virtually to the brink of a third world war. Mercifully, the worlds leaders avoided possible catastrophic decisions. We are equally glad that Cuba had succeeded in normalizing relations with its powerful neighbours.

Fidel Castro graduated from the University of Havana in 1950. Thereafter, he opened a law office for his legal practice. He appeared without fees for most of the working class clients. Unfortunately, he ended up having to close down the office for reportedly being no longer able to pay the electricity and other bills. Nevertheless, he continued to appear for those needed his services.

Meanwhile, a less known fact about Castro is that in 1952, he signed up to contest the elections for the House of Representatives. But, that election never took place. Supported by a foreign power, Batista seized power in Cuba, which frustrated Castros ambition for a seat in Parliament. Signaling what made Fidel Castro to become a revolutionary, he said From that moment, I had a clear idea of the struggle ahead. Over the next seven years, he carried out a relentless revolutionary struggle to oust Batista from power. Finally, he succeeded in 1959 becoming the Prime Minister and later the President of Cuba. He was seen as a charismatic leader by the people. He was like a folk hero for some and a rebel with a cause for the youth.

The Cuban leader, who hosted the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement - NAM - in Havana in 1979, was elected the leader of the NAM. He remained an active leader and as an iconic figure in the movement. The NAM is an important forum for the third world and must be kept invigorated.

In conclusion, I wish to point out that internationally Fidel Castro was portrayed by the powerful Western media as a dictator. But, for the Non-Aligned world, he will remain as an unforgettable and great legend of our times.

Permit me, Sir, to convey my deepest sympathies to his family as well as the Government and the people of Cuba.

Thank you.
