Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, I would like to say a few words in regard to this matter. This being, Sir, an unfortunate incident, has apparently been caused as a result of some misunderstandings over arrangements pertaining to a welcome event to new students, I think everyone should ensure that such misunderstandings are avoided. Very fortunately, Sir, the situation was brought under control very rapidly with all sections of students and the University authorities fully cooperating to achieve that objective. I do not think we should exacerbate this situation and I think there is a duty cast on all of us to act with restraint.

The University should be opened and should become functional early. I believe, steps have already been taken and some Departments have already started functioning. Let the normal inquiries take their course and let the results be known and the decisions taken, after the inquiries are over. While we all must act with restraint in regard to a matter of this nature, I think it is also obligatory that we must not be oblivious to the fact that incidents have also taken place in other universities also - I do not want to specifically refer to those incidents - but, I think there is a duty on the part of the Government to take connaissance of the fact that such incidents have taken place in other universities also.

Whether there had been some political motivations behind all these incidents is also a matter that the Government should address and take connaissance of. Such political motivations, Sir, could be to deliberately deter the process of reconciliation and such activity, you will agree, could be intended to jeopardize the countrys main goal of reconciliation and unity amongst all people. While there is a duty cast on all of us, as senior citizens of this country, to ensure that the situation is not exacerbated, we must nevertheless be conscious of the fact that there are certain elements in this country who are trying to create mischief and that those elements cannot be allowed to have a free run.

Thank you, Sir.

. . , , . , , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for granting me an opportunity to speak a few words on this issue that was raised by the Hon. Members of the Opposition.

I was directed by His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister to visit the University of Jaffna along with the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management as well as the Hon. Karunarathna Paranawithana and have a discussion with the authorities regarding the issue. We had a very long discussion with the heads of students, lecturers, the Senate and the Deans of the Faculties. All

were together in one common room and they expressed their views very clearly. The Sinhalese and Tamil students of the Jaffna University very clearly said that there is no difference or any animosity towards any community and the Sinhalese are living very closely with the Tamils and the Tamils are living very closely with the Sinhalese, because a majority of the Sinhalese students are staying in Tamil homes. So, there has been no problem whatsoever.

As the Hon. Member who raised this issue said, this was an issue that had been brought up at a ceremony held on Saturday. There was a custom that had been followed earlier by the University. Suddenly, that custom had been deviated from. I do not want to talk much on that because the deviation of the custom had, unfortunately, not been mutually agreed upon. If it had been mutually agreed upon, this incident would not have happened. All these years, such incidents have never happened, as clearly mentioned and there has been no panic whatsoever.

The Vice Chancellor of the University has taken necessary steps to hold an inquiry immediately and the report will be ready, probably, in another ten days time. Once the report is ready, we will know exactly what the position is and the Senate of the University as well as the UGC will take necessary action to bring the people concerned to books. But, I want to emphasize that there have been some elements behind this whole issue, maybe, to provoke the situation and that is very unfortunate. As far as the ground situation is concerned, the Sinhalese and Tamil students of the Jaffna University are living very amicably with one another.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , 23(2) .
