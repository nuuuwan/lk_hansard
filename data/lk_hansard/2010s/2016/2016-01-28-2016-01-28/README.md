. . [3.33p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad to follow the Hon. Prime Minister on this issue relating to the Adjournment Motion which has been moved by the Chief Opposition Whip, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

We have been debating the issue relating to the conduct of law and order and law enforcement machinery - the police force - in this country. The Hon. Anura Dissanayake dealt with, initially, in his speech, matters pertaining to the promotions, transfers and disciplinary control of police officers and the difficult service conditions that police officers are subjected to because of service requirements. Now, this is a matter regarding which any government has to be quite sensitive, since a fair and effective policing is a necessary element in maintaining a State. In maintenance of law and order and law enforcement, our police force certainly, over a period of time, has faced many difficulties. We do admit that. But, yet, there are incidents which bring to focus deficiencies in the system and those deficiencies have certainly got to be addressed.

Looking at the criminal justice system, all of us must agree that the Police Department functions in collaboration with our judicial system and the Attorney-Generals Department in properly conducting law enforcement in this country. There are a variety of difficulties the Police Department has gone through and there are certain endemic problems that the Department has faced. One of the endemic problems has been that the Police Department had been forced to do other duties other than the police duties and they had been even used to do combat operations during the unfortunate civil war that we faced. We formed the Special Task Force and even the present IGP joined the police force directly as an ASP recruited to the Special Task Force. Over a period of time, this type of militarization of the police force also had an impact on its conduct.

Therefore, we need to look at all these issues that have been raised, particularly, we have to look at them with some sympathy. But, in the meantime, maintaining discipline; looking at their issues relating to promotions; their frustrations when it comes to service requirements that are applied inequitably which are affecting lower ranked officers are also important. These are all matters that the State has to be concerned about. But, in the meantime, we also have to look at it as to whether laws have been enacted in this House. We brought in the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act in keeping with the international conventions. How many prosecutions have we filed in courts against torture? So far very minimal. How many convictions have we had when it comes to torture? I am told that it is just one conviction for so many years. But these are issues that need to be brought out so that proper police conduct could be ensured.

Now, this Embilipitiya incident has brought to focus some issues concerning the conduct of policing in this country. I am not going to comment on that since it is a sub judice matter. But what is important is that this Government has introduced the Nineteenth Amendment

519 520

to the Constitution and through the Nineteenth Amendment we have re-introduced the National Police Commission through which independent eminent persons are appointed to look after promotions, transfers and recruitment matters of the police force. Politicization of the police force is no more in this country. Our Government has seen to it that these matters would be handled through the National Police Commission and we see several people going and making their complaints to the National Police Commission direct when they have a grievance against the police force.

But during the previous regime several things happened. There were incidents against places of religious worship. There were religious personalities conducting themselves in a manner so reprehensible in front of a large number of policemen. The police force was found to be just bystanders watching and not enforcing the law. We had a Buddhist monk conducting a press conference in the Nippon Hotel and another set of Buddhist monks came, beat him up, got him to kneel down and forced him to apologize in front of the glare of cameras and policemen were found to be mere bystanders watching what was happening. In the precincts of Anuradhapura, a Muslim shrine was being vandalized in front of police officers who were simply bystanders watching what was happening. The culture of impunity that got into the police force had virtually pervaded the whole system. Ultimately, as a remedy, the former regime introduced another new convoluted system of having a "religious police force". We are used to having the police force under a Minister in charge of Law and Order. But, with the introduction of this "religious police force", the policemen who were coming under the Inspector-General of Police were asked to take orders from the Secretary to the Ministry in charge of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs. That was the way in which they were creating a culture of impunity and what happened in courthouses in Homagama and other places is a result of this culture of impunity that we allowed to a certain section of people who violated the laws in the country when no action was taken against them.

Therefore, this Government has now introduced the Independent Commissions. We have brought in the National Police Commission and brought all the issues pertaining to police under their purview. There have absolutely been no interference at all in the manner in which police conducts its operations when it comes to law enforcement. They also face many problems, we must admit that. As a Government, we need to be sympathetic to their difficulties.

When it comes to law and order situations like what happened when the HNDA students protested in the Town Hall Junction - Lipton Circle, media repeatedly showed the way in which excessive force had been used

on protesting students. The amount of force to be used in order to contain a riotous situation is a decision that has to be made on the spot by officers who are there to ensure that that situation does not get out of hand. Therefore, that decision has to be left to field commanders to make. Those issues have to be analyzed very carefully. We need to be sympathetic to the service constraints that police officers face as well when we also jump to conclusions in criticizing them. Just looking at television footage, we jump to conclusions. Today, media too has got to be fair in looking at this issue that concerns police personnel and public. All of us know the public is the first interface when it comes to the police. They are not like other armed forces personnel. They have to deal with the public in their day-to-day affairs. In that process, we need to be carefully analyzing the causes and improving the conditions of training of our policemen while enforcing the law equally as regarding anybody who violates the law.

Necessarily, this culture of impunity has grown over a period of time due to several factors. Unnecessary politicization has also affected the way in which things have grown out of hand. But, I am sure with the passage of time, with the new introduction of the National Police Commission, things are bound to improve. In the coming months, when we implement the Right to Information Act, that will further empower the public to expose wrongdoings; expose corruption and increase transparency in the way in which Government conducts its affairs. In the meantime, as the Prime Minister very correctly pointed out, the media too has to very fairly report incidents. They have got to be balanced in their approach and have got to give both sides of the version and be fair by the readers; not to be siding with one faction and giving a twisted version of events.

Therefore, it is important for us to bear these matters in mind and look at more training, better facilities and better service conditions for our police force. Over a period of time, we have recruited people even without the basic qualifications because of service requirements at that time. There were several border-villages that had to be protected. The armed forces could not be deployed; they were overstretched. Because of that reason the police was pulled into combat operations. Their normal policing duties were forgotten. When violent deaths took place, we did away with the autopsy and the need for any investigation and disposed of those bodies by using the Emergency Regulations. Over a period of time, police officers even forgot what was an inquest and what was the need to conduct autopsies, because there was facility for you to dispose of the bodies summarily using the Emergency Regulations. This country has been ruled for a period of more than thirty years continuously using the State of Emergency. The Emergency Regulations were used to override the normal law enforcement during that period. Though, occasionally, it was subjected to judicial review - we had the Fundamental Rights under Chapter III of the Constitution through which many actions had

521 522

[ ]

2016 28

been filed concerning these matters. Many habeas corpus applications were brought to court, but none of them were resolved. If you look at the Court of Appeal Registry, there are many unresolved habeas corpus applications and habeas corpus applications have been routinely referred to the Magistrate for inquiry; but no finality has been reached. The whereabouts of the disappeared could never be found. All of this has totally eroded the manner in which law enforcement practices carried out in this country. The entire criminal justice system suffered.

But now, with the new reforms that we have introduced and the new laws we are going to enact, there would be a paradigm shift in the way in which law and order enforcement is carried out in this country. The conduct of the police and the policing responsibilities would be undergoing drastic changes hopefully. But then, as and when some incidents occur, let us not forget that police are functioning under extreme stress and extreme difficulties. Then, the wrongdoers have to be punished; they have got to be brought to book. There are miscreants in any place; they may even be among us in this Chamber. We may have violated the law at a given time. The type of politicization has left that politicians are never booked even when they commit a wrong. How many of us have exceeded the speed limits? In such a situation, when we lower our windscreens, the police officers let us go, because they feel that it would cause trouble if they book us. That has happened. Therefore, we need to look at these issues with much more responsibility and try to improve the conditions for police officers to be of better service to us and for them to be proud of their uniform and not to be treated haphazardly. But, in the meantime, when a few incidents of this nature that we spoke about today do happen, we need to allow the law to take its own course. Just because somebody is in robes we cannot allow them to come and disrupt courthouses; we cannot allow them to block prison officers from obeying orders of courts and taking people to remand prisons. These incidents have got to be looked at carefully so that this culture of impunity that we saw in the past should not be allowed to reappear and that is a primary responsibility of this Government. I am sure, Mr. Presiding Member, that we, as a Government, have taken a pledge not to unduly bring pressure on the police force and none of us have ever done that.

But, then, the training and service conditions of police officers have got to be improved. In the meantime, when incidents of serious nature, which are threatening the entire fabric of public confidence in the police force come to light, we have also got to see that investigations pertaining to conduct of police officers are carried out properly. If a wrong has been committed, those responsible have got to be punished. But, that does not mean that we should jump to conclusions before allowing a fair process of investigation and trial to take place. With those comments, I conclude my remarks.

Thank you.
