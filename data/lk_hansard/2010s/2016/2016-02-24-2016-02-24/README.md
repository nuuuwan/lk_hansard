[10.38 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are today debating the Resolution that has been presented by the Hon. Prime Minister, seeking to convert this Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly. I am standing before you today, Hon. Deputy Speaker, as a Member who had signed this Resolution along with the Prime Minister, seeking to adopt this novel approach in making a new Constitution for Sri Lanka. So, when I say, a new Constitution, that issue itself became a matter of controversy and the Opposition as well as the members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party had wanted us to drop the word new and enact amendments to the Constitution. But, as a matter of fact, we must say that this journey to deliberate and draft a new Constitution, would be long, difficult and arduous and may be controversial, but at the same time, this is a historic and ambitious journey that we are seeking to go on.

After the Presidential Election, the country was presented with a new opportunity and that new opportunity, after the Parliamentary Election has been further strengthened with the two major political parties coming together in forming the Government and that in itself has given hope to the people that finally enacting of a Constitution and doing away with certain features of the Constitution may be possible. Whether we are going to retain the Presidential Model of Government that we have embraced ever since the 1978 Constitution or return to a Westminster Model of Parliamentary Governance where a Cabinet System is to be adopted, is something that we have to deliberate. I do not say, there is total consensus on

the issue. Even our Party has not come to a conclusive decision to do away with the Presidential Model. But, we were on a common platform with our Colleagues from other parties in the last Presidential Election where there was a promise given to abolish the Executive Presidency as well as to introduce a new electoral system for the country.

Of course, in both the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, none of us did seek a mandate from the people to introduce a new Constitution. But, I must say that there was a general consensus among all people and majority of the people that a new Constitution is needed for the country. Many question as to why we should appoint a Constitutional Assembly. They ask why we do not appoint a Select Committee. I have myself been in two Select Committees of this House previously and it is my experience that that Select Committee process may not be the best option at this moment, because it does not have the flexibility or the scope to formulate a Constitution due to certain other constraints which we have all experienced in the past.

Therefore, the best possible method is this approach to convert the whole Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly. The proposed process is in keeping with the existing constitutional provisions. In other words, the process has legal validity. It is to deliberate, seek the views and advice of the people and draft a Constitutional Bill for consideration of Parliament. Finally, Parliament will be reconvened in order to consider the Bill that would be the final product of the deliberations of this Constitutional Assembly.

In any Constitution-making exercise, the legitimacy of the process and the final product - the new Constitution - becomes paramount. Constitutions cannot be imposed on the people by force. It is said that the legitimacy of the Constitution is multi-dimensional. When you say multi-dimensional, it has got to have political legitimacy; it has got to have legal legitimacy. On top of everything, it must have moral legitimacy. So, in order to get this multi-dimensional legitimacy, we have now decided to put in place several processes.

We have appointed a panel of 21 eminent people to have a Public Representations Committee, which is going all around the country listening to the public; the civil society. [Interruption.] My learned Colleague, the Hon. John Senewiratne corrects me and says that it is 25 now. So, we have 25 eminent people sitting in batches, going to district by district, having public sittings, getting the civil society to be involved in the process of Constitution-making, and that is to give moral legitimacy to this exercise. So, how can anyone say that our approach to have a Constitutional Assembly is not the way to go about? It is not just a Constitutional Assembly alone. We have other parallel processes that we have put in place, and at the post-Constitutional Assembly stage, the public

1299 1300

2016 24

will have the opportunity to challenge the Constitutional Bill before the Supreme Court as envisaged in our own Constitution. Then again, the provincial councils will have an opportunity to express their views and finally, as required by Article 83 of the Constitution, it will also be presented for a Referendum before the entire country. Therefore, there is no sleight of hand in this approach. [Interruption.] Yes, you are welcome. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Who is paying for them? Parliament has not done any authorization yet. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) If you want, we can get that authorization done. The only thing is, this exercise has been undertaken by the Prime Ministers Office. They have, in fact -[Interruption.]- No, no, the Cabinet has authorized. It is a Cabinet-appointed Committee. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Since Parliament has the right to control money, Parliament should have first decided on the constitutional process and thereafter, that process should have begun. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Nanayakkara, for such a solemn exercise, eminent people have been chosen and they are going around the country and for their incidental expenses, I am sure, all of you will not grudge paying something for them. -[Interruption.] I know, but that authorization has been taken from the Cabinet. If necessary, that matter can be brought to Parliament for approval. I am sure from the way you are questioning these things you want to keep on -[Interruption.] No, no, we are doing a simultaneous exercise because we do not want to waste time. We want to get the public input and we want to have the Parliament deliberations parallelly. Anyway, I thank you.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, this whole process - some may seek to challenge this as if it is lacking legitimacy - has the full force of the mandate of the people, and then respecting that mandate, we have made sure that processes are very transparent, open, and that everyone who needs to be involved in this exercise is invited to involve. Finally, there is going to be a Steering Committee, and there again, that has also become a matter of controversy. The Steering Committee will be entrusted with the final responsibility of drafting a Constitutional Bill. I am sure, my Colleague, the Hon.

W.D.J. Senewiratne, is also going to be there in that Steering Committee. So, being a very senior legal luminary in the House, I am sure, his mind would be brought to bear on - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) All are luminaries. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Great minds. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, there are several great minds in this House, including the Hon. Leader of the House. So, all of them will be in a position to assess all these public representations that have been made and look at the long history of several other draft documents that we have before us. We had several All Party Representative Committees; we had Select Committees and there is a copious amount of drafts and documents that can form the basis of a final Constitutional draft. So, in that process, the Steering Committee has a very big responsibility.

Having said that, I do not want to deal too much with this issue, except to say that at the 26th Delegates Conference of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, held on the 07th of November, 2015 in Polgolla, Kandy, our Party said that it is committed to a meaningful settlement that would ensure due sharing of State-power, shared rule and dignified coexistence amongst all citizens and communities in Sri Lanka. It was also resolved to call upon the Government to enact and implement all necessary Constitutional reforms as assured prior to the Parliamentary Election held in August, 2015. As an interim measure, the SLMC called upon the Government to strengthen the devolution of power to the Provincial Councils to facilitate their autonomous functioning as provided for in the Constitution. I must also table here a policy statement that we, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, published in 2008 which was very forward-looking and grounded in the vision that Sri Lanka should be a multiethnic country which respects human rights, pluralism and the rule of law. This policy statement contains several components in it. It is a 16-point policy statement which I, with your permission, will want to table* so that it will form part of today's Hansard.

Sir, may I have a few minutes to say a few words in Tamil? But before that, in reply to the Hon. Vausdeva

Nanayakkara, Item 31 of the Resolution itself provides for funding.- [Interruption.] We will, once it is passed. Even if some of you vote against it, I am sure, it will get passed. Do not worry. We only need a simple majority to get that through. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) He is not against it, he is for it. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) It is not the passage I am talking about, I am only telling that there is a procedure; that this House must be respected. This House is not respected when you proceed before the - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am told that you all are for it.-[Interruption.] Therefore, I withdraw what I said.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, please. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, we are still debating the Resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly to draft a Constitution in place of the present Constitution, which, we all agree, must be abandoned. Everybody in this country has been campaigning for the abandonment of the 1978 Constitution because it contains very many features which are unacceptable. So, what we should do now is to try and ensure that this Resolution is adopted by Parliament and we commence the business of framing a new Constitution. That is going to be done by the 225 Hon. Members of Parliament; it is going to be done by Parliament in its capacity as the Constitutional Assembly. So, I think everybody should cooperate to ensure that this Resolution is adopted if you have the interests of the country at heart. If you do not have the interests of the country at heart and you want to delay this matter, prevent this matter from happening or create difficulties; you are doing a disservice to the country. Please remember that. We all want to cooperate to ensure that the country has a new Constitution which will address, not merely the Executive Presidency, not merely the question of electoral reforms, but also the national question in such a way that it will be constitutionally resolved as desired by all the Hon. Members of Parliament. So, why are we delaying that? I would appeal to all the Hon. Members to cooperate. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much. , . ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) , .

Presiding Member, on Saturday, 09th January, 2016 an excellent Resolution was presented to this House by this Government with the guidance of the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena. This is an excellent effort taken by you to fulfil the needs expected by the people of the country. It has been identified not only by the people of this country but also by international bodies like the United Nations Organization.

Paragraph 2 of the Resolution states, I quote:

.the People have at the Presidential Election held on 08th January, 2015 given a clear mandate for establishing a political culture that respects the rule of law and strengthens democracy;

Paragraph 3 states, I quote:

His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka has clearly expressed his desire to give effect to the will of the People expressed at the aforesaid Presidential Election by enacting a new Constitution that, inter alia, abolishing the Executive Presidency;

Paragraph 4 contains three important features. It states, I quote:

abolishes the Executive Presidency, ensures a fair and representative Electoral System which eliminates preferential voting, strengthens the democratic rights of all citizens, provides a Constitutional Resolution of the national issue, promotes national reconciliation, establishes a political culture that respects the rule of law, guarantees to the Peoples fundamental rights and freedom that assure human dignity and promotes responsible and accountable government.

In your proposed amendment to the Resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly presented yesterday, you have decided to delete paragraph Nos. 2, 3 and 4 in page 1.

His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister, as a Parliamentarian of this House, I have a responsibility to express my views for your urgent consideration. You both created a baby who is expected to grow up as a good human being. Yesterday, both of you cut off the head of the baby, which means "a new Constitution for Sri Lanka". Now, it is a dead body without the head. Do you feel that the baby will grow up without the head? How are you going to feed the baby without a mouth? You can feed the baby through a nasogastric tube. But, please keep in mind that your Constitutional Assembly does not have the brain now.

But, what the country really needs is leadership. To provide that leadership, we must, within this united country, divide power in a way that the institutions that are closest to the people function effectively, so that the people would receive the services that they need from their State.
