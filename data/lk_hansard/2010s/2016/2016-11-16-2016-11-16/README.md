asked the Minister of Justice:

(a) Will he inform this House -

(i) the reasons led for the objections raised by the present Chairmen of Labour Tribunals, with regard to their functions in terms of the Section 46 of the Industrial Disputes Act (amended) and the regulations under the same, in connection to the appearance of a representative on behalf of applicant or respondent in Labour Tribunals;

(ii) whether he accepts the fact that the anti labour attitude of the Government has been proven by the abrupt discontinuation of 60 years of long-standing practice and opportunity of providing employees with the access to convenient and low cost legal work;

(iii) whether this situation has arisen due to a request made by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka;

(iv) whether he is aware of the fact that it will be difficult for the applicants to be represented by the lawyers, unless the Labour Tribunal affairs are restored in a reasonable and lawful manner to the previous system that it was used to be;

(v) whether he is aware of the fact that the applicants do not trust the legal aid service of the Legal Aid Commission of providing lawyers;

(vi) if not, whether the word Social which was initially found in Market Economy Policy has been removed by now?

(b) If not, why? ( ( ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe - Minister of Justice and Minister of Buddhasasana)

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . , .

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) , , restrictive interpretation of the law is not the norm in the world today and particularly in India this is the case. These were meant to be informal tribunals and they are now formalizing them to a point that it becomes a burden on the applicant. I hope you would take up a position about that.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Speaker, there is no controversy about the legal position as the Hon. Member was explaining to this House. At the time when we are going to discuss this issue, a notice can be made and any Hon. Member who is interested in this matter can come and make representation.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. May I suggest that you discuss this matter in detail at the Committee?

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Then, do you agree with the restrictive interpretation about peoples' rights?

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) I do not agree with that. But, since there is a matter to be resolved through legislation, we will discuss it.

[10.31a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga - Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs and Minister of Lands) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Shritharan spoke with a great deal of emotion. I can assure you that the Unity Government headed by His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister will ensure a fair deal in the promulgation of the new Constitution, and you can be assured that there will be a peaceful environment and a fair deal in all affairs. But, please do not be in a hurry. We cannot be responsible for what took place during the previous regime. But, now we are making a tremendous effort to give back some of the lands and also to ensure all rights of the Tamil people in the North.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. S. Shritharan.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Shritharan, this is my time. . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) Hon. Minister, give me only one minute please. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Okay.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) , , . . - . !

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Member, be peaceful. Do not allow any further eruptions of violence in the North and the East.

1223 1224

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you go ahead with your speech. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, at the very outset, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the President-elect of the United States of America, Mr. Donald J. Trump, for his splendid and historical victory which I am sure will open a new chapter of closer relationship between Sri Lanka and the United States of America.

A good Budget reflects timely and necessary action to address the aspirations of the people at the time, and lay a foundation for the well-being of its people in the future. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of Finance for having presented one of the best Budgets of the country under the circumstances, and the second Budget of the Unity Government for good governance under none other than His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena.

I wish to speak on some selected aspects of the Budget due to allocated time constraints.

To begin with, it compels me as pertinent to briefly speak on the backdrop of the state of the socio-economy of the country not many years ago, when the Government of Good Governance was elected ousting a neo-fascist regime heavily tainted with family nepotism, rampant corruption and mismanagement amidst a mountain of misused debt and an enormous debt trap inheriting the worst economic legacy that any new government would have to face. Contrary to propaganda, in truth, the Government under the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was seriously trapped with cash and the Treasury was almost in a state of bankruptcy.

Internationally deserted, politically and economically having outraged the powerful West and even the Untied Nations Organization, as wisely believed it was the impending national disaster of utter bankruptcy more than anything else that forced President Rajapaksa to lose at the two-year premature Presidential Election on 8th January 2015. I believe the former President was happy to lose the presidential election to fight another day when his regime of corruption is forgotten, rather than face a national outrage against him and his government if he remained any longer.

The onus of repairing and salvaging the heavily sinking national economy is now up to the Government of Good Governance and it has become the responsibility of the Unity Government to float and steer the ship through the storms to the destination of actual peace and prosperity. One should understand that it is an enormous task needing understanding and sacrifice. The Budget underlines the need of the moment which is an economic, social and environmental transformation ensuring a better country for all the citizens including the citizens of the North as well.

The Government with astute diplomacy and statesmanship has won back international goodwill and support enjoying a warm international climate to catalyst development plans as promised by the Government under the broader theme of Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion. The Budget presented is a highly balanced Budget both development-oriented and people-friendly, benefiting all segments of the society. Although all previous Budgets have emphasized on sustainable development, the meaning was lost even without an effort or a direction.

The Budget for 2017, however, targets the fulfilment of core factors of sustainable development to make it a reality, namely, economic growth, social equity and environment protection. These are the factors that together meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their needs. The proposals categorically assure that environment will not be compromised in the pursuit of sustainable growth. As a matter of fact, there are many proposals including a clear policy on green energy to effort the preservation of the environment.

The Budget outlines plenty of emphasis on export growth, employment creation, infrastructure development, commercialization and modernization of agriculture, heavy investments on housing, roads, health, education, water projects, provincial development and other important fields.

With the understanding that the economy needs transformation and an export-led growth to provide one million jobs, a foreign investment-led development strategy is being put into place by the Budget Proposals. With investments being the key, there are two encouraging indicators proposed by the Budget: firstly, making the country attractive and feasible for foreign investors with a conducive policy environment and secondly, by the practical implementation of the policies, willing to change the landscape for landmark investments.

The Budget correctly envisages one-stop shop facility to investors. The Registrar of Companies to be open all seven days of the week is a step in the right direction in reducing time to commence a business. The Budget also rightly recognizes the need to promote investment areas where the impact to the economy is high due to value addition and employment generation with willingness to support domestic entrepreneurs in sectors such as tourism, agriculture, fisheries, livestock, poultry and manufacturing.

We are automatically reminded of the unproductive investment and wasteful expenditure of the previous Rajapaksa Regime with little or zero returns such as in the construction of the Mattala Airport, the Hambantota Port, the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium, in the operation of the Mihin Air and many others of that nature.

I am thankful for the wide range of proposals with regard to the promotion of tourism to realize the aim of making tourism the principal foreign exchange earner for

1225 1226

2016 16

the country and a high employment generator. In this context, key tourism corridors and eco-triangles in the country are identified creating an enabling environment by providing necessary infrastructure and regulatory framework. The envisaged Tourism Development Fund with the imposition of a 0.5 per cent Tourism Development Levy will positively contribute for the realization of plans for development of tourism in the country.

The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka is upbeat about the carefully planned progressive Budget Proposals which will help place Sri Lanka on the right track in tourism, the subsidy of Rs. 25 billion for refurbishing hotels over 10 years in operation to be in line with modern requirements for the continuation of minimum rates for city hotels till 2018 and also about the Budget allocation for building a MICE Convention Centre for meetings and events.

The Budget has recognized the potential of water sports, now a popular tourist attraction, facilitating even hosting international competitions in our Eastern beaches with duty waivers for the import of surfing items, jet skis and leisure boats. The people of the country should be happy to note that the Government is committed to pursuing an economic policy to generate wealth and equal distribution of income to all its citizens.

In this direction, to correct the imbalance, the Budget proposes substantial capital allowance for businesses which make investments in the North, the East and the Uva Provinces to generate new employment in which provinces the GDP per capita income is lowest in the country.

Mr. Speaker, we are still a public sector-driven economy. Any development plan or vision is attainable only with due performance or execution of policies. Our Public Service will have to be equal to the task. There is an urgent requirement for reforms in the Public Service and in this context, I commend the Finance Minister for the proposal to appoint a high-level committee to make recommendations to upgrade the service to the required standard.

As much as we plan to have an employment-generating, export-led economy, the Budget is equally committed to develop the agricultural base of the country. Once the Granary of the East, we are still basically an agricultural country. Agriculture is so important to our economy with the spirit of agriculture being our way of life. The proposal to empower the farmer and boost agriculture, envisaging its transformation into commercial agriculture as the way to the future is most timely. The Budget aims to support agriculture to transform itself from the low-yielding, low-income, few crops-dependent agriculture to a high-output, commercial agriculture, and encouraging farmer cooperatives will certainly increase the farmer income, dispensing with the middlemen.

The Budget calls for a clear land policy to go hand in glove with proposed development. In our island nation,

the land resource is very limited, that it has to be utilized to the optimum benefit and cannot be wasted at any cost. I am happy to state that action is already being initiated by the Hon. Prime Minister for the setting up of a State Land Bank with a data bank of all the State-owned land in the country, which will prioritize and facilitate the best use of land on merit of utilization for future development. A Land (Special Provisions) Bill is to be presented to this House, which will formalize ownership of State land to those already in occupation with State permits under various categories. That will grant thousands of families the freedom to develop themselves and enhance their quality of life.

The Budget Proposals provide the way forward to rightful empowerment of the people of this country. The proposal to construct 500,000 houses with loans at 7 per cent interest payable over 25 years will make Sri Lanka a house-owning society.

The Budget Proposals also strengthen family security with the strengthening of free health facilities and provision of free insurance cover for the children attending school. The extension of the health insurance of retired government servants is most reassuring to a large number of them.

The Budget, as never before, holds out so much for the improvement of education and upholds the right of every child to be healthy and to a continuous and quality education for 13 years ensuring zero dropouts. Strengthening IT facilities and providing free Tablet computers to 175,000 Advanced Level students and 28,000 Advanced Level teachers show the commitment to enhance student knowledge for future challenges and investments on skills development to face the future job market.

The Budget has come in for acclaim from all knowledgeable and far-thinking groups of the society. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition has gone on to say that the Budget has looked into the needs of the Northern Province - your own Leader has said that - and that it is a people-oriented Budget. That is his view. Then, no other than the former Minister DEW Gunasekara, the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Communist Party and former Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises - COPE - under the Rajapaksa Regime, pays tribute to the Budget, calling the Proposals as progressive.

Without precedence, the Budget assures review of quarterly income and expenditure outcomes within one month at the end of every quarter to uphold the Parliamentary control of public finances, and also proposes a committee constituted of members from both public and private sectors to oversee Budget implementation and execution, a device for transparency and the monitoring act of good governance in order to prevent repetition of what happened during the past period. The Budget for 2017 is a vibrant plan with a vision to lift the economy and achieve targeted development goals empowering all people of this country including those in the North and the East as well.

1227 1228

Among the far-reaching proposals for the future development and prosperity of this country, I wish to summarize the medium-term proposals of this Budget: generating Rs. 1 million employment opportunities, enhancing income levels, creating a broad and vibrant middle class, ensuring land ownership and development of rural economies.

Much more could have been said. But, unfortunately, due to the limitation of time, I thank the Hon. Speaker for providing me this opportunity and once again congratulate the Hon. Minister of Finance, wishing successful implementation of all the Proposals in the Budget.

Thank you.

16 . This is the sixteenth occasion that I am participating in a Budget Debate. 16 . I am not happy with the economic development that has happened in my country. . 30 .

. We have many challenges. One such challenge is the enormous debt

1305 1306

payments that we have to make - the debt trap that we are facing. , . We have to face the reality of the debt trap. That is the reality that the citizens of this country have to face. , , , . . . .

, , . We cannot take a populist approach to the enormous debt burden that we have inherited. We have to face it squarely. - . . , . Our economic management team is not comprising of family members. .

, . . . . , . I expect that our economic management team would fulfil the obligations of facing the reality of the debt trap that we have inherited. So, although the path can be difficult, I think in the next two to three years, there would be stability and consolidation. And I believe that the second Budget of this Government can fulfil that.

, 3,671 . 5,391 . 2005 2015 . The debt that we have inherited has increased three-fold from 2005 to 2015. . . - - . , . . . . . . .

, . , . , . Unnecessary expenditure,

corruption and wastage. . , , , . Whatever the faults we have done, whether it be corruption, wastage, intimidation or harassment, there is freedom in this country - freedom of press, freedom of talking and freedom of expression - to find out the truth and expose those people who are responsible. That has happened and that will keep on happening. Remember, if you do something wrong or if you do something illegal or if you do something that contravenes the law, you will always be found out.

, , 5,391 . , ? . We must understand the debt trap. , -, , , - . , .

. , crowding-out effect - the debt trap" . . , . We take debt from one hand and pay the other debt that we have taken before from the other hand. . , debt trap" .

? . . , . , . Future generations of this country will curse this Government if we do not act responsibly and curb the huge debt that we have inherited from the Rajapaksa Regime. .

125 . . , . , .. . Those people, who said that without P.B. Jayasundera the economy could not go forward, should look at these statistics because they are very important. 125 . 2006 2011 2,563 , 5,133 . 2011 2015 5,133 , 8,505 1.6 . .

1307 1308

. , .

, , , , . Some of the Western economies including the European economy have had to face unnecessary recessions that affected their economies during the last two-three years. Thankfully, Sri Lanka has been able to resist the possibility of recession or an economic downturn. , . We have to be happy that we have maintained the position of our economy. . , . , . , .

, -the employment problem in this country- . If you look at the election campaign process of the President-elect Donald Trump, you would notice that one of his main slogans was job creation. ? 100 , 80 . , . ? , . .

I am sad to say as a person who believes in the market economy, that the capitalists, the entrepreneurs and the industrialists in this country have not fulfilled their social obligations towards this country.

, . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have only two minutes more. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member.

, . . We must look at this problem objectively because the industrialists must take a risk and invest in the free market. , .

, , -the social obligation has always been fulfilled by this Government. . , . 35 . . , , . , . We know our social obligations. . pension . 100 . .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you may continue.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, with the increase in commercial and non-concessionary borrowings from external sources, our external debt had gone up to US Dollars 25,167.8 million in 2013 with a total debt servicing of US Dollars 1,805 million. Public debt which stood at 76 per cent of GDP in 2015, has been reduced to 75 per cent of GDP in 2016. So, there is a reduction.

The fiscal constraints imposed by heavy debt burden prevented us from going for government investments to induce economic development. The debt burden is one of the factors which prevents us from stimulating the economy as much as we would like to.

I also would like to state that there will be great benefits to the people through this Budget and there will be a great transformation. Whilst there is a heavy burden by way of taxes, gradually with the benefits we get through the economy, we will be able to ease the tax burden on the people.

Once again, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for giving me this opportunity.

[5.37 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity.

First and foremost, I must thank the Hon. Minister of Finance for giving us such a good Budget where he has actually allocated a large amount of money for Ministries targeting not only main industries but almost all other industries. These monies will directly go into the villages and through that, definitely the farmers, who are living in the villages will be benefited.

Once again, I must thank him for allocating Rs. 1,200 million to improve the fishery villages. As you know, the fishermen of the country are living in very difficult conditions and they are living in very badly put up houses. So, I must really thank the Hon. Minister of Finance for allocating such a large amount of money in order to safeguard the fisherfolk and thereby improve the fisheries industry. This industry has been starving for a long time. Due to lack of facilities fishermen find it difficult to do their job properly.

Also, I must thank the Hon. Minister for allocating Rs. 500 million to develop aquaculture industry, by which the standard of fishing can be improved. In addition, he has planned to put up two or three canning factories not only for fish but even for prawns. As you know, it is very difficult to improve the prawn industry due to the price factor and the cost of production. So, this allocation will definitely help improve the fishing industry and also the prawn industry.

The Hon. Presiding Member, as you are aware, the Hon. Minister has talked about the salt industry and salterns in Hambantota and Manthai. I must actually tell this House that private salterns in Puttalam, where I come from, produce 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the salt requirement of the country. We have been the main suppliers of salt for ages. But unfortunately, when you speak of the salt industry, we are a forgotten lot. I would like to remind that there are about 275 saltern owners producing salt almost in 400 acres. Like in the salterns in Hambantota and Palavi, they also follow the instructions given by the Ministry of Health to maintain the standard of their salt production.

I can remember about 10-15 years ago, the UNHCR helped us through the Government to obtain certain iodine adding machines, which are still in good condition. The Government is providing the Palavi Saltern, Hambantota Saltern and the Manthai Saltern with the latest machineries to produce good-quality salt for the country. At the same time, I must also thank my Leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, because through his assistance, we are now supplying salt to all the Sathosa outlets, under the name "Thammanna Salt". Why I mention this is, since the Government is interested in helping the Government-owned salterns, they must consider the private salterns also. There are about 250 saltern owners producing salt in 400 acres and about 10,000 families are living through this industry. It provides direct employment for 5,000 people and indirect employment for 5,000 people. Therefore, it is the duty of the Government to look after these private salterns also like the Manthai Saltern and the Palavi Saltern.

In regard to the tourism industry, I must also thank the Hon. Minister of Finance for allocating a large amount of money for the tourism industry. A lot of middle-class tourists come to Kalpitiya, which is my area. Although tourism industry is developing day by day, infrastructure facilities in that area is not enough. We know that the Hon. Finance Minister has allocated a large amount of money for the tourism industry. He has also mentioned that he would encourage transportation on waterways from Puttalam to Colombo. Actually, there is the Dutch Canal from Puttalam to Colombo. In fact, last week also I mentioned this. Earlier, people had been transporting goods using padda boats. Since the tourism industry is now flourishing there and since the Hon. Finance Minister has allocated money, that canal can be improved to take tourists by ferries and in addition to transport goods from Puttalam.

In regard to agriculture, Rs. 50 million has been allocated for mechanization of commercial agriculture. I would like to mention that people in Kalpitiya, where I come from, are cultivating agricultural products in almost 16,000 acres, but they have been doing it in the same old way for a very long time. I am happy to say that the Hon. Minister has allocated a large amount of money for commercial agriculture to improve mechanization through the use of machines such as transplanters, hand weeders and to promote drip irrigation. By doing so, we can help farmers earn more money and improve the standard of agriculture also.

Similarly, with regard to coconut industry, money has been allocated to modernize the Coconut Processing Research Division of the CRI which is very essential for development of coconut industry. As I mentioned before, we always talk about tea and rubber cultivations but forget coconut cultivation. Along with tea and rubber, coconut was also one of the main export products earlier, but due to the negligence of officials, the coconut industry has today come down to be only a consumption item and most of the oil mills are closed. Due to negligence of the previous Government coconut plantations were not developed for the last 10 to 15 years.

1351 1352

Sir, when you look at the plantation industry, you can see that smallholders are looking after their estates but big estates have been neglected. They have not been replanted. Therefore, production has gone down and as a result, 50 per cent of coconut oil mills and DC mills are closed today.

I am very happy to say that money has also been allocated for high-yielding planting material and especially, for seedlings used for replanting. Then, at least, in another 10 years, we will be able to go back to the era in which coconut was exported, like tea and rubber. So, I am very happy that the Hon. Finance Minister has allocated money for such areas.

He has also mentioned about auctions. Since I am also engaged in the coconut industry, I would like to say, earlier BCC had a special auction centre under the Ministry where all copra and coconut were auctioned. But, it was done manually and there were a lot of problems. Now, the Hon. Minister has allocated a large amount of money to mechanize this so that we can have a new system. Then people will be benefitted and higher prices can be obtained.

I am also very happy to say that he has allocated Rs. 400 million for the dairy industry. As we know, a massive amount of money is spent for the import of milk powder. Unfortunately, all these years, we have been neglecting this industry. If this allocation is spent properly, I am sure that better cattle breeds can be imported. If this industry thrives, definitely the import of milk powder can be brought down.

I am very happy that the Hon. Minister spoke about Katunayake Expressway being extended up to Puttalam. Sir, over 300 to 400 lorry loads of goods daily come from Puttalam to Colombo. Except rubber and tea, all other items are manufactured there. We have cement, salt, fish, agricultural items and coconut. We have everything there. All vehicles that are daily coming from Jaffna come to Anuradhapura. From Anuradhapura, they come to Colombo via Puttalam. So, Puttalam is really congested. If you can extend this Expressway to Puttalam, we will be benefitted. I remember the Hon. Prime Minister saying that the problems in Sri Lanka will be over once we can reach Colombo from Jaffna within three hours. If you do this up, I am sure that target can be achieved in the future.

Hon. Presiding Member, the Opposition always speak about the Mattala Airport and the Hambantota Port. I am very happy that they were built. The day before yesterday, we landed at that beautiful airport and we saw only buildings and there were no planes. I saw on the board that displays the flight schedule there was one flight to come from Dubai - and later only it was noted that it was coming on the following day. That means, within 24 hours, only one flight was coming! This is the sad situation there.

Then, we went to the Hambantota Port. When we were at the Port, we saw about 200-300 cars, but not a single

ship was there. Also there is a massive building like the BMICH; but not a single soul there! This is the position there. Everything has been done, but they are of no use. If that could have been built somewhere closer to Colombo, we would have benefited. If the Colombo Harbour or the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake had been improved, by now, we would have got some income. We do not say that they have not done anything. What they have done is not proper. By now, His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister have entered into agreements with the Chinese Government by which we could derive some income through these investments.

Then, just look at the Cricket Stadium in Hambantota. Cricket matches are played regularly in Sri Lanka, but not a single cricket match is played at the Hambantota Cricket Stadium. See the expenditure that was incurred and what we have to spend to maintain that stadium. They have put up that Cricket Stadium in a jungle where people cannot go. Of course, our Government, President and the Hon. Prime Minister, had to go back to the Chinese Government, and now they have done it in such a way that our income can be aggregated and loans can be repaid.

Therefore, I am extremely happy about this Budget and I must also thank the Hon. Minister of Finance for presenting such a good Budget.

Thank you.
