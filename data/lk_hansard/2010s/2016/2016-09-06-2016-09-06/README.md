ATTACK ON SRI LANKAN HIGH COMMISSIONER IN

pinpointing the extreme group of the LTTE who was behaving like this. Even the Malaysian Government sometimes could be helpless. So, that is the point to which I want to draw the attention of all the Hon. Members and all political parties in this House. Then, todays Daily Mirror newspaper states, I quote:

Attack on Sri Lankan Envoy : Five arrested. It does not give any information as to who has been arrested.

, 2016 06 "" , " " . . , "" , " " . , . , . . - There is an international convention; you would accept that all the diplomatic personnel have to be protected.

I do not blame the Malaysian Government. They had done whatever was possible after the incident took place. Their security personnel moved in to give protection to His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. But, what has our Government done? This is what should be answered, Hon. Prime Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

41 42

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to say a few words on this matter.

I wish to unreservedly condemn, Sir, the incident which is now being discussed in this House. Quite apart from everything else, any other circumstances that may be relevant, the incident by itself needs to be condemned and I would urge that stringent action must be taken against the offenders. If they are Sri Lankan citizens - it appears to me from the Hon. Prime Ministers statement that they are not - we might even consider whether they should be extradited to this country and charged in this country.

The country is moving towards stability; the country is moving towards harmony and it is my submission that such incidents are unwarranted. Foolish action on the part of some people, who do not quite realize how harmful the consequences of such foolish actions could be, should not be encouraged; but on the contrary, should be discouraged and terminated.

Such people do not realize that they are playing into the hands of people who do not want stability in Sri Lanka, who want the country to be destabilized and to be in a state of tension, with the possibility of a conflict emerging at any moment. People who have such intentions have such intentions only in their self political interest and not in the interest of this country. I do not think anyone should be so foolish as to play into the hands of these people.

So, we would urge the Government to ensure that stringent action is taken against the offenders and the stability that prevails in this country is not in any way disturbed.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, this has been raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order No. 23 (2). So, let him speak.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . , , . . ICAPP . . -[Interruption.] Let me explain. Mr. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena is an SLFP Organizer of the Government today. You are condemning your own people. Perhaps you do not know. . , .

I do not want to make a long statement. Hon. Leader of the Opposition also condemned this. It was very clear that the attempt was on the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's life. I was there and I heard what was uttered. I do not want to repeat what was said there in this House. The Hon. Prime Minister is aware of this and the Hon. Lady Deputy Minister is also aware of this. They were chasing after the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa when he went to the temple, when he went to the hotel and everywhere he went. So, you should not at all undermine what happened to him in Kuala Lumpur. It is true that the Malaysian authorities gave whatever possible assistance. But, the problem was Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa's security personnel was not given permission by our country's security establishment to go with him. This is the key issue which should be addressed by the Hon. Prime Minister. I am not making any reference to any other person. The Hon. Prime Minister should get involved in

43 44

2016 06

this because it is for defeating the LTTE, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa is being hunted in this manner. I use the word, "hunt", Hon. Leader of the Opposition. All of us today enjoy freedom because the LTTE was defeated and it is up to all of us to defend the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and give him all the security needed irrespective of political views.

, ? , , , . , . . It is the office of the ex-President that has to be recognized. Give special security to a person who is a target. Please understand, he is a target. That is why, the Hon. Prime Minister should give his attention to provide the necessary security.

STATEMENT MADE BY UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-

GENERAL ON SRI LANKA [.. 5.12] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , .

Sir, "The Sunday Times" of 04th September, 2016 states, I quote:

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon caused controversy this week by categorising Sri Lanka alongside Rwanda and Srebrenica to make a case for increased intervention by the United Nations in internal conflicts.

Mr. Bans comments were a departure from the prepared text of his speech Sustainable Peace and Achieving Sustainable Development Goals delivered in Colombo at the invitation of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.

It further states:

The conflict in Sri Lanka has never been categorised as genocide (for obvious reason), despite a vehement campaign by fringe, pro-LTTE diaspora and Tamil extremist groups to have it defined as such. Some are now using the Secretary-Generals remarks to validate their claims of ethnic cleansing in Sri Lanka.

Looking up from his speech, Mr. Ban told the audience that, Something more terrible, serious happened in the past. In 1994, in Rwanda, there was a massacre. More than one million people were massacred. United Nations felt responsible for that.

Of course, he continued, it was their war and massacres. But the United Nations was not able to act on it. We said repeatedly, Never again, never again.

Then, he goes on to say, I quote:

'How many times should we repeat never, never again? We did again in Sri Lanka. We have to do much more not to repeat such things in Sri Lanka, Yemen and elsewhere.'

, . . . Are we going to get categorized into Rwanda and other countries which fell into the genocide category? This is the clear categorization which Ban Ki-moons statement leads us to. This is the first time Ban Ki-moon has made such a statement. If the relevant organizations pursue this, it is going to be very adverse to Sri Lanka. Therefore, we call upon the Government to make a very clear statement, as we propose, that this should be denounced and rejected. I remember, the present Hon. Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training once sitting along with the UN Representative who came here, when the relevant Representative went out of the text and made a statement, he was very fast to correct it. That is the how Sri Lanka behaved in the past, but there is a different situation today. We call upon the Government now to make a statement and denounce this. The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is not a Head of a State. Heads of States and countries lead the United Nations Organization. He is only the Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization. It is very sad that we have to take up this matter, but the Joint Opposition calls upon the Government to make a clear statement on this.

, , . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella.

[5.26 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me one minute extra.

The topic of the Adjournment Motion today holds a paramount importance for the present and the future of Sri Lanka. The visit of Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the UN, last week has raised many questions in the minds of the decision-makers and the general public. To begin with, I would like to draw attention to a few salient remarks made by the Secretary-General.

To start with, in his statement, Mr. Ban Ki-moon has called for, " a reduction of the size of the military in the North and East" and he also pushed for " a speedier return of land to the internally displaced".

After his meeting with the UN Secretary-General, President Sirisena addressing the media also stated that he asked the UN Chief more time for reconciliation. In making these remarks and demands, Mr. Ban Ki-moon seems to have momentarily forgotten his mandate as per the UN Charter and has clearly overstepped his boundaries in trying to instruct a Government, or to interfere, as to how to take care of national security and internal affairs.

Secondly, I would like to place a few facts and refresh the memory of the UN Chief who is very critical of the Mahinda Rajapaksa-led Government claiming that not enough was done. At the end of the conflict in 2009, over 300,000 people were displaced and were living in camps. In less than two years, 95 per cent of them have been resettled. Over 12,000 known terrorists including child soldiers who surrendered and were captured were rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society. Enormous amount of money was spent on rehabilitation and reconstruction of railway, road network, schools, hospitals, health sector and so on and so forth. The call for an internal investigation was dealt with by the then Government, internally through the Paranagama Commission and the LLRC.

At the press conference held, the UN Secretary-General took questions from only a few selected journalists, and evaded responding to even those questions. He evaded the question when asked about his presumptions that war crimes occurred. When questioned on the involvement of foreign judges, he did not deny it. In fact, he went on to say that the country will have to work together with the international community and the United Nations on a transitional justice mechanism. Why would the UN or the international community be involved in the justice mechanism in Sri Lanka? Mr. Presiding Member, do we have a failed-justice system that needs international intervention?

105 106

When a question was posed on the double standards the UN has, the Secretary-General rejected those claims immediately. I would like to draw attention to one such recent incident on the double standards of the UN and of the international community. On the 3rd of October, 2015, a hospital in the Kunduz Region of Afghanistan was bombed by the American Air Force. It was a trauma centre run by Doctors Without Borders. Of the 42 lives that were lost, many were women, children and the staff of Doctors Without Borders. Where is the UN involvement in this incident? It was a blatant violation of human rights and the UN and the international community has been very quiet about it. Is it because the perpetrator was the US Air Force? I would like to ask the UN Secretary-General, is this not double standards? This is only one such instance whereas you can give hundreds of instances where UN has been totally and blatantly silent about killings.

Setting the record straight on the UN Secretary-Generals passing comment on how it was rather difficult to get the Mahinda Rajapaksa-led government to listen to even him as he put it, I would like to remind him that the Government of Sri Lanka was elected to do right by Sri Lankans and not yield to every whims and fancies of the international community whose suggestions were mostly on par with those of the LTTE diaspora and the separatist groups. At the press conference, Mr. Ban Ki-moon acknowledged that there was a huge difference between his first visit in 2009 and now.

He credited this change and said, this change was brought about with the active involvement of the international community, particularly the United Nations through the Human Rights Council. I would like to remind the Secretary-General that his first visit was to a country, for two days, coming out of a 30-year long brutal war against terrorism. The change he sees today is not the change brought in by the international community or the UN. It was a hard-earned change brought by peace-loving and hardworking Sri Lankans under the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Finally, Sir, I would like to make a reference to the Secretary-Generals remarks at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute where he drew a comparison between the incidents that took place in Rwanda in 1994, and in Srebrenica - a small village in Bosnia - in 1995, and the Sri Lankan conflict. The situations in Rwanda and Srebrenica were confirmed genocides, where one ethnic group killed the other. I would like to remind the United Nations Secretary-General that the situation in Sri Lanka was a democratically-elected government fighting one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world, an organization that was banned in most of the western nations that you uphold so highly. Unless the definition of the word genocide has been redefined, I would like to pose the question as to how these situations were put on par with each other. In fact, it seems as though the UN Secretary-General has added a title to his name as a spokesperson for the LTTE diaspora, as this is exactly what they have been trying to establish for years. Mr. Presiding Member, this is exactly what the LTTE and the

LTTE diaspora have been trying to establish saying that there was genocide in Sri Lanka, and he was drawing parallels with Rwanda and Srebrenica.

In fact, it is a shame that we as the Opposition has to be the ones to raise the questions and reject this statement made by the UN Secretary-General. It should be the Government who should be taking him to task on this statement. It also gives rise to questions in my mind as to why the comparison was made. The steps that followed once confirmed genocide was committed in Rwanda and Srebrenica were to establish a UN Security Council tribunal on those situations. Is that where the UN and the international community is leading Sri Lanka towards? I would like to ask this question.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have another two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, I will finish before that.

In conclusion, Sir, it baffles me as to why an outgoing Secretary-General with only three months left of his tenure was invited to Sri Lanka. If it was the intension of the Government, the UN and the international community that this visit would assist with the reconciliation effort, it has, in fact, proved the exact opposite. The Secretary-Generals statements and remarks during this visit have only given rise to many questions, doubts and has played on the sentiments of extremists.

Sir, give me just another minute, please.

Making reference to mistakes the UN has made in conflict-ridden situations and taking Sri Lanka as an example, he stated, We made big mistakes. We learnt very hard lessons on the part of the United Nations. I established internal investigations into what happened, into what our people of the UN had been doing at the time.

So, firstly, I would like to ask the UNSG where the reports of the internal investigations held are. It has been seven years since the conflict ended in Sri Lanka and the world is yet to see a report of the internal investigations conducted by the United Nations on Sri Lanka. I find it quite strange that a person who is skeptical and critical of internal investigations would go ahead and hold only an internal inquiry into what the UN was doing at the height of the conflict in Sri Lanka and have no report or repercussions to show from there onwards.

Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me time to speak. I think this is a very timely matter. It is not a matter for different political parties to conflict on. It is a matter of our country and its future, and I believe, honestly, that we need to look at it in that perspective, not in the perspective of political alliances.

I would thank you once again, Sir.

This is my first visit to Sri Lanka since 2009, when I saw great suffering and hardship. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced and in need of humanitarian aid after the terrible conflict that tore the country apart. I called for fast reconciliation and action to build peace, in the knowledge that conflict can recur in fragile post-war societies." Then he says, "Today, the picture is very different. I congratulate the Government and people of Sri Lanka for the progress you have made. There remains much hard work ahead, but you have moved with determination along a new path with great promise for all the countrys people.

international community, particularly the United Nations, through the Human Rights Council. He says that, but that is not the truth. That is what I say.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) But, I can tell you one thing. Hon. Member, I am the one who went to the Human Rights Council. From 2009 till 2014, I led the Sri Lankan delegation. It was only one year that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris led the Sri Lankan delegation. Whenever we went there, we talked of and we tabled the progress that we had made. But, unfortunately, there were very many more things that they expected us to do. Now, we also had our limitations. You cannot bring about reconciliation overnight. This is something that takes time. I was a part of that Government. You and I, both, were sitting in that Cabinet. We were party to the decisions that were taken. There was work done during that period also. But, what I am saying is, this is an observation that the Secretary-General is making, that he is pleased to see that progress has been achieved. That is good for all of us. Now, he says that he congratulates the Government on the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Right to Information Bill. Then, he says, "I commend your efforts to move forward on a comprehensive transitional justice agenda and on a constitutional reform process"- that Parliament is actually giving attention as we speak today. Then he says, I also welcome the symbolic steps you have taken, including the decision to sing the national anthem in Sinhala and Tamil on Independence Day last February for the first time since the 1950s. These steps have built confidence and trust, and strengthened transparency and accountability." So, this is what the Secretary-General of the United Nations coming to Sri Lanka and saying as part of his official statement.

Then, he deviated from this official statement and mentioned in the context of what the UN should have done and did not do in various conflict situations. In that context, he brought in Srebrenica and Rwanda. He talked about Rwanda first. We know that in Rwanda there was a genocide, there was a massacre, and about 800,000 civilians were killed. In Srebrenica, we know that there was a massacre of about 7,000 Bosnian Muslims. Now, that situation cannot be compared to Sri Lanka. - [Interruption.] That is what is wrong. Can I finish, Hon. Presiding Member? I was in the audience. I was listening very attentively to what he was saying.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Member, you must allow me to speak. The reason that I said I was there was to vouch for the fact that he did not compare Rwanda and Srebrenica with Sri Lanka. I was there. -[Interruption.] Can I finish, please?

[6.13 p.m.] ( ( ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Madam Chairperson, in spite of the screaming Members of the Opposition, Sri Lanka is a proud member of the United Nations Organization. We joined the United Nations in 1955.

We, as the guardian of the teachings of Gautama Buddha, which is in line with the moral voice that the United Nations seeks to be in this world, should be proud to uphold the values, principles, and norms that the Charter of the United Nations sets out. Sri Lanka should be a leading voice as a promoter of universal values that are set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Charter of the United Nations.

Madam Presiding Member, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, honoured this nation and our people undertaking an official visit to Sri Lanka from 31st August to 2nd September 2016. He travelled to Galle, as the Hon. Member just mentioned, where he mingled with youth from all parts of our country. He inspired and encouraged them with his words of wisdom. He urged them to work to become true global citizens. He inspired them to work together with young people from different neighbourhoods, ethnic groups or religions and share their vision for a sustainable and peaceful future, not only for Sri Lanka, but for our planet. I do not understand why the Hon. Member cannot appreciate that position.

The Secretary-General spoke of the "great transition and progress, landmark progress", achieved by Sri Lanka since his last visit in 2009. He also travelled to Jaffna as the Hon. Member mentioned and had meetings with the Governor of the Northern Province, the Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance, and met the Chief Minister of the Northern Province. While in Jaffna, he visited the Palai Veemankaman South village resettlement camp.

He held official meetings with the President and the Prime Minister, the Hon. Speaker of Parliament and leaders of political parties. At these meetings, the Secretary-General commended the substantial progress achieved by the National Unity Government in working towards reconciliation and a durable peace, strengthening democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression and good governance under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister, since January 2015. He also met with representatives of civil society and some of the independent commissions.

Under the leadership of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, we have once again restored Sri Lankas image as a responsible and respected nation

121 122

on the world stage. So much so that we are now hailed as an example to other States. We acknowledge the problems we have. We do not shoot messengers. We work together with dignity and decorum and through discussion and engagement to find solutions that are in the best interest of all our people. Let me repeat "all our people". We do not engage in withholding from our people what is beneficial to them or what is in their best interest in the long-run and this includes strong institutions, an independent judiciary, good governance, rule of law, individual rights, economic prosperity, safety and security and a durable peace, which guarantees the non-recurrence of conflict.

Madam Presiding Member, while thanking the Member of Parliament, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena for posing a question concerning the visit of the UN Secretary-General, I must inform this House that contrary to what the Hon. Member says, the Secretary-General did not say anything during his visit that defamed our countrys image, undermined its unity, sovereignty or territorial integrity.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Madam Presiding Member, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Deputy Minister, in an Adjournment Motion we expect the answers for the questions that we have posed. The other thing is -[Interruption] You are misleading. Out of imaginations, you are speaking.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Instead, his visit and his remarks served to strengthen Sri Lankas image in the eyes of the world. It enhanced Sri Lankas profile as a nation, perhaps the only one of its kind in the world at this moment in history, which has forged a consensus among the two main parties in Parliament to work towards addressing pressing issues and challenges faced by the people.

Ours is a country which seeks to heal; which seeks to reconcile; which seeks to understand the pain of the

problems of people and find durable solutions with empathy; which seeks to usher in reform to institutionalize good governance practices, strengthen the rule of law and individual rights and works hard at bringing in the necessary economic reform that would result in growth and equitable development that will benefit all.

It is steps like this that will enhance our sovereignty; it is steps like this that will safeguard our sovereignty and our territorial integrity. It is by addressing our problems and by working in engagement with others as a responsible State that we can safeguard our unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty - not by shouting of slogans until we turn hoarse or not by sitting in protest or by burning effigies of visiting dignitaries.

Madam Presiding Member, in this context, I want to specifically mention to those with diabolical intent who try to give various interpretations to the Secretary-Generals remarks that the National Unity Government is committed to safeguarding the unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and welfare of all our people and that includes our security forces who have spared no effort to combat terrorism.

The way we safeguard our motherland and our security forces is not by shouting slogans but through meaningful actions, constructive engagement, dialogue and most importantly by addressing issues, facing challenges and crafting solutions. Amidst efforts to mislead the public and stall action in Parliament through disruption and rioting, the Government with the support of the Members of Parliament from the Opposition, JVP and the TNA saw through the passage of legislation last month to establish an Office on Missing Persons. This was a humanitarian measure aimed at alleviating the pain and anguish of the mothers and fathers of our nation who seek answers to the fate that befell their children, family members who have gone missing.

It is by addressing issues in a responsible manner that we can lift the cloud of allegations that hang over the heads of our security forces and our country. It is by our own accord and our best interest that we decided to co-sponsor the UN Human Rights Council Resolution that incorporated our proposals to set up mechanisms for truth seeking, justice and reparations, and to take steps for non-recurrence aimed at achieving sustainable peace in the country for good of all communities. We believe that the process undertaken by Sri Lanka through truth seeking and accountability will reinforce democracy, freedom, and human rights in the country. Sri Lankas constructive engagement with Human Rights mechanisms has also paved the way for visits of a number of special rapporteurs to this country, engage with Government officials and people, and see for themselves the actual developments in the country through a candid and open engagement. This approach has been very much appreciated not only by the local communities but also by the international community.

In this context, the UN Secretary-Generals visit and his engagements with all segments of Sri Lankans

123 124

[ () ]

2016 06

demonstrates the constructive approach that this country has adopted in achieving progress on multiple fronts and multiple issues. Despite these positive trends, some sections have been attempting to cast the visit of the Secretary-General in a negative light by misinterpreting comments made by him in his speech at the public event at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute on 2nd September. These sections have conveniently opted to completely ignore the many positive comments made by the Secretary-General.

The UNSG referred to the ambitious reform programme set by the Government and stated that we have made significant progress in implementing the programme. He congratulated the Government on the many achievements earlier listed by the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe and much more. As this House is well aware, there is still much left to do. Therefore, it is only natural that the Secretary-General also pointed this out and encouraged the Government to continue with its efforts for meaningful reconciliation.

The Secretary-General acknowledged that there is no fast route to achieving this. He stated that reconciliation would take many years of political courage and determination. Madam Presiding Member, we believe that the Secretary-Generals visit and his two-day engagement with Government leaders and civil society is a very positive development and it demonstrates the goodwill that has been recognized by the international community for Sri Lankas sincere commitment to re-engaging with the UN system and finding meaningful solutions to reconciliation and peace building.

Further, an open and an honest engagement with international partners is in line with the mandate given by the people of the country to the Unity Government in order to restore the international image of the country. We believe that we have made successful progress in this regard. We are well aware that some sections are attempting to cast the comments made by the Secretary-General negatively for political purposes. Instead it should be noted that the Secretary-General acknowledged that the UN itself has made some mistakes in several cases particularly in Rwanda and Srebrenica and that the work done by the UN was not sufficient including in Sri Lanka.

There was no equating of the situations as mentioned by the speeches in support of this Adjournment Motion. In fact, I have the verbatim of his statement. As the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe also mentioned, the Secretary-General says, Something happened, during my time as Secretary-General, in Sri Lanka. But something more serious, terrible happened in the past. and, he refers to Rwanda. So, if you are unable to comprehend the difference, then that is not my problem. That is your problem. You have a problem in understanding. He says, Something happened, during my time, in Sri Lanka but

something more serious, terrible happened in Rwanda. - [Interruption.] So, this is the verbatim. This is exactly what the Secretary-General said. So, if the Hon. Members of the Opposition are unable to comprehend simple English, Madam Presiding Member that is not my problem. This shows your inability to understand the language. You have misconstrued it and then gone before Sinhala press and told lies. Do not do that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) We disagree with the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardenas proposal that Sri Lankas image has been tarnished and the territorial integrity, unity and sovereignty and respect of the country has been violated by the visit of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . . ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) On the contrary, I must stress that the previous Governments non-engagement with the international community seriously eroded Sri Lankas image in the international arena. We are determined to strive on the path of reconciliation in the interest of this nation so that the people of our country can live in safety without fear and progress in unity towards prosperity.

Finally, Madam Presiding Member, I must also state that the Secretary-Generals visit has further strengthened the cooperation between the UN and its agencies with Sri Lanka and helped this nation advance its status as a responsible and respected Member-State of the United Nations.

Thank you very much. . . Question put, and agreed to. . . 6.30 2016 07 .. 1.00 .
