The front page of Daily Mirror newspaper of 19th September, 2016 has also reported this incident. I quote:

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Hon. Minister will answer that Question tomorrow. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . : : PURCHASE OF HARDWARE FOR DIGITALIZATION OF PEOPLES BANK: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim - Minister of Public Enterprise Development ) Hon. Speaker, the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development is responsible for ensuring good governance at State-owned institutions. These institutions have independent Boards of Directors. The Directors, along with the management, have the mandate to oversee the day-to-day operations and make commercially-viable decisions. However, as State institutions, those are bound by the Government regulations and processes. Under the guidance of His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are committed to transparency and accountability, which are two of the fundamental pillars of Good Governance.

The Question raised with reference to a tender floated for the procurement of hardware as part of the digitalization initiative at the Peoples Bank is one that is still in process and has not been awarded. The tender has an estimated spend of US Dollars 4.5 to 5.5 million over a period five years. The Hon. Member raised a question about the duration of the tender period. The management at the Peoples Bank had provided five days for bidders to provide responses to the RFP. Subsequently, this was extended to two weeks, based on a request made by one of the vendors. The Hon. Member of Parliament has also questioned the tendering process and requested an inquiry be held.

595 596

Furthermore, some media outlets have sensationalized this and cast aspersions on the integrity of the Bank. There has not been any formal complaint to the Ministry or to any authority officially, except allegations made through newspapers. I would like to inform the House that the Board of Directors had decided to call for two expert opinions on the process of selection of the tender. I will also ensure that the Secretary of the Ministry will be engaged with the Peoples Bank to look into the appointment of the said two experts to get their opinions and will also ask the Secretary to ensure that the due processes have been adhered to.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker this is a question in relation to a tender and the tender procedure had apparently not been followed. That is why I raised the issue. The Hon. Minister also mentioned that the officials of the Ministry were advised to go into the matter. The "Ceylon Today" of Sunday, 11th September, 2016 reported this incident on one whole page under the heading "People's Bank in 'cover-up' mode" - I do not want to go into the matter - stating that three Directors had objected or questioned the relevant decision and complained to higher authorities about the violation of this tender procedure. Now, that is the question before us, which should be addressed and corrected. That is all we are interested in. You should take steps to correct it. In addition to that, let me also tell you - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, time is a problem. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Minister will answer. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. You just raise the question. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Peoples Bank will also run into difficulty, if we do not allow this problem to be cleared. The Hon. Minister has responded. I am not going to question the Hon. Minister. I am only trying to ask you, Hon. Minister, whether you will hold an inquiry so that the relevant people will be able to come for the inquiry and lay down the facts, because it has not been done so. There is propaganda that is being taken in. Very clearly, three Directors had objected to it and it is in black and white in the Minutes of the Board.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) The reason is, it has been transparent. There are Directors who can object and give their opinions. It was done. Still, the tender has not been awarded. There is no scandal involved because it is still in the process. The Board of the Bank itself has decided to seek two expert opinions to ensure that the process is transparent. So, we will definitely give the opportunity to anybody to make representations to the experts' committee and then, they can lay down the facts. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Have you appointed - ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) No, we have yet not appointed. But, the Board of Directors has already decided to do that. I will ask the Secretary to my Ministry to get involved in the process of getting the two expertscommittee set up to get their opinion. It is very simple. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, that is fine. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, Hon. Minister, there was a similar decision taken by this Board on awarding a US Dollars 11 million tender to Silverlake Axis, Malaysia. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is what I am saying.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) It has not yet been awarded to anybody. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I know. The Hon. Minister has already replied. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Central Bank has questioned this decision of the Board on awarding this. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, now you have devoted your attention to this, have you not? ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Speaker, I would like to answer that. If there were any allegations, then there is a process to follow. You can go and make a complaint. You can make a complaint to the Ministry or to the - [Interruption.] But, this is all on newspaper hearsay; there is no real fact. So, you have to come up with a complaint. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I only hope that the Hon. Minister would appoint a committee to hear any other - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Yes, certainly. We are open to that. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is fine. We will leave it at that. ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I will ask the Secretary to work with the Board of the People's Bank to have a committee appointed to get the opinion of anybody who is interested. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is fine. Now, that matter is closed.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, we have to be very careful because this is a tender which has not yet been finalized by the People's Bank. When, the newspapers publish one full-page article, it can put the reputation of the Bank in risk. So, let the tender process take place and then we can look at what happens. Now, the Hon. Minister is having an eye on it. But, when different newspapers run on this, on which the Hon. Minister has had no complaint, sometimes the reputation of the Bank can be at risk. ( ) (The Hon.
