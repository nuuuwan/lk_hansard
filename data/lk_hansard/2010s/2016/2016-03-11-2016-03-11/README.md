( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Wajira Abeywardana - Minister of Home Affairs) I propose that the Hon. J.M. Ananda Kumarasiri do now take the Chair. , . . Question put, and agreed to. , .. . , , .. . Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. J.M. ANANDA KUMARASIRI took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Sumanthiran, please. [12.13p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member for the opportunity given to speak on the Orders and the Bills that have been presented today. I wish to say a few words on the two Bills that have now been presented by the Hon. Minister of Labour. Initially, I would like to welcome this move, particularly, the budgetary relief allowance of workers and the consideration of the Government for workers who draw less than Rs. 14,000

mensem and some relief through this process. I am sure, although the amounts are low, since those are persons, in any case who draw fairly low salaries, they will find some relief through the enactment of this legislation.

Secondly, I would also like to congratulate the Government and welcome the National Minimum Wage of Workers Bill, setting out very clearly the minimum wage of workers per day and per month. As the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena asked the Hon. Minister a moment ago, Rs. 400 per day is not the actual market wage of any workman, but we are conscious of the fact that you are prescribing a minimum wage, not the market wage. So, to that extent, I would welcome it; although I would have preferred if it was Rs. 600 and Rs. 15,000 per month. Nevertheless, the very idea of introducing this Bill is most welcome and the implementation of this, the supervision and action against errant employers is the key if the workers are to actually reap the benefits of these legislative measures that you are bringing in.

Now, that brings me to a crucial issue addressed by the Hon. Minister right at the end of his speech of the non-inclusion of domestic workers in the definition of the law. It is only the Industrial Disputes Act, under which domestic workers actually can make a complaint, but most of the other legal regimes covering work excludes domestic workers. I heard the Hon. Minister say that whilst he appreciated that it would be a good thing to include the domestic workers, the supervision of this is not possible or is difficult. Now, that difficulty, I think would go to any sector of employment; any trade for that matter. Labour Inspectors have to go in to the kitchens of various shops to detect employees who are not registered for statutory payments and so on. There is a law, an ancient law, Registration of Domestic Servants Ordinance that is still in our Statute books which requires the registration of domestic workers with the police station. Failure to do so and non-production of pocket register and so on and so forth, makes the employer liable for certain punishments. This law may have fallen into disuse. The objective of that law may have been very different and may not suit modern times, but it is not impossible; if in 1827 or somewhere they provided for registration, it is not impossible to contemplate a registration mechanism and, surely, the workers themselves can register. This is a sector - whilst they have their own limitations and I will come to all those now - but this is also a sector that can wield bargaining power. Because of the limitations of law now they are unable to wield that bargaining power. And, anybody who wants to engage the services of a domestic worker also knows how difficult that is. So, the point I am making to the Hon. Minister is that registration is something that the worker himself or herself can also take an initiative of, and if there is provision for that, then that can be included. If that is the only difficulty that the Department of Labour envisages, I think, that is something that is easily surmountable and it will bring an

533 534

2016 11

enormous amount of relief to domestic workers. We are signatories to the ILO Convention C189, but we have not ratified it. But if we do ratify it, we will be bound to implement several provisions relating to domestic workers rights.

There have been some surveys done with regard to domestic workers in Sri Lanka. There are supposed to be around 90,000 domestic workers and more than two-thirds of them are women. Now, therein lies a lot of issues. It has also been found that in our country out of the women labour force, one in three are domestic workers: one in three of our female labour force are actually domestic workers. The reason for this is because of various pressures that women in employment face - like tending for families, child birth, various other factors - continuity in employment for women, as we all know, is a difficult exercise. Therefore, at some point or the other, they choose to do domestic work and then we find that there is no legal protection for domestic workers. So, we have a situation where this is not their preferred choice. This is something that they fall back on. Even for people who go abroad as housemaids, we have various regulations governing their protection. Once they return, they then become domestic workers, not for anything else, but because that is the only work that they seem to be able to fit into and earn some living. But, when they do that they are outside the protection of the law- there is no minimum wage; there are no prescribed hours of work and various other issues arise. The basic minimum protection that any workman should have is denied to this "one sector"; it is only to this "one sector" and that is my appeal to the Hon. Minister, today. Earlier, I remember we excluded private chauffeurs or personal drivers and domestic workers. Now, they have been included. It is only the domestic workers who are excluded from the definition of workman in all of the legislation that we have. Today, if the Minister is informing us that the reason for that is the difficulty faced by the Department in actually locating these workers, I say with all humility, that that cannot be the case. There have been surveys done and they have found all these details. It is easier to locate them than to find people in various wayside shops.

This affects women. So, as I said, that raises another very important issue of equality in our social institutions, particularly when women are actually bringing in the money to keep the home fires burning, and they are denied that protection; whilst although there are men also who are caught up in this category, they are very small in number.

As you yourself said, for the last ten years, there has not been legislation with regard to minimum wage. Therefore, at the time when you are making progressive legislation that should have been made long ago, you are doing that leaving out a significant section of our labour force - the most marginalized section of our labour force - the sector of employment that women are able to choose from the provision of law that you are introducing is something that we would like to highlight. So, I would

urge, even before the end of the day, the Minister to take steps to leave out that exclusion. All that needs to be done is, under the definition of "worker" the words does not include a domestic servant to be left out. As the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara says, that is all that we have to do. Leave that open and then it is caught up. Then further steps can be taken with regard to registration and other measures of supervision, EPF, ETF, gratuity and period of employment and so on. This is a sector in which period of employment may not extend long periods - not for five years or more, much less. It is very few who work in homes for their lifetime. There are others who work in multiple homes. So, it is a unique situation and legislation and other supervisory measures have to be taken, taking into account the peculiarity of this particular sector of employment.

Therefore, I would urge the Hon. Minister to take the first step today in recognizing this important sector as part of the progressive legislation that you have presented to the House. In both these pieces of legislation, they are being specifically excluded. So, I would urge the Hon. Minister to remove that exclusion, include them as the first necessary step. Then there are some other pieces of legislation which also have excluded them and those amendments can be brought in.

Maybe you can ratify the ILO Convention C189 and bring in the provisions of C189 into the legislative framework of this country, because we stand on the principle that any work has dignity. If we are today excluding this sector, it is a slur on their dignity and that has been the culture also in the way we treat this sector of employees. But, that is not right and I do not think this House would agree that that should continue any longer.

If we have made that mistake all these years, I would urge the Hon. Minister to take the necessary steps between now and the end of the day, and consult with the officials and bring in one small Amendment to this Bill at the Committee Stage. I am sure the whole House will agree with you and applaud you for that.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Sitting is suspended till 1.30 p.m. , .. 1.30 . , .. 130 . Sitting accordingly suspended till 1.30 p.m. and then resumed. ( ) (Chief of Staff and Deputy Secretary-General of Parliament) .

Hon. Minister, I think, the Collective Agreement is not functional now. The main Collective Agreement says about extra wages to pruners, kankanis, supervisors,

and many others. That should be existing. Every two years, we increase the salaries, but that has now lapsed. The estate workers are fully entitled to that Rs.2,500. Whenever, we enter into a Collective Agreement, if it is more than that, then of course, we will have to take it up for discussion.
