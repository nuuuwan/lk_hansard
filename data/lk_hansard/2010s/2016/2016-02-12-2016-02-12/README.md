. . . . , . . " " " " . . . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . . [3.13p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana Seyed) Hon. Deputy Speaker, first of all let me thank the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana for bringing in this Private Members Motion on issuing Death Certificates for the disappeared people.

I must make a special mention with regard to the year 1990, during conflict times, where hundreds of innocent people disappeared or abducted and were massacred by terrorist groups.

On 3rd August 1990, in Kattankudy Jummah Mosque and Hussainiya Mosque, a mass massacre of 103 people took place while they were praying. According to the Islamic rites, we perform the burial as soon as possible - within 24 hours - which is the practice amongst Muslims.

During that time, the situation in our area and surrounding villages was that we did not have government institutions or machinery properly manned and was poorly represented and even the Member of Parliament who represents the area could not be there physically to take care of these matters in person. It was virtually an idyllic and non-functional situation.

However we had to conduct an inquest on the massacre as soon as possible and make arrangements to issue Death Certificates to the families of the bereaved, prior to burial. While the emotional wave rode high amongst the people due to such unprecedented massacre in the area we had to make arrangements for the mass burial of the 103 massacred individuals killed by terrorists during congregational prayers. It definitely was not an easy task. However we managed to conduct the inquest and have Death Certificates issued for all 103 Janazas.

Likewise, Hon. Deputy Speaker, the following week, on 12th August 1990, another massacre occurred in the

1007 1008

Batticaloa District, in my own hometown called Eravur, in Saddam Hussain Village, where almost 143 innocent people, including women, pregnant women, children, infants and the elderly, were all massacred around midnight whilst they were asleep in their houses.

I happened to be in Colombo that day, and when I heard of the incident at around 5a.m, I immediately called our then President, His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa and informed him of the calamity that was intimated to me. He called me back and confirmed immediately and ordered the Army, Police and Air Force to provide security to our villages instantly. He made special arrangements for us to fly to Batticaloa and I managed to make it to my hometown Eravur, in the morning itself.

That same day we managed to trace all the deceased in the affected area, conduct an inquest, and made funeral arrangements and mass burial took place by 6p.m that evening.

After the burial the people were so afraid and insecure that they may be still surrounded by terrorists, as there were neither electricity, telephone services nor security for the people. Such was the situation.

Despite all these difficulties, I was there with my people and I made sure that Death Certificates were issued to the affected families so that they could get at least some compensation. The bread winners were gone; the youth on whom the future of these families relied were also gone all of a sudden. With all these emotions and the frustrated situation of our people I had to assure them that they will be getting some sort of assistance and facilitating the issuance of the Death Certificate was one of the documents that they could hold on to until normalcy was restored way later on.

Similarly Sir, somewhere in July 1990, before the aforementioned massacres, 120 people returning from the Hajj Pilgrimage were stopped at a place called Ampalanthurai and Palankuda area and were abducted. Till today, their whereabouts are unknown - be they dead or alive. All of them are from Katankudy and their families do not know if they are living or not. The families of these abducted Hajjajis have been inquiring about them wondering whether anything can be confirmed of their disappearance.

Some of the families have even identified locations of mass burial sites where bodies have been dumped, and still proper arrangements have not been made to exhume and examine the remains. This calamity occurred way back in 1990 to the people of Kattankudy.

If some of such mass dumping of bodies is being found, forensic investigations could be carried out to identify if these were the said Hajj group, so that the respective families could have a decent burial and have a closure in this chapter and also obtain the Death Certificates.

Many more incidents such as these can be mentioned which took place at Alinjupothanai in the Polonnaruwa District, Palliyagodalla, Ahamadupuram, and Pangurana. Such border villages have also undergone mass massacre of Muslims in the same year.

Sir, there are so many letters of complaints that keep coming in about such incidents. Therefore, I must thank Hon. Buddhika Pathirana for bringing this Motion and also for giving me the opportunity to highlight such incidents on behalf of those affected families. I also take this opportunity to ask the Government to take necessary action accordingly to look into these very serious issues and do the needful in providing Death Certificates to those families who have grieved the sudden disappearance of their loved ones in these unfortunate situations.

Thank you Sir, for giving me the time to speak on this matter.
