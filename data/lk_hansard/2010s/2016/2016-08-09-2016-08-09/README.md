VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL: DETERMINATION

OF THE SUPREME COURT ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to the House that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the

Bill titled Value Added Tax (Amendment) which has been challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121 of the Constitution.

The court has determined that the provisions contained in Article 152 of the Constitution and Standing Order 133 are imperative in character and the failure to follow them render the subsequent proceedings nullity.

Since the due process had not been complied with in terms of Article 78 (2) and Article 152 in the Constitution before the Bill was introduced in Parliament, the Supreme Court has made in terms of Articles 120 and 121 read with Articles 123 and 152 of the Constitution that no determination would be made at this stage on the ground of challenge raised by the petitioners.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays proceedings.

Speaker, in deference to the judgment of the Supreme Court, we will re-present this Bill in the House later. But, there are a large number of Bills which have become laws in this Parliament, the last Parliament and the Parliament before, following the procedure in respect of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill. Now, this raises an issue, which I think I should point out to you. While we have got this question out of the way, I think the House will have to give a Ruling on this matter because, . . . .

FISCAL MANAGEMENT (RESPONSIBILITY)

(AMENDMENT) BILL

. . Order for Second Reading read. [2.58pm] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - Minister of Finance) I move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.

Sir, we are debating today the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) (Amendment) Bill. As you know, this was enacted in 2003 and at that time the limit set on GDP was 4.5 per cent. After that, on the 01st of January, 2013, this was increased by the then Government to 7 per cent. Since then, up to 2015, you had certain snowballing payments made. There was Rs. 796 billion paid in the year 2015. Another proposed that this would be going up to Rs. 1,137 billion. So, that is, it would increase by Rs. 341 billion. On the 31st of December, 2015, the total stood at Rs. 603 billion. That is the total commitment given by the Government. The 2016 figure remains to be Rs. 186 billion and this is related to State-owned enterprises.

[5.47p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for the opportunity given to participate in the Debate on the Amendment to Fiscal Management (Responsibility) (Amendment) Act. Although the proposed Amendment is a very short one, the only thing that is sought to be done in that, is to change the percentages in the original Act with regard to the extension of government guarantees from seven per cent of GDP to 10 per cent of GDP. Now, if one considers the quantum of GDP, this is a huge sum and this is a matter that was considered by the Committee on Public Finance. There is a Report that was submitted at the last Session where two recommendations have been unanimously made and I would like to state that here in my speech and I am also moving some Committee Stage Amendments in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on Public Finance. The Committee, unanimously, with Hon. Members from both sides of the House, said that it is not advisable to extend the government guarantees on behalf of the Public-Private Partnership in which the Government holds less than 50 per cent of shares. I am saying this because the proposal to increase it from seven per cent to 10 per cent of the GDP was made in the Budget Speech by the Hon. Minister of Finance when he presented the Budget Proposals on 20th November, 2015. Under paragraph 422 he stated, I quote:

Honourable Speaker, I propose to increase the guarantee limit under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (FMRA) from current 7 percent of GDP to 10 percent of GDP, and to enable the issuance of guarantees to Public Private Partnerships in which the government holding is less than 50 percent, at a fee. Regulations will be issued enabling the issuance of Treasury Guarantees on a fee basis.

So, this is the rational according to the Hon. Minister of Finance for the increase of the Treasury Guarantee limit from seven per cent of the GDP to 10 per cent of the GDP. There are two aspects to this; one is, perhaps, the limit has been reached and the Government is unable to issue Treasury Guarantees even for State entities because you have already reached the saturation point of seven per cent. But, there is another proposal here - a very curious one - which says to extend this Treasury Guarantees on behalf of the Public-Private Partnership in which the Government holding is less than 50 per cent. It does not give the limit; presently perhaps, the rules under which these guarantees are given, require that the Government has control over these enterprises. So, you have a shareholding of more than 50 per cent. But, the proposal is, by amending and increasing that limit, you propose to give guarantees to even entities and enterprises in which the Government holds less than 50 per cent.

It does not have a lower limit, which means, even in enterprises where the Government holding is .0001 per

cent, a Treasury guarantee, a sovereign guarantee is given and even if it is given for a fee that is a very serious issue, because any time there is a default the Government must honour its guarantee. We have had a very good track record as a country in honouring guarantees. Therefore, we propose that that not be done and that you cannot open it up for the Government to give Treasury guarantees in enterprises in which Government holds measly shareholding and therefore appropriately the limit also must be adjusted. You do not need to raise it to 10 per cent. You can perhaps raise it to eight per cent. Therefore, in respect of both these matters I have already tendered a Committee Stage amendment that I will be moving and I want to bring to the notice of the House that these amendments are in line with the unanimous recommendation of the Committee on Public Finance.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

I think we will meet the expectations that you wanted. I think that the Hon. Sumanthiran spoke on behalf of the plural Opposition Members of Parliament who are there and we will certainly accept that you have brought that forward in that spirit and I hope that you will reciprocate in the same manner. At the end of the day, we want to bring in financial discipline. The Hon. Prime Minister has mentioned that financial consolidation will take place by the year 2020 which will be 3.5 per cent of the budget deficit. Our journey is increasing fiscal space by increasing revenue, reducing the cost and ensuring that we put that to productive use. Productive use is capital expenditure and that is to what we are basically coming forward. So, I do not want to deliberate this any further. I only want to mention that these were the salient facts that were discussed and we are ready to accommodate that and go forward.

Thank you, Sir.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, with regard to this amendment, just a moment ago the Hon. Minister gave an undertaking that where the Government holding is less than 50 per cent, still it will be over 20 per cent. Now, how will that be incorporated into this? It is an assurance that you have given on the Floor of this House, I am willing to accept it. This is a concern that was raised in the Committee on Public Finance.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, if it is legally in order, we can bring that in saying anything that is over 20 per cent only can get a Government guarantee. If that can be incorporated, that is not a problem.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Even if by way of a Regulation if that could be brought about and that guarantee is given by the Minister, I am not moving that amendment.

[6.41 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. I think it is a timely Adjournment Motion regarding the problems faced by Sri Lanka in the development projects as one of the smallest Asian countries.

I am really thankful to the Hon. Speaker for giving the Hon. Thilakarajah and myself an opportunity to take part in the Asian Parliamentary Association in Pakistan a few weeks back where 43 countries took part. Hon. Members of Parliament and Senators from all the Asian countries were present there. The same problems that we face here are faced by almost all the other countries. We all stressed the problems faced by the South East Asian countries including Sri Lanka and realized the problems faced by all the countries are almost the same. Sir, I followed the speech made by the Hon. Buddhika Pathiran. The same pattern was followed there. We had long discussions with the Hon. Members of Parliament and the Senators there. Actually, we must thank the Government of Pakistan and also the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan for organizing this event. We mostly discussed trade and problems faced by all these countries. I would like to table* the speech made there by myself.

Every country represented in that Association is experiencing the same problems we are facing here today. We spoke about trade. In fact, both of us had a discussion with the Chairman of the Senate for 15 minutes where we discussed trade relations between

1093 1094

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Pakistan and Sri Lanka. There we stressed that we had a good relationship earlier with the Pakistan Government. We told them that they helped us to win the war. Similarly, we reminded them about the Bangladesh war where our previous Government allowed their planes to be landed here and proceeded to Bangladesh. Actually, they are very keen to improve the industries of our country. Also, we brought to their notice the houses built by the Indian Government and requested that they follow suit. Now time has come for us to get together. We must get the help of the other countries also.

When we take the industries or the mega projects implemented in this country, they have been a real failure. That is why we are facing all these problems today. So, we must think of a future where we can make people happy and peaceful by developing our trade and industries. As you know, certain industries were started by the previous Government taking big loans, but what happened was they have been a failure. For instances, take the Mattala Airport, the Harbour and the Cricket Stadium in the Hambantota District. I do not think they have played at least ten matches a year in the Cricket Stadium in Hambantota. So, this is the situation.

I must also speak about the SriLankan Airlines. I read in the newspapers that there are only 23 flights for SriLankan Airlines whereas there are 300 pilots and 8,000 employees. This is the situation. Every organization in this country is facing this problem. So, to bring in a peaceful existence for our people, we have to concentrate on these things. It is useless speaking of the past because the damage is already done. Actually speaking they have spent billions unnecessarily. Why we are facing this situation is because the expected income from all those mega projects which were done earlier is not coming. That is why the Treasury has to pay. In fact, it must be corrected.

The former Minister of Sports is not here. There are several cricket grounds available in the country. In Colombo, there are three or four stadiums. In Kandy, there is the Asgiriya Stadium. In Dambulla, there is a stadium. But what did they do? They did not improve the Asgiriya Stadium. Without doing that they opened another. Look at the stadium in Hambantota. I think, only elephants are there now. I am a big fan of cricket. I think they did not play even ten matches in Hambantota for the last two to three years. Millions of rupees have been wasted to maintain that stadium. This is the situation our country is in today.

Take for instance the CTB. The CTB is facing the same plight. Although there are 2,000 odd buses there are only 1,600 drivers and 1,400 conductors but there are 8,000 employees doing nothing. All these things will have to be put right.

I know that His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister together with the Cabinet are trying to bring all these things under control. Of course, it will take some time. It cannot be done overnight. It is only twelve months since our Government came into power. I do not think it is possible to solve all these problems within twelve months. However, gradually we can improve the situation and our industries and agriculture will help us move forward.

Thank you. [6.49 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for the opportunity given to me to speak on this important subject, evaluation of development and making policies. I thank Hon. Buddhika Pathirana for moving this timely Adjournment Motion. I also thank the Hon. Speaker for giving me this opportunity to participate in the forum in Pakistan which focused on adopting legislation to support the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September last year in New York.

I was able to put forward some suggestions at this Standing Committee of Asian Parliamentary Assembly on Economic and Sustainable Development Affairs. Both as a member country and as a Parliamentarian, we actively participated and we were able to get some experience from the other countries that participated from the Asian Region. Forty-two countries were there. They were discussing the adoption of legislation with regard to Sustainable Development Goals.

I heard the concept of sustainable development during my college days and we were taught that we must reach that in next 10 years - it was in early 1990's. Then I heard the concept of "Millennium Development Goals". It was determined in the year 2000 and it was said that we must reach the 10 goals. It was a global concept. Globally we had to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Then again I heard the same wordings, but with some developments to the Millennium Development Goals. It was called, Sustainable Development Goals, which was determined in September last year. Those goals should be reached by 2030. That UN Summit was held in New York. I was able to participate in that Summit as a civil society member. Even though I was a Member of Parliament- I was a new Member in September, 2015 - I was able to sit at that table where it was determined. There I understood that there are 17 goals to be achieved by 2030 to reach sustainable development. The main aspects are environment, poverty alleviation and there are so many other things that I will not describe here. We all know those aspects. But, at this juncture, what are the experiences that we can get from our neighbour countries? There was the Speaker from Bhutan. He was

explaining that they were able to plant 50,000 trees a year to preserve their environment for a better future. There was a Senator from Pakistan. They were introducing a proactive Parliament. They call it, Green Parliament.

The entire roof of their House of Parliament is covered with solar power panels and they produce electricity for the Upper House and the Lower House. They have taken this step to strengthen their development plan and as an example project on how to achieve Sustainable Development Goals and promote environmental protection.

As a representative of a member country, I was able to put forward some suggestions to the Standing Committee on how to adopt legislations to attain these Sustainable Development Goals. As the Hon. Member who moved the Motion said, we must have a policy and we must have a plan. If we look at the portfolio of His Excellency the President, we can see that there is special emphasis on environmental protection. So, it is related to Sustainable Development Goals. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals we must have concern on our environment when implementing development activities. But we are not bothered about the environment when we implement our development activities and later on we suffer from their consequences such as landslides which is a threat to our environment.

The Hon. Prime Minister has now introduced a Sectoral Oversight Committee system to Parliament. Therefore, as Members of Parliament who represent these Sectoral Oversight Committees, we have an opportunity to discuss matters that come under various ministerial portfolios in Parliament itself and enhance the activities of each and every Ministry.

When you take the 17 goals which were determined by the UN Summit, you can see that these 17 goals come under17 ministerial portfolios of our country. For example, the subject of poverty alleviation goes to one Ministry and subject of environment goes to another Ministry. Likewise, every Ministry should take part in this process of reaping the benefits of Sustainable Development Goals to our country.

Therefore, what I am asking is, why can we not have a Standing Committee or an Oversight Committee or a Task Force especially to achieve these Sustainable Development Goals? Then, such a Committee would have the responsibility to implement what we are suggesting and it could see as to how these goals are going to be achieved by each and every Ministry in the next 15 years. So, we have a responsibility in this regard.

I put forwarded this suggestion to the Asian Parliamentary Assembly. Then we personally met the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan and we discussed how we can carry this forward. We can introduce this to all the

Parliaments who represent the Asian Parliamentary Assembly and then we can take part in this development process as a region and see as to how we can adopt this implementation process in order to achieve these Sustainable Development Goals in every country. That is one of our suggestions. So, it can be worked out in order to uplift and evaluate the implementation process of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [.. 6.56] ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Gamage) .

[.. 7.08] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development) I would like to say something. Some Members spoke about Sustainable Development Goals and how those could be mainstreamed for development. I am not going to comment on that only for the reason that I think we probably need a separate Adjournment Debate on Sustainable Development Goals itself and how to mainstream it.

There was a reference to Sectoral Oversight Committees and I think this is a very big positive departure from the past Parliaments to this Parliament. One of the functions of these Sectoral Oversight Committees is to ensure that policies - not just the policies of the Government but also Legislator views - are carried out because the present Committees, unlike the Committees in the past which were Consultative Committees, are chaired by backbenchers and that also is a big positive departure from the past. So, it has the oversight function but where it will eventually lead - maybe like in other countries' legislatures- that you will probably be able to propose legislation via the Committees to Parliament which is different to the practice that we have up to today where it is largely the Government that proposes legislation. So, I will not comment more on that.
