Hon. Member, this has been traditionally done before, but, for the first time, we have formalized it with due respect to all the religions. There was a request by the Ministry of Muslim Affairs, and on that, there were five consignments which were personally approved by the President, the Prime Minister and myself. We did not want to give anybody carte blanche to import these consignments on duty-free basis. So, we imposed the duty on to the Ministry of Muslim Affairs, which is transparent, knowing that this would be the case. Any other area which is of similar significance for any religion will certainly be looked at. All we want to say is, it is for the religious harmony that we did it, not with any other intention at all. Any imports coming in now will not be tolerated; it has to be during Ramazan Season, not now.

Thank you for raising this matter.

CONTROL OF PRICES OF ESSENTIAL FOOD ITEMS: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF INDUSTRY

AND COMMERCE ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Deputy Speaker, an issue has been raised recently with regard to the prices of consumer goods as the prices of essential commodities differ significantly

from one district to another. This happens due to transport cost incurred and the number of middlemen involved in the supply chain. However, now, the consumers are of the view that this happens due to increase in Value Added Tax -VAT. Therefore, these concerns should be addressed positively in order to maintain the cost of living in the country while ensuring delivery of quality goods at the lowest price to the end consumer. I must highlight the fact that the VAT component is applied only to certain commodities. It is not applied to essential food items such as white rice, sugar, dhal, onion, potatoes, red onion, milk powder, wheat flour, dried chillies, green gram, chickpeas, canned fish, sprats, chicken and pharmaceutical items. Specially, in Sathosa outlets, we are selling the abovementioned VAT-free essential food items. There is no VAT imposed even on vegetables and dried fish. It must be noted that the items on which VAT is not levied, the prices should be less. When the price of Thai sprats, which are identified as a good quality food item, are sold at Rs. 530.00 per kilo in Sathosa outlets all over the country, I saw it is sold in the range of Rs. 700 - 850 in the outside market. When it comes to remote areas, the price goes up to Rs. 900 due to intervention of middlemen. But, I must emphasize the fact that no VAT is imposed on essential food items. Therefore, the pricing formula which is implemented now by the Consumer Affairs Authority must be re-published and proper monitoring mechanism should be introduced district-wise. My Ministry will take immediate action to re-gazette the essential food items with the maximum price later in consultation with the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Cost of Living and the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance.

We will also strengthen the market-driven mechanism. Hereafter, action will also be taken to announce the maximum price of essential food items frequently through print and electronic media also. If these goods are sold above the maximum retail price, the consumer can lodge a complaint at the district offices of the Consumer Affairs Authority which we have established in each and every district. The Consumer Affairs Authority has now introduced a new facility where the consumers can lodge their complaints through the hotline 1977 throughout the day.

As announced in the course of the Budget Speech by the Hon. Minister of Finance and decided by the Cabinet this week, as well as the Special Cost of Living Committee chaired by the Hon. Prime Minister last week, the Government has decided to subsidize essential food items such as sugar, dhal, big onion, sprats, dried chillies, potatoes, canned fish, milk powder, fresh milk, gas, rice and some other food items which will be announced within the next two days.

This week we discussed strengthening the capacity of the Consumer Affairs Authority by employing additional

200 graduates. In addition to that the price control mechanism will be supervised at the district level. The District Secretaries will be in charge of it and our senior Ministers who are in charge of the District Development Committees are to chair the meetings every month at district level.

The other measure that we have taken to ensure controlled prices is by increasing the number of Sathosa outlets in the country. Currently, 319 Sathosa outlets are operating all over the country providing a significant support to the consumers. Also there are 2000 Co-operative outlets. The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane who is present here, supported to establish Co-op shops when he was the Minister of Co-operatives and Consumer Services. The Hon. Prime Minister instructed me to take necessary steps to make available all food items that we are going to Gazette as essential food items at all Sathosa outlets. We are going to sell all these food items at the same price in all 2000 Co-operative outlets and 319 Sathosa outlets. I think within one week or two weeks time we can start that mechanism. We will ensure the supply chain of essential food commodities to each and every corner of the country. Also, the Hon. Prime Minister, has advised to convene the Cabinet Subcommittee which is Chaired by the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, on very Tuesday and submit a weekly report on the cost of living along with its recommendations. Therefore, I firmly believe that this proposed mechanism will ensure the control of prices of the essential food items and accessibility of food items at affordable prices.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) It is a good sign to see that you are going to make those essential food items available at Sathosa.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) There are 319 Sathosa outlets all over the country plus 2000 Co-op shops. Through the Commissioner of Co-operative Development and Registrar of Co-operative Societies, we are going to supply those food items.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .. ? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Minister, now you are bringing it up to Rs. 500,000. Why do you not bring it up to Rs. 1 million because then, you can reduce a lot of litigation? It is a very good suggestion, but Rs. 500,000, Sir, in todays

context, with legal costs and all that, is nothing. So, if they can consider raising it to about Rs. 1 million, it will be of great value.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) I appreciate the view of the Hon. Minister. I also think that it is a reasonable suggestion, but what we thought was, if we increase that from Rs. 250,000 to Rs. 1 million straightaway, there may be some other repercussions. So, without making any confrontation, we thought of adopting this peaceful way of settling the issue. As the Hon. Minister said, certainly by looking at the progress of this Amendment, maybe within one year or in a very short time span, we may be able to consider your suggestion very seriously.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Everyday, they have to shuttle up and down more than 6,000 remand prisoners from Welikada.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) That is correct. Under the new relocation scheme, the Remand Prison will be situated at Hulftsdorp.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) That is good. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I fully agree that there is no reason why we should have a prison in the heart of the Colombo City for convicted prisoners. It is such a valuable land of about 65 acres. I do not know whether I am correct, but I think it is roughly about 65 acres.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) The extent of that land is 38 acres. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Okay. Thirty eight acres have been wasted on nothing for decades. In fact, I suggested to the Hon. Prime Minister also - when we take over six acres from the BCC land, there is a balance of six acres - to have a remand prison on the same land. Then, there is no question of transporting the prisoners from here to there, there would also not be any shootings in between and we can avoid so many conflicts.

As a result, they have sought some alternatives. What the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, suggested, I think, would be a very good option so that we will be able not only to avoid the congestion in the prison, but also to do the justice to the prisoners by doing that.

Sir, with that, I conclude my speech. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Sir, today, we are discussing laws coming under the Ministry of Justice. If the Hon. Member wants to sling mud or do something else, he can choose another forum or another way, but he is making use of his time and talking something completely irrelevant to the subject. Then, what is the purpose of having Standing Orders in this House?
