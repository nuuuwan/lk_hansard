- , . . We have so far not received any official report on this. . .. , " " .

We have not had any official report. But if the Hon. Member likes, you can sit down with the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indegenous Medicine and the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, Hon. D. M. Swaminathan and work out a scheme. I think, the Hon. Minister is more than ready to work with the Provincial Councils and if there are people, we could have them treated. We have hospitals in the Northern Province, including the Teaching Hospital in Jaffna. We can handle the situation and we can bring them out of Jaffna to Colombo, if further treatment is necessary. Since we have had no official reports, as the first step, Hon. Member, you could take the initiative with the Hon. Minister to go and look at the people who are suffering. Then the Hon. Minister will prepare a scheme where we can give treatment and the necessary certification to all of them. We do not rule it out. We have not got any official reports. That is all. But if there are people who are suffering, yes, we will take action. People were injured in the war; people were caught in the cross-fire of the war. So, we have to look after them once the war is over. ( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) , , ''

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The Hon. Member says that there have been a large number of students affected. First, you and the Hon. Minister can give us a report with the numbers that are affected, then we can take it up. I will speak to President Maithripala Sirisena and together with the Health Minister, we will prepare a programme. If we have to get any medical expertise from outside we will bring them in. If they have to be sent to Tamil Nadu we will do that as well. We will work out what the economic cost is. We will take up the responsibility. But first I suggest that the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, the Hon. Member concerned, other Hon. Members of the area and the Minister of Health would identify the numbers and let us know. Then we will have a discussion and finally I will refer this matter to the President. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.
