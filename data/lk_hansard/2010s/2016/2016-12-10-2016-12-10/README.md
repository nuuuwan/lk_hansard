Our Manifesto at 2015 Parliamentary Election states, I quote:

The principles and specific constitutional provisions that the TNA considers to be paramount to the resolution of the national question relate mainly to the sharing of the powers of governance through a shared sovereignty amongst the Peoples who inhabit this island. The following salient features of power sharing are fundamental to achieving genuine reconciliation, lasting peace and development for all the Peoples of Sri Lanka: The Tamils are a distinct People with their own culture, civilization, language and heritage and from time immemorial have inhabited this island together with the Sinhalese People and others.

The contiguous preponderantly Tamil Speaking Northern and Eastern provinces is the historical habitation of the Tamil People and the Tamil Speaking Peoples.

The Tamil people are entitled to the right to self-determination in keeping with United Nations International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which Sri Lanka has accepted and acceded to.

Power sharing arrangements must continue to be established as it existed earlier in a unit of a merged Northern and Eastern Provinces based on a Federal structure.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, with the extension of time, you have two more minutes. Do you want more time or do you wish to conclude in two minutes?

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Hon. Chairman, I will conclude in two minutes.

It further states, I quote:

The Tamil speaking Muslim historical inhabitants shall be entitled to be beneficiaries of all power-sharing arrangements in the North-East. This will no way inflict any disability on any People.

Devolution of power on the basis of shared sovereignty shall be over land, law and order, enforcement of the law so as to ensure the safety and security of the Tamil People, socio-economic development including inter-alia health, education, higher and vocational education, agriculture, fisheries, industries, livestock development, cultural affairs, mustering of resources, both domestic and foreign and fiscal powers.

Hon. Chairman, I assure this House that we, the TNA, on behalf of our people who gave a mandate to us, are committed to work together with the National Government and other leadership to find a political solution within a united Sri Lanka. That process has now started and we are already committed to work together.

Therefore, I ask the Hon. Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance to consult us when determining how much of funds are needed to the war-torn areas; what are the projects that we need to implement and on what areas that we need to work together for development. I therefore, request the Prime Minister and the Hon. Minister of Finance to fix a date for this matter after submission of the Budget where you are announcing allocations within the budgetary allocation. Discuss with us and we will work together. That is what I am requesting the Hon. Minister of Finance.

We will fix early dates to discuss with you, because we are not in the Cabinet. Our goal is not to be in the Cabinet. That is not our target. We have to solve our problems and we will think about it later. Therefore, the TNA Members of Parliament and the members of Provincial Councils, are all prepared to discuss this matter with the Government. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance assured us to come for a decision to

3843 3844

implement such development programmes in Tamil-speaking areas, particularly, in the war-torn areas in the North and the East.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Chairman, certainly I would say to the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah that we are very willing at any given time to meet them. He just mentioned two matters which I will refer to, because it is related to my Ministry. Last year, we allocated Rs. 23 billion to Jaffna, but only Rs. 1.2 billion was spent. This year even we have allocated the same amount. Capacity is the problem in Jaffna and in the entire Northern Province. The entire country gets even distribution. The Northern and the Eastern Provinces do sometimes get special treatment owing to lack of development that took place during the past thirty years.

So, I would appreciate if you can bring up any matter that is concerning your area, because there are a lot of unspent funds. That is why I urge your Provincial Councils and your Members also to get it moving.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you, Hon. Minister. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Thank you, Hon. Minister. Actually, we are concerned as to why they failed to spend the money totally. But our request is different. Our request is before you prepare the Budget, we should be consulted; because it is a war-torn area. There has to be special arrangements and allocations for the North and the East. Efficiency of implementation is another matter. That is true. We admit and agree with you. But, when the Northern Province and the Eastern Province is concerned, particularly the Northern Province should be allocated sufficient amount of money on the basis of the programmes and the requirement. What I am claiming is to sit down and discuss with us about the failures in the implementation of development programmes and about future arrangements for our area.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Chairman, I would say with all responsibility to Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah that we did so this year as well as last year. We spoke to the Hon. Sumanthiran on three occasions. You all had a meeting in Jaffna and I guess unfortunately you were unable to attend. We got your four pages of items - the "wish list" - and we have incorporated almost 99 per cent of that. So, this was done in consultation with you. I do not think that anything has

been put in without consultation. The mandate given by my Prime Minister is, "please do consult, not only the MPs of the North and East, but every MP". Definitely, the Northern Province got what is needed and the Hon. Sumanthiran spoke about it.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. You have nine minutes.

[10.11 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Chairman, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah raised the issue of sharing of financial powers of the Central Government with the Provincial Councils. I think this is a very important topic. At the outset, I must thank the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, our Minister of Finance, for having done a wonderful job in presenting a Budget at a time when we have to service a very large amount of external loans that have been obtained by the previous regime and for taking bold attempts to reform our income sector, particularly, by raising revenue by various means without burdening the public too much. So, it is a very difficult trapeze act that the Hon. Minister of Finance has performed.

I must also acknowledge the fact that not only did the Minister give enough room for the Opposition Members who are cooperating with us to consider allocations to their areas, he also did give the same space to us Colleagues in the Cabinet to discuss the Estimates of our Ministries far ahead of the preparation of the Budget. Even almost at the very eve of presenting the Budget, he was willing to accommodate some of our suggestions, and I must thank him for that.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that with almost more than 150 years of centralized rule, ever since the British colonial times, the tendency by the Centre to part with power is not very satisfactory. You cannot blame the Minister alone. Even the bureaucrats have to be blamed. We realized this even in the Cabinet when certain objections were raised, particularly when the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government was wanting to retain some of the allocations to himself whereas those moneys should have gone directly to the provincial councils. But, it was not observed in the past. The Hon. Minister of Finance will realize this. In fact the President, the Prime Minister, everybody had to intervene in order to resolve the issue of the Central Government Minister,

3845 3846

[ . ]

2016 10

who controls the provincial councils and local government authorities, trying to interfere in retaining the funds and insisting that the Accounting Officer should remain the Secretary to the Ministry rather than the provincial authorities. This issue has been discussed in the past and the Hon. Minister of Finance along with the President had to sit with the Chief Ministers to resolve this issue. Therefore, I think we need to look at this matter in depth. We also have the Finance Commission. The Finance Commission has its own criteria-based funding, and they too take into consideration the development of the province, the level of development and poverty indicators and various other factors and then start distributing the funds.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Our request is that the Finance Commission should address the North and the East as a different category. The devastated and war-tone area should be allocated the required amount of money under a separate arrangement.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That has been discussed. Even the Chief Ministers who represent this Government at the provincial level have brought it to the notice of His Excellency the President, and the Ministry of Finance has addressed that issue; but still the problems remain.

The other issue is the attitude of the Governors. The Governors still retain financial powers. The Hon. Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management is sitting by my side. He had been a former Chief Minister. He knows the attitude of the Governors. Even then, what is strange is the attitude of the Governors in the North and the East is diametrically opposed to the attitude of the Governors in the rest of the country. This is also a phenomenon that we have seen in the past. If I am to say, this is quiet -[Interruption.]

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) We all are trying to find a political solution on the devolution of power. The present Budget is more centralized. That is what I am asking for a more practical arrangement.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Member, I am possessed of what you are trying to say.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have three more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) During the former regime there has been this practice - not only the former regime, earlier regimes had always been following the practice of employing military men as Governors; either from the army, navy or from the air force. This had been the practice in the past. We have done away with that. Now, we have put in civilian Governors. Of course, civilian Governors have come into being. But, even with the civilian Governors in the North and the East, there seems to be some difference in their attitude when you compare them with the Governors of the rest of the country. This is something that we all realize because both the TNA and ourselves are administering the two provinces.

The SLMC is administering the East along with the support of the TNA and other parties as well and the TNA is having the Chief Ministership in the Northern Province. Our experience with our own Governors is not the same as the experience of the Chief Ministers of the rest of the country. This is a matter that we must try and resolve in our Constitutional reform process, because this is an attitudinal problem and perhaps it has got to do something with the fact that these are minority-dominated areas. Let me not delve on those political issues but let me -

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, let me very quickly touch on an issue which concerns the Hon. Minister of Finance. Of course, I have several matters to discuss about. Let me thank him for having provided some allocations at my request for the development of the Kalmunai-Samanthurai Township Programme as well as to have the Heda-Oya Irrigation Reservoir cum Water Supply Project. That has been mentioned in the Budget Speech. Hopefully, we will be able to persuade the External Resources Department to try and source out some funding from external sources to implement these projects.

In the meantime, we are also eagerly waiting to commission the Jaffna Water Supply Project by desalination programmes funded by the ADB. Already, we are getting ready to call for the EOI and thereafter the RFP to be issued in order to get the Jaffna Water Supply Project off the ground. But that will only be a temporary solution. The final solution has to be from the Iranamadu Tank. We have to have a surface water solution. This is something we must bear in mind.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, I do not want to be unkind, but please wind up.

3847 3848

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Finally, let me very quickly refer to one other matter. Because of the natural disasters last year, I know our Budget projections did face a lot of problems. In fact, you have introduced an insurance scheme. What I am trying to say is, from Hanwella, Colombo, Kolonnawa and Kaduwela areas we have identified almost 1,500 industries - large, medium and small-scale industries. They are spread all over the Kelani Valley downstream areas and there was an insurance scheme that was implemented. Several industries are yet to source the funding. Several of the livelihoods have been affected. I hope the Hon. Minister will summon a special meeting, because it is his own district and all these industrialists are adding value to our economy. They are exporting. They are also supplying goods within the country and they need very much support.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I hope there would be some quick assessment of what is happening to the insurance claims submitted by them. With those comments, let me congratulate the Hon. Minister for having presented the Budget under very difficult and adverse circumstances.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I would like to address my Colleague, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. We will be able to implement every single project that has been mentioned in the Budget without any problem. We have not uttered a single statement without having the backup of money. So, I can say that they will be fully utilized.

Also, on the issue of insurance claims, I would beg to differ. The only problem is, from the Government institutions down from the Pradeshiya Lekam level, there are 34,000 claims that have got to come for natural disasters. There is Rs. 3.5 billion yet to be settled because they have not brought forward the claims. I would urge the politicians and the officials from every area where claims have got to come, to get together and give them as soon as possible. We are committed. The total amount of funds we got for natural disasters was Rs.7 billion and another Rs.3 billion has got to come.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. Next, Hon.Bandula Gunawardane.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) . . ,- Why you need to bring in the e-procurement is, it will provide information on tenders, plans and circulars. It brings the transaction costs, costs of travel, private costs as well as public costs down. It also increases competition in the market and that is why you need it. So, we have a Commission. But the Commission alone cannot do this. We need to create an agency for the whole Government under the Commission with a common platform. Then only this will really work. South Korea streamlined this and the saving was US Dollars 1.4 billion from 2001 to 2015. From tender notice to the award, we can have one system. The number of contracts will increase. Small and medium businesses can come into this.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) , .

This is a nationally important thing. One hundred and sixty countries have agreed on the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. Sri Lanka is also a signatory to this. Whenever a proposal is brought in, I know that there is opposition; but the Opposition should be constructive in its criticism.

Even for vacancies in the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank, we are now asking people to apply across the electronic medium, because we want to reduce human intervention.

Hon. Members of the Opposition, in your term there was so much of corruption. At least, now let us get together rather than point fingers at each other to reduce

3905 3906

this in the national interest. We both have a responsibility to work for the citizens of this country. Therefore, let us look at this constructively.

Thank you again for giving me this opportunity.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, Hon. E.Saravanapavan. [1.53p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Presiding Member, what I observed and appreciate is that the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana and the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa are much concerned about the civilians. I am disappointed and wish to point out that the same thing happened in the North and the East when they were ruling. There was not only one incident, but several incidents involving civilians. But, what did they do? Did they or anybody raise their voices at that time on behalf of the civilians? -[Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) Prabhakaran was there. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Anyway, I appreciate that you are concerned about the civilians.

( ) (An Hon. Member) At that time, Prabhakaran was there. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) No, even places which were not under their control were attacked. - [Interruption.]

Anyway, now let me start my speech on the Vote of the Ministry of Finance. What I find is that the financial allocations are not devolution-friendly. Everybody can read these and I will explain. I would like to take up only one matter of utmost importance and which is critical at this juncture in the history of devolution of this country.

I am very glad that His Excellency the President, on the 07th of this week, vehemently reiterated in Parliament his determination to deal with the causes that led to the ethnic conflict and the bloody war, which devastated the life of our people. His noble vision will be realized only if the different arms of the State machinery cooperate sincerely with this cause. The Ministry of Finance which supplies the real lifeblood to the Governments programmes has never been sincere towards strengthening the structure of devolution. The financial allocations were not what was expected. The financial policies were unsupportive of the devolution process in the past and even at this moment, the old trend persists. In the next year's Budget too, there are no signs of change in

the allocation of financial resources towards strengthening the devolution process, leading to reasonable alleviation of grievances of our people.

The Ministry of Finance consistently maintained a ratio, whereby only a minimum of Governments total Budget was allocated to the second and third tiers of the governance structure, which weakens them and prevents them from moving forward towards better governance. In the Budget for 2017, out of the total Capital Expenditure of the Government, only 3.5 per cent is allocated to the second and third tiers of the governance structure, namely to the provincial councils and the local governments. Similarly, only about 8 per cent of the total Recurrent Expenditure of the Government has been allocated to this devolved structure of governance. On the whole, only about 6.4 per cent of the total Government Budget is allocated to the provincial councils and local governments. Various strategies are adopted to keep the provincial councils a weak structure, scuttling the purpose of devolution.

I was trying to find out which Ministries will be handling the railway line extension project up to Ponnalai and the vertical building project for Jaffna announced by the Hon. Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech. After a long search in the Volumes of Budget Estimates, I could not find such details and I am not even sure if the Hon. Minister of Finance was serious about those projects. I do not know who is hoodwinked by whom? There are also a number of strategies institutionalized in the budgeting procedure which deprived the war-affected regions, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The constitutional responsibility, authority and the role of the Finance Commission are simply belittled and undermined by the Ministry of Finance.

If you carefully analyze the past history of financial allocations, there had been a deliberate, manipulative practice which created the regional disparities. This has embarrassed the present Government, forcing it to declare its efforts to bring back the socio-economic conditions of the war-affected regions on par with that of the rest of the country by 2020. But, it is a dismal vision without a concerted effort to provide resources and powers to these regions and improve capacities.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, the Hon. Member was not here in the morning. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake clearly stated that the North has spent only 30 per cent of the monies allocated last year. You all have not spent it. -[Interruption.] If you were here in the morning and listened to the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, he explained that you all have spent only 30 per cent of the monies allocated last year. You should have been here in the morning.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) No. You must find out from the Director-General, Department of National Budget when the money was

3925 3926

2016 10

released. Even last month, we were asked to propose a project. But, with the zero budget, we could not do anything. So, it was postponed to next year.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, the Provincial Council has been dragging its feet. That is the main problem.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) My time is limited. So, I want to go ahead with my speech.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to demand from the Hon. Minister of Finance to declare very clearly on the Floor as to what percentage of Governments total Budget will be provided in the future, during the rest of the period of this Government of good governance, for the second and third tiers of the governance structure.

We, as a war-affected community, are continuously languishing below the threshold levels in all aspects of life and need to be informed of what is going to be done for us in order for us to develop some faith and confidence in the Governments vision and mission.

Also, the Hon. Minister of Finance has pointed out in his Budget Speech that 100,000 persons in the tourism industry, 60,000 in the textile industry and 400,000 in the construction industry are to be trained. So, it is a very good proposal. And also, he has proposed to give scholarships to the state sector training institutes. So, I want to bring to your knowledge that there are no state sector training institutes in the North and the East, if you want to implement it in a large scale, except for the Sri Lanka-German Training Institute in Kilinochchi, which has been set up very recently. So, what I am saying is that it is a good proposal because then, they can be self-employed or find other employment. Therefore, that matter has to be considered.

In his own party, there were two people who were sentenced to death day before yesterday. It was published only in the local newspapers and more murders will come up very soon. We are working with the Government in order to achieve political rights. Therefore, no one should take it for granted that we are part of the Government. You must understand that.

The inequality is growing. That is the biggest problem. You accept that; I accept that. How do you reduce this inequality? It cannot be done by a Budget of this nature where you impose heavy burdens on the masses; on peasantry; on the workers; on the middle class and on the pensioners. No. You have imposed heavy burdens like in other countries where welfare has been assured.

, . . I would like to quote an interesting article written by Prof. Siri Hettige of the University of Colombo, which appeared in the Daily Mirror newspaper dated 26th September, 2016. There he clearly states:

Taxation is a key public policy instrument that modern democratic States use to reduce social inequality and ensure equality of opportunity in diverse spheres such as food consumption, education, health and social protection.

Also, I would like to table* the two tables which appeared in this article to be included in Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I would like to conclude my speech with this, because the Hon. Minister of Finance may like to be a bull in a China shop, as I mentioned earlier.

I would like to quote from Gandhiji, the Father of India. He addressed the Ministers in this manner. I quote:

"Today, you have worn on your heads a crown of thorns. The seat of power is a nasty thing. You have to remain ever wakeful on that seat. You have to be more truthful, more non-violent, more humble and more forbearing. You had been put to test during the British regime. But in a way it was no test at all."

The most interesting part is, I quote:

"But now there will be no end to your being tested. Do not fall a prey to the lure of wealth. May God help you! You are there to serve the villages and the poor."

This is what Gandhiji said.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon.M.A.Sumanthiran.

[4.51 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to speak at the concluding stages of the Committee Stage Discussion. One could hear the words ", "" continuously in the Chamber.

( ) (An Hon. Member) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There, I can hear it again being traded from one side to the other fairly liberally. I will address that issue in a moment. But, let me begin with something that I want to mention in this House in my capacity as the Chair of the Committee on Public Finance. During the course of the Budget Debate, our Committee was supposed to tender two Reports to Parliament. We presented one Report.

In that Report, we raised a very serious issue - that the Estimates that were placed on our table on the day the Budget was presented contains figures that are not accurate; figures that the officials themselves knew to be not accurate, because during the course of the Committee deliberations, they admitted so and gave us another set of figures stating that it was on the second set of figures that the Minister actually made his Budget presentation. In that Report, we recommended that the figures of 12th November, which were said to be the actual figures, be distributed to all Hon. Members at least during the Committee Stage, and I regret that it has not been done. We all are looking at the Estimates in those red books, which the officials of the Ministry of Finance themselves have told us are not accurate.

The second Report we were supposed to present to this House was our comments on whether the Government Estimates actually reflect the Government

4001 4002

2016 10

policy, whether money is well laid out in accordance with Government policy. We have tried to ascertain the Government policy and that is not easily forthcoming because as in the last year, this year too, the Hon. Prime Minister made a Statement prior to the Budget and then, the Hon. Minister of Finance made his Budget Speech, and one is still left wondering, which is the Government policy. We have sought this information. We have asked officials and the Ministers, the Prime Minister included, to provide to the Committee a proper statement of Government policy so that we can examine the Estimates and comment on them for the House as to whether the money has been well laid out in accordance with the Government policy. Unfortunately, we have not been able to do that during the course of the Budget Debate, but we will strive our best to do it early next year.

With regard to corruption, it is very interesting that from the time I entered this House in 2010, allegations have been made against the Government, sometimes, against particular Ministers. Certain words are used for certain Ministers and one is then supposed to deduce what that means. Today too, we heard different words being used for different Ministers. In the last Parliament also we saw that. Now, some of that is coming out. I would like to say - I am not saying this in any patronizing way - that those words are being used because there is knowledge in the country as to what the Ministers are up to. Most of the corruption that the Ministers are involved in is no secret in this country. That is why those words are used. A Government that has been in office for just two years will do well to take heed of this and correct their ways. It is no use defending the Government by asking the Opposition, "What did you do when you were in the Government?" That is not the answer. Constantly, when the Hon. Members of this side were on that side also, the same thing was done and it is being repeated. What is most strange is that some who were Ministers in the last Government continue to be Ministers in this Government too, and those are the Ministers who remain quiet when these allegations are traded, because they are always at the receiving end of the allegations. As soon as the Government changed, we started hearing stories. I am going to use some words now, which might ring bells. We started hearing about the areca nut transactions of a Minister who was in the previous Government and continues in this Government too. Like that, there are so many words that are being used. I will not go through the whole list.

But, this is a Government that we also helped come into office and I think we also have some right to expect better performance by this Government. It is well-known, and it is conceded even by the "Joint Opposition", as they call themselves, that the President and the Prime Minister who head this Government, both are well above any of these allegations. I have not heard any allegations being levelled against either of them personally.

( ) (An Hon. Member) How about the COPE Report?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But that is not good enough. The two leaders must ensure that their Ministers - leave alone the public officials, but their Ministers - are also above reproach. Sadly, that does not seem to be the case. If this continues, this Government will not last. You must understand that the former Government, who now shouts hoarse also came down because of corruption - mostly because of corruption. It is unfortunate that many of you do not seem to learn those lessons, but are still continuing those very ways.

I will cite one thing - an allegation I made a few days ago in this House with regard to the 65,000 houses. On that day, I asked the Minister concerned to deny if possible that one Ravi Wettasinghe is the local agent of ArcelorMittal. I asked him to deny if possible that it was Ravi Wettasinghe who was the local agent. He did not deny it. Now, I take it therefore, that it is Ravi Wettasinghe who is the local agent of ArcelorMittal. He is a notorious figure in this country. He figures in the book called, Thatcher's Fortunes: The Life and Times of Mark Thatcher." I am glad that the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene is here. In 2002 he got into a brawl outside a nightclub when you were present and it is reported how this happened and what kind of person he is. This is how it is reported:

"Ravi Wettasinghe, known to contribute towards political campaigns in millions, was the local agent for a British bus consortium comprising three bus companies, Ibis, Transbus and Mayflower. In 1993, Mr. Ravi Wettasinghe bought the Government-owned Werehera Bus factory for Rs. 25 million, but ran into problems and eventually left the country forcing the Government to pay Rs. 460 million in salaries for the workers."

- I mentioned this last time -

"While he was away, he had reportedly contributed.."

- now this will hit both sides -

"..Rs. 7 million to the PA during an election campaign while also contributing towards the UNP election campaigns."

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) How much? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That amount is not given here. Now this is the man who is the local agent of ArcelorMittal, who wants to build those steel, pre-fabricated houses. He is the man who funds both sides.

Yesterday was the International Anti-corruption Day and His Excellency the President, while making a speech, responsibly stated publicly that even today more than 50

4003 4004

per cent of the tenders that are granted by his own Government is riddled with fraud. Your own President said that, publicly. I was in the same forum. I told him, It is not 50 per cent, it is more than 90 per cent. He did not dispute me.

So, why is this happening? I think if you have come together as a National Government to take the country forward, to make a new beginning for this country, you have to rid yourselves of corruption. Without that, this country will not go forward. The Hon. Minister of Finance is listening attentively, I am happy. I hope you will take all the necessary steps and that it will not be necessary hereafter for anyone to be shouting at your Colleagues and yourself calling you all, Horu.

There is one more thing. This morning, when we convened as the Constitutional Assembly, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, referred to xenophobia that is enveloping this country and this is a very serious issue. On the last day of this year as we sit, I want to make certain mention of some of the trends that are happening. All of us know what is happening and are either unwilling or unable to arrest this particular trend. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena mentioned a Resolution that was allegedly passed by the Northern Provincial Council. The Hon. Minister of Justice too mentioned this a few days ago in this House and I want to correct both of them. There was no Resolution passed by the Northern Provincial Council saying that no Buddhist temples can be built in the Northern Province; that is false and malicious. The only Resolution they have passed is to say that no unauthorized structures of any religious institution, be it Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim or Christian, should be built. That is all that the Resolution says and I think you need to be careful before you make such inflammatory remarks in this House. You must ensure-

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We cannot worship a Bo tree according to you.-[Interruption.]

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe - Minister of Justice and Minister of Buddhasasana) Sir, it was in the banner headlines in almost all the newspapers in this country and was telecast in all the television channels, but there was no single denial either by the Chief Minister or any Member of the Northern Provincial Council. Then, am I responsible or are they responsible, if it is a false?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What the Chief Minister has said is in the newspapers today. He has referred to the Hon. Minister of Justice as a

good friend and somebody who knows him and he has said, The Hon. Minister could have called and asked me. You know what the media does in this country; you know how involved the media also is in fanning these flames. So, one needs to be careful -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If the Chief Minister has issued a disclaimer, it could have been published in the media.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What I am saying is -[Interruption.] No, no. The media constantly does it. If we are to issue disclaimers and denials, everyday we will have to do that. So, all that I am saying is, please ensure before you -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) In any case, there is no unauthorized - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Anyway, I have now clarified. Take my word for it. So, do not make these inflammatory remarks again.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Both of you are not in agreement. -[Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no. We are fully in agreement. We belong to the same Party. We are in agreement and I defend that Resolution that was passed by the Northern Provincial Council. I do not think that in any part of the country, any unauthorized structure should be put up, whether it is Buddhist, Christian, Hindu or Muslim. Everybody must comply with the law and if -[Interruption.] Well, that is so. -[Interruption.] I am talking about structures.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You cannot worship any Bo tree. -[Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. I am not saying you cannot worship. -[Interruption.] You tried to do this, this morning also. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You cannot lay a Buddha statue in front -[Interruption.]

4005 4006

[ .. ]

2016 10

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am talking about the construction of temples and places of worship.

Sir, with regard to Buddhism also, one has to be very careful that you do not misrepresent to the country what we say. We respect Buddhism. We think the majority of this country who are Buddhists must have their due place in the country; we do not dispute that. As we strive to draw up a new Constitution, this issue of the foremost place to Buddhism has again hit the headlines. One needs to be very, very careful unless, of course, you deliberately want to cause mischief and mayhem in the country. One must be restrained in what you say. We are striving to do that and that is why we continuously keep saying we have no objection to some important, special place be given to Buddhism. I am prepared to say that even despite the fact that most - not most, but all - of my constituents are not Buddhists, we will do that. -[Interruption.]

Sir, equality before the law for all the people of this country is also a principle, I think, all of us agree with. That also must be ensured. A special place for certain historic or certain other reasons does not mean and cannot mean that others come second. All citizens of this country are equal and that must be very clearly understood and laid down. So, as we strive to do this - allay the fears of the majority - at the same time, the people who are small in numbers in this country must also be assured that although their numbers are little, that they do have a place; that they are not second-class citizens. That must be assured. -[Interruption.] Please do not disturb me.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) You have only four more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay. Therefore, in this difficult journey that we have undertaken to draft a new Constitution, we must act together. The fact that all Parties represented in Parliament constitute the Constitutional Assembly and are represented in the Steering Committee, is a good thing. This is a historic feat. The fact that the Steering Committee has met more than 40 times - I think 46 times or something like that - and been able to deliberate matters itself, is a very positive thing. So, we need to be careful, as we go forward, that we do not lose this opportunity.

I am told that when we talk about the new Constitution, various persons are getting worried about a referendum. Now, we have very clearly said and I want to repeat what my Leader has said in this House and in the Constitutional Assembly. He said, "We want a new Constitution that all the people of this country approve of, that definitely must include or should include the majority people of this country. A Constitution will not stay as a Constitution of the country if the majority of the people

do not accept it." So, we are not trying to do something that the majority people of this country do not want. But at the same time, we have the confidence that the majority people of this country are also reasonable people, are also people who will adhere to basic human values of equality, of equal citizenship. That message must be taken to the majority people of this country. I am rather disappointed that Members who represent the majority community are fearful about going to their people and telling them this is a right thing to do. If they fear and they keep saying, We will lose a referendum- you will lose a referendum only because of corruption and nothing else; not because of the contents in the Constitution. So, put your house right with regard to even perceptions of corruptions, be transparent, go before the people, and convince your people that you are in fact involved in good governance. Please tell your people that this is the right thing for us to do if we are to go into the future with all the people who are smaller in numbers also agreeing that this is our country; we are no longer second-class; we have equal stake, and that is necessary to forge the unity of this country. So, my final words as I wind down is, let us see a prosperous and a new era for Sri Lanka in 2017 with a basic social contract, which is the Constitution, ensuring that as we go forward.

Thank you.

Hon. Chairman, I would appreciate if you ensure that this document is included in Hansard in full. *

As I have mentioned, this document is regarding investment incentives - simplification of the tax system; setting-up of headquarters of international agencies; investment incentives for lagging regions; high impact investment; landmark investment; incentives for exporters; solid waste management/organic fertilizer; sugar industry; reduce the time bar period for appeals and assessments and restructuring of capital allowance. All are being given to the incentivisation of exports out of Sri Lanka.

Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena did mention that the attempt is to give these investment incentives only to the top end of the business stature in this country. He only falsifies a true statement.

Sir, Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah mentioned this morning about the lack of funds. I would aptly say that once again there is Rs. 23,000 million allocated, but capacity has not been there for the utilization of that, especially in the Northern area. So, please do not in any way infer that the Central Government does not provide funds. We have been very generous not only to the Northern Province but also to the Eastern Province and all other provinces. An equal distribution of funds is the intention of our Budget because that is the core thinking of our Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister. As a Government, we have been doing as much as possible. However, we are prone to be fallible and therefore you are free to tell us any particular area that has been overlooked.

This is in reply to what Hon. Sumanthiran mentioned. Hon. Member, please be assured that certain corrupt incidents that happened before will not happen in the future. I give that assurance on behalf of the Government, His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister. It is not just a reduction in corruption but it is an eradication of corruption that we are aiming at. That is what our Government is continuing to do and I want the fullest cooperation. Do not speculate. Mention the names of the people who are corrupt and we will bring the crooks out. Whether those are within us or had been there before us and are now shielding behind us is the question that we need to address at this moment.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The bond issue - () (, ) ( ( ) - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne - Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine) We are going into it. Do not worry. It is not like those days.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are the only Government that is allowing questioning and checking from the COPE, the Supreme Court and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. We will certainly allow it. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This entire Discussion has been on the premise of the bond issue. We will look into it; clear all doubts that are there and prove that all speculation has been fictitious as mentioned before.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Nothing has happened. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, how many more minutes do you want? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, another 10 to 12 minutes.

Sir, I cannot explain to a person with a childish mentality. When a company is faced with a natural disaster and cannot basically produce in the country, they have to import it. At the point of import we slash the manufacturing charge. What else do you want to charge? Do you want to see that production is not going on? -[Interruption.] , . . . , . . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, may I say a few words. We have had a long and an arduous Session during the Budget Debate. I wish to thank you, Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Chairman of Committees and the Hon. Members who presided over the Sittings during the course of the Debate, and for all the assistance and the kindness you have shown to all the Hon. Members in the course of the Debate. Also, I wish to thank the Leader of the House and the office of the Leader of the House, the Chief Government Whip and the office of the Chief Government Whip, the office of the Leader of the Opposition, my secretary in particular, and the Chief Opposition Whip and his staff for all the assistance they have rendered. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General of Parliament, the Deputy Secretary-General, the Assistant Secretaries-General and the staff of Parliament for the long hours of work they have been compelled to put in to successfully perform the duty of having this Debate conducted in a very acceptable way. I wish to thank the media for the coverage they have given to the Proceedings of Parliament. I wish to thank all security personnel who have been functioning in Parliament during the course of this Debate.

As we come to the closure of the year Sir, we are moving into the year 2017, which we all hope would be a very eventful year for this country; which will put this country on a different path going into a different future - a very prosperous and successful future for all the citizens of our country.

Sometimes we have had difficulties in the course of the Budget Debate particularly, in the matter of allocation

of time with many Hon. Members wanting to speak, but we have been able to resolve such disputes with a lot of cordiality and in a manner acceptable to all the Hon. Members of this House. I think that is the spirit in which we should function. Our Hon. Members very actively participated in the Debate, particularly, the young Members.

All in all, Mr. Speaker, we have had a very successful Budget Session.

Thank you. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) , , , . , , , , . .
