GSP . GSP . . GSP . ? . . . , . . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . . [6.04p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Hon. Presiding Member, before I start my speech in my mother tongue Tamil, I wish to state a few things in English, because our Hon. Minister as well as the Hon. Deputy Minister have carefully been listening to all the speeches today. It is very much appreciated. Firstly, I thank you very much for being present here.

Actually, the National Minimum Wage of Workers Bill is to provide for the payment of National Minimum Wage by employers to workers and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Hon. Member, I suppose that this matter with regard to the payment of national minimum wage will be taken up for discussion either on 23rd or 24th.

( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) I understand that. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Today we are discussing another matter where we are seeking to increase the allowances of the members of the Wages Board. So, if you can speak on that, it is very much appreciated. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Thank you very much. I will not speak on the other matter. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) You will have adequate time to discuss that. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Of course, I am coming to another point. The Hon. Vijitha Herath, Member from the JVP, also mentioned this. The last line of Clause 14, "Interpretation," of this Bill, states, I quote:

.... not include a domestic servant.

Sir, what I want to mention here is, - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) That is not an Amendment. ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Yes, that is not an Amendment.

Hon. Presiding Member, what I actually want to mention here is that we can get some examples from India with regard to domestic help. According to "The Times of India," enforcing labour reforms in the unorganized sector, the Rajasthan Government has fixed minimum wages for domestic help and set limits to their working hours recently. Why I am saying this here is because we have been trying to implement this Act from the 1st of January, 2016. - [Interruption.] As I said, according to The Times of India, during the same period, India has fixed Indian Rs. 5,642 per month for eight hours of work as the minimum wage for domestic help and workers to be paid double the minimum fixed wage per hour for overtime. This is the example that we can get from India for this type of a Bill, once it is brought to Parliament.

That is why I mentioned this. We can discuss other things also in this House.
