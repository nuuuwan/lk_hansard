NINETEENTH SAARC SUMMIT SCHEDULED TO

BE HELD IN ISLAMABAD: STATEMENT BY

MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to make a statement on the 19th SAARC Summit that was to be held in Islamabad on the 9th and 10th of November this year, and matters in connection with regional cooperation in South Asia.

Hon. Speaker, as this House is aware, Sri Lanka is a founder member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, commonly known as SAARC. Sri Lanka was in fact among the earliest countries in the region to support the concept of regional cooperation when it was first discussed. Therefore, when SAARC was conceptualized, we were naturally among the original signatories to the Charter of SAARC on the 8th of December, 1985.

Successive Government in Sri Lanka, throughout SAARCs history of over three decades, since 1985, have remained faithful to regional cooperation through SAARC. I recall the words of President J.R. Jayewardene at the first Summit in Dhaka on the 7th of December in 1985 where he said, I quote:

We approach our task with hope and with optimism, for we believe that as the full potential of our venture comes to be realized, its benefits will be incalculable to the welfare of our several peoples and countries.

Manifesting our firm commitment to regional cooperation, Sri Lanka assumed the responsibility of chairing SAARC and providing leadership to the Organization on three occasions. Sri Lanka was host to SAARC Summits in 1981, 1998 and in 2008. We have always been active participants in SAARC, contributing to the realization of objectives envisioned in the Charter which states, ... to promote the welfare of the peoples of South Asia and to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region.

We can, I believe Mr. Speaker, be modestly proud that Sri Lanka has taken all the steps that could possibly be taken to work with countries in the region, since SAARCs inception, to explore ways and means of making SAARC improve the lives of people and making SAARC relevant to people so that they realize the value of working together, of cooperating with each other, and they see regional cooperation as an essential means to ensure the betterment of their lives.

From promoting greater economic liberalization and cooperation to improved physical connectivity and trade; enhancing people-to-people contact, cultural cooperation, facilitating deeper understanding of each others traditions, practices, literature, cultures; and promoting the "SAARC brand"; technical cooperation in all areas including governance, security, agriculture, and a host of other fields, Sri Lanka has supported and promoted every conceivable aspect of "working together" in the region.

Sri Lanka also promoted the concept of exploring possibilities of working together to address global issues such as energy security, food security and climate change that impact on the development strategies of all the countries in our region. We supported SAARC, as the ideal platform for our leaders to meet and discuss to take common positions on issues that affect us collectively as a region and seek practical and pragmatic solutions.

Sri Lankas united vision, irrespective of political party affiliations within our country, I believe, is for an inclusive, plural and rapidly developing region that benefits all the people of South Asia; a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation that is an efficient and effective mechanism that makes a positive impact on the people of the region, translating the vision of the Charter into reality; a South Asia of peace, friendship and prosperity, where its borders will see the free flow of people, goods and ideas without fear which is truly a region of prosperity.

Mr. Speaker, addressing the 1st SAARC Summit in 1985, President J.R. Jayewardene also said this: I quote:

The greater we understand each other, easier becomes the realization of our goals. There can be no successful regional cooperation without mutual confidence, without mutual trust.

It cannot be denied, Sir, that peace and security is a primary requirement for the fulfillment of our vision of prosperity and meaningful cooperation in the region. It also cannot be denied that regional cooperation can never reach its optimum potential as long as intractable bilateral issues prevail.

Terrorism, as we all know, is an issue that must unite our region, not divide our region. It is a menace that has taken a heavy toll on the economic and social fabric of almost all our countries. Terrorism poses an existential threat to the civilized world and it must be defeated. Sri Lanka has always been firm in denouncing terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, irrespective of where it occurs, and Sri Lanka supports decisive action in dealing with terrorism.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please!

I wish to announce that this House cordially welcomes Her Excellency (Mrs.) Christa Markwalder, Speaker of the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland and the Secretary General, Mr. Philippe

533 534

Schwab of the Switzerland Parliament now present at the Speaker's Gallery accompanied by His Excellency the Ambassador for Switzerland.

Hon. Minister, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) It is indeed a great pleasure to welcome the Hon. Speaker of Switzerland.

In the region, as you know, we have in place instruments such as the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, the 2004 Additional Protocol on Terrorism and the SAARC Ministerial Declaration of 28th February, 2009 on Cooperation in Combating Terrorism. Translation of such instruments and declarations into implementation, therefore, is essential.

Sir, it is time that our region unite in its resolve to eliminate this scourge. All the leaders of South Asia, I firmly believe, must unite and take a firm stand and decisive action to eliminate terrorism, which stands as an obstacle to the achievement of the goals that we envision for our region. The people of this region of South Asia deserve better living standards, better infrastructure, better education, peace, prosperity, security and friendship, and we must not fail them.

Sir, there were concerns being expressed by some regarding the Statement issued by the Government in relation to the postponement of the 19th SAARC Summit, which was to be held in Islamabad next month. At no point, Sir, I would like to stress, did the Government of Sri Lanka pull out of the 19th SAARC Summit; at no point, did the Government of Sri Lanka decide to boycott the SAARC Summit to be held in November. Those who made those allegations and accusations did so either through ignorance or lack of knowledge of the SAARC Charter.

As the Hon. Members of this House are aware, the General Provisions of the Charter of SAARC prescribes that "decisions at all levels shall be taken on the basis of unanimity". Therefore, the moment one country says that they are unable to attend a SAARC Summit, a SAARC Summit cannot be held.

; . . . . . . .

There was, therefore, no question of Sri Lanka pulling out of SAARC or Sri Lanka saying that we will not attend the Summit, as there was no Summit to attend. Sri Lanka issued a statement after several countries had informed the current Chair of SAARC, Nepal, formally that they are unable to attend the Summit and after the Chair - that is, Nepal - issued a statement as well.

In our statement, we expressed regret that the prevailing environment in the region, with several countries having stated their inability to attend the Summit, is not conducive for holding the Summit on the 09th and 10th of November and expressed hope that the steps required to ensuring our regions peace and security will be taken to create an environment that is conducive for the pursuit of regional cooperation.

Sir, as a country that is committed to regional cooperation and as a country that clearly perceives the benefits of regional cooperation for the people of Sri Lanka and the wider South Asian Region, we stand ready to participate in the 19th SAARC Summit whenever it is being held.

It is my solemn hope, Sir, that this would be the moment that all the leaders in our region resolve to forget past failures, break with the past and unite in good faith and sincerity to work together for the greater good and benefit of the people of our region.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Minister. Then, the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana.

" " PRIVILEGE: DAILY MIRROR REPORT OF 07TH

OCTOBER, 2016 ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene - State Minister of Defence) Hon. Speaker, I wish to raise a matter of Privilege regarding the front-page story in the "Daily Mirror" newspaper of today, which states, I quote:

SEVERAL MINISTERS, OFFICIALS DID NOT PAY FOR HIRING HCOPTERS

Sir, this is in relation to the Annexes I tabled yesterday in answer to the Question raised by the Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila. This story has implicated

535 536

[ ]

2016 07

several Ministers like the Hon. John Amaratunga, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Hon. Harin Fernando, the Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka, the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka and the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha. So, I have to clearly say, Sir, that this story is false. None of these Ministers owe a single cent to the Ministry of Defence or to the Sri Lanka Air Force. The Ministries have paid for all the official trips. So, there is no truth in this report, Sir.

It has also stated about foreign dignitaries. As a Government, we do not make it a habit of inviting foreign dignitaries to come to this country, taking them on trips and giving them a bill, asking them to pay for the helicopter rides.

Most of these Ministers have accompanied the Hon. Prime Minister or the President in their official tours and there is absolutely no money due from them. So, I urge the "Daily Mirror" newspaper to be more professional in disseminating their news, not to dabble in tabloid journalism and ruin its good name, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. State Minister, I think this news report appeared in several other newspapers as well. I read those.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . It is a clear violation of the Privileges of Parliament; it is a dishonour to the Hon. Members of Parliament and Parliament. .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . I will look into that matter. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, do you have anything to get clarified?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I want the Hon. State Minister to clarify -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I do not want to get into a home and home battle over the Daily Mirror - that is a different issue. But, has the Hon. Minister tabled a document giving all the details? If so, the matter has been reported, it has been tabled. You cannot go back on the document you have tabled. Can the Hon. Minister tell us whether he tabled that document?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana, can you just clarify that? The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is asking whether you have tabled a document indicating the names of the Hon. Ministers. He needs a clarification on that.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Sir, the names are there in the Answer, but these are Ministers who have accompanied the President or the Prime Minister in their official tours. So, all those names have been put, but we do not charge them when they accompany the President or the Prime Minister. If the journalists had clarified with us, this would not have led to this kind of stories being published.

537 538

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Will you clarify that? ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana ) I will make a statement today, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, the Hon. Minister has given the correct answer, but the others have misunderstood. He has said that these Ministers have only accompanied. He has not said that they have to pay. You have not said that, have you?

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana ) Sir, the Answer clearly states that all monies have been paid and no one has to pay anything else for that.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Anyway, I will certainly look into that matter. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . . . . . . " " .

[12.04 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. Specially, I must thank the Hon. Abdullah Mahrooff for bringing in this very important Motion.

The area where I come from - the Puttalam District - has well over 50,000 cattle, but, unfortunately, it is very difficult for them to exist due to lack of grazing lands. The main reason is that in the Puttalam-Anamaduwa area almost all the lands have been taken over either by the Department of Wildlife Conservation or the Forest Department and another portion of land in extent of 5,200 acres are being taken over by the cement factory of Holcim (Lanka) Limited. The cattle farmers are finding it difficult to exist. That entire 5,200 acres do not belong to the Holcim (Lanka) Limited. Yesterday, I tabled the relevant Gazette Notification, by which only 1,900 acres had been allocated to that cement factory, but now, they have 5,200 acres. Since there is a lot of jungle in the Anamaduwa-Puttalam-Wanathawilluwa area, another portion of land has been taken over by both the Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Forest Department

555 556

2016 07

The lands belonging to the JEDB and other plantation companies, thousands of acres in extent, in our area have not been replanted. Out of the lands they have, only 10 to 15 per cent have been planted and are bearing crop. Whenever these cattle stray into their lands, they somehow catch them and the poor farmers have to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000 or Rs. 3,000 to get them back. Today, we know the quantity of milk powder that is being imported. But, if we support the farming community to look after the cattle by feeding them and giving proper instructions, definitely the import of milk powder can be brought down. As I mentioned, most of the lands in my area belong to the big plantation companies like the JEDB, the Chilaw Plantations Limited, the Kurunegala Plantations Limited and to the Holcim (Lanka) Limited or are under the Department of Wildlife Conservation. So, the Government must take a decision to allow the cattle to graze on such lands. Otherwise, what will happen is, the cattle farmers will give up rearing cattle.

Another problem that we face is stray cattle. Most of the stray cattle come into my area, Puttalam, adjoining Mannar. They have no owners. We are facing all these problems because of lack of grazing lands. My area is also next to Wilpattu, where there are thousands of elephants. Now, what is happening is, those elephants also come into Puttalam and Anamaduwa - actually upto one-and-a-half-kilomoters away from my home. The crops in my estate, 35 acres of land, Hon. Minister, are completely destroyed, but I am not complaining about that. What I am saying is that elephants also come into the town area and have their feed from that area. The people suffering most are the farmers.

Therefore, my request is, allow the cattle to graze on large lands such as those belonging to the JEDB and the Forest Department or especially, on the land belonging to the cement factory of Holcim (Lanka) Limited in my area. Of course, some senior officials agree to that, but when the cattle stray into those lands, they are caught and the farmers are fined. So, just imagine a farmer paying a fine every other week.

Sir, this is a very important Motion because we have to bring down the import of milk powder. We can do that only by helping the poor dairy farmers to have more cows that will produce more milk. That is the only way we can bring down the import of milk powder.

Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to inform all the people who occupy State lands to give permission to the cattle farmers to allow their cattle to go in and graze on those lands, by which we can save a big amount of foreign exchange, cutting down on the import of milk powder.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . .

Whereupon THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA left the Chair, and THE HON. BIMAL RATHNAYAKE took the Chair.

[2.53p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for the opportunity given to participate in this Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana on the matter of following a National Monitoring and Evaluation

Policy in order to make the development process more productive and efficient in using the allocated funds from the National Budget or from foreign funding.

I also take pleasure in seconding this important Motion which is an absolute necessity at this juncture where the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 is being considered as a blueprint of the development process. This has been taken up in various forums. Various people who have an interest in the country have been repeatedly talking about these matters in various forums.

When we speak of Sustainable Development Goals, it is a very comprehensive development process which has to be planned, identified, prioritized with the inclusion of every aspect of resources available in every village, city, district, province, country and the whole world fits into the framework of the so-called "Five Ps" known as Planet, People, Peace, Prosperity and Partnership. This will definitely avoid having projects implemented in an ad hoc manner at the whims and fancies of politicians jeopardizing the environmental issues and natural habitats, at the cost of the taxpayers' money.

Therefore, this Motion is very important in order for us to commit ourselves to enforce a National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy in Sri Lanka and to transform the socio-economic position of citizens by empowering them to reach better living standards. I would like to mention that certain objectives of this policy are to be implemented to promote innovative and productive growth with capacity building in our system.

So, I must firstly thank Hon. Kabir Hashim, Minister of Public Enterprise Development. He happens to be the Chair of Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation. Not only that, every time the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe becomes the Prime Minister, he is the one who heads planning and implementation and takes policy decisions on development.

Sir, for many decades, people have been asking for this kind of National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy to be introduced in Sri Lanka in order to avoid corruption. When foreign funds or consolidated funds are allocated for projects, they are not properly planned; they are not properly evaluated. When those projects are not properly monitored, definitely there is going to be corruption. We have seen enough of corruption in the past. That is why we have to ensure good governance even in procurement procedures.

Our Parliament has already focused on Sectoral Oversight Committees. We are overseeing, monitoring and evaluating any project that is coming under any Ministry. So, this is one of the reasons why all Members of Parliament have agreed to this without any party difference. In a National Government, this is the right time for us to form a National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy in Sri Lanka.

Sir, a National Evaluation Policy is important for the following 10 reasons that we have been discussing.

National Evaluation Policy sets standards for evaluation at State level; the policy will guide State institutions and evaluation practitioners for establishment of necessary evaluation mechanisms and systems, and carrying out objective and independent evaluations; the policy will be an assurance for State accountability in relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability; the policy will guide national evaluation capacity development; it will emphasize evaluation as a requirement of development programming; it fulfills evaluation needs of the country; the policy will ensure effective use of resources of the country; this will also guide civil society interventions; the policy would give confidence to the public in effectiveness of development interventions in the country and finally, this will be an assurance to tax payers, donors, private investors for accountability of resources given by them.

So, these are the very important factors that must be considered in forming a National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy of Sri Lanka and without any objection, Sir, both sides of the House have to support it.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah. You have eight minutes.

[2.59p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for the allocation of time for me to speak on this important Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana. As he said, I too have the pleasure of being here again to speak on this important subject which was brought to Parliament earlier also as an Adjournment Motion on the 9th of August, 2016.

Sir, the United Nations have determined 17 Sustainable Development Goals or global goals to achieve by 2030. Initiatives also have been started in each and every area to monitor how we are going to achieve these Sustainable Development Goals. In the previous occasion also, I mentioned this. I had an opportunity to participate in the Standing Committee on Economic and Sustainable Development Affairs of Asian Parliamentary Assembly held in Pakistan. Again, I thank the Hon. Speaker for nominating me as well as the Hon. Mohamed Navavi to participate in that event. At that forum there was an issue raised with regard to the goals determined from time to time. In the year 2000, we determined the Millennium Development Goals. Then, again, in 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals were determined to be achieved by 2030. At that forum issues were raised with regard to the process that we are having in monitoring and

evaluating these goals in our development process. These are very important issues. Even now, there are monitoring units to evaluate the financial performance of each and every development activity, but we do not have any method for performance-based evaluations. So, I was able to put a suggestion at the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development to have Oversight Committees like what we have at present in this Parliament. These committees are different. In these Oversight Committees we interact with the administrative officers who are in charge of the ministries. They implement the suggestions and convey the views of Parliament to the public. So, the same Committee could be an evaluation committee; so that the evaluation taskforce can overview to see how each and every development activity guides us to achieve sustainable development goals. For this process, as the Hon. Member suggested in his Motion, funds are necessary. As he requested in his Motion, we need adequate fund allocations to have this evaluation process for the development programmes. My suggestion is, not only the funds, but we must have the mechanism also in place as an accountable committee or an organization to continue this process.

In the morning, we had a discussion with regard to the policy planning on evaluation process and the Hon. Kabir Hashim chaired that meeting. He is the Chairman of the Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation too. His valuable contribution should be taken into account by this Parliament. In that meeting, I suggested to have a Standing Committee for Evaluation in Parliament such as COPE and COPA, which are evaluating the financial performances of our development processes and the institutions under the Government. My suggestion was appreciated by that Committee. I hope to record my suggestion in Hansard as well, because this suggestion could be taken into consideration by the Hon. Speaker in the future and there should be a performance-based evaluation for our development process.

I again thank the Hon. Kabir Hashim as well as the Hon. Niroshan Perera, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, who participated in that valuable meeting. That Committee will ensure that not only the financial performances but also the public funds used in the certain development work will be properly evaluated.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You also have eight minutes.

[3.04p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity.

I must thank the Hon. Buddika Pathirana for bringing forward this very important Adjournment Motion before this House today. In the morning, we had a session organized by the Hon. Niroshan Perera, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs and the Hon. Kabir Hashim also participated in it. We had a long discussion.

Evaluation is the most important aspect we need to look at today. Today, in our country, especially as politicians, we come across different problems. As you know, there are Members of Parliament, Members of Provincial Councils and Members of Pradeshiya Sabhas. But there is no coordination and cooperation among these politicians or institutions. First and foremost, to fall in line and to work together for the benefit of the country, we need unity among these politicians and institutions. In that way, I am sure, if we all get together and put forward this National Evaluation Policy to look into all projects which are funded by the Government or the foreign donors, we can reach our goals in the future.

In the morning, at the session they gave us ten reasons as to why a National Evaluation Policy is important. I just went through that and I found some of these points. I will read two or three points which are very important. The first is, Policy will ensure effective use of resources of the country. In my view, that is very important. The second is, This will also guide civil society interventions. So, if you organize it in such a way, all these people can fall in line. They will also get involved in those projects. The third is, The policy would give confidence to the public in effectiveness of development and intervention in the country." The final point is This will be an assurance to the taxpayers, donors, private investors for accountability of resources given by them. "

As the Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah said, we were in Islamabad, Pakistan last month to participate in the Asian Parliamentary Assembly and 46 countries participated in it. There are many countries who are behind us. At the discussion, they too agreed to that. But there were a few countries which are ahead of us, and they are doing very well. A National Evaluation Policy is very important. As I said since there is no coordination, what is happening today? When we, Parliamentarians are moving in one direction, the provincial councillors are moving in a different direction. Now the Pradeshiya Sabhas are not functioning. If Pradeshiya Sabhas were there, they will move in a different direction. Ultimately, we do not reach the goal.

We know a number of massive projects were done by the earlier government spending a lot of money. Finally, what is the result? I need not repeat what happened. Massive projects were done, but no evaluation was done. Ultimately, today, we are suffering. If proper evaluation was done, if concentration was made, if all of them got together and studied those projects, then today, we would not be in this position. All major contracts were done; projects were done, but today, we are not getting any return. That is why we are suffering today. We borrowed money from foreign countries and invested in those projects, but we are not getting any return from that

money. Therefore, we have to repay the loans from borrowing money from somewhere else. These are the facts that we have to consider.

In the morning, we had a very good session. I am very happy that the Hon. Niroshan Perera arranged that meeting and we had a long discussion with the officials. There were foreigners also taking part in that.

Therefore, I consider this a must for this country. As the Hon. Member said, we need not wait till 2018, 2019 or 2020 to do this. It is in the hands of a hard-working State Minister from my District. I am sure that he is capable of doing this and also, since his Ministry - Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs - is coming under the Hon. Prime Minister, he could work out a system not to delay this.

Money is allocated to us and then we pass it on to the officials. Sometimes, people are not satisfied with the work done. That is what is happening today. So, when we go for the opening, we would not be satisfied with the work done. If there is proper evaluation and coordination between the politicians, the officials and the people in such a manner, this can be done. Therefore, in future, we must fall in line with this so that 100 per cent of investment can be made use of.

So, once again, I thank the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana for bringing in this Adjournment Motion and I must also thank the Hon. Presiding Member for giving me this opportunity.

Thank you.
