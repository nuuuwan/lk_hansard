[5.03 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) !

Before I commence my speech on the Votes of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, since the Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development is here, I would like to bring this to his knowledge.

Sir, I would like to highlight a grave concern of the minority community regarding the callous disregard in providing security to the Leader of the Opposition and the shabby manner in which the Leader of the Opposition is being treated. The security personnel of the Hon. R. Sampanthan has been provided with an old vehicle - the condition of which is untrustworthy - that will not be able to assure his personal safety.

At a time when there is obviously orchestrated campaign to instigate violence and unrest for political interest, the welfare and the security of our Leader of the

355 356

)

Opposition has been disregarded. This is under the Good Governance Government which is seeking understanding and wants to reach out for reconciliation.

Even the police forces needed to be given specific orders this week by His Excellency the President to do their job, and in this environment not providing effective security to the Leader of the Opposition is unimaginable. We are entitled to expect that the Leader of the Opposition be given the basic courtesy. He has still not been provided with a house and now the situation has worsened by denying him with effective security.

Last week, the Hon. Prime Minister requested from all concerned to offer all the support and help to the former President for his trip overseas, whereas the Leader of the Opposition is being treated in such a disrespectful way.

We are at a loss to understand the basis for such decisions and I ask, on behalf of the minority community, not to keep on sending wrong signals and expect sacrifice to support the Governments initiatives when you are at a great risk.

Sir, I must bring this to the knowledge of this House. On 3rd September, 2015, a vehicle 15 years old, bearing number GB-8470, was provided to the Leader of the Opposition. On the 20th December, in lieu of that vehicle, another vehicle bearing number PA-2910, which had some technical problems was provided to him and it was sent back. Again, on the 12th May, 2016, a Defender bearing number KH-0996 was given to him. I understand that it was purchased on 7th September, 2008, but it too had some technical problems and it was sent back on 9th June, 2016. Subsequently, another old vehicle bearing number GC-0334 was provided. It was called back and in lieu of that, a vehicle bearing number 61-7065 was given. It is a vehicle 22 years old. It was reported to the IGP. The Hon. Sampanthan travels very long distances and by the time his vehicle reaches one place, this old vehicle bearing number 61-7065 is far behind. It cannot keep up with the speed of the vehicle in which he travels. Therefore, I think, immediate action be taken by the Inspector General of Police in regard to this.

Thank you.

2017 . . -

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Hon. Member, if I may respond, this is the first time that this matter is being brought to my notice. But the Police have a shortage of vehicles. All the vehicles we have are old. You mentioned a Defender bearing a "KH"

number. Those are some of the newest vehicles that the Police have got. But Defenders are Defenders. They are four-wheel drive vehicles. I think they are proved to be good for the use of police officers in VIP security. Of course, everybody likes to have a Defender. That is the best vehicle we have as well.

Anyway, I will have this looked at and no sooner the Police Department gets new vehicles, most certainly the Opposition Leader will have a new vehicle. But in the meantime, we will try to find him one that does not break down and that can keep up with his vehicle.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Minister, he is the Leader of the Opposition and the fifth in the protocol list. He has to be -

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) I am not doubting whether to find him a new vehicle. I hope you understand that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I am not asking for a Defender for him. My argument is, not about the Defender but giving him a vehicle 22 years old by the IGP. How will you justify it when all the other Ministers and MPs are having the latest vehicles? They do not experience any breakdowns. How can the vehicle of the Leader of the Opposition experience breakdowns on several occasions?

( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) I also have a Defender and mine also breaks down. Anyway, I hope you understand -

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) The system is breaking down. ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) I hope you understand that this is the first time this matter is being brought to my notice. I said, I would resolve it. I hope you understand that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you, Hon. Minister, for the courtesy extended. That is why I took this matter up when you are present here, in the House. Otherwise, I would have taken it up at a later stage.

Hon. Presiding Member, we recognize that there is improvement in the people of the war-affected areas in engaging and participating in economic development activities. The security forces related challenges imposed by the previous administration are slowly but surely diminishing. The Governments efforts to create an enabling environment for small business to prosper is encouraging and the eagerness of the people of the war-affected areas to get back on their feet again is becoming compelling as the overcrowded actors engaged in providing humanitarian needs, subsistence and assistance are increasingly realizing the futility of such programmes. Year 2020 has been targeted by the Government for the lowest-GDP provinces to be in par with the rest of the provinces - this offers hope.

The environment must be capitalized and opportunities must be converted to a reality to benefit the entire country. We view this as a critical juncture that we all must participate for the sake of these most vulnerable people and chart a new and promising course.

Social and economic justice for the war-affected is fundamentally important as they are yearning for some hope for their future. We recognize that we, as political leaders, must convey that there is a ray of hope for them to get back on their feet. We will call them to embrace, engage and exert themselves for a better future for all.

We must also recognize that simply having the right environment will not be sufficient to get the results. There is a gap between their capacity to engage and the benefits that this conducive environment can offer. A lot of work must be done. We need to map how this gap could be bridged. We need to carefully chart a course, monitor and support the progress all the way to 2020.

The skill and confidence level of the people is low, village infrastructures are inadequate and the communities are not restored so that they are unable to work in a cohesive manner. The village-level producers are home garden operators and the vested interests of the intermediaries continue to prevent fair market price for their produce. They need to be assisted to become commercial farmers. There is a total lack of understanding as to what value chain gives them the best price for their labour.

In the year of Social Inclusion, these vulnerable people must be supported and encouraged to gradually progress to become entrepreneurs. We need an action plan created which makes available to the local people. There should be a road map to get there and it will not happen if you leave it to the autopilot mode. Everyone wants results: we want the regions to grow; we want the country to grow.

There is a complex maze in Government departments and in the financial institutions. There are various types their incentives, allowances and concessions which are all confusing even for the best financial and business professionals. How would a war-affected individual or community will understand and get the benefit from them? Every single person will have his unique circumstances, aptitude and desire. So, how will all these get reconciled with this Budget and other positive measures to get the real benefit of it?

The Public-Private Partnership and engagement of professional civil society organizations must be urgently enlisted to bridge this gap.

Sir, we would like to point out that in 1983, the Northern Province was second in GDP rank, but now it is the lowest just after the Eastern Province. The Northern Province contributed 60 per cent of the GDP from agriculture and industries and 47 per cent from fisheries.

Since the 1983 disturbance, it has now been pushed to the bottom on each count. In addition to all the discrimination and marginalization that the war-affected Provinces suffered, we are now faced with the problem of the illegal fishing done by the Indian poachers. They destroy the environment and deny our fishermen their livelihood. Therefore, these fishermen must be helped and supported, if the country needs to get the benefits from our fisheries resource.

365 366

[ . ]

2016 21

I would like to provide one example for the types of problems faced by the fishermen in the war-affected zones. A handful of multi-day boats are made available to them, but those boats are certainly not enough for the full potential of the Northern fishermen. There is no repair facility provided. These fishermen are not given proper training to improve their capacity. Moreover, harbours are controlled by the security forces and access is denied. The type of diesel they want is not commonly available. So, further offering of multi-day boats for them would not be beneficial. Hence, the improvement of the livelihood of the fishermen will be affected. We need results. If we are to achieve results, we need to understand the ground situation and tailor the programmes to suit the ground situation.

The business ventures such as Cey-Nor fish net making, boat manufacturing in Karainagar, tyre manufacturing facility in Kaithady, Palmyra Arrack in Varani, coconut fiber making in Sankanai and handloom industry in Point Pedro have ceased to operate. Even the other ventures are struggling to survive and they cannot be deemed being able to provide sustainable jobs. A complete analysis needs to be done to find out as to why these business ventures have failed, so that we can learn from them and avoid making the same mistakes again. We cannot fail anymore and cause further disappointments to the people there. These are areas where productivity needs to be immediately improved and supported.

In Sambalthurai in Jaffna District we still have security forces controlling fishing and daily registration with the security forces is required to go fishing. There are a large number of areas in the Northern Province where fishing is still being restricted. Also, except for one light house, no other light houses are there in the Northern Province. The number of ice factories is insufficient to fulfil the current requirements and increase in such facilities is needed to achieve growth.

Muththayankaddu in Mullaitivu District once produced the majority of dry chilli in Sri Lanka, but they are unable to re-engage in it because water supply is restricted to chilli farming. This issue must be reconsidered.

Importation of potatoes and the timing of such imports to coincide with the harvest season has a devastating impact on our farmers.

The local cattle stock of the Northern Province is far below national standards and they have not been improved over the years due to the war. This situation needs to be improved to unleash the full potential of the Province. There are no value addition capabilities of milk production. Provision of new facilities to improve the value and create employment opportunities in the Province are urgently required.

Hon. Presiding Member, to my knowledge, we have been speaking on this subject over and over again - not only myself, but all the Members of Parliament from the Tamil National Alliance. This is my second term since the

year 2010. The same policy that was adopted by the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, former President, I think, is continuing. Up to now, why has the actual figure or the GDP not grown up? Why can you not analyze this? I think there are so many institutions which can easily visit the North, speak to the people and ask them their desires as to what they could do. Nothing is provided yet. That is a fact.

In my speech, which I made at the time of last year's Budget, I told the Government that it had not allocated sufficient funds to the North and East. They were depending on donor countries. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech last year, mentioned that they were going to convene a Donor Conference in 2016. But, it never took place. So, there is no money, no development. Are you going to tell the same thing this year? Okay, forget about the previous regime. We did not trust that regime. That is why we supported you. We gave you our fullest support. But, where is the growth in our area? How many years have passed now? When do you plan to do these things? We do not have proper skills; we do not have any industry functioning there properly to create employment. Honestly, I am the only large-scale businessman there who created 300 employment. That is all. I think, I am the largest employer because there is no other large-scale businessmen.

You have to look into this matter seriously. The Government has to give more consideration towards that. Do you not think that everybody is having in their minds that there is partiality? You must accept that fact. If you speak to any person in Jaffna, they will tell, We are being discriminated." I would like to tell you that as long as they have that feeling in their minds, the reconciliation process will be very difficult. I have been running a newspaper for the last thirty years. I know the set-up of the people; I know the mindset of the people. Last time we all - everybody has - fully supported you. But, in return what did we get? Nothing!

Please, consider this. You are very much aware of the community in the North and East. What do you expect? Even if you spend billions of rupees from Colombo towards reconciliation, it will be a herculean task unless you genuinely come forward and give the Northern Province and the Eastern Province equal status like the other provinces. The 42nd National Sports Festival was held in Jaffna and the Northern Province was the last! It was in the ninth place. How can it be? Something is wrong somewhere.

His Excellency the President comes there and makes promises, but he is unable to fulfil those promises. When you make a promise, you have to fulfil it within the stipulated time. Only 2,800 families have been resettled. There are another 10,000 families to be resettled. So, what are you going to do for those 10,000 families? They are still living outside their lands. Why can you not give them their lands back? Can you kindly tell me how can you start the reconciliation process without settling them and without letting them have their day-to-day lives on

367 368

)

their own land? As I told you, firstly the people should be settled down. Thereafter, they will appreciate everything this Government is doing for them; but not at present.

Now you going to introduce a 65,000 housing programme for war-affected families. You have disturbed the entire community by telling them that you are going to give them prefabricated houses. Unfortunately, even the Government will not give a loan for such a house; the banks will not give a loan. We have a dowry system involved. But, no one will take that house for a dowry. So, our women may not get married. You must understand this. All their houses have got destroyed. They do not have proper houses today.

You have abolished the Rehabilitation Authority and you have reduced its money allocation by Rs. 30 billion. Why? Have you resettled the displaced people who are to be resettled? No, it has not been done. Then, how can you reduce the money? What are you going to do? Somebody should answer this.

( ( () - ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran - State Minister of Child Affairs) The Hon. Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs is not here. He is in Jaffna.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) The Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs is frequently visiting Jaffna. Kindly tell the Minister that there is no point in visiting Jaffna. He is a good Friend of mine. I have known him for the last 30 years. He was a Rotarian governor. There is no point. First he has to settle the issues that are there. There are so many issues.

See the issue of fishermen there. For how long have they been asking for the Myliddy Harbour? I think His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the Government are willing to help them. But, I cannot understand what prevents them.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran) It is only two years. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Two years, Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, how many more minutes do you want? There are four more speakers including two Ministers and we have to stop at 6.30 p.m.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you. There are so many things to be explained. I strongly feel that the Hon. Ministers, Hon. Members and all those in the Government have to have a proper understanding of these problems. This has to be explained to them. Then, they will understand.

I think our former Minister of Higher Higher Education would have understood the situation in the past as to what happened in the University of Jaffna. There were so many things that happened. I think, you all are much aware of it, but we have got to give you the right picture. There is no point in repeating the same thing. Next time also I may have to bring this up. So, please make sure that we will not have to repeat the same thing next time. Kindly look into our problems. We are there for you. We supported you. I must tell you that there was so much pressure on us not to support you. There were all sorts of heated arguments in this regard. But we supported you. We want everything to go smoothly. Unfortunately, in the North, the Hon. Rajapaksa has disturbed the entire community there. He is answerable for that. Where is the law? You are punishing all others for discrimination. Why can you not punish him? He cannot speak like that.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, please. You have only four minutes.

[5.50p.m.[ ( ( ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for the four minutes given.

Sir, the Hon. Saravanapavan made many allegations that the Government has not done sufficiently for the Northern Province. He, in fact, asked the question whether we are following the same policies of the previous Government. The Hon. Prime Ministers policy has been very clear, Hon. Saravanapavan. You know that. This Unity Government has been doing so much for the people of the North. In fact, as you rightly pointed out, it is reconciliation, that must come first. See how much

369 370

reconciliation has been happening. You know for a fact, Hon. Saravanapavan,that we are on a process of four-pillar reconciliation programme. We are talking about finding the truth. We have set up the truth seeking mechanism. You know that the Office of Missing Persons has already been set up. You know that the accountability process is moving forward. You know that consultations have happened right round the country and all kinds of stakeholders have voiced their opinions and you also know, at the next point of reparations which we are talking about, how we are going to deal with it.

Hon. Saravanapavan, you and I sit in the same Subcommittee on Finance of the Constitutional Assembly headed by the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane as the Chairman. You, me and the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, we discussed how financial allocations should be managed. We discussed how much of decision making power that the Provincial Council should have in terms of Budgetary allocations. You presented your arguments; I presented my arguments. We discussed and we submitted the Report of the Subcommittee on Finance to the Constitutional Assembly the other day.

So, I think it is a little bit unfair to say, Hon. Member, that we are following the same path of the previous Government. We are not. We are conscious of the fact that reconciliation is primary and that through reconciliation only we can develop this country. That is the foundation and therefore, it is a little bit unfair to be making such remarks, Hon. Member.

However, I must tell you that development is for all people. It is not just for the Northern Province, not for the Southern Province or not for the Central Province, but for all people in the country. If you look around the world, you will see what is happening. Why is neoliberalism failing?

The statements that have been made by the Hon. Minister of Justice last Friday in this House, have caused significant hurt to the Muslim community. The statements have renewed and created unnecessary further incitement of already prevalent ethnic tensions. Also, they have created a sense of hostility and alienation towards all minority ethnic communities in Sri Lanka, not necessarily just for the Muslims.

371 372

)

Hon. Presiding Member, his statements have also caused a sense of agitation and discomfort amongst Muslims, fearing retaliation from other ethnic communities who have been excessively stirred up by the Hon. Ministers comments. I want to mention here that in the latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s when we were facing terrorism in our area, in the North and the East, the difficulties that we underwent have to be reminded for the sake of Hon.Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe's consideration. That will be apt at this moment.

For example, I come from the area called Eravur in the Batticaloa District, and 121 people were killed by the LTTE in the midnight of 12th August, 1990. The elderly people, those people who were ailing with various sicknesses, pregnant women, children and all were killed without any discrimination while they were sleeping. Further, early in the same month, on the 3rd of August, 1990 people in the Kattankudy Mosque were killed while they were praying. At that time, the then Minister of State for Defence, the Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne told in the presence of the then IGP and the then Commander of the Army that he can arm the Muslim community to protect themselves. We said, No. Even at the time when we were attacked we did not want to take up arms. We wanted to continue to live peacefully with other communities and we said, If you want to recruit our youth, take them into the regular police service or absorb them into the army to safeguard our country and our people". That is how we stood for the sake of our united Sri Lanka. Sir, we have paid a heavy price towards a united Sri Lanka. So, in any kind of situation, we have never ever wanted to associate with any kind of undesirable activities or any terrorist organization. Instead, we really condemn them and denounce them.

Even if you find that those 32 people have any connection with ISIS, we will cooperate with you to find them. We do not promote that kind of activities. This has to be emphasized in this House that we do not cooperate or associate with this kind of undesirable and unwanted activities. I want you all to understand the reality and I am telling this with the good intention on behalf of our community - our community is in fact a peace-loving and a patriotic community working towards a united Sri Lanka - and also on behalf of some Muslim organizations like Jamiyyathul Ulama, Thableeg Jamaath, Sunnathul Jamaath, Shoora Council and Thareekas and several other social service organizations including Thowheed Jamaath, who are leading us in the proper way to conduct ourselves in a peaceful manner and to coexist with the rest of the communities in this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much. ).
