REPAIR OF DAMAGED WATER INTAKES: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF CITY PLANNING

AND WATER SUPPLY

( ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, I am compelled to make this Statement in view of some unsubstantiated social media reports relating to a pending shutdown of the Ambatale Intake. In my opinion, it is very irresponsible reporting. As a matter of fact, I thought I should clarify some of the details so that there will not be a panic situation arising over the already stretched-out disaster position that we all are faced with.

Mr. Speaker, as a result of the unusually heavy rainfall and the flood situation during the last few days, many of our water intakes have been damaged and filled with mud and silt. In addition, power supply interruptions and the landslide situation have also caused disruptions to the water supply.

In order to overcome the situation, we have cleaned and repaired most of the intakes and where necessary, obtained the assistance of the Sri Lanka Navy for the cleaning operations. Further, diesel-operated generators have been utilized to maintain a minimum supply. Actions have been taken to provide temporary storage tanks and to supply water through bowsers to hospitals, other essential institutions and the camps provided for displaced persons.

All our Regional Offices and the Provincial and Regional Support Centres are coordinating with the relevant disaster management offices, district secretariats and divisional secretariats to maintain water supply to essential areas and to ensure at least the minimum water supply needs.

In order to maintain the safety of water supply, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board has increased the level of residual chlorine in the systems and also strengthened the Water Quality Surveillance Mechanism by deploying chemists and other staff to the relevant points.

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board is constantly coordinating with the Department of Irrigation and Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka in order to minimize the water levels in the rivers and reservoirs so that Response Plans could be initiated. Further, maintenance and repair gangs have been mobilized in order to face any expected emergency situation.

Mr. Speaker, when it comes to water levels in the Kelani River, sometimes people mistake the measurement of the Department of Irrigation taken at Nagalagam Street with the water levels in Ambatale, where the intake is at a higher elevation.

Sir, now I would like to place before the House the rectification efforts we have taken in this situation.

1) Western Province:

Due to flood water rising in the Kelani River, the Ambatale New Intake had to be kept under careful observation for the past few days. Only if the water level reaches 23 feet, we may be compelled to completely shut it down. Since of yesterday, we have seen a steady decrease of water level and it has gone down to 19 feet and 11 inches by early morning today. We have also kept the necessary water pumps on standby to pump out water seeping into the pump house and the Navys assistance in this regard must be appreciated. Due to the natural phenomenon of the sea level increase during the two days

363 364

before Poya and the two days after Poya and the sea level reaching the peak during the Poya Day, we are closely monitoring the high tide that is being reported. Last morning, there was a 0.4-metre rise in the sea level observed between 3.00 a.m. and 4.00 a.m. It is reported that tomorrow being a Poya Day, it may rise up to 0.5 metres. In such a situation, discharge of water from the river will slow down and the water level rising could be observed. With the receding flood levels, we can confidently say that it will not reach the critical 23 feet, which will necessitate any shutdown of the Ambatale New Intake.

We must also assure consumers that there is no truth to the rumour that the Kelani River water had been severely polluted with oil. We have been constantly checking water for impurities and we can guarantee the quality of the water that has been treated and supplied to the consumers.

In the Avissawella Intake, pumps were submerged since yesterday. Due to receding water levels, the situation will be rectified today.

There is no issue in Kethhena WTP and Kandana WTP located along the Kalu Ganga. Hence, there is uninterrupted water supply to Kalutara and Panadura.

In the Western North Region, the following situations have arisen due to flooding.

i) In Divulapitiya, all three intake boreholes are damaged and the NWSDB is unable to provide water to about 1,000 connections.

ii) In Raddolugama, CEB power line and the transformer is damaged. The NWSDB is managing with great difficulty using generators. The affected areas are Raddolugama and a part of BOI Zone.

iii) In Gampaha, the intake access roads are submerged. The NWSDB is operating the intake for eight hours per day with great difficulty. The affected areas are Nittambuwa and Kalagedihena.

Mr. Speaker, since my Statement also deals with the rectification efforts we have taken in other provinces in this emergency situation, it is quite lengthy and I thought I would table* it to be included in toto in Hansard and also circulate it to the press in the Gallery so that it will be reported properly.

* : * :: *Rest of the Statement tabled:

2) Central Province: In the Central Province the Nillambe 500mm diameter treated water pipe line is at high risk due to road damages. If there is a breakdown Daulagala and Hiddaula Towns will be affected. NWSDB is collecting 500mm pipes for new pipe line in case of a failure.

In Akurana, the distribution pipe was damaged due to A9 Road slip. Action is taken to rectify the pipe line today itself.

In Gampola, Araththana, Balagolla the river intakes are blocked due to floating material during high floods. When flood level recedes, intakes are cleaned and pumping shall recommence.

3) North-Western Province:

In the North-Western Province, following issues were observed.

i) In Giriulla, electrical panels are under water and there is no pumping at present. This will be rectified today.

ii) In Nattandiya, five tube wells are under water. Three days of dry weather necessary to rectify the situation. There are 2,000 connections affected in Nattandiya and NWSDB is providing bowser supply at present.

iii) In Pannala, 200mm PVC pumping main was damaged. 376 connections were affected due to the pipe damage. NWSDB will rectify the pipe line today.

4) North-Central Province:

In the North-Central Province, Eppawala water supply is disrupted due to the collapse of Eppawala Wewa Bund. It will take about a week for Mahaweli Authority to rectify the bund. Three bowsers are engaged to provide water to consumers.

5) Northern Province:

In the Northern Province, no water supply interruptions reported from Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar.

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. EDWARD GUNASEKARA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) As you are aware, because of the rainy weather we had for almost one year, salt production in Sri Lanka came down very badly. I represent the Puttalam District, which supplies 40 per cent of the salt need of the country and in the last Maha Season, salt production almost came down to zero. Especially in Puttalam and Mannar, there was no salt. There was no salt in Palaviya also. There was a shortage of salt and the prices have gone up drastically. Actually, it has gone up by 200 - 300 per cent. Sir, I would like to bring to your kind notice the fact that the Society in Puttalam supplies properly-produced iodized salt. Our industry directly comes under the supervision of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.

In our country, there is a shortage of salt. In addition to that, there is iodine deficiency. Iodine can be added to the diet through salt. Actually speaking, 95 per cent of the people in the country should have sufficient iodine.

381 382

[ ]

2016 20

Unfortunately, it is only about 60 - 65 per cent. Therefore, it is a must that we add iodine to the diet through salt, which is the easiest way. There are only a few companies which produce iodized salt. It is very difficult for us to produce it without the necessary salt. Now, only the Mantai Salt Limited of Mannar is supplying salt to us. The Salt Limited in Hambantota has stopped supplying. So, we request the Hon. Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and also the Minister of Industry and Commerce to intervene and request these people to supply the necessary salt to us, so that we could produce iodized salt.

There is a committee coming under the Ministry of Health for which we have to attend regularly and give reports. All these things are done in order to give quality salt to the people. It is with great difficulty that we are supplying iodized salt at the moment. But, there are ample stocks at Hambantota. They are holding stocks of salt thus creating this problem. Specially, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is aware that we supply pure quality salt. Even to Sathosa we supply. But, unfortunately, we do not have the necessary salt to produce iodized salt and the prices also have gone up. The Salt Limited, Hambantota has ample stocks of salt. So, I request them to sell that salt at a nominal price to people who are producing good iodized salt according to the rules and regulations of the Ministry of Health. Otherwise, what will happen is there will be a shortage of salt. Probably, we may have to import salt which may affect our industry in the future. Our Maha Season will begin in June-July. So, until such time I request Salt Limited, Hambantota to give us the necessary salt so that we can produce necessary iodized salt.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 00 0
