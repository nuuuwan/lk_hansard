(ii) The opportunity given for representatives to appear for parties in the proceedings before the LTs as per Section 46(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, No.43 of 1950 has not been revoked and the said law is still in operation.

However, by way of a definition to the said Section, the Presidents of LTs have decided not to consider any other persons as representatives other than Attorneys-at-law and officers of a trade union representing such parties.

The Presidents of LTs have informed that they have reached the above conclusion based on the provisions laid down in Section 46 of the said Act and as well as Section 41(1) and 41(2) of the Judicature Act, No.02 of 1978.

: : PUBLIC AWARENESS ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Speaker, I would like to reply to the Hon. Douglas Devanandas question raised on 20th September, 2016 under Standing Order No. 23(2).

There are provisions in the Right to Information Act where access to information can be denied and overseas agreement is one such category. That is Section 5 C (V). Disclosure of such information prematurely would be or is likely to be seriously prejudicial to Sri Lankas relations with any State, or in relation to international agreements or obligations under international law, where such information was given by or obtained in confidence.

Hon. Speaker, I would like to inform you that with regard to these negotiated Trade Agreements, we have consulted all the stakeholders, obtained their views and we continue to do so. Even yesterday, we had some discussions. We continue to engage all the stakeholders and their concerns are also being addressed.

As far as loss of employment opportunities are concerned, this had been widely debated, particularly, with regard to the service sector under the ETCA Agreement.

1601 1602

Hon. Speaker, there are four "Modes for Trade in Services" under the principles of service liberalization of GATS and WTO. Movement of natural persons is under Mode 04. Our Government will not sign any agreement under Mode 04 and we have categorically stated that we will not agree to sign any agreement under Mode 04. So there should not be any fear of people coming to Sri Lanka.

The Hon. Member has asked whether there are unexpected losses to the country. I do not believe so. There are also possibilities to terminate any agreement by giving about six months notice. All these will be included in the Agreement.

The opening of international markets through these agreements are not only for exports but also for imports. Any Trade Agreement, whether it is multilateral or bilateral, will lead to open both import and export markets and thereby increase investment potential in these related industries.

Especially, with the Agreement with China, we are hoping to open 451 goods categories and we believe that this includes garments, gems and jewellery, rubber and rubber products and so on. We believe that our exports can increase by about US Dollars 500,000 to a US Dollars 1 billion per yearover a short period of time.

Under the Indian Agreement, we are also hoping to remove the quotas for textiles and pepper, thereby increasing the possibility of our exports.

As far as the present non-tariff barriers are concerned, we have made a lot of progress. We have been discussing with the Indian Government and steps are being taken to address these issues by accepting Mutual Recognition Agreements where standards can also be discussed and agreed upon. I believe we are making good progress in this regard.

As I said before, clauses on investment facilitation are included in these Agreements and it is expected that the FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) from relevant countries will be substantially increased. Attracting FDI to strategically selected sectors will result in employment generation and technology transfers thereby inducing a positive impact on the economic growth. I have explained before all these benefits.

The Hon. Member has asked as to which extent this will affect on the prices of the other goods and services. In that regard, both parties will implement a tariff reduction or tariff elimination programme. Therefore, goods that are imported to Sri Lanka under these Trade Agreements will cost less and our people can have cheaper goods. However, we will also take safeguards to protect our sensitive industries such as agriculture products, fisheries and so on.

Thank you.

, 148 , 1949 . , . Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005 .

I would like to quote Section 4 of it. It states:

THE NATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEM

4. (1) The Central Bank shall be the authority responsible for the preparation of a plan for a national payment system. The Central Bank shall also be charged with the responsibility of providing guidance and leadership for the establishment and development of payment, clearing and settlement systems in Sri Lanka.

(2) The Central Bank shall facilitate-

(a) the interaction of its clearing and settlement systems and related arrangements with other systems or arrangements connected with the exchange, clearing or settlement, of payments or securities ;

(b) the development of new methods and technologies for payments in domestic or foreign currencies and the transfer of securities ; and

(c) the co-operation among all participants in the evolution of payment systems and the provision of payment services.

These have been openly violated. The former President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa tabled the relevant documents, regarding the request of the Minister of Finance to bring it under the Finance Ministry. Central Bank, as we understand, is opposed to this principle. Obviously, Parliament has not given such powers to the Finance Ministry. It will be taken over by the Finance Ministry and then handed over to a private company; which is totally a violation of the Parliamentary powers under the Constitution, powers of the Central Bank and also the logic of running a Central Bank. What is the use of running a Central Bank if all the pieces of it are handed over to private companies? Finally, who will take the responsibility?

Sir, we know about Perpetual Treasuries Limited. That was the biggest fraud which happened under the Central Bank, for which the former Governor has been charged. Today the Parliamentary Committee has established it very clearly that this is a fraud and we of the Joint Opposition demand that all those assets be frozen immediately and the licence of Perpetual Treasuries Limited be cancelled and legal action be taken against all those who are responsible for this Rs.1.5 billion initial fraud that has been perpetuated on the monetary system of this country.

The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama quoted Dr. W.A. Wijewardena, former Deputy Governor. I would like to table* what Dr. Wijewardena has said. He has warned that these should not be given in any form outside the Central Bank. Is Dr. Amunugama going to agree with us or with Dr. Wijewardena? Just quoting something Dr. Wijewardena has said on the GDP is not going to help this type of violation, which is going to end in a further chaotic situation of our monetary management.

, . , . . . . You all have accepted all the terms dictated by the IMF.

. IMF - - , -the next tranche- . What are the conditions? -Budget - . .

The agreement with the IMF came in the form of an Extended Fund Facility of US Dollars 1.5 billion - 185 per cent of Sri Lankas quota spread over three years. The EFF is built on six pillars: (1) lowering the budget deficit; (2) higher governmental revenues; (3) stronger public financial management (4) state enterprises reform; (5) monetary policy reform and (6) supporting higher trade and investments.

I would like to quote from the book titled, Sri Lanka - State of the Economy 2016 published by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka.

It states, I quote:

....Sri Lanka has granted significant tax exemptions to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) which has contributed to weakening the countrys tax base and tax compliance. Both these

sectors perform poorly. Exports have continued to decline as a share of GDP, hitting a new low of 14 per cent of GDP in 2015; in the first half of 2016, export earnings have contracted by 6 per cent. Similarly, Sri Lanka has failed to raise its FDI beyond 1.5 per cent of GDP even following the post-war economic euphoria. FDI inflows fell by 30 per cent in 2015;

That is when the UNP came. , , . .

It further states, I quote:

they have fallen by a further 53 per cent in the first half of 2016.

So, it is a very bleak picture. Hon. Finance Minister will come here and say that he is expecting FDI to come, FDI to invest, FDI to buy our corporations. This will not happen. This is what we are trying to explain. We have to strengthen the public sector to perform certain committed responsibilities of our society, especially free education, health, transport et cetera. Now, what are you going to do with education?

Whatever paper you sign will not be taken seriously by the international community, because if you do not respect the Supreme Court, they know that you will not respect even a word in any of those agreements that you all sign.

Hon. Speaker, the proposal should be considered in terms of the work arrangements permitted by the law such as security janitorial, canteens and transportation activities. My aim is to put an end to exploitative practices and not to curb flexibility that business requires.

I would like to make a correction to the section where "Sugar Mills" have been mentioned. For that, the word "Vavuniya" should be added and this was an omission from my end. Also there is a correction that needs to be made in the area of plantations, which had restricted housing development to Badulla and Rathnapura only. It will be expanded to all plantation areas such as Moneragala, Kegalle, Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Kalutara and Galle. Those are the rectifications that have been done.

. . , . , , , , . - needless to say, Hon. Speaker, it is the brunt of the payments on the burden of debt stock inherited by this Government, details of which I have given to this House on several occasions. The total debt plunges into a colossal sum in excess of Rs. 9.9 trillion. I have given, in the Budget -2017, various dimensions of the mounting public debt to this House. You can see that the burden of this debt will be felt

1721 1722

at an alarming scale from 2018 onwards. Managing this colossal sum is not an easy task.

The countrys debt management responsibilities are shared mainly among the Central Bank, the General Treasury and the Department of External Resources. That arrangement was good when the total debt was a few billion rupees. Given the complexities and the scale of debt, the task of managing it is no doubt going to be challenging in the days to come. These debts need to be closely monitored, controlled on a day-today basis. Therefore, our Government intends to undertake the management of debt based on a new piece of legislation which is to be brought in to this House in the first quarter of next year. In that effort, we will look at the institutional arrangements, long-term debt programme, settlement instruments and debt market development, et cetera. I would like to say that the Ministry of Finance is currently working on this.

Then, there is another distortion in the Payment and Settlement Systems Act. I was surprised and beyond expectation to hear some Members of Parliament were able to go the Central Bank and get some clarifications. For 11 years, we have been trying; but was never permitted. But at your first attempt, five or six Hon. Members were able to go to Central Bank and get certain clarifications. That is the sense of open democracy that we have.

I would like to invite the Hon. Members to see, in particular, Section 4 (3) (b) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005, which I will read for your satisfaction. I quote:

establish, operate, organize, promote, participate or assist in the establishment, operation, organization and promotion of, and regulate and supervise -

(i) any system for the clearing and settlement of payments and other arrangements for the making or exchange of payments in domestic or foreign currencies ;

(ii) any system for the clearing and settlement of securities and other arrangements for the exchange of securities ; and

(iii) any system to facilitate the clearing and settlement including other arrangements for the making or exchange of payments or the exchange of securities in any currency against other payments or securities in another currency.
