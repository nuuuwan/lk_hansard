Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to speak a few words about the elderly population in Sri Lanka. It was reported during the last five or six years that Sri Lanka has one of the fastest-aging populations in the world. So, it has been growing significantly and today, more than 20 per cent of our population is beyond 65 years. With that, it was lamented by the Hon. Minister that there is a significant rise in the non-communicable diseases in this country in the form of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, cancer and so on and so forth.

We commend the fact that the Ministry has taken a lot of initiatives for the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases in this country. But, it is important, at this moment, to highlight that even though we have paid a lot of attention to hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other circulatory disorders, we have paid less attention towards psychiatric illnesses including dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

It is also important to mention the fact that the treatment centres are greatly centred around the urban areas. As the demography is changing, we see a transition of the disease pattern along with that. The success story of the Sri Lankan health sector was because of the fact that we have a great delivery system in relation to the primary health care. But today, we do not see that success in relation to the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases. So, because of that reason, we see a great disparity in the distribution of services and the resources amongst the rural and urban sectors. Due to that, we see that a lot of patients bypass the primary health care institutions - rural hospitals, base hospitals and at certain times the district hospitals - in their areas and come to the general hospitals or the tertiary health care institutions like teaching hospitals seeking treatment.

As the Hon. Minister illustrated in his speech, if we can establish a system of referring patients from the peripheral hospitals to the teaching hospitals, we can reduce the numbers at the general hospitals. We have seen at certain times patients seeking treatments for minor illnesses like cough and cold at teaching hospitals. So, there has to be an effective referral system to ensure that patients do not bypass the peripheral hospitals. So, how can we do that? To do tht, we have to have standard operating procedures in this country like the NICE guidelines laid down in the United Kingdom or America. If we follow the standard operating procedures and have a laid down system of treating patients with different

conditions once those are diagnosed, the patients would be convinced that they would be given the same treatment whether at the peripheral hospital or at the teaching hospital. If we can curtail the numbers that way, we would be able to provide better treatment for the non-communicable diseases and in the highly-specialized sectors at the teaching hospitals. However much we try, we have to come to a tertiary health care institution to get a neurosurgical procedure done, for a bypass surgery, a kidney procedure or for that matter even to see an endocrinologist. But, if we can generalize these services to ensure that we treat a higher number of patients, we would be able to further strengthen the services provided by the Sri Lankan health care sector.

Thank you very much, Sir, for the time given to me. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! .

That is why we have set up the 842 Healthy Lifestyle Centres and 906 Well Women Clinics throughout the country. That is what we have done to, as you said, spread it out to the peripheries.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, within two weeks of my appointment as the Health Minister, I made permanent most of the employees under the Central Government. There was a problem with regard to some people because they did not have the basic qualifications. I put up a Cabinet Paper asking that those people also be made permanent. But, it was not approved. Then, I told your Provincial Minister to do the same thing for the people who are in the Provincial Health Service. I do not know why that has not happened.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Thank you very much for your response, Hon. Minister. We thank you for your effort to make these labourers permanent.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, for the appointments in the Central Government, we have to follow certain procedures. For hospitals under the Central Government we have to appoint people who have passed six subjects with two Credit Passes at the G.C.E. (O/L). But, for the hospitals which come under the Provincial Councils, we have provision to appoint people who have passed only the 8th Standard.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) That is correct. I accept your position to appoint the people who have passed the G.C.E. (O/L) to the vacancies in hospitals which come under the Central Government.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, the Hon. Deputy Minister says, about 20 people have been appointed from the Northern Province. But, if you have any more people, give me that list and I can do the needful.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) The Members of Parliament of the Eastern Province, who represent our Party have also made some claims to me. They have a lot of issues. I think it is better that we will get an appointment with you to discuss the matter and take a decision on this.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) You consult the Members and give me the list.

Hon. Presiding Member, at the same time, I would like to say that a lot of countries, especially most of the States in the USA and in Europe, have legalized

medicinal herb sativa. I think, if we can introduce medicinal herb sativa for cancer patients even in Sri Lanka, it is a good suggestion, because a lot of countries are now introducing this kind of medicinal herbs.

Thank you very much. [ .]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. The next speaker is Hon. Mohamed Navavi. [5.23p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity.

I was extremely happy to listen to the Hon. Minister when he was speaking. I must thank him because a large amount of money has been allocated not only for the Colombo and Kandy General Hospitals, but also for the hospitals right around the country, so that more people will be benefited in the future.

I was listening to him explaining that on CKDu, already Rs. 2,225 million has been allocated and another Rs. 750 million is proposed to be allocated. Since in places like Puttalam, my area, the kidney disease and other diseases are very common. I am sure the Hon. Minister will help us to obtain necessary machines to curb those diseases.

If we take the children's hospitals, there are two major children's hospitals in the country. Rs. 1,000 million has been allocated for the improvement of pediatric care in hospitals in other areas too. It is a very good move because people from faraway places have to travel a long distance to the children's hospitals either in Colombo or Kandy. So, with this move, Hon. Minister, I am sure we will be able to help the poor children living in other areas.

Also, I am extremely happy about the decision you have taken in regard to private hospitals. It is really the middle-class people who have been suffering, because when they go to private hospitals as an alternative, they are taxed very heavily. So, I am sure, with this decision, you can bring those under control so that the people of this country will benefit because that was what we promised during the last election.

2923 2924

Another thing I must mention is, the reduction of prices of medicine. A gentleman told me that his monthly bill on medicine was over Rs. 8,500 and that now, it has come down to Rs.2,500 to Rs. 3,000. Therefore, it is a very good move and I am sure that in the future, people will be benefited more.

Sir, I must also mention about the Puttalam Hospital in my area, about which I have already spoken to you, Hon. Minister. When His Excellency the President was the Minister of Health, he visited the Puttalam Hospital. Now, I invite you too, Hon. Minister, to visit the Puttalam Hospital, which caters to a very vast area. Unlike the area covering Chilaw, Wennappuwa, Marawila, Negombo and Kuliyapitiya, Puttalam , my area, is vast and we have shortcomings in the Puttalam Hospital. In the week before last, I moved an Adjournment Motion in this regard and-

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) I will visit your hospital in January next year. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. I will not drag this on. I know the service rendered by you. I was the Provincial Minister of Health at that time and I rendered some service to the Puttalam Hospital. After that, it has had some problems. I am extremely happy because wherever we go, -

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Hon. Member, I would like to say that the DG and I visited the Puttalam Hospital; discussed with the staff and asked them for suggestions. With regard to construction of buildings, the Department of Buildings has been asked to do the estimates. Hopefully, next year, we will start some of the work.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) But, Hon. Deputy Minister, I was not aware of your visit. You never informed me about your visit to Puttalam.

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Actually, we were going to the Chilaw Hospital and on our way to Anuradhapura, we just visited that hospital. Anyway, sorry about it.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) You know me personally. You should have informed me. I am not finding fault with it, but you should have informed me.

Anyway, I have known the Hon. Minister for the last so many years. So, I am sure that when he comes to the Puttalam Hospital, he would definitely inform me and come. There are so many problems in that hospital that needs attention as it caters to a vast area.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Give me two more minutes, Sir.

The Puttalam Hospital caters to places like Kalpitiya, Vanathawilluwa and a part of Anamaduwa. In addition, there are seven or eight army camps.

Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity and invite the Hon. Minister to visit Puttalam in January.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. E. Saravanapavan. You have nine minutes.

[5.28p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

This time, the allocation for the improvement of physical infrastructure facilities in hospitals - out-patient departments, accident wards, operation theatres, laboratory complexes and equipment - is Rs. 25,200,000,000, which is a little more than the allocation for last year, Rs. 23,147,000,000.

What I try to say is, since the theme of this Budget is "Accelerating Growth With Social Inclusion" and by year 2020, the Northern Province will virtually reach the average of the rest of the provinces, it is time to concentrate and consider more allocations to the North. I am happy to note that next to the Western Province, you have considered the Northern Province in making the second highest allocation. But still, we have to look into how to make it work, how we monitor it and how to expedite things. Sometimes, with the allocations being made during the period of August to September, it may not be possible for the officials to complete the work.

Presently, the Teaching Hospital, Jaffna needs Rs. 150 million for a nursing lecture hall and the laboratory extensions need Rs. 300 million. There is a building being built with World Bank assistance. For the

2925 2926

2016 (5

completion of its floors, Rs. 1,073 million is needed. Completion of this building has to be given priority with the allocations made. Also, there are so many other requirements. Especially in the case of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, we can go for high-rise buildings due to lack of space and I want to bring that to the notice of the Hon. Minister. I am very happy with good governance. The Hon. Minister is one of the key persons in that. We, especially I, supported it because he was there.

Hon. Minister, I would like to bring to your kind notice that the Department of Management Services was very clearly informed that the approved cadre at present in the health sector in the entire Northern Province is altogether 7,275. That is, from the medical consultant to the worker at the bottom. In 2013, they made a request for additional cadre, but instead of the total number, only a limited number was approved. After my last speech on this subject, immediately 200 nurses were given.

If we take up the nurses, the approved cadre is 826, but the additional cadre requirement is almost 970. There are nearly 20 peripheral hospitals where there are no consultant doctors at all. So, how can the hospitals function? First, I want to point out the shortages. In relations to pharmacists, the additional cadre requirement - when you say "additional cadre requirement", in other words, it is the shortage - is nearly 55; with regard to medical laboratory technicians, it is 46; with regard to physiotherapists, it is 24; with regard to radiographers, the most important technicians, it is 27 and in relation to radiotherapists, it is 28. More than those, we do not have the required cadre of medical officers for mental health, clinical counsellors and child psychologists. There is a shortage of so many cadres, but I read out only the important ones. So, Hon. Minister, kindly look into that.

I think of all the Ministries, everyone focuses on the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and gives it priority. Of course, I know that you are doing your best with the available resources. I think even after the 30-year war - during the 30 years of war, no development took place - which ended in 2009, no development took place. It is only with Good Governance that things are happening, I would say, rather expeditiously. If you start paving the way in the year 2017 only, we can come up to the average level of the other provinces, not only with regard to health, education and so on, but in all other aspects.

I want to point out another issue apart from the shortage of cadre. We have seven primary health care centres in the Northern Province. The newly opened five hospitals have to be upgraded and the Special Care Units such as for chronic kidney disease in all major hospitals lack staff. A major drawback in our hospitals, be it a teaching hospital or a rural hospital, is the shortage of staff. In some hospitals, there is a shortage of 50 per cent of staff. The Northern Provincial Council has already passed a Health Statute, which was assented by the Governor. Approval has been given to upgrade five hospitals. So, there is a need for infrastructure development. In addition to the needs I mentioned of the

general hospital, we need more money for development of the other hospitals. When I discussed this matter with you, you asked me, "We have sent so much of money and why are things done very slowly?" The funds are sent by the Central Government as the allocation of the provincial council. I suggest that a committee be appointed consisting of the Minister of Health of the Province and also the Members of Parliament to discuss the progress of the projects implemented, whether the implementation is slow, how it should be done technically, about the programming et cetera. If there is such a system, I appreciate it. If not, such a system has to be created.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, we are working very closely with the Provincial Minister of Health. But, if things are not moving, we have to pay attention to it. I cannot always supervise only the Northern Province. So, if I appoint you to represent our Ministry from the Central Government, can you work with the Chief Minister, get things done and report back to me?

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Of course. ( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Regularly, you will have to be in contact with our Ministry and do everything, acting as a go-between.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Definitely. In the interest of our people, I will do it. ( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Okay. Then, from 1st of January, we will appoint you to look after the health sector of the Northern Province on behalf of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine of the Central Government. We will send you the letter.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you, Hon. Minister.

Apart from that, Hon. Minister, I wish to draw your attention to the awareness programmes on a number of diseases. The health workers are carrying out the programmes, but you can see that there is a shortage of even health workers. You have to initiate some awareness programmes with a difference for those to reach out to the people immediately making them aware of a disease before it gets worse. That too has to be done. Initiating the process through your health services is also essential.

2927 2928

At the same time, there has to be advertisements and other means of creating awareness such as through schools and other places. The Hon. Minister suggested some programmes to be conducted through schools, for which he has allocated Rs. 1,000 million.

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) All this propaganda work that you referred to is carried out by the RDHS offices and the MOH offices in those areas, which deal with the public.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) How do we ensure that it really reaches out to the people with the lack of staff and with some RDHS offices functioning and some not functioning?

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) All the RDHS offices are functioning because every month, we have a meeting of the Regional Directors of Health Services.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Okay. Thank you, Sir.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, it is not based on ethnic proportion, it is based on Siddha and Unani systems. What you say is correct. Usually, there should be a ratio of 2:1 for Siddha and Unani. But the problem is, during the conflict time, there were not enough people for Siddha system from the North. So, what they did was, they turned the ratio the other way, that is, 2:1 for Unani and Siddha. This year also they have just followed what was done the previous year. Now I have instructed them to go back to the previous system that we had before the war; to have the ratio of 2:1 for Siddha and Unani. It will happen from the next batch.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs) Shanthi Sriskandarasa) Okay, thank you.

, , , , -

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) During the last three years, there were no passing out of nurses because of the qualification problem. Now, the first batch will pass out in January. Thereafter, we will be able to send a good proportion of nurses to the North.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, we cannot deviate from this only for one district. As you know, this criteria has been gazetted. So, in the gazette, you cannot specify one criteria for the Northern Province and another for Western Province or any other province. That is the whole problem. It is only one exam, and there should be only one criteria for the recruitment procedure for the entire country. Now, can you do that for the doctors? You cannot. The same thing applies here.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Minister, with the Z-score, you will have to change it. At the moment only 150 nurses are being trained in Jaffna but 300 nurses should have been trained there. So, find some solution for this. As I told you, we need hundreds of nurses, but you do not have enough nurses to recruit.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) No, we have enough recruits. The problem is, there is a limited provision for training. Therefore, there is a shortage of nurses. Not that there are not enough applicants. There are enough applicants. The number of applications are okay. At the moment 7,575 trainees are being trained in the Nurses' Training Schools with all those qualifications. Since there is a shortage of nurses, now we have set up a Faculty of Nursing. So, actually, this requirement will be fulfilled with that. I do not know why they are asking for a Credit Pass for English, which is not a requirement even for Medical Officers or for university education. Anyway, I will look into that matter.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs) Shanthi Sriskandarasa) Okay. Thank you.

Sir, I am very happy to speak in the Discussion on the Votes of my Ministry today. First of all, I would like to thank my Minister and the Hon. Minister of Finance for proposing to set up a new hospital in Nintavur. The name of my village came in the Budget Speech. It is written the Budget Proposals for ever. So I am very happy and I thank my Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne and the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

In fact, after becoming the Deputy Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, I visited all the hospitals in Trincomalee and Ampara Districts with my Director-General for inspection. So far, we have spent more than Rs. 700 million for buildings and equipment needed for both districts. We found that there was a lack of equipment in a lot of hospitals and we have taken steps to support these hospitals. Through the Provincial Council, we have given money and work is being done.

In fact it was pointed out by JVP Members in Parliament that the development of hospitals in the estates has been neglected. Actually, the Government has spent about Rs. 300 million to develop the estate hospitals. In fact, I have sent the Kandy PD and his team along with the team of the Department of Buildings. We have done a survey. We have already estimated and allocated Rs. 3.5 million for estate hospitals in the Nuwara Eliya District. For the Badulla District, we are spending about Rs. 32.7 million and for the Matale District, we are spending about Rs. 10 million for development.

We have been spending a lot of money on the health sector, but still we do not have enough facilities.

. A patient, after an operation in Kandy, had to be taken to the Ashraff Memorial Hospital in Kalmunai due to bleeding in the brain. I called the Director and he said, Sir, we are short of doctors and nurses in the ICU Department. We need trained nurses and doctors. Today, Kandy Hospital needs about 200 nurses and 58 doctors. We are unable to give this number today because there is a shortage of doctors and nurses. In fact, there are about 7,572 nurses following the training courses. By end January, we are getting about 1,200 nurses and 1,200 doctors and around May, June we are getting another 1,200 nurses.

; . , . What DDG (Medical Services) does is, he calls every hospital and finds out what their problems are; the number of doctors they need and so on and he budgets for them. . .

also we have the problem. The village school does not hold the sports meet every year. Because of lack of funds, the principal never bothers to hold the sports meet. Furthermore, parents are more keen on education, they are not interested in sports. It is going to be a challenge for our country again. Within about 25 years, our children will face severe problems.

Today, there is another big problem in Sri Lanka. After smart phones were introduced to the country, children are more keen on them and they will face eye problems like the children in China.

I have many more issues to speak about, but due to lack of time, I table* the rest of my speech to be included in the the Hansard.

I am very happy to work with my Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, our DG, Secretary, DDGs and Directors of the Health Department. I thank you because you are the people who brought this credit to our Hon. Minister and to the health sector today. Because of my Minister's initiatives and his farsightedness the health sector is strong and successful in 2016 and all of us hope to work harder in 2017.

Thank you. : :: Rest of the speech tabled:
