[5.23 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity given to speak on the Orders presented today under Section 14 of the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979.

Before that, I take this opportunity to commend the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and its Minister, the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama and the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, State Minister of International Trade, for effectively identifying key factors and issues pertaining to the development and value-enhancement of homegrown producers and manufacturers in order to better position their products in the international arena, thereby growing our economy.

The first Order presented today is intended to reduce the Export Cess rate on raw rubber from Rs. 15 per kilogramme to Rs. 4 per kilogramme. As is widely known, the export of rubber has been one of the hallmarks of Sri Lankas major exports and foreign exchange earners for the last few decades. However, industry performance in the last five years has not been encouraging. According to the statistics provided by the Rubber Development Department of Sri Lanka, we have witnessed a downward trend in rubber production and exports. Production has reduced from 158,000 metric tons in 2011 to just 88,000 metric tons in 2015. As a result, exports have dropped from 42,600 metric tons in 2011 to just over 10,000 metric tons in 2015 with a year-over-year reduction in exports of over 12 per cent.

Sir, what has occurred since 2011 has been a domino effect which is continuing to affect smallholders and estate planters from increasing their natural rubber production. Global factors such as weakening crude oil prices, promoting the demand for synthetic rubber, drove down natural rubber prices. Decline in natural rubber prices has caused smallholders in major producing countries to switch over to other crops, which led to a slowdown in global demand and large stockpiles accumulated in major consuming countries. This in turn led the rubber prices at the Colombo Rubber Auction decline to the lowest recorded levels in 2014.

However, there is a silver lining in all of this. Our neighbours in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia have all grown their rubber production collectively between 10 to 25 per cent. Hence, as Sri Lanka progresses towards becoming the Hub of the Indian Ocean, it is essential for the Government to ensure that Sri Lanka becomes a serious player in raw material production, specifically in rubber, in order to attain the goal of US Dollars 4 billion in rubber exports by year 2024 as outlined in the Rubber Industry Master Plan.

Sir, to allow for this, reforms with respect to levies and taxation to the industry also must be relaxed in order to incentivize the industry and its stakeholders to operate at optimum levels to ensure a rise in production and therein, exports. This is relevant to the marked improvement in demand for Sri Lankan rubber, driven by the decrease in rubber supply from Vietnam, as a result of the wintering of rubber trees during March to April driving up global prices for fresh stocks in June to July.

Hence, provided that this Order is passed by Parliament reflecting a significant reduction in export cess levied on rubber, it would most definitely allow for a positive upward trend to arise through the benefits of

295 296

2016 05

improving Sri Lankas price competitiveness with the main competitors, especially if this is correctly timed with rise of prices in June and July of next year, which inevitably calls for the reform and rectification of these levies now.

Sir, now I am getting into another subject - beedi leaves. It has been reported that 15 per cent of persons between 18 and 69 are engaged in smoking, and about 30,000 die annually due to tobacco-related diseases. It has been calculated that the Government spend about Rs. 72 billion annually to treat such patients. Further, the World Health Organization has stated and identified that taxation by Government is a good measure to control the use and abuse of tobacco and tobacco-related products.

Hence, given the measures undertaken by His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, we have in recent times witnessed a steady increase in the imposition of taxes and levies on the production and import of primarily cigarettes, owing to price hikes amongst retailers around the country and in keeping with the WHO doctrine towards taxation to combat use.

However, in the past, due to insignificant taxation and regulation, beedi had become a cheaper alternative, being the poor mans fix. This has been further strengthened by the increase of prices of cigarettes, and has led to beedi increasing its market share, being the cheaper option thanks to minimal taxation and regulation. In 2013 alone, beedi commanded 42 per cent of the tobacco market share in volume but its taxation was less than 1 per cent.

Therefore, this Order which revises and increases the import cess rate on beedi leaves will certainly create a significant impact by creating economic barriers against the disposal income of Sri Lankans, which will in turn lead to the reduction of tobacco consumption in the country. For this, I commend the joint action undertaken by His Excellency the President, the Hon. Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and the Hon. Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade and their efforts in this regard.

I thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have five minutes. [5.30p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. I think this is a very important Debate. Most of the Members spoke only about tea and rubber, but nobody mentioned coconut, which we must not forget. About 30-40 years ago, our main export

industry products were coconut along with tea and rubber. As you know, Sir, even in the Sectoral Oversight Committee, I have been arguing and fighting about improving the coconut industry.

What I have to say here is, in the early 90s' or before that, we had coconut products exported. Desiccated coconut was exported. Coconut oil, fibre, charcoal and even coconut ekel were exported. Unfortunately, in the late 80s' and 90s', it took a different turn. Today, it has become an industry where exports have come down very badly. Around 50 per cent of DC oil mills are closed. Coconut oil mills are closed. Sometime back, 20 - 30 years ago, BCC was one of the biggest oil mills in South East Asia. Unfortunately, it is closed today. Billions of rupees were collected in the form of cess and employment opportunities were given. But now every thing has come to a standstill. More than the industry, Sir, coconut plantation has come down.

I see Hon. Presiding Member looking at me. He was also in the Sectoral Oversight Committee when I was arguing. The JEDB, Chilaw Plantations Limited and the Kurunegala Plantations Limited have large estates. In fact, when we were at the Sectoral Oversight Committee, one institution - I am not sure whether it is JEDB- mentioned that they have 12,000 acres of land but only 2,000 odd acres have been planted. This is the situation today. So, we have to reorganize the coconut industry so that we can export all the coconut-based products and get a good income to the country. You will not believe, sometime back, the previous Government imported coconut from India. It was a waste of money. The former Minister who was in that Cabinet is also here. This is the problem we face today. We cannot reorganize the coconut industry overnight.

I come from the Puttalam District, which is in the coconut triangle. I know that the estates of JEDB and the Chilaw Plantations Limited are not maintained properly. Replanting of young plants and rehabilitation of estates is also not done. They have to fertilize the estates annually and it is also not done. They are only plucking coconuts and every estate is running at a loss. Therefore, the relevant Minister should look into this industry where we can strive. Then, like Philippines and Malaysia, we can also export coconut. I have been in this trade. Hence I know the capability of this industry to thrive. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to look into this. If we can improve the coconut industry, we can earn money by exporting coconut and similarly through the cess also.

Another industry which we always forget is salt industry. Today there are many major salterns in Puttlam and Hambantota. Now we have started a saltern in Elephant Pass also. With all that, salt production in Sri Lanka is sufficient. This is a fact. Unfortunately, salt is imported from India for certain products. What I am saying is this. Here we have an industry in which we are striving. I come from the Puttalam District, which produces 40 per cent of the salt needed for the whole country. This year, in addition to salt production in Puttlam and Hambantota, the saltern in Elephant Pass has produced 800 metric tons of salt. So, why is there an

297 298

unwanted importation of salt? What happens is, when we import a certain quality of salt from India in big amounts, our salt gets stagnated. Ultimately, after one or two years, the stagnated salt is sold at a very low price.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Presiding Member, please give me two more minutes.

Therefore, we must look into this matter and take proper action to develop the salt industry in the future.

Everyday we talk about tea; everyday we talk about rubber but we never talk about coconut and salt. These are industries which can give a major income. There are thousands of people employed in these industries today. Like the number of employees of tea and rubber industries, there will be more people employed in industries coming under coconut and salt.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Therefore, by considering salt and coconut industries, we can strive and we can achieve our goal in the future.

Thank you.
