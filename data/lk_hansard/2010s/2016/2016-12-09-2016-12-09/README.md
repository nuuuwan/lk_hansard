[11.01 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, today, what I could gather from all the speeches made by Hon. Members is that everyone wants to have a concrete devolution of power in all the Provinces in order to develop their areas. Thereby it is quite apparent that the rural economy is one of the backbones of the country. But it is unfortunate that the Centre is still holding all the power. So, I hope, in the new Constitution, all the power will be devolved and by devolution of power, probably all the Provinces will be able to stand on their own feet and develop their areas.

Sir, on the 05th of November, 2015 the Hon. Prime Minister delivered his vision and a Policy Statement to this august Assembly that enumerated a platform for the Budget - 2016. The medium-term strategies proposed consisted of generating one million employment opportunities; enhancing income levels; development of rural economies; ensuring land ownership to rural and estate sectors including the middle-class and government employees and creating a wide and strong middle-class. This year, the Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech, outlined that there will be progress in the noble endeavour to strengthen democracy, fundamental rights, reconciliation and development for lasting peace, freedom and national integration and that the country is guided by a new vision of lasting peace built on mutual respect and dialogue and that there will also be an ambitious reforms agenda encompassing all major spheres including social, political, economic and international relations. We need to involve our people, mobilize them, instil some hope to build their confidence and capacity to be able to create a socially inclusive growth.

The rural roads that have been developed had the dominant focus of providing access to the security forces and were specified by them. It helped all their commercial activities in addition to their own movements. However, if we want to improve the rural productivity, we need to have a plan at the village level involving the villagers.

The impact on education, in our villages is so severe that they cannot even converse or write in Tamil. There are no systems that will provide catch up education, so that they could have a fair chance of being included in the society. In the health sector, especially psychological and nutritional deficiencies must be addressed and the impact on the health of women must be clearly understood and addressed. The scale of resettled IDPs are so big that people are not aware of even their neighbours. The resettled communities were not allowed to come together during the past administration. They must be mobilized to form groups to enable them to address their own affairs and to take ownership for their development. We must empower them, hear them out and respond instead of specifying solutions.

The Northern Province is fast becoming a hunting ground for some corrupt Traffic Police. They are now resorting to bribery by intimidating the local community

and cannot even speak the language. This reminds us of the practices adopted several decades ago, which led to youth unrest. The mobility of our people is challenged by these few police officers and such practices must not be allowed to prevail.

There are also intermediaries of trade who are taking advantage of these vulnerable communities which have not been restored or integrated. Therefore, these intermediaries deal with them individually and negotiate for exploitative prices.

The Northern and Eastern Provinces are severely affected by brain drain. There is a lack of capacity in every aspect. These Provinces are forced to deal and negotiate with unequal and privileged partners in building those up. We need a plan to restore that capacity so that we could start taking some meaningful steps in terms of all the good things that have been announced by the Government.

We want the donor community to engage with the local organizations and institutions and get informed of the local view first and then formulate programmes instead of consulting the same old Colombo-centric officers. These officers presided over those institutions during the many years of war and are still working on an autopilot mode, dishing out unworkable and dysfunctional solutions.

Mr. Presiding Member, we need a targeted approach that will allow the local communities to engage and participate in this process by taking up the challenge of social inclusion and job creation. There are a lot of encouraging policy pronouncements that could certainly make a difference and now, there is also space for all the stakeholders to work in a coordinated and cohesive manner. If we are serious about a win-win scenario, this is an opportunity for all to make a great contribution to the war-affected people, the region and the country.

All the wild noises, distractions and politically-orchestrated thuggery must be addressed based on law and order and human rights. Intimidation, convenient interpretation of history and intensions for power, personal glory and wealth can once again leave an unbearable scar on the minorities and on this country. Let us disregard these thuggeries and focus on the simple but important issue of rebuilding the villages and villagers. Let these distractors speak for themselves, showing who they are. It is easy to get trapped in this vicious cycle all over again by being preoccupied with these episodes that have now become an unfortunate characteristic of this country. We have seen and suffered violence in all its forms and some of the current dramas on stage for the entire world to see are all familiar.

We should not be distracted by a few hooligans standing in the way of addressing the needs of the war victims on a mass scale. Let us allow the law to deal with them and see if human rights would be observed and minorities would be treated as equal citizens of this country.

Rural development in the war-affected Provinces is critical at this juncture and turning a blind eye to it and allowing these businesses to continue as usual will seriously affect the people in those Provinces and for that matter, the country. The potential for rural development in the war-affected regions is vast and must be explored as a matter of urgency. Agriculture is one of our main sources of livelihood, cultivating our traditional crops, other crops and leafy vegetables with livestock production being our mainstay. Currently, most of these are produced as a backyard operation due to many reasons. But, there is a lot of potential to improve their production if we approach it in a thoughtful and committed manner.

Fisheries is another important sector for the North and the East. In the past, the livelihood of fishing was decimated, the local people were marginalized and they lost their ability to engage in it in any meaningful way and benefit from that. However, now we believe that there is potential to enhance their contribution to the national economy.

Palmyrah trees of the Northern Province have the potential to support a further several thousand families. There are only a few small industries and there is no chamber of manufacturers functioning in the Northern Province, which clearly demonstrate there is lack of value-addition in those small industries, but potential for growth.

It is time to unblock the challenges that stymied progress. Due to the war and the measures justified as taken for national security, we had numerous challenges in the past such as difficulties faced in free transport of goods to national markets and market cartels, racial discrimination, political and security interference in commercial activities, Central control of permits and policies and health and environmental policies, not having access to technical training and capacity building, inability of the community to gather together, market dumping to affect the price levels and the dysfunctional state sector not responding to business needs. All these and the lack of exposure of the local people to technical and technological advancement have caused the current stagnation and the dominance of backyard farming in the war-affected areas. All these can be addressed now and must be addressed for economic and social advancement. We must give maximum opportunity for these to be rectified and want maximum cooperation form all.

Even the few small industries and the handloom operators lack quality and productivity to be competitive even in the domestic market, let alone becoming a beneficiary of Asias Growth Story. Therefore, their capacity and the quality of the products must be improved.

Freshwater fish production in tanks, reservoir fishing, harvesting of aquatic resources and ornamental fish farming offer a lot of potential for commercial exploitation and must be supported. The Central control of the travel and tourism industry and granting approval

for projects devoid of any consideration for the social and economic environment have also been concerns for the provinces. What is needed is socially, culturally and economically appropriate projects and programmes that will directly advance the socio-economic situation of the people. Projects that promote authentic, eco-friendly tourism have enormous potential for these provinces, particularly for the Northern Province. Just a copy and paste run-of-the-mill hippy tourism industry would not only be economically unsound, but would also be a cultural and social intrusion and must be avoided.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, give me one more minute please.

Each one of these sectors has exceptional potential for economic development benefiting villages, regions and the nation. Nearly 80 per cent of the population in the North and the East are living in rural areas and most of those areas were war-affected.

The Hon. Minister of Finance outlined that social inclusion is a matter of prime concern and the participation of the entire population in the journey for development is a noble objective with that being a society for all. Accordingly, Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion forms the broader theme of the National Budget for 2017. The Hon. Minister of Finance further mentioned, We will formulate a cohesive policy to facilitate an equitable and inclusive level of social development in Sri Lanka. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . .

[2.11p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, it was in 1977 that my father held the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways. In 1978, a new Ministry was created, the Ministry of Lands, Land Development and Mahaweli Development and we saw through that new Ministry a new plan and a new act. Today, again we are talking about new Ministries that have been established and I hope that these new Ministries, like in 1978, will have the vision and the leadership to carry out what the people of this country are expecting in the next few years to come.

Sir, for the first time in the history of this country, the two main political Parties, the UNP and the SLFP, have got together and formed a National Government and people are watching to see what the leaders of these two Parties, especially His Excellency the President and our Hon. Prime Minister, will do. There is a saying, "higher the risk higher the return". Sir, people are also very sceptical. There are lots of allegations and countercharges that have been levelled. I think, 2017 will be the year that will really make this Government a success.

3713 3714

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

I also wish to take a few minutes to speak on the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure. This Ministry is, like in 1978, a Ministry that can really deliver. My Good Friend, the Hon. Harin Fernando is a young Minister, like my father at that time. The new Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure today is like the then Mahaweli Ministry. I think the other Ministers will not get angry with me when I state that it is through this Ministry that you have the opportunity to go into sports, youth, health and medicine - all through information technology. Through the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital infrastructure, we have the opportunity to go into all aspects of life.

I also wish to speak about the National Payment Plan. I think, it is a very good initiative taken by the Hon. Minister. The officials of the Information Communication Technology Agency are here. I wish them well but I also wish to caution them when they proceed with something of this nature. Of course, we are about 10 to 15 years late in terms of implementing something like the NPP. So again, I wish to encourage them and place on record my well wishes to the Hon. Minister and the officials. I wish them every success in their new endeavours.

Sir, I do not wish to take too much time.

( ) (Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka) Hon. Member, do not blame the military for everything that is happening in those areas. If you all are unable to assist the people and develop the area, it is your failure. So, do not blame the military for that. You must know that you are here today because of the military. When the LTTE was in existence in those areas, you all could not do any democratic politics there. So, do not practice the habit of blaming the military for each and every failure.

( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) These are actually lands of our people. These lands have been taken over by the military after the war and our people have been restricted to the Chettikulam area. That is what I am telling you. In the absence of our people, you have taken over the lands.

( ) (Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka) Hon. Member, when there are development projects and when the country is developing, military should also be developed. Development should take place all over the country. So there are a lot of lands being acquired by the Government. Even in the South, a large number of lands are being acquired. You can see that people are losing even their homelands when highways are built.

( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Yes, if there is any development - ( ) (Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka) Let me finish first. The military has to be located everywhere in the country. You cannot say, The military must get out from the North. Then, you all must take some interest and find suitable lands for the military. Military camps will be there all over the country, not only in the North but South, West everywhere.

( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Hon. Minister, this is my time and I want to express my views. My view is, if you take lands for development, we are not going to oppose. But lands of our people have been taken over by one of the military camps at Vattuvahal. Actually that is a land specified for tourism development. If you want to take that land for tourism development, we do not have any objection. But, you are trying to keep -[Interruption.] No, the military is having a separate land in Mullivaikkal. There is a big camp there. But, you are trying to acquire all the lands for the military. That is not the way of handling this problem. That is what I am telling you.

( ) (Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka) Madam Presiding Member, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, what is your point of Order? ( ) (Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka) . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) . . .

Now, Hon. Minister, if you have any questions, I can answer.

( ) (Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka) I have no questions from you. You were trying to instigate communalism here; you were trying to indirectly tell the Muslims that they also must fight against or stand against the Sinhalese and the Army. If you have those feelings, do not try to spread those. You all had been doing it in the past and everybody suffered. In your area, you had no democracy then. When the LTTE was controlling that area, you had no freedom to talk like that. Please remember that.
