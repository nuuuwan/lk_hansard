1983 , . , . [2.03p.m.] () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Mr. Speaker, I am delivering this condolence message to the family of the late Hon. D.M. Seneviratne on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance. I heard that the late Hon. D.M. Seneviratne was an active member of the Ceylon Communist Party and had worked closely with the late Hon. Sarath Muttetuwegama.

The late Hon. D. M. Seneviratne contested the first-ever Provincial Council Election in 1988 and became a Provincial Council Member from the Ratnapura District. He was a Member of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council during the period 1988-1997 and again during 2003-2008. While he was in the Provincial Council, he contested the Parliamentary Election in 1994. He received 41,675 votes, but was not successful in securing a Seat in Parliament. However, because of his efforts, God gave him a chance to serve as a Member of Parliament in 1997. He unsuccessfully contested the Parliamentary elections again.

The late Hon. D.M. Seneviratne continued to practice as a lawyer until his death on 9th September, 2014. He served the people a lot as a lawyer.

Sir, finally I take this opportunity to offer our condolences to his family.

Thank you. [.. 2.06] ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , .. -
