, . : General Observation

The Committee is of the view that during the last few months the conduct of some Members had been unruly, aggressive and hostile. If there will be a continuation of this kind of conduct, there will be an erosion of public confidence reposed in the Parliament and the democratic system of governance. Such a situation might eventually eat into the vitals of the democratic principles and norms. Hence the Committee recommends that stringent measures should be taken to uphold the discipline and to maintain the decorum of the Parliament. Recommendations

i. The Committee recommends that this is a noteworthy matter to be resolved, by a discussion at the Party Leaders Meeting in the interests of the Parliamentary system. If no consensus is arrived at, in considering circumstances under which the uncertainty has arisen, we recommend to hold a fresh counting of vote. (Noted a fresh vote was held.)

ii. When a Bill or a Resolution is presented to the Parliament, the Minister in charge of the subject concerned (including the officials) shall act in due diligence and appraise the House with clarity the nature and the purpose of the Bill or Resolution.

iii. The ringing of Division Bell to indicate the voting of Members must be continued for five minutes.

iv. When voting had been fixed at a particular time, the House shall not commence voting before the fixed time even if the Debate is concluded. The House may be adjourned till the time fixed for voting.

v. At the time of voting, in the absence of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker shall preside and conduct the voting in the House.

vi. Members of the Speakers Panel shall be given a special training to develop their skills.

vii. Officials of the Parliament shall not engage with the Members or any outsider to evaluate or examine the conduct in the House or any other related matter unless there shall be a direction from the Speaker.

viii. Stringent measures should be taken to uphold the discipline and to maintain the decorum of the Parliament.

ix. The existing Standing Orders may be revised appropriately to meet the above-mentioned requirement

CONVOLUTED SITUATION IN SRI LANKA TRANSPORT BOARD ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , , .

(1) Is the Hon. Minister aware that the buses of the Sri Lanka Transport Board, which cover a distance of 1.2 million kilometres per day, while providing transport to 2.2 million commuters daily, generating a revenue approximately of Rs. 69 million per day increased the number of passenger-kilometres they operated by 19.6 per cent in 2015, compared to an increase of only 6.1 per cent by the private sector and provide over 40 per cent of all bus services in the country?

Sir, I would like to refer to the Central Bank Report as well as a newspaper report of May, 2016.

875 876

(2) Is he aware that, according to newspaper reports, the Secretary of the Ministry of Transport has stated that 12,000 employees of the Sri Lanka Transport Board are to be discontinued, that compensation packages are to be worked out for them and that lands and buildings belonging to the 120 depots, which would be reduced to 70, are to be disposed of or to be sold off?

Sir, this statement of the Secretary appeared in the first page of the Sunday Times newspaper a few weeks ago.

(a) Does, the Hon. Minister plan to discontinue 12,000 employees of the SLTB?

(b) If so, is he aware that this would represent the entire administrative, financial and clerical staff of the Board and that a modern organization cannot be run without the administrative, financial and clerical staff of its management?

(c) If this is done, in which case, how does he propose to carry out the essential administrative, financial and clerical tasks required to run transport services and does he intend to privatize the entire SLTB?

(d) Is the compensation to these discontinued employees to be made without adhering to the terms and conditions laid down by law by Parliament, specially on the Gratuity Act and will it be honoured?

(e) Are the lands of the depots to be sold off, leased out or otherwise disposed of illegally, violating all declared policies of the Government as well as the Treasury?

(f) If so, since much of the land of the SLTB is located in urban areas which are easily accessible and therefore of greatest utility for passenger transport services, will their disposal inconvenience the public and together with the problems associated with moving plant and equipment, obstruct the efficient running of the transport network including the provision of night services, school services, extra special services to the villages and special services that are being given today to remote urban areas?

(g) Is the number of depots to be reduced - as announced by the Secretary in his press release which appeared in the Sunday Times, is newspaper - from 120 to 70.

If so, it would be a reduction of 50 depots in the country and what action will be taken to organize a modern transport service?

(h) If so, is the Hon. Minister aware that the number of deports was originally increased because it was found practically that there

was an optimal number of buses for the efficient functioning of a depot, and that reducing the number of depots would increase the number of buses per depot and hence reduce efficiency and that the reduction in the number of depots will obstruct the efficient running of the transport network, including the provision of night services, school services, services to villages and remote urban areas and special services that have always been provided only by the SLTB and no other institution?

Hon. Minister should take action to stop these relevant circulars issued in haste and consider the views of the trade unions and the public commuters of this country.

Thank you. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva - Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation) , . .

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , " " . . . Question proposed. -

, RETURN OF MILITARY-HELD LANDS AND STRUCTURED PROGRAMMES AIMING THE DISPLACED IN THE NORTH AND EAST

[12.39p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

Seven years have elapsed since the end of the armed conflict in the country.

Several hundred thousands of Tamils and others were displaced from their original places of residence in the North and the East during the period of the said armed conflict.

Unambiguous assurances were given by His Excellency the President and others that displaced people would be resettled in their original places. This was stated to be the definite policy of the new Government.

Large numbers of those persons are still prevented from returning to their original homes and to their lands and resuming their livelihood activities/ occupation, primarily due to the fact that the military continues to occupy their lands or due to the fact that though the land is not used, the military has not released the land.

Although some steps have been taken to hand over some parts of the said lands to the original owners, large swathes of land are still occupied by the military, which prevents the owners of those lands from being resettled in their own places, and putting the said lands to productive use.

In addition to the land already under occupation by the military, more lands have been requisitioned by the military, the surveying of

which has led to agitations by the people against Government surveyors and other officials.

Assurances were also given last year that most of the prisoners held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act would be released.

However, apart from around 50 persons released on bail, others continue to languish in prisons under law that the Government has promised to repeal. These prisoners complain that other prisoners similarly held have been released in the past and that there is discrimination against them.

There is no structured programme of action taken to address the urgent and essential needs of the affected people to enable these people to rebuild their lives by providing them with housing and livelihood support. The engagement by the military in economic activities causes immense harm and deprivation to the local civilian population.

Serous prejudice has been caused to people indulging in their own livelihood activity by various extraneous factors, as in the case of Mullaitivu and Trincomalee where fishermen from other districts are permitted to engage in unlawful fishing activity.

There is an urgent need for satisfactory finality in regard to the issue of missing persons.

In the case of Government jobs, persons from other districts are given appointments to all positions even to posts such as labourers, when several thousands of locals remain unemployed. Appointments to Government positions are done purely on the basis of political influence and Tamil youth as in the past continue to be ignored and discriminated against.

There are several actions by the State and its Agencies and others with political influence, pertaining to civilian administration, land, to places of religious worship, to cultural places, to development activities and in other areas of importance to the affected Tamil people, harmful to genuine reconciliation and the future well-being of these people in territories which they have historically inhabited;

It is urged:

(i) That all lands possessed or held by the military in the North and the East be immediately returned to the civilians, entitled to same.

(ii) That a structured programme be implemented urgently to enable the displaced and affected people to meaningfully rebuild and recommence their lives;

(iii) That immediate action be taken to reverse, rectify and redress the several actions that have adverse political, economic, social and cultural consequences to the Tamil people and thereby impedes genuine and meaningful reconciliation, and the evolution of permanent peace in the country on the basis of justice and equality.

That, Sir, is my Adjournment Motion. I do not propose to go into details in regard to the various matters that I have mentioned in my Motion. I will make some general observations. My Colleagues who will follow me will place before the House more detailed information in support of the Motion.

We are, Sir, at an important juncture in the history of this country. Reconciliation amongst the different peoples in the country is the prime need of the country. Reconciliation has become a fundamental need after a long period of injustice and inequality followed by a

921 922

violent conflict which lasted for more than three decades. A change in Government occurred in January, 2015. This change was further strengthened by the formation of a National Government in August, 2015 by the two main Parties. The President is from one party and the Prime Minister is from the other party. The Members of the Cabinet are from both parties. Structurally, the change in Government was the first major step towards reconciliation. All the people in this country contributed towards this achievement

The most affected people, the people most affected by injustice, inequality and violent conflict, the Tamil people of the North and the East, not merely made a very substantial and significant contribution towards the achievement of this change, but did so with certain definite expectations. They expected justice, equality, restoration of their lives and contentment. They expected conditions to be created for genuine reconciliation. But seven years after the conflict came to an end, seventeen months after a new President was elected, nine months after a new Government was elected, they remain a discontented people. In that context, reconciliation in the proper sense is not yet visible.

This is not to say that the Government has done nothing, or that the Government has not done anything, but I do think that much more could have been done in the time that has lapsed to bring about a change to have a favourable impact on the lives of people. I am prepared to accept that the new Governments approach and attitude towards the affected Tamil people is very different from that of the former Government, but it is the Government's actions that have an impact on the lives of the people and it is in the field of action that we see inadequate performance on the part of the Government.

One cannot understand Sir, why lands cannot be released to the people. I met with the President; I met with the Prime Minister. They are all agreeable to lands being released. I want to just refer to a few instances where I have personally observed certain things. I went to Valikamam area at the request of some people of that area. I went around. There are large extents of lands in which there are houses which have been damaged, where after several years much jungle has grown, lands on which people lived, lands on which people farmed, which are not being used by anybody, not even being used by the military. But the people cannot return to their homes, the people cannot return to their lands. Why not? Why should these lands be kept barren, unused, when there are people who own those lands, who can go and live on those lands and put those lands to productive use. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, do you want more time? You were allotted 15 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I have got 15 minutes, Sir. But, I will take more time if necessary. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It is okay. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I went to a place called, Ottahapulam in Jaffna. A large number of Catholic people live in that area. I went there on a Sunday. There was a mass going on in the church.

I met the fathers and the nuns and the brothers who were there. I met the people who were there. People live in different parts of Jaffna, on every Sunday morning, they come to the church for mass. That is their village and they like to see mass in their village. They come to that church from different parts of Jaffna and after mass they returned to wherever they are now having been displaced, some are in camps. Their houses are unoccupied. Their lands are not being used. Why cannot these people return to their lands? Why cannot these people return to their houses? Why cannot these lands be restored? When I was in Kilinochchi some time ago I went to a place called, Paravipanjan. People came and complained to me, Sir, our houses are being occupied by the military. Not even they are using it though they are keeping it in their possession. We are unable to go back to our houses. Please come and have a look. I went there and looked around. Houses are locked up. No one is using them. Not even the military is using them. The houses are not being used by the people. This cannot go on.

We read from the media that His Excellency the President is due to go to Jaffna very shortly in the course of the next few days or weeks. We have also read from the media that His Excellency the President has been having conferences and meetings with both civilians and military officials in regard to the release of lands in the North. I think it is incumbent on the part of His Excellency the President, given his attitude and approach to this whole question, even his commitment to the process of reconciliation, goodwill and harmony among people, that he must take decisions that will result in a very substantial part, if not the entirety of the lands belonging to the civilian population being returned to these people.

I went to Myliddy. People complained to me that they are unable to carry on their occupation there. There is a fisheries harbour there. People want to carry on their occupation. These are industrious people. They are not

923 924

[ ]

2016 10

lazy people. They have never lived on a Governments dole. They are people who lived through their labour. They are hardworking people. Why are you frustrating them? I think the time has come for the Government to take a decision in regard to this matter.

Housing is another big problem. We should discuss things, resolve things regarding the matter of housing. My Friends who will speak after me will go into further details. We must start housing. People must be given houses. When President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the President I went around the Vanni, to about 30 villages, with some of my Colleagues and I gave President Rajapaksa a report in regard to the situation prevailing in the Vanni and requested housing. His response was, "Where am I to go for money? I have no money to build houses." When I was in India, I and my Colleagues, discussed the matter with the Indian Prime Minister and there are 50,000 houses given by the Indian Government to the people of the North. Now the Government is doing something. But, it must be done.

They must be given proper housing. They must be given housing which will last for at least one or two generations, two or three generations. They must be given permanent housing in keeping with their civilization, their conventions, their traditions, and livelihood. What have you done in the matter of livelihood? Have you given the farmers their agricultural equipment? Have you given the fishermen their fishing equipment? Have you given the people who live on livestock development livestock to be able to carry on their activities? Have you started small industries? Agriculture, farming, fishing, these are the occupations of our people. What is being done in these areas? Everything is ad hoc. Nothing is properly coordinated. There is no proper plan for the restoration of the livelihood of these people. We cannot allow this situation to be continued.

In giving Government jobs, Tamil youth were always disregarded, Tamil youth were discriminated against for a long period of time. What is happening now? All the Government jobs in the North and the East are being filled on the basis of political influence. There are Ministers in Colombo who give jobs to their constituents in the North and the East. The Ministers from the North and the East give jobs only to their supporters. Muslim Ministers give jobs to their supporters. Tamil Ministers may give some jobs, not as many as others, to their supporters. Sinhalese Ministers send their people to the North and the East. Tamil youth, qualified youth deserving a job, are not given jobs. Even the vacancies of labourers in the North and East are being filled by other people. This cannot go on, Sir. Political influence cannot be the reason for the denial and deprivation of Tamil youth of jobs. I want to mention something. We have eighteen Tamil Members of Parliament from the North and the East in the present Parliament. Of these eighteen Tamil Members of Parliament from the North and East in

the present Parliament sixteen are from the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, the Tamil National Alliance. Sixteen out of eighteen Tamil Members of Parliament from the North and the East are from the ITAK or the TNA. We command more than 85 per cent of the Tamil representation of the North and East in this House. Can they be ignored? Is this democracy? Is that equality?

I remember, Sir, during the time of the late President J.R. Jayewardene, he distributed 1,000 job bank forms to every Member of Parliament. We all got 1,000 job bank forms. I remember jobs were given in various areas through various Members of Parliament. They were given jobs in the same way and we chose them on the basis of merit, on the basis of qualification and on the basis of acceptability. I am not asking that we be given jobs but, I am asking that our youth be given jobs. It is criminal to deprive Tamil youth of employment in this country. True, we are not a part of the Government. We could have been a part of the Government. But, we and our people are committed not to being a part of the Government until there are democratic and equitable arrangements in the Constitution in regard to the governance of this country. We want to bring about a political solution; we want to bring about constitutional changes that will ensure that democracy and equity prevail. That is why we are not in Government. But, does the fact that we are not in Government mean that you can deny, deprive our youth of their just entitlement to employment?

I think, Sir, there is a duty on the part of the Government. I would have much wished that the Hon. Prime Minister was here. Very unfortunately, at this late hour - lunchtime - he is not here. There must be an affirmative action programme to redress and address this issue of discrimination in employment. I would call upon the Government to kindly place before this House the number of the Tamil youth in the North and the East who have been given jobs after you came into power. I would also call upon you to place before this House figures in respect of the number of Sinhalese youth and Muslim youth who have got jobs in this county after you came into power. Then, the injustice will become apparent and when it becomes apparent, there must be an affirmative action programme in terms of which you will provide sufficient jobs to the Tamil youth who have not been given jobs.

Sir, in bringing forward this Motion, it is not my intention to confront this Government. But it is certainly my intention to raise these issues in such a way that the Government will give its mind to these issues and resolve them. You do not consult us as the Members of Parliament of the North and the East in regard to any matter.

Now, I see from the media that you have great plans for development of the North and the East, that foreign funding is being sought. In fact, there is a possibility of a

925 926

conference being held in Japan very soon where you will receive funds for the development of the North and the East. These funds are being given by foreign donors, foreign agencies and foreign countries to benefit the affected people. They want the lives of the affected people to be restructured in such a way that they will be able to commence normal lives. That is why this funding is being made available. Is it not obligatory on your part to engage in a process of consultation with democratically elected representatives of these people? Is that not your bounden duty?

But, that is not happening; I am not saying that it will not happen. As I said before, we are conscious of the fact that your Government has a new attitude, a new approach but, you are going by default. In your mind, you are having a different attitude and a different approach. What you have in your mind, what you have in your thinking is not translated into action on the ground that has an impact on the lives of people that brings about a change in the lives of people.

Sir, I would like the Government to take note of these matters. My Colleagues, the Hon. Members of Parliament from the North and the East who will speak after me, will refer to many of these issues particularly on land, jobs and prisoners. I have discussed it with the President; I have discussed it with the Prime Minister. They are very favourable to the prisoners being released. Maybe, some of them cannot be released and that is something that we all can understand. But, thus far, despite numerous efforts on our part, despite the prisoners staging various demonstrations and fasts and so on and so forth, about 50 persons have been released on bail but yet another 150 people continue to languish in jail and these prisoners want to know why they are being treated differently. There have been JVP insurgents who have been pardoned and sent home. There have been LTTE cadres who have been pardoned by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government even have been rehabilitated and sent home. Why cannot those prisoners be released?

I want to know, Sir, whether there are some obstacles in the way of the Government functioning. We know that certain people are talking in terms of national security and they think that anything done for the Tamil people will have an adverse impact on national security. National security cannot be secured in that way. National security can only be secured if there is justice, equality and equal treatment of our people.

Even the release of lands, there is a feeling amongst some sections of thinking society that the Government is not acting on account of these imaginary, exaggerated, fabricated fears on the part of some people that if lands are released to the owners of those lands who are Tamil people, national security would be affected. On the

contrary, if these lands are released, those lands will be put to productive use and there will be much greater production in this country than at present and the Government has stated that they will release those lands. So, on the question of lands, on the question of prisoners, on the question of jobs, I want to impress upon the Government that there is no room for delay. There must be action on the question of missing persons. In fact, in an Adjournment Debate some weeks ago, I raised the question of missing persons and I believe that the Government is taking some action now. Many of these matters have been referred to in the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council. You are expected to make your views to the Council which is recommencing its next Session, sometime, next week. On the 29th of this month, the High Commissioner for Human Rights will make his oral report to the UN Human Rights Council in regard to the current situation. Early next year, there will a sitting where there will be a written report. So, I think, these questions need to be addressed. These are not questions which can be delayed any longer. Restoration of justice and equality in the lives of the Tamil people in the North and the East and the commencement of a genuine programme of action towards reconciliation can no longer be delayed. Some of these things that I have mentioned can be done immediately, can be done very early.

I would submit that the Government should not be deterred in taking action in regard to some of these matters by some of the imaginary, fabricated and exaggerated fears that are expressed by people with jaundiced thinking, the thinking that is communal in nature, not intended to achieve unity in this country, but to preserve disunity in this country for their own political reasons and for their own political advantage. The Government, which has been returned to power on the basis of genuine reconciliation, on the basis of inclusivity, on the basis that all people will be treated equally through a new Constitution, will ensure that powers of governance are so structured as to ensure equality. If that happened, probably, many of the things that I am complaining about, would be addressed under that new structure of government. Therefore, Sir, this cannot continue. I would earnestly appeal to the Government to take stock of the situation; kindly consult us; we are prepared to be involved with you in the matter of reconciliation, in the matter of ensuring that the lives of our people are restructured, but please do not delay. Delay is not going to do any good to anyone of us.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. Now I call upon the Hon. S. Shritharan to second the Adjournment Motion. You have ten minutes.

Sir, I must read here the LLRC Recommendation on the National Land Commission. I quote:

The Commission is of view that the Government should expedite action on the establishment of a National Land Commission (NLC) in order to propose appropriate future national land policy guidelines. In formulating land policy, the proposed NLC should include guidelines for the equitable distribution of State land. The Commission regrets to note that although this is a requirement under the 13th Amendment, and a draft Bill has been framed, successive governments - That is including ours.

- have failed to get it passed through Parliament.

So, this is high time. We have converted this Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly and now we are in the process of enacting a new Constitution for the country. When enacting a new Constitution, it is imperative that we must at least implement what is already there in the Constitution. That is, to establish a National Land Commission. So, this prevarication or continuous avoidance of appointment of National Land Commission has resulted in serious difficulties when it comes to the land issues in the provinces. So, there had been a variety of issues.

Sir, I must finally mention an issue. I am sure the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana in his limited time may mention it as well. Sir, we have now introduced a Prescription (Special Provisions) Act.

Let me quote two paragraphs from the Country Reports on Terrorism issued by the US Department of State. This is in respect of the LTTE. It states:

The Group used its international contacts and the large Tamil diaspora in North America, Europe and Asia to procure weapons, communications, funds and the other needed supplies. The group employ charities as fronts to collect and divert funds for its activities.

This is from the Country Reports on Terrorism - 2015. , .

Let me quote another paragraph:

Additional LTTE Members were arrested in Malaysia and India in 2015, one of whom was accused of exhorting other Sri Lankans to fund and revive the LTTE.

, . ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Member, I would like to - ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, please do not take my time. You may respond in your speech. Let me speak. -[Interruption.] You can respond in your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) What is the date of the Report? ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) It was issued in 2015. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) It was in 2009. ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) I am referring to the Report issued three weeks back.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) You want the LTTE? We do not want the LTTE. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) Not me. I quoted the Government of the United States. It is not my idea. I do not want the LTTE. I dedicated my life to defeat the LTTE. I never cohabited with the LTTE like you all. Please bear that in mind.

[2.53p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella - Minister of Higher Education and Highways and Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon. Presiding Member, our Ministry, the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, has been doing some work silently in the North and East, particularly with regard to roads. The rest of the country got several, I would say thousands of kilometres of roads from an ADB Programme. It is called, "iRoad Programme" and the North and East was left out of it. I think each electorate got about 70 - 80 kilometres of iRoads from the ADB-funded Programme except the North and East. The ADB officers are coming in two weeks' time to Sri Lanka. We have already discussed with the local ADB directors and I am glad to inform you that when they come this time we will confirm an ADB Programme for roads for the North and East. The North will get 1,500 kilometres of carpeted roads and the East will get 900 kilometres of carpeted roads. Not only the North and East, Uva was left out and they will also get; Gampaha and Colombo will also get.

We have written to the Members of Parliament offering money. I do not know whether you have got the letters. Did you get my letter? I have written to all the Tamil MPs from the North and East offering them money to do up roads. -[Interruption.] We have offered them money because they went through a 30-year old war. They have serious problems. Colombo District in the Western Province will be getting an iRoad Programme this year .

Then, with regard to the higher education sector, I would like to mention that we have allocated large sums of money. You may be aware that we have increased the Budgetary allocation for Higher Education by nearly 50 per cent. So, for the development in the Northern Province, we have allocated Rs. 2.361 billion as capital grant for 2016. We have allocated Rs. 1,000 million for the establishment of the Engineering Faculty in the University of Jaffna. Then, under a JICA project we are going to establish a Research and Training complex with six labs including a processing training unit for meat processing, dairy processing and food processing; research and training farm including a special unit and new equipment will be supplied for the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Jaffna.

Then, the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training will establish a Technical College with the help of GIZ. This is same as the German Technical College in Ratmalana, which is a very esteemed organization. For this, the total fund is Euro 8.4

965 966

million. This is to train young people in their skills. I think they will open it next month.

Then, plans are underway to upgrade Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan Academy of Fine Arts in Jaffna as a separate institute under the name of Sir Pon-Ramanathan Institute of Performing Arts in the University of Jaffna to honour the great national leader. Then, under capacity building in special research grant, we are allocating Rs. 41 million.

With regard to the Eastern Province, we have allocated Rs. 22.2 billion as capital grant for development in 2016. The Faculty of Engineering of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka was supported by Kuwait Government for the development of buildings and to pay a special incentive allowances for senior academic staff in the Faculty of Engineering. A luxury bus for the Faculty of Engineering of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka has been provided. University Industry linkage cells will be developed with GIZ. Then, there is a separate allocation for eight staff quarters.

So, these are basically some of the things that are lined up for the next year. We all know that the people in the North and the East went through the most difficult period in the last 30 years. The new Government is conscious of that. Of course, there were very serious problems. I would call it serious but when it comes to issues like devolution it will need a great deal of discussion. But with regard to infrastructure and other social liabilities, the new Government is committed to help the North and the East.

Then, with regard to jobs, in my Ministry, I have given all the jobs in Jaffna to the Jaffna MPs to be given to their people. I have not sent a single person from Kandy or Colombo to work either in the North or in the East, not even in Ruhuna. In the South, I have given all the jobs to the Southern MPs; in the North, I have given all the jobs to the Northern MPs; in East, I have given it to the Eastern MPs; in Sabaragamuwa, I have given it to the Sabaragamuwa MPs. Otherwise it is really not worth, because even if you send people from here, they cannot live in that area. After one or two months they will come back.

Sir, I do not wish to speak at length. Briefly that is what we have in mind for the next year. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Douglas Devananda.

Mohamed Navavi)Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

Before speaking on this Adjournment Motion, I would like to go back to twenty or twenty five years in the past to remind you of an incident where 120,000 people were chased out of the North. They were forced to leave the North within two hours only with what they were wearing. So, they were unable to take even their jewellery with them. With only Rs.2000 in hand, they were asked to leave the North within two hours. Through Wilpattu, they reached Puttalam in dire straits, leaving everything behind. The people of Puttalam - Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils - all got together and welcomed these people. From then onwards, we have been looking after these people for the last twenty years. That was the situation. These disturbances were started by them and today, we have to settle this issue on their behalf.

1013 1014

It was a pathetic scene. Those people had nothing. In fact, I would like to remind you of one incident. There were two lorry loads of refugees coming from Jaffna. This incident that I would like to tell you is about a young couple who had been married for two or three years. On this particular day, the husband got into one vehicle and the wife was in the other vehicle. When they reached Puttalam, the husband asked the wife, Where is the child?, and wife said. I thought you had brought him. There were so many such incidents that happened on that particular day.

But after twenty years, what is happening now? Out of these 120,000 people who came to Puttalam, 40,000 people have become permanent residents in Puttalam today. So, now there are 18,000 to 19,000 registered voters in Puttalam. Eleven thousand people voted at the last Election and I am happy to say that out of those 11,000 people, 9000 voted for the present Government. Apart from that, another 20,000 to 25,000 people are living in the other parts of the country and 15,000 to 20,000 people have gone back to Jaffna, Mannar and other areas. But still there are 15,000 to 20,000 people who want to go back. They want to go back, but very unfortunately they are not allowed to go back. The moment they go back, people start criticizing my leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, saying that we are trying to encroach lands in Wilpattu.

Sir, I am from the adjoining electorate. Therefore, I know very well that these people who want to go back after 20 years, are going back to their own lands. During the last twenty years, that area has become a very thick jungle and this is why certain politicians in the North and communal-minded people from the South are always shouting at our Hon. Minister. In fact, Hon. Minister clearly showed that there had been seven or eight mosques, two churches and many schools in that area. The main reason as to why these people cannot go to those areas is because the politicians do not want these people to go there.

Further, the Government is trying to resettle these people but unfortunately they are unable to do so. Similarly, when we talk about Jaffna, I would like to remind you of the fact that when the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen was the Minister of Resettlement, he resettled almost all the Tamil people in Manik Farm. That was his way of doing things. But very unfortunately, he is unable to resettle his own people in his Electorate.

Now, when we talk about Jaffna, there were 2,000 families who were chased out and now it has gone up to 7,000. Of that 1,100 families have been resettled - 750 in Jaffna, 250 in Kilinochchi and 100 in Chavakachcheri. But only 185 houses have been handed over to them. The rest of the people find it difficult to go back because up to now their lands have not been given, their business

establishments have not been given and their own houses have not been given. This is the situation in the North today.

When we talk about Mullaitivu, earlier there were 2,350 families to be resettled but now it has gone up to over 6,000. Two years ago, there was a land kachcheri at Mullaitivu where 1,550 people applied for resettlement. Out of that, 904 applications were accepted but, nothing has been done so far due to some problems created by the politicians there. These 905 people had their own lands; their own houses and they had their own shops. Very unfortunately, up to date these people have not been granted what they own.

Further, they have started the Indian Housing Scheme. Pookulum is a Sinhala village. From that village too, all the Sinhalese people were chased out. They have been living in Puttalam. Now, when they try to go back, they still face the same problem. This problem is faced not by only one community, but by all: by the Sinhalese, Muslim and Tamil communities. The Indian Housing Scheme, I am sorry to say, has neglected the Muslim community living in Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Mannar. In fact, sometime back, we had a lengthy discussion with all the MPs of the North. In Parliament, we requested the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, the Leader of the Opposition to consider these cases so that all these problems can be solved. Out of all those people who had been living in the North and the East 20 years ago, now only a section is prepared to go back. Therefore, what I say is, we must safeguard and look after all the communities. I know the Tamils have a problem. Similarly, we also have the same problems.

Sir, this country does not belong to one community. All three communities must be able to live together peacefully in the future. That is why we changed the Government. We changed the dictatorial Government and today, we have formed a Government of major and minor communities working together. We must all get together and live peacefully in this country.

Thank you very much. [5.38p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Sir, I thank you for allocating time for me to speak on the problems faced by the people of the North and the East. I represent the people of Jaffna and Kilinochchi. There is no doubt that there are numerous problems faced by people of these districts, which are similar to what the people of other districts in the country are also facing. However, there are certain specific issues in the Northern part of the Island due to the 30-year war, which disrupted normalcy and livelihood.

1015 1016

[ ]

2016 10

Now, after the war, we are striving hard to return to normalcy. After more than three decades of civil war and millions of bitter memories, people of the North are now enjoying the dividends of peace and freedom. I believe that the process of solving problems can start only when all stakeholders agree on the issue that there are problems and that they need to be solved. As an Hon. Member from the North and as a person who work with the people of the North on a day-to-day basis, I have come to understand certain specific problems, which I personally feel needs to be solved on an urgent basis. I believe that that may not only help people to return to normalcy, but also for their voices to be heard and for their concerns to be understood. We are here to help and work with them to reintegrate and reconcile.

The most pressing issue among the people is the issue of resettlement of the internally displaced people. Most of the people of the North and the East were displaced during the three decades of war and most of them have been living in welfare camps, some in rented houses and in relatives' houses. They were not displaced six years back, but nearly 30 years back. Around 1,300 families are still living in these welfare camps with no proper housing, sanitary facilities and no livelihood. Most of them in the welfare camps are from the coastal area and hence, their livelihood was fishing. They have been staying in these welfare camps for the last 30-odd years without any livelihood and slowly the quality and standard of life of those communities are deteriorating.

Sir, in the Jaffna District, at the start, the total extent of the High Security Zone was, 27,259.31 acres and since 2009 till now, totally, 20,408.40 acres have been given back to the public. A balance of 6,850.91 acres is still to be released, which nearly accounts to 2.36 per cent of the total area of the Jaffna Peninsula. This 2.36 per cent is peoples' private land, not Government land, which needs to be handed over back to the 9,680 families.

However, I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President and the security forces for expediting the resettlement process since taking over office in January, 2015. When His Excellency the President visited Jaffna in December, we were able to show him the plight of the IDPs in the welfare camps and he genuinely understood their problems and promised to resettle them within six months. There is fresh hope among these people and they are eagerly waiting. I am happy to learn that the President has already made arrangements to solve the issue and will soon announce the resettlement plan.

Also connected to this issue of resettlement, I would like to state that the armed forces stationed in the North and the East are in surplus compared to the number of population living there and the military camps are among the residences of the people. I am deeply saddened by the incident that happened recently at the Salawa Army Camp

and convey my deepest sympathies along with my people to the innocent civilians who suffered losses. If such incident happens in the North and East, the disaster would be massive and unbearable. Therefore, I humbly request the officials to make arrangements to move these armouries, not only in the North and East, but everywhere in the country, to safer and isolated locations, which would not endanger the civilian lives.

Sir, when we talk about bringing normalcy to these war-torn areas, special attention should be given to the plight of the political prisoners and their families. Although a step-by-step initiative has been taken to free them, the action seems to be very slow and needs to be accelerated. Those who have been detained for a long period could be granted amnesty on humanitarian grounds.

The people from the coastal areas must resume their livelihoods in accordance with their choice. Their livelihood is at stake right now with the Indian fishermen using our resources, even damaging the future growth potential of our resources. However, our Government has reduced this compared to the previous years, but still, a complete stop needs to be put to this, otherwise this will erode our fishing community. The federation of the fishermen must be encouraged to enhance their lives and their childrens education.

The Hon. Prime Minister has assured one million jobs to the youth in the near future. I appeal to him to allocate a substantial ratio to those who were rehabilitated and released to the society. Sir, I believe that a major Government-driven employment programme should be undertaken to absorb all the rehabilitated ex-LTTE cadres and war widows into government jobs, private jobs or by creating self-employment opportunities to solve their economic necessities, which would ensure normalcy and national security in the future. The civil society and the private sector should also be enabled to play a dignified role in providing livelihood options to these communities in the North and the East as a priority. The problems and challenges faced by these rehabilitated cadres, widows and orphans in the war-torn North and East are a burning issue. Their livelihoods have to be prioritized when projects are implemented in these districts.

We must take account of the total available vacancies in these districts and compare those with that of the other districts and if there is a difference, we have to bring it to an equal level for them to function normally. But, the unemployment ratio in the North and East is on the increase. Considering this matter, action has to be taken to fill the vacancies with suitable persons, so that unemployment would be brought under control. Recently, there has been a rising number of educated youths idling and without proper guidance connected with illegal and violent crimes. If those vacancies are being filled with these youth, the present rising violent incidents,

1017 1018

particularly in the Jaffna District, will, no doubt, diminish.

Drug consumption is a terrible menace to the community in the North. If the youth were settled with proper employment and a proper hope of life this sort of violent addictions would be easily eliminated.

Hon. Presiding Member, agriculture has always been the main source of income of the civilians in the North. Action has been taken to encourage farmers to use organic fertilizer and do away with pesticides and chemicals. More and more people are going back to farming in the North. A little encouragement from the Government would help unemployed youths also to join farming. Re-implementation of the discontinued pension scheme would also ensure safety to these families.

However, it is learnt that the tobacco cultivation is to be discontinued in the near future and the farmers who are engaged in the tobacco cultivation may be facilitated with some new crops to be cultivated. Sir, when potatoes and onions are imported during the time of harvest in the North our farmers are at a disadvantage in marketing their products. By the time an increase in the tax is made the harvest is already spoiled. This has been continuously happening in the past years even after informing the relevant officials. I believe having a fixed time to increase tax coinciding with the harvest in the North would encourage farmers from avoiding these crops because of the risk. Also a mechanism for preserving these harvests is also essential.

Thandikulam Economic Centre would facilitate farmers from all the provinces to market their products and thus the uncultivated lands will be fully used for cultivation. This is according to the President's plan of making Sri Lanka becoming self-sufficient in food. I believe, a time similar to the agricultural revolution created by Madam Srimao Bandaranaike earlier could be created again by President Maithripala Sirisena, a President who knows the values of agriculture and is from a farming family.

In the Jaffna Peninsula, there are no major developments with regard to water supply. The septic tanks and soakaway pits constructed in sandy areas are often close to domestic drinking water wells. The quality of ground water is getting worse in Jaffna, especially in Chunnakam, because the area is polluted and contaminated due to the oil spill. The extraction of ground water also creates intrusion of salt water. Iranamadu option or any other option to provide water to the Jaffna Peninsula has to be initiated very fast.

Hon. Presiding Member, while bringing your attention to some of these issues as immediate concerns of the

people in the North, the way I feel and understand, I would like to take this opportunity to specifically thank and mention with sincere gratitude His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister for expediting the process of resettlement. I believe the official resettlement statistics may also speak for what has been done so far. We believe that the remaining work will also be done in an expedited manner under the guidance of His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister. We all want solutions and I believe that many of us would agree that most of the issues are related to the day-to-day problems faced by the people of the North. I would like to take this opportunity to invite the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the Members of the TNA to work together with our Government in the journey to solve the problems. Together, we can do more and deliver faster.

Going forward, I believe that we should look beyond these immediate issues, which must be solved in the short term, and plan for the future with a real strategy in line with the Governments vision which is to be implemented in the medium and the long term. I believe that the real issues we need to solve are the socio-economic problems of the people which are linked to education, income, and occupation. Solving issues related to these factors with a long-term strategy may create a sustainable and positive impact on the society and the economy as a whole and I believe it is what we need. Unemployment is a major cause that can create social unrest and it is the youth who suffer from it. Our history has taught us good lessons, both in the South and the North, on what damage such unrest can create. So, it is our duty to solve these problems in a sustainable manner.

Hon. Presiding Member, for generations we have looked up to the first world countries and have always wanted to be like them and be one of them, but it has mostly been about catching up with them. I believe that trying to replicate the models that brought success to them is not the way forward. I do not believe that we can achieve those dreams by doing what they did 30-50 years ago or by working only with our traditional industries. We need new strategies, new models, new industries and we need to plan ahead today and find success in our own way.

I believe that we are now in the era of fourth industrial revolution and I also believe that the economic power is now slowly shifting from the West towards the East. Digital revolution, the power of connectivity and integration have created new frontiers and are continuing to create many new industries and business opportunities. Unlike the previous industrial revolutions, the fourth revolution is evolving at an exponential rate. The possibility of billions of people from different continents connected through mobile devices, great processing power, access to knowledge and their markets are amazing. This has the potential to create new

1019 1020

[ ]

2016 10

opportunities for countries like Sri Lanka and become an important player in the service industry as a provider to knowledge-based industries. We must prepare the country, our people, infrastructure, education, policies and framework by thinking of these future possibilities. I decided to talk about the future for the specific reason that we cannot suddenly become an attractive place for investors and industries to come and set up their businesses in the North or other part of the country.

Sometimes, the problems that we, the politicians, think as the problems of the youth, the next generation, may not be what they are actually facing. Why do educated people migrate? Why do we have more and more young people preparing to leave the country immediately upon completing their education? The educated people from our region have left and are still leaving the country after tertiary education. It is a loss to the economy. The Government invests massive amounts of money to educate them up to the secondary, tertiary level and when they migrate to foreign countries due to lack of opportunities initially or partly due to war and it is those countries that harvest the benefits. We must increase the living conditions, create new opportunities, facilitate new businesses and try to understand why those educated people are leaving and then find solutions to make them stay. Once people are educated, the first thing they want is a good job or a livelihood to lead a comfortable life. I believe that educated people do not want to restrict themselves from growth if opportunities are not available in this country. Opportunities can be created through economic growth. We need to grow and we can grow faster with new industries and new knowledge. We must invest in equipping people with the knowledge that is in demand. Sir, I would like to make a proposal here. If we can agree that we need to plan for the future, and if we can agree that future industries will be built on new technologies and new knowledge, the first thing that we need to do is equipping and empowering todays new generation with new knowledge and skills.

We discussed about the infrastructure. We discussed about the resettlement. We discussed about the other pressing issues that require solutions in the short-term. Let us also discuss about a long-term plan and implementation.

As we all know, the North is known for its academic excellence over several years in the past. Now it is almost history. But, now we have to recreate the same record. We must be proud of the educational institutions for the role they played in the development of the North and their contribution to the growth and education of young people in the North. Consequent to the war, quality of our education has become very low and education culture has deteriorated. We need to pay attention to academic areas of studies and the sense of identity that young people develop as students. Some of the educational institutions are defunct, have not resumed and still they are in the

High Security Zones - for example, Palalay Training College. After the end of the war, the students of Jaffna and Killinochchi are highly motivated to receive vocational education. School leavers and students who are not selected for higher education are highly interested to follow vocational courses. However, our people are thankful for taking steps to establish a branch of Ceylon German Technical Training Institute in Killinochchi by the President in the next month. This would enable us to build capacity and skills for future industries.

However, still there are no adequate institutions to accommodate all the applicants. The solution is to establish more technical colleges in these areas. I take this opportunity to thank the Hon. Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training for initiating discussions to start another technical college in Thenmaradchi area, after I brought this to his kind notice.

Sir, to create knowledge-based industries, properly developed infrastructure is important so that the threshold resources could be met. It would be great if you can create new options and opportunities as many as possible even for the students who are not fair enough in their secondary education. If someone drops out of the education system after completing school without being selected to a university, there should be an option for him to learn, earn and become successful in life.

If the country's infrastructure and socio-economic indicators are improved, there could be a better living condition. Good education is in demand by the industrialists. They may generate better jobs for the youths and when they get a better income it may reduce migration. These are all interconnected but it has to be done systematically. Invest today for a better tomorrow. Solving of day-to-day problems only may not give sustainable results.

Thank you.

[6.25p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. First and foremost, let met thank the Hon. R. Sampanthan, the Leader of the Opposition, for moving this Adjournment Motion which has given an opportunity for all of us to discuss various grievances and issues that we are facing in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces.

Sir, as you are well aware, almost for three decades, 1983 - 2009, due to conflict situation prevailed in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and its peripheral areas, its populace had economically been starved. More significantly, we have been tragically compelled to lose our livelihoods, assets and hundreds of our family members. The infrastructural, physical and structural facilities of many villages and towns were badly damaged and one such town of the Eastern Province which was badly affected was Eravur, which is my hometown. Public and civil properties were affected. For example, the Eravur Police Station was overrun by terrorists and burned to ashes; public market, Eravur Town Council building and the library had totally been destroyed. The entire town of Eravur was considered as a refugee camp and there was a standstill in all our day-to-day activities much more so compared to other towns in the District.

Furthermore, we were deprived of development in every aspect and we were forcefully pushed backward. With post-conflict development, as normalcy has now been restored and good governance is now in effect, we hope that we can be a great strength to His Excellency the President and to the Hon. Prime Minister in their sincere efforts to steer the country towards political stability, improve our economy with sustainable development and bring back glory to our motherland.

Hon. Presiding Member, many matters have been discussed here. Many of our lands are occupied by the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. Although they say demilitarization is taking place, still those lands are not released. At this juncture, we intend to develop the affected areas and have identified many aspects on a priority basis. One such aspect is the relocation of the Eravur Police Station to a more suitable premises and release the current property to its owners. For over 25 years, the Eravur Police Station has been utilizing private properties for its use. The police station, barracks, officer's quarters and police car park are located there. One such property occupied by the Eravur Police belongs to Aligarh Central College, a burgeoning National School in Eravur, which is currently in dire requirement for more space in order to provide further facilities for its students. Actually, this contiguous

land to the school is currently occupied by the police is a dire need for this school. Therefore, Sir, the police, civil society organizations, the Local Authority of Eravur and general public have come to a mutual conclusion that it is imperative to relocate the police station to another suitable property with ample amenities can be offered to the officers in one large complex to serve the needs of the populace. Thereby, they can release the land to the school and other properties to the relevant landowners.

. , . . , 2016 Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management consolidated budget Amalgamation of Rugam and Kitulwewa Tanks project . project .

This augmentation not only increases the extent of cultivable lands up to 25,000 acres, but will also enable the farmers to cultivate the entire extent of paddy lands in the Batticaloa District in both Yala and Maha Seasons as well as to cultivate various other crops such as fruits, plants and vegetables whilst developing poultry and livestock in the rest of the cultivatable areas, which will enhance the National Food Production Programme 2016-2018 of His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena. Further, it is going to help us in climate resilience improvement along with mitigation of floods, which has been recurring every year during the monsoon season due to lack of proper water management. This facility will also provide drinking water for more than 200,000 people in the District.

Having said that, let me thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion and now, it is time for breaking our Ramadan fast and this very moment I am hoping and praying with conviction for our communities would reach a meaningful solution for all our grievances and the plight we all have undergone.

Let me also thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for giving us an opportunity and by moving this Adjournment Motion and he has paved a platform to place all our grievances. Before, I conclude let me say that this has given us an opportunity like a trial as if the North and the East are going to be merged.

Thank you very much.

[6.37p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I am happy to follow my Friend, the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana, who made a case for the merger of the North and the East. I hope his sentiments will be duly regarded by his Party, the Sri

Lanka Muslim Congress, of which he is the only Hon. Member in this House and the United National Party, which is leading the Government, as we discuss in the Constitutional Assembly, a permanent solution to the national question that has afflicted this country since Independence.

In the last Parliament, we often used Adjournment Motions such as the one we are debating today - the situation in the North and East - to air the grievances of areas that had to recover from the war devastation. At those times, we wondered or we hoped for better times, times when the then Government would not be in office any longer or would change their mind and become progressive and that it will not be necessary for us to come to this august Assembly and speak of all of these grievances again. When a change came in January last year and then followed by the fullness of that change in August last year, we thought we have turned the pages and now it will not be necessary to air our grievances in public like this since we were also close partners who brought about that change in government. This Government is called the "Government that is implementing the principles of good governance".

As the Mover of the Resolution, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition stated earlier in the day, "We definitely see a change in attitude from earlier times, but translating that change of attitude into action seems to be lacking" to the extent that the two speakers who preceded me, both of whom are part of the Government, were heard to complain about the situation in the Eastern Province. Both of them - one Hon. Member is from the Batticaloa District and the other is from the Ampara District - stated, although they are Members of the Government, that the North and the East have been neglected and that there are several issues that remain to be resolved. Sir, it is sad that we have to urge the Government in a debate such as this, but, in a sense, we are exercising this privilege - we have democracy to be able to speak with frankness and tell the Government now of the various issues that we have brought to their attention before making them public.

The issue with regard to the release of lands was a crucial factor. Last year, at the Presidential Election or before that during the campaign, there was a definite promise that was given that all of the private lands will be released to the people - to the owners - for their resettlement. In fact, the intention of the Government was clear. In that, they moved in that aspect and released certain extents of land, both in the North and the East, but one-and-a-half years later, today, as we look back, we find that this is grossly inadequate, that so much more could have been done in a very short time.

In fact, our expectation was that all of these should have been done within the 100-day Programme of the Government which started in January, 2015. Unfortunately, after one-and-a-half years, more than 70

1033 1034

per cent of that land that has been illegally occupied by the security forces still remain within the domain of the security forces.

Similarly, if I am to highlight one other issue, is the issue of prisoners. I am highlighting that only for the reason that again a solemn promise was given in October last year; that before the 7th of November that a majority of these prisoners would be released. However, even to-date that has not happened. So, it is well and good for the Government to say the right things as it did on the 14th of September, last year in the UN Human Rights Council when the Hon. Foreign Minister spoke and he was applauded for his frankness for the vision that he revealed to the world of a new Sri Lanka, an inclusive Sri Lanka, and itemized the reforms that this Government would bring about in this country.

"Baby steps" have been taken and we do not deny that. But, they remain "baby steps". When a baby begins to walk, everyone applauds; people are happy that the baby is now standing up, taking the first few steps. Even if it falls, then it stands up; people are happy. But after two or three years if the baby is still stumbling, still falling down, still only taking baby steps, then there is something radically wrong with that and that is what we find with this Government and that is why, today, it has become necessary for us to urge the Government to pull their socks up as it were and move and deliver seriously on the promises that they have given to the people of this country more than anybody else and also to the international community at large.

Our people are frustrated naturally because you cannot keep promising them all the time and not delivering on those promises and therefore, this is a clarion call today to the Government to please speed up what they started doing in respect of all these matters that my Colleagues have spoken today. They have enumerated the difficulties that our people face in the areas of their occupation, in the allocation of jobs, in the fishing industry where people of other districts and from other countries invade our space and make it impossible for our fishermen to make a living. One example is, recently six persons who did not speak a word of Tamil were appointed as labourers at the Jaffna Kachcheri. Is that just? Are there not many thousands who are jobless in those areas? Even to grades such as this, somebody who could be walking to the office from nearby places should be recruited. But, from far away places, from other districts, people are being sent. Now our people have naturally started asking the question as to whether there is any change at all. They are asking us, Is there any difference between what we had to endure during the last Government and under this new Government? They know that there is change, there is a sense of freedom, there is relaxation of various measures that were imposed by the previous Government.

All that they are aware. But, it must move on; it cannot stay there. Peoples lives must be rebuilt. They must find their feet. They must be able to carry on with their living, make their own livelihood and live with dignity. That is still not possible for a majority of people who have suffered as a result of living in those areas in which violence ravaged for three decades or more.

So, Sir, the Ministers who spoke today told us about various projects that they were implementing. We are thankful for all of that, and yet, we found all of them wholly inadequate to deal with a special situation of recovery from war devastation of three decades. There must be special attention with special programmes if those people are to get back to normal living, and we urge the Government to consider this very seriously, to take us into confidence. We have supported the change. We have supported this Government. We voted for the last Budget Proposals with this Government giving the Budget Proposals a two-thirds majority. But as can be observed, we are unable to continue to give that kind of unconditional support any more and we know the reasons. So, it is time that the Government takes this seriously and our appeal to both the President and the Prime Minister who, we know, intend well, to make the necessary changes, to bring about some kind of structural arrangements.

It is not enough to tell the Hon. Ministers in charge of various subjects to consult us and work with us because that does not happen. The Hon. Minister for Resettlement was complaining bitterly that the Hon. Mavai Senathirajah has said that it is not possible to work with him and he said, Hon. Senathirajah said that without foundation. It is with foundation; it is for good reasons that those sentiments were expressed. We have not lightly made these complaints. So, when these complaints now start emerging from us, we appeal to the Government to please take this seriously. If you want to actually realize reconciliation in this country, actually make a change, turn over a new chapter, have a new Sri Lanka where all the people live in contentment and with pride that they are Sri Lankans and do not have a sense of grievance that they are being discriminated against, then, the right attitudes that you bear in your mind must necessarily be translated into action. And, this is a golden opportunity and we ask that you do not flitter it away. It is a golden opportunity because we, on our part, representing our people with the mandate of our people, are willing to give that assistance to the Government, give whatever necessary to achieve that goal. The Constitution-making process is proceeding.

But at the same time, all of these day-to-day issues must be addressed, redressed and people must regain that confidence that in a new Sri Lanka which the new Government has promised, things will be different, that it will not be like before, that we will truly be able to proudly say, We are Sri Lankans, that all the different peoples of this country will have their different identities

affirmed and given its due place, powers shared amongst the different peoples in such a way that mere majoritarian rule will not be the order of the day; that everyone will have a share, everyone will be able to actually use the sovereignty that is vested in the peoples of this country.

I thank the Hon. Presiding Member for granting me this opportunity to speak at the end of this Debate and conclude my speech.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you.
