Very unfortunately, at this late hour - lunchtime - he is not here. There must be an affirmative action programme to redress and address this issue of discrimination in employment. I would call upon the Government to kindly place before this House the number of the Tamil youth in the North and the East who have been given jobs after you came into power. I would also call upon you to place before this House figures in respect of the number of Sinhalese youth and Muslim youth who have got jobs in this county after you came into power. Then, the injustice will become apparent and when it becomes apparent, there must be an affirmative action programme in terms of which you will provide sufficient jobs to the Tamil youth who have not been given jobs.",

Maybe, some of them cannot be released and that is something that we all can understand. But, thus far, despite numerous efforts on our part, despite the prisoners staging various demonstrations and fasts and so on and so forth, about 50 persons have been released on bail but yet another 150 people continue to languish in jail and these prisoners want to know why they are being treated differently. There have been JVP insurgents who have been pardoned and sent home. There have been LTTE cadres who have been pardoned by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government even have been rehabilitated and sent home. Why cannot those prisoners be released?",

There must be action on the question of missing persons. In fact, in an Adjournment Debate some weeks ago, I raised the question of missing persons and I believe that the Government is taking some action now. Many of these matters have been referred to in the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council. You are expected to make your views to the Council which is recommencing its next Session, sometime, next week. On the 29th of this month, the High Commissioner for Human Rights will make his oral report to the UN Human Rights Council in regard to the current situation. Early next year, there will a sitting where there will be a written report. So, I think, these questions need to be addressed. These are not questions which can be delayed any longer. Restoration of justice and equality in the lives of the Tamil people in the North and the East and the commencement of a genuine programme of action towards reconciliation can no longer be delayed. Some of these things that I have mentioned can be done immediately, can be done very early.",

The Government, which has been returned to power on the basis of genuine reconciliation, on the basis of inclusivity, on the basis that all people will be treated equally through a new Constitution, will ensure that powers of governance are so structured as to ensure equality. If that happened, probably, many of the things that I am complaining about, would be addressed under that new structure of government. Therefore, Sir, this cannot continue. I would earnestly appeal to the Government to take stock of the situation; kindly consult us; we are prepared to be involved with you in the matter of reconciliation, in the matter of ensuring that the lives of our people are restructured, but please do not delay.

The rest of the country got several, I would say thousands of kilometres of roads from an ADB Programme. It is called, \"iRoad Programme\" and the North and East was left out of it. I think each electorate got about 70 - 80 kilometres of iRoads from the ADB-funded Programme except the North and East. The ADB officers are coming in two weeks' time to Sri Lanka. We have already discussed with the local ADB directors and I am glad to inform you that when they come this time we will confirm an ADB Programme for roads for the North and East. The North will get 1,500 kilometres of carpeted roads and the East will get 900 kilometres of carpeted roads. Not only the North and East, Uva was left out and they will also get; Gampaha and Colombo will also get.",

They were forced to leave the North within two hours only with what they were wearing. So, they were unable to take even their jewellery with them. With only Rs.2000 in hand, they were asked to leave the North within two hours. Through Wilpattu, they reached Puttalam in dire straits, leaving everything behind. The people of Puttalam - Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils - all got together and welcomed these people. From then onwards, we have been looking after these people for the last twenty years. That was the situation. These disturbances were started by them and today, we have to settle this issue on their behalf.",

Eleven thousand people voted at the last Election and I am happy to say that out of those 11,000 people, 9000 voted for the present Government. Apart from that, another 20,000 to 25,000 people are living in the other parts of the country and 15,000 to 20,000 people have gone back to Jaffna, Mannar and other areas. But still there are 15,000 to 20,000 people who want to go back. They want to go back, but very unfortunately they are not allowed to go back. The moment they go back, people start criticizing my leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, saying that we are trying to encroach lands in Wilpattu.",

I believe that the real issues we need to solve are the socio-economic problems of the people which are linked to education, income, and occupation. Solving issues related to these factors with a long-term strategy may create a sustainable and positive impact on the society and the economy as a whole and I believe it is what we need. Unemployment is a major cause that can create social unrest and it is the youth who suffer from it. Our history has taught us good lessons, both in the South and the North, on what damage such unrest can create. So, it is our duty to solve these problems in a sustainable manner.",

I do not believe that we can achieve those dreams by doing what they did 30-50 years ago or by working only with our traditional industries.

Why do we have more and more young people preparing to leave the country immediately upon completing their education? The educated people from our region have left and are still leaving the country after tertiary education. It is a loss to the economy. The Government invests massive amounts of money to educate them up to the secondary, tertiary level and when they migrate to foreign countries due to lack of opportunities initially or partly due to war and it is those countries that harvest the benefits. We must increase the living conditions, create new opportunities, facilitate new businesses and try to understand why those educated people are leaving and then find solutions to make them stay. Once people are educated, the first thing they want is a good job or a livelihood to lead a comfortable life. I believe that educated people do not want to restrict themselves from growth if opportunities are not available in this country. Opportunities can be created through economic growth. We need to grow and we can grow faster with new industries and new knowledge. We must invest in equipping people with the knowledge that is in demand. Sir, I would like to make a proposal here. If we can agree that we need to plan for the future, and if we can agree that future industries will be built on new technologies and new knowledge, the first thing that we need to do is equipping and empowering todays new generation with new knowledge and skills.",

The infrastructural, physical and structural facilities of many villages and towns were badly damaged and one such town of the Eastern Province which was badly affected was Eravur, which is my hometown. Public and civil properties were affected. For example, the Eravur Police Station was overrun by terrorists and burned to ashes; public market, Eravur Town Council building and the library had totally been destroyed. The entire town of Eravur was considered as a refugee camp and there was a standstill in all our day-to-day activities much more so compared to other towns in the District.",

One such aspect is the relocation of the Eravur Police Station to a more suitable premises and release the current property to its owners. For over 25 years, the Eravur Police Station has been utilizing private properties for its use. The police station, barracks, officer's quarters and police car park are located there.

One example is, recently six persons who did not speak a word of Tamil were appointed as labourers at the Jaffna Kachcheri. Is that just? Are there not many thousands who are jobless in those areas? Even to grades such as this, somebody who could be walking to the office from nearby places should be recruited. But, from far away places, from other districts, people are being sent. Now our people have naturally started asking the question as to whether there is any change at all. They are asking us, Is there any difference between what we had to endure during the last Government and under this new Government? They know that there is change, there is a sense of freedom, there is relaxation of various measures that were imposed by the previous Government.",
