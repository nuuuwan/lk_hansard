I move, "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."

Hon. Speaker, we are presenting an important part of the financial regulations, an important law to regulate the financial institutions of this country. Today, the financial institutions are not confined to large banks or even to

finance companies. There are a large number of financial entities, private financial entities and non-government entities functioning in this country from the national level to the local level and I find that the laws in respect of banks, finance companies and even the microfinance companies are not sufficient. It has led to a lot of speculation and a lot of exploitation of the consumer in this country. If you look at the finance companies, about 11 or 12 finance companies have collapsed in this country causing a lot of loss to the investors, the depositors and a lot of middle-class and lower middle-class people have lost their money as a result of the inability to regulate the finance companies sufficiently.

The same has applied at the village level to ordinary people, who have lost money in the microfinance companies due to non-regulation. On the other hand, we find large-scale financial conglomerates coming up at national level. If we do not regulate them properly, they will become a threat to the country because they can manipulate the economy. We see that happening already in the capital markets, in the stock markets where a few people are trying to manipulate the markets and my policy so far has been, not to tell them what they are doing. You found recently everyone was talking of the collapse of the economy, but in fact, the measures we are taking will have a stronger economy and all of a sudden the same people who said, The economy is coming down, we need not invest in Sri Lanka. are turning around to invest in the country. All of a sudden they have forgotten the issue that we are going to bring in the Capital Gains Tax on share transactions and now they find it attractive even to invest in the countrys share market. That is one aspect of it.

We are dealing today with the microfinance. There were a large number of pyramid schemes in the country. We have heard of them and somehow or other the specialty for all these pyramid schemes seems to be they have come from Tissamaharama and Hambantota. I do not know what the reasons are, but the biggest pyramid schemes came in from Hambantota and Tissamaharama areas. It may also have been that we were not applying the law. We failed to apply the law; either the regulating authorities did not pursue these matters or the police did not investigate. But, today - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) . . , .

. I think in Batticaloa also, where there are unsuspecting people, there have been problems.

I do not want to talk at length. What we are doing by the legislation is this. Initially, microfinance non-governmental organizations have to be registered under the Voluntary Social Service Organizations (Registration and Supervision) Act, No.31 of 1980. So, these are non-governmental organizations. Then, what we seek to provide in the different chapters are as follows. If you want to carry on this business, you must be licensed as per Clause 3- Licensing requirement to carry on microfinance business. The procedure is there and the Schedule gives the conditions. In the Schedule we have restrictions on business carried on by microfinance companies. We deal with management of licensed microfinance companies in Part III of this Bill and directions to and rules governing licensed microfinance companies are given in Part IV. Then, Part V is on financial statements and audit of licensed microfinance companies and Part VI is on examination and supervision of licensed microfinance companies. Then, the most important part is Part VII which deals with cancellation of the licence and winding up of licensed microfinance company. Finally, we have the last two provisions, namely, Part VIII which deals with microfinance non-governmental organizations and Part IX which deals with principles, strategies and guidelines laid down by the Board.

What has happened so far has been the exploitation of a large number of unsuspecting people by the microfinance companies and we have to bring that to an end. I hope this legislation will be the first and the most important step in this regard. There will be other legislations that we will have to bring in. But, I would first ask this House to give its consent to passing this legislation and once the legislation is passed, we will look at what else is necessary. There have to be a whole series of new laws that have to come in to the country, as I mentioned earlier, from the Banking Act itself to microfinance and the control of microfinance.

The grassroots economy is an important part of our country and we have to strengthen the grassroots economy. Especially in todays development, when the large-scale investments are coming, it has to be matched with a strong local economy which creates jobs. The way the technology is developing today, you may find robotics and automation taking place in the largest investments. So, where do you find employment? That has to come to

the grassroots, to these service organizations, to the small organizations.

In addition to this, I will be asking the House to look at our proposals on the Grama Rajya also as to How w how to establish the Grama Rajyas and the Grama Rajyas must also have a role to play in regard to strengthening the village economy. This must go hand in hand.

The other measure that we are contemplating is small and medium enterprises. The jobs will come from the grassroots economy, from the small and medium enterprises. The large enterprises are needed and they have to bring in the investments. They have to create the market. But the job creation sometimes may not depend on the large investments. It will have to be in the small and medium enterprises and the grassroots economy. So, we have to ensure that there is a strong grassroots economy and in bringing the Grama Rajya legislation, if the House so requires, we can give the proposals first to the House and then bring in the legislation. But, today I have presented here the Microfinance Bill which was prepared earlier and I hope the House will give us support to pass this Bill.

As regard to the Grama Rajya system, I would like to have your views.
