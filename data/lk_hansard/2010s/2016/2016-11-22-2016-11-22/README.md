Speaker, I am pleased to present the Report of the Committee on Public Finance on Assessment of the Fiscal, Financial and Economic Assumptions of the Budget 2017. The Report has been tabled, Sir. I wish to say a few words with regard to this Report since this is the first Report this Committee is presenting.

We were mandated by the Resolution to present this Report within four days of the presentation of the Budget.

411 412

Although the Committee worked without a Parliamentary Budget Office this year, we are indebted to the service rendered to us by a few individuals - Dr. (Mrs.) Anila Dias Bandaranaike, Mrs. Rose Cooray, Mr. Themiya Hurulle, Mr. Sarath Mayadunne and a team of economists working through Verit Research headed by Dr. Nishan de Mel - who gave their invaluable input and assistance without any remuneration.

I have highlighted one or two matters in the introduction. We were given a set of figures on the 2nd of November, which later turned out to be not the basis on which the Minister of Finance presented his Budget. Thereafter, on the 12th of November, another set of figures were given to us, and now we have based our Report on that new set of figures that have been given to us. We have recommended to the Government to distribute the second set of figures that were given to us on the 12th of November to the Members, which is not published as yet. We find that the Estimates in the Red Books do not accord with the actual figures by which the Ministry of Finance is working. Therefore, we have recommended that those figures, which we have called figures of 12th of November, 2016 be circulated to all Members of Parliament at least during the Committee Stage Discussion.

Thank you. . . Ordered to lie upon the Table.

, : , : RESOLUTION BY UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, this in response to the Question raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena on 28th October, under Standing Order No. 23 (2).

Sir, Sri Lanka is a Member of the Executive Board of UNESCO along with 57 other member countries. On 13th October, 2016, among the proposals placed before the Executive Board was one that was introduced by seven sponsors - Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Sudan. These proposals which deal with the Al-Aqsa Mosque/Al-Haram al-Sharif and its surroundings, the Ascent to the Mughrabi Gate in Al-Aqsa Mosque/Al-Haram ash-Sharif and so on were considered to contain contentious and controversial elements, on which the 58 Members of the Executive Board of UNESCO could not reach consensus.

We are very aware of the position taken by the State of Palestine in this matter. However, there were concerns pertaining to the nature of the language that was used, including concerns that the sites were referred to only in their Arabic names. These reasons meant that there were divisions in the positions of the Members of the Executive Board. As you are aware, Sir, even the Director-General of UNESCO, Madam Irina Bokova expressed concerns stating that, I quote, Jerusalem is the sacred city of the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam. To deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site...

Sir, we in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan people, know very well the destruction, the loss and the pain caused by conflict. Just as much as we want to try to ensure that such violence does not recur in our country, this is the message that we want to give to the world. We yearn and strive today to build a nation that respects all cultures, all religions and all beliefs, not a nation that merely tolerates diversity, but a nation that truly respects all cultures, all regions, all beliefs and upholds everyones dignity.

Having seen the devastation of conflict, Sri Lanka stands firmly for dialogue as the means for resolution of conflict. Therefore, Sir, Sri Lankas position is that issues pertaining to Palestine and Israel too, should be resolved through dialogue. Resolutions of this nature that relate to the preservation of cultural and religious heritage too, therefore, should be framed and formulated in a manner

431 432

that helps resolve problems and not in a manner that could cause further stress and strain to the communities concerned or to already complex issues through divisive action and positioning.

Sir, as you know, UNESCO is an organization that stands for peace and understanding in the world, an organization which promotes understanding and respect for each others cultures, traditions, religions and beliefs. The Constitution of UNESCO states, Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.

A Resolution of this nature, to us, did not seem to help find a solution to the issues concerned. This is why Sri Lanka decided to abstain on this particular vote. It must be noted, Sir, that Sri Lanka did not vote against the Resolution. There are allegations that Sri Lanka succumbed to the pressures exerted by the United States and Israel. That is absolutely incorrect. In fact, no country has lobbied us to adopt the position that we did on this particular issue in UNESCO. UNESCO stands for peace and the promotion of peace, understanding and respect for each others ways, cultures, traditions and religions. Accordingly, Sir, Sri Lanka wants to see UNESCO being used as a forum for the promotion of peace and understanding and for approaching issues in a manner that helps resolve them through peaceful means and not through divisive means that can add to already complex situations. Reaffirming our commitment to the principles of UNESCO, we, in fact, received the Director-General of UNESCO, Madam Irina Bokova in Sri Lanka this year.

The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena has also asked whether our decision to abstain means that the Government has abandoned or reversed Sri Lankas long-standing policy of support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people or whether the Government has abandoned or reversed Sri Lankas long-standing Non-Aligned foreign policy.

First of all, let me assure this House that Sri Lanka has not changed, reversed or abandoned this countrys long-held position of support for Palestine.

Along with Sri Lanka, 13 other Non-Aligned Movement Members in the Executive Board abstained on the said Resolution. This includes India and Nepal in our region. As this House is aware, India is a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, and India is also home to the third largest Muslim population in the world. In fact, more members of the Executive Board of UNESCO abstained than supporting this particular Resolution.

This issue has nothing to do with NAM. Sri Lanka remains a member of NAM and Sri Lanka has not abandoned its Non-Aligned stance. In fact, I believe that a strong policy of Non-Aligned Movement is to refrain from action that would further aggravate already complex issues, but to strive to resolve such issues in a manner that is peaceful, and in a manner that would ensure a durable solution.

Hon. Speaker, Sri Lanka stands firm in its support for the Palestinian cause. Successive Governments of Sri

Lanka have maintained support for the just cause of Palestine and solidarity with the Palestinian people for their struggle. As this House is aware, the Palestinian Declaration of Independence proclaimed the establishment of the State of Palestine on the 15th of November, 1988 and Sri Lanka, almost immediately after that - three days later, on the 18th of November, 1988 - recognized the State of Palestine

The cause of the Palestinian people and commitment to the Palestinian cause has been a consistent and core feature of Sri Lankas Foreign Policy, maintained by all Governments since then. The National Unity Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe upholds and continues this policy.

The Embassy of the PLO was established in Sri Lanka in 1975. In 1976, the Palestine-Sri Lanka Solidarity Committee was founded. With formal recognition of the State of Palestine in 1988, the Embassy was renamed the Embassy of the State of Palestine on the 6th of February 1989.

Mr. Yasser Arafat visited Sri Lanka during the tenure of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and he was honoured as a Head of State. President Mahmoud Abbas visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2008 and once again in 2012, and President Rajapaksa visited Palestine in January 2014.

In 2007, Sri Lanka established a Representative Office in Ramallah and appointed a Resident Representative to the State of Palestine and this Office continues to function there even today.

A Sri Lankan Parliamentary delegation headed by the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Hon. Rajitha Senaratne, visited Palestine from 10 - 13 October this year.

In fact, our friendship is as strong as ever. Just last week on the sidelines of the Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, I had the honour of having discussions with the Prime Minister of Palestine, Hon. Rami Hamdallah and Palestine's Ambassador to the United Nations in New York, Dr. Riyad Mansour. We had the most cordial and friendly discussions. I can assure you that the relations between Palestine and Sri Lanka is as strong as ever.

Mr. Speaker, Sri Lanka has always supported Palestine in multilateral fora through successive Governments.

Sri Lanka has chaired the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs of the Occupied Territories for over three decades since its inception in 1968. Sri Lanka has chaired this Committee without a break, through successive Governments. In fact, when I met Prime Minister Hamdallah he again thanked Sri Lanka for our support by chairing this Committee. Sri Lanka has thus been a significant voice in the UN consistently on the violation of human rights in the occupied territories.

In 2011, Sri Lanka in fact supported Palestine joining UNESCO as a full-fledged member. In 2012, at the UN,

433 434

[ ]

2016 22

Sri Lanka supported the Resolution granting Palestine non-member Observer Status in the UN. Sri Lanka continues to support full membership for Palestine in the UN.

In September 2015, Sri Lanka voted for the Palestine-sponsored Resolution in the United Nations in support of non-member Observer States being allowed to raise their flags at the United Nations Headquarters, alongside the flags of member States of the United Nations, thereby supporting Palestine to raise its flag at the United Nations Headquarters.

In fact, . .

Every year, Sri Lanka supports approximately 15 Resolutions in the United Nations related to Palestine. , . * , .

Additionally, this year, Sri Lanka also expressed support for Palestine's membership in the World Trade Organization - WTO - and INTERPOL.

Mr. Speaker, Sri Lanka's principled support for the Palestinian cause remains, as you can see, steadfast and unchanged. Sri Lanka has consistently called for a negotiated solution resulting in a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognized borders, side by side, and at peace with Israel, as endorsed in the Quartet roadmap and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.

The decision to abstain on this particular vote in the UNESCO Executive Board is by no means a change of Sri Lanka's position on Palestine. In fact, as stated earlier, Sri Lanka wholeheartedly supported Palestine obtaining membership in UNESCO and we have done so ever since.

As you are aware, Hon. Speaker, the former President and current Member of Parliament of this House, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was the first Head of State of this country to visit Israel. He visited Israel on 8th and 9th of January 2014.

This did not mean that Sri Lanka abandoned its position on Palestine. This Government too will not abandon Sri Lankas support for Palestine and the Palestinian people.

The visit to Israel undertaken by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is considered as a high point in Sri Lanka-Israel relations. President Rajapaksas visit contributed to strengthening relations between Sri Lanka and Israel too. The National Unity Government continues to build on this relationship. As recognized by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as well, Israel is an important country in the world, with advanced

technological knowledge and expertise in areas that can be helpful to the people of Sri Lanka and in our journey towards economic progress. There are many areas of cooperation such as agriculture, agricultural research, solar energy, water management and horticulture that can be explored. In fact there is ongoing defence cooperation between the two countries, and over 6000 Sri Lankans are currently working in Israel with more employment opportunities in the future.

As this House is aware, the President of Israel just concluded a very successful State visit to India, a country that is home, as I said earlier, to the third largest Muslim population in the world, from 14 to 21 November.

Maintaining good relations with Israel does not mean in any way that Sri Lanka has abandoned Palestine or the Palestinian cause. Sri Lanka cannot have enemies. Sri Lanka cannot afford to quarrel with other countries. We should position ourselves in this world as a nation that stands for peace, reconciliation, democracy, human rights and the preservation of a rules based international order.

It is very unfortunate that some sections with hidden agendas try to use and manipulate issues of this nature to drive wedges between people and communities in our country. They try to arouse emotions and fear, misleading and misguiding people, and thereby attempting to create situations to militate against the Government.

Hon. Speaker, I urge my Colleagues in this House to refrain from engaging in cheap theatrics when it concerns Sri Lankas relations with the world. We are today seeking peace and reconciliation, and we must embody that spirit of peace, and that spirit of reconciliation, in word and deed when dealing with the international community as well. This is what we seek to do and we will, at all times, act in the best interest of the people that we represent.

[1.54p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Mr. Presiding Member, it is my privilege today to participate in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Education. I am happy to note that the Hon. Minister of Finance has allocated in the Budget almost three times the allocation made in 2014, but this allocation of Rs. 90,000 million for 2017 reflects a reduction of the sum allocated in 2016. As the Hon. Minister says, the reason is that the Ministry of Education had underspent the full amount allocated last year. But the response of the Hon. Minister of Education was that the Treasury had failed to release the total amount of money on the due date. In view of this, I think the Ministry of Education should not be penalized since in the overall situation it will be tantamount to punishing school-going children. I would propose that the Hon. Minister of Finance move a Supplementary Estimate with a view to allocating the full amount requested by the Minister of Education.

505 506

2016 22

I am happy to note that Rs. 5,000 million has been allocated to provide basic facilities to 1,000 schools in the country. What about the rest of the schools? They might feel discriminated. Therefore, please extend such basic facilities to all the schools irrespective of linguistic differences.

The allocation of Rs. 5,000 million to rent a maximum of 50 computers each to strengthen IT facilities in 3,500 schools is also commendable as much as providing Tabs to Advanced Level students and teachers.

The existence of 100 private schools including international schools will help boost education among 150,000 students. Although this would help lessen the burden that the Government has to shoulder in the field of education, I must also emphasize that charging of exorbitant fees from students by these international schools must be monitored and regulated.

I observe that Rs.250 million has been allocated to upgrade 25 schools in the plantation sector, but there must be a rationale adopted to upgrade all other estate schools as well so that they too would enjoy the benefits. The concept of this is that education facilities must be provided equally to all school-going children.

As a senior Member of this House representing the Colombo District for nearly 23 years, I would now like to turn my attention to the educational facilities provided to schools in the Colombo District. While pointing out the shortcomings in the facilities for education in all schools in Colombo District, I would particularly pinpoint the shortcomings prevailing in Muslim schools. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe will now take the Chair. , . , , . Whereupon THE HON. KANAKA HERATH left the Chair, and THE HON. SHEHAN SEMASINGHE took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you may continue. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) As per the recent surveys conducted by All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference, All Ceylon Federation of Muslim League Youth Fronts and other educational bodies, the standard of education and facilities provided to Muslim Schools in Colombo leave much to be desired. As a result, the educational attainment of children in these Muslim schools falls far below the standard achieved by students in other schools in the Province.

Nevertheless, philanthropists like Al Haj Z.A.M. Refai, Chairman of Zam Gems, Haji Elyas Kareem, Chairman of EAM Maliban Textile (Pvt) Ltd and Dr. Fazli Nizar of All Ceylon Moors' Association, the World Memon Organization and the Serendib School Development Foundation have from time to time come forward to help Government to ease its burden by providing school buildings, laboratories, libraries et cetera for a few selected schools.

Schools which have served the community for 50 or 100 years, like the Muslim Ladies' College, Fathima Girls College, Khairiya Muslim Girls College, Hameed Al-Husseini College and Al-Hidaya Maha Vidyalaya have been beneficiaries of such benevolence in the recent past.

The Darus Salam Muslim Maha Vidyalaya which was originally named as "Denham School" is located in the highly populated Maligawatta area. As one who began the political career as a Member of Maligawatta Ward representing the Colombo Municipal Council, I am committed to provide every facility to this important educational institution as it would help the poor and the underprivileged in the area to keep abreast with the educational facilities enjoyed by the rest of the children in Colombo.

With this laudable objective in view, I took great pain to mobilize the well-to-do in the community to raise the standard of educational and curricular activities of this school. The response had been very encouraging. The World Memon Organization and the Serendib School Development Foundation have agreed to donate Rs. 250 million for the development of this school. We have drawn up a master plan with the approval of the Ministry of Education of the Western Provincial Council. The whole project is programmed in keeping with the requirements of the regional engineers, the School Development Society as well as the Old Boys Association. I too have allocated a sum of Rs. 1 million from my personal funds to make this project a reality. I put up a four-storeyed building in Muslim Ladies' College at my expense.

These two organizations have helped the College by spending Rs. 14 million for a new building with a computer training centre, a fully-fledged teachers resting room and with the payment of monthly allowances to seven voluntary teachers. Apart from these, conducting of extra classes to help the Ordinary and Advanced Level students and providing facilities for the development of sports activities were also included in this project.

I speak at this moment with a heavy heart, deep sorrow and with emotion. Should someone sabotage our well-intended project? I was born and bred in this place. I have a duty by the people of this area. I have a passion to provide the best facilities to the poor children of Maligawatta and raise the standard of education so that they would be equal to any other students coming out of more advanced schools in the capital city. I could not develop this school due to underworld interference in the

507 508

school. Even the building that was constructed by me and former MP, Mr. M.M. Zuhair was not even officially opened by us. Now, I have got the chance of bringing this school to a very high standard with the help of the World Memon Association and the Serendib School Development Foundation.

When the above project was to be executed, a certain politician in order to gain undue popularity had suddenly descended in the area to sabotage my scheme of work. Attempts have been made to suddenly bring this school under the new scheme "Langama Pasala, Hondama Pasala". I strongly objected to this move. There are various other schools like Al-Hidaya Maha Vidyalaya which could be brought and improved under the "Langama Pasala, Hondama Pasala" Concept. Hon. Minister, I brought this to your notice and you could not help me because of the pressure brought upon you by your Party member. So, I do not blame you.

I raise this important matter and appeal to you to reconsider your decision and spend that money to a school like, Al-Hidaya Maha Vidyalaya, so that the girls in Colombo Central will have a fully-fledged first class school. I sincerely hope that the Minister of Education would take serious note of this problem and allow us to implement our proposals for the welfare of Darus Salam Muslim Maha Vidyalaya, Maligawatta. We are prepared to even deposit in advance a sum of Rs. 100 million with the Department of Education in the Western Province to be spent for this project.

I must also point out at this stage of the existing vacancies for Moulavi teachers throughout the island. This matter is greatly agitating the Muslim community. Without proper religious guidance, no community could attain educational standard. There are a large number of Moulavis and Moulavias in the country who are waiting to fill these vacancies. From the time our Government came into power, we have been requesting the Minister of Education to fill these vacancies.

Sir, an ugly situation was created recently as a result of some misguided elements accusing that Madrasas and Quranic schools are spreading extremism.

This is completely a twist of the real situation that deliberately intended to spread hatred and misunderstanding among our sister communities. Like Pirivenas, Dhamma Schools, these Quranic Schools and Madrasas teach the Muslim children nothing but pure Islam based on the Holy Quran and the Sunnahs of the Holy Prophet. I know for certain that learned men from abroad have been invited from time to time to lecture at these institutions and nowhere it is recorded that they are propagandists of extremism. At a time when our "Yahapalayanaya" is making a steady progress in the path of reconciliation to build up a strong society based on goodwill and brotherhood, I strongly condemn the most irresponsible statement by these quarters who are definitely trying to sabotage the well-intended governance of this administration.

Therefore, I urge the Government to take firm action to put a stop to propaganda made by these anti-social elements and dispel the fears that are currently engulfing the Muslim community in various parts of the country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon.Gnanamuthu Srineshan. You have 19 minutes.

You have only two minutes. Please try to finish your speech in two minutes. [5.50 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Actually, I must thank the Minister, Hon. S.B. Nawinne, for the work that his Ministry has done in the Puttalam District. Similarly, I must thank the Hon. Minister of Education and the Hon. State Minister of Education for the wonderful work that they have been doing. I can remember, during the previous Government, under the programme for development of 1,000 secondary schools, we got only five schools. But after the present Minister took over, under " the closest school is the best school" concept this time we have got 39 schools, out of which we have started developing 13 schools. This shows the improvement in education in our area.

Especially I want to mention about the Puttalam Zone, where we have 203 schools. I think this is one of the biggest education zones in the whole country. My leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, has already made a request in this regard. Sir, we get the same facilities as

589 590

2016 22

other smaller zones, because the facilities given to this zone are divided among 203 schools. Therefore, I have given a proposal to take four AGA divisions in the Puttalam Electorate - Puttalam, Vanathawilluwa, Mundalama and Kalpitiya - under one zone and the balance to go under Anamaduwa. Especially, Puttalam and Anamaduwa are backward areas. Actually you have given us more than what we require. We are very happy. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me one more minute.

Last time I spoke about the shortage of teachers. I am very happy to say that you have filled 75 per cent of the vacancies. I remember I spoke about the Advanced Level teachers. Of course, you have promised that you would look into that. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me half a minute.

In the morning, the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake spoke about the education of Muslim ladies. I assure you that they are being educated. In fact, when you go to most of the offices, you can see Muslim girls, wearing fardha, working in many offices . Therefore, in no way, can their education be stopped. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much. The nest speaker is the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana. You too have only four minutes. [5.52p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Thank you, Sir. First and foremost let me commend the Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and the Hon. Radhakrishnan for introducing reforms that are targeted at ensuring zero dropouts, mandatory education for 13 years and expanding the options for students to continue their higher education with focus on science and technology, based education creating an abundance of multi-faceted and skilled individuals ready to take on tomorrow.

Secondly, let me commend the proposal to introduce a regulatory body towards monitoring and overseeing private and international schools to ensure that their curricular and standards are aligned with the governments expectations to ensure that our children receive the very best.
