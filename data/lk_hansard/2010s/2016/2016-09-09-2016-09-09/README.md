RATIFICATION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT

[11.35 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) I move,

"That the Ratification of the Paris Agreement on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in New York on 09th May, 1992, which was presented on 07.09.2016, be approved.

(Cabinet approval signified.)"

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am happy that the Members of this House are taking a keen interest on this matter and I think it is my duty to explain why we asked for a change at the Committee on Parliamentary Business to bring this forward.

Global climate change has really captured our attention in the last few decades. In 1992, the United Nations adopted the framework on a Convention on Climate Change. But the problem was having agreed to the Convention, countries could not thereafter agree on the steps to be taken. I mean, in 1992, I was the then Minister of Industries and Scientific Affairs. You can just imagine how long it has taken for the countries across the globe to come into an agreement.

The fact is that some of the developed countries did not want any caps on emission or any controls because they felt that their own development will be affected. We are all aware that in the last two centuries the industrial revolution and the rapid developments of the world economies; the World War II; the use of atomic weapons; the testing on nuclear weapons and all those have made a significant impact on the global climate change. Therefore, the climate change, the range we expect of 1.5 C - 2 C, is getting exceeded. Even in Sri Lanka, as I mentioned yesterday in my speech, there is a threat that even the waters of Mahaweli can get affected and also our tea industry. It is in this background that there were a number of meetings held, but even the last one in Copenhagen also ended without any agreement despite the efforts that were made. Many countries were looking at their own self-interest. Is it possible for a country to develop fast, have rapid development while controlling its level of emissions? So, it is a question of how powerful the lobbies were in different countries; whether it be in India, China or America and we are happy that Europe and Japan took the lead on these matters. Nevertheless, at the Paris Climate Talks last year, there was an agreement reached. I will not say that we are 100 per cent satisfied with it but it was a great leap forward and now the process of ratification has started.

The ratification requires 55 countries with 55 per cent of the global emissions to agree to ratify the Agreement

for it to come into force. While the countries have agreed, these are still issues in some of the Western countries and also in some of the developing Asian economies. Whilst they should agree to these provisions to restrict emissions, these are some of the major issues that are coming up and that will occupy the centre stage in the forthcoming elections in the Western countries this year and next year. In such a background, it gave us all encouragement when the President of the United States and the President of China - President Obma and President Xi - agreed prior to the G20 Meeting that both countries are going to ratify this Climate Change Agreement.

In that background many countries and many Parliaments have now decided to go ahead and ratify the Agreement. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, President Maithripala Sirisenas election manifesto ensures that we take all necessary measures to protect the environment. That was agreed to by all the parties that supported President Sirisena and the President himself has taken over the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment and taken many measures to go ahead. Therefore, for us it is important that that be clarified. As far as Sri Lankas development is concerned, we also have an ambition of rapid economic development. It has to be one that is environmentally friendly. If I put it in another way, I do not know whether the Opposition will agree, it is going to be a very "green" development economically. We will talk about the political one later.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You can talk about it tomorrow. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe)

Yes, we will talk on that tomorrow. This country has to move forward being environmental friendly. The Government has already approved the Sri Lanka Sustainable Development Bill. It has been sent to the Provincial Councils. I would like to ask the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government also to ask them to expedite it. Then we may be able to debate and pass that Bill also this year. Then we can look at the other measures that are necessary to be taken in accordance with the Sustainable Development Council that has been prepared on the lines of the Canadian Sustainable Development Council. Canada is one of the countries in the forefront of protecting the environment. Once we have the Sustainable Development Council, Hon. Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife will then be able to bring before this House the necessary plans.

So, in this background, we want to ratify it quickly in order to ensure that at least by the time the UN General Assembly meets, there are enough ratifications or commitments to ratify that and the Agreement will come into force before November this year. We discussed this matter with President Maithripala Sirisena and he himself

467 468

2016 09

pressed for this Accord. We must also place on record the contributions made by President Hollande of France in putting the Paris Agreement together.

In this background, we felt that we should ask the Parliament to ratify this Agreement immediately because when the President visits New York for the UN General Assembly - that will be the last UN General Assembly meeting with both Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the US President Barack Obama who took the initiative in Paris Talks - he should be in a position to announce it.

This week is the last week in which this House is meeting before the President leaves for New York. Therefore, I spoke to the President and he informed the Cabinet to go ahead and pass this on Friday. The President himself could not be available here. He is in Jaffna to participate in two ceremonies there, which are important. That is a part of the reconciliation process. While he is playing a major role, he is unable to be here. But we are moving this and I must thank both Sides of the House for agreeing to support it. We hope that as soon as the Provincial Councils send us their observations on the Sri Lanka Sustainable Development Bill, we will be able to bring the Bill also into the House and then look at the other measures that will be necessary thereafter.

Thank you. . . Question proposed. [.. 11.43]

Paris Agreement is a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate changes by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Centigrade or best below 1.5 degrees Centigrade. The Agreement is due to be effective in 2020.

The Paris Agreement is a bridge between todays policies and carbon-neutrality before the end of the century. Before and during the Paris Conference, countries submitted comprehensive National Climate Action Plans. Even though it is not enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees Centigrade, the Agreement traces the way to achieving this target.

National contribution towards minimizing global temperature, Sri Lankas INDCs -Intended Nationally Determined Contributions- is comprised of four main areas.

First is mitigation, which means reducing greenhouse gas emissions against the Businesses-As-Usual in the sectors of energy. That means electricity generation, transportation, industry, waste and forestry. The key contributors to greenhouse gas are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Sri Lanka expects to reduce 20 per cent of GHG emission in energy sector by 2030.

Second it is adaptation. INDCs will have focus on human health, food security, water and irrigation, coastal and marine, urban infrastructure and human settlement, tourism and recreation. These are the most vulnerable sectors to adverse effects of climate change in Sri Lanka.

Third it is loss and damage which occurs due to extreme weather conditions such as prolonged droughts and flash floods.

Fourth is implementation. Sri Lanka needs financial support, technical assistance and technology transfers from the developed countries to overcome these types of problems.

Paris Agreement was opened up for signature on 22nd April 2016 at a high-level signature ceremony convened by the Secretary-General in New York. Arrangement for signature will remain opened until 21st of April 2017. As of 3rd September, 2016 there are 180 signatories to the Paris Agreement. Of these, 26 States including China, Cameron, Maldives and Palestine have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance and approval. Sri Lanka has not deposited up to now.

Nature is a mysterious phenomenon, not even scientists can explain it. Like the wind or the blowing that embraces one's body, it cannot be explained other than referring to it simply as "nature".

India is regarded as the mind of spiritualism. Indians recognize three particular plants, or trees as being holy. You know the Bo tree. Ascetic Siddhartha sat in deep meditation under the Bo tree until he attained enlightenment and became the Buddha. Scientifically Bo tree is known to have anti-inflammatory and

immunomodulatory properties. Hindus believe in Tulsi plant which is a holy plant. They grow Tulsi plants in front of their houses because it has medicinal properties. The third important tree is the bamboo tree which has two varieties. One is the Wild Bamboo tree and the other is Beema Bamboo. The latter has a superior clone which has been identified as eco-friendly and is used to generate bio mass energy. Bio mass is an organic material that is produced from plants and animals. It is a renewable source of energy that can supply energy for 24 hours of the day and 365 days the year. Although it is the best source of energy it is not cost effective to produce.

Finally, I want to tell you about the benefits of signing the Paris Agreement. Firstly, the Paris Agreement can contribute to the global efforts to mitigate global warming, manage climate change and direct Sri Lanka towards a sustainable development path.

Secondly, by way of the Paris Agreement, we can obtain financial assistance from the Green Climate Fund for conditional commitments declared in IDMCs. Developed countries intend to continue the existing collective goal to mobilize US Dollars hundred billion, that means ten thousand billion in Sri Lankan Rupees per year by 2020 and extend this until 2025.

Thirdly, we will be able to obtain finance, technology development and capacity building to build resilient and vulnerable sectors in our country such as human health, food security, water and irrigation, coastal and marine, bio diversity et cetera. Fourthly, we can adopt a new carbon development path way, by which both economic and environmental benefits can be achieved for sustainable development of the country. Fifthly, foreign exchange spent on petroleum imports can be saved by shifting to renewable energy source. Finally, we can achieve improved eco system services such as clean air, clean water and low fluoride soil and lands.

Unfortunately, together with the high growth has come a disparity in income. Sixty five families in the world enjoy the income equal to that of 3.5 billion poor people's income. So, you can understand the disparity. Unless action is taken to overcome poverty which lays the foundation not only for future social instability but barriers to growth itself, we shall not be able to create a just society for all our peoples.

Together with the elimination of poverty, there should be increased access by all citizens to their basic needs. One of the fundamental needs on which life depends is water, which is becoming increasingly scarce, and what is available is often poisoned with chemicals. Researchers warn that this climate change in the next thirty years in Asia would lead to one billion more people becoming "water stressed".

The montane rainforests which safeguard the watersheds of Asia have been depleted. That very depletion has contributed to global warming, the retribution for which comes in the form of extended droughts, cyclones, catastrophic floods, super-storms and food shortages, which in turn contribute to the shortage of water.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, how many minutes have I been allotted?

505 506

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Ten minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you.

Sir, we are gathered today to take up the Debate on the Ratification of the Paris Agreement. Though we were to have a few Votes of Condolences and Private Members Motions be taken up today, the Party Leaders agreed to give way to this Debate, particularly because of its urgency and importance.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a historic achievement after 25 years of diplomatic wrangling. There have been many conferences which failed to reach consensus among the nations in the UN system. Finally, we have been able to seminally achieve something. Though I personally feel that we would want drastic measures to be imposed on the industrialized nations, we have no choice but to finally agree to a consensus of this nature.

The salient point of this Paris Agreement is that only developed countries are expected to slash their emissions in absolute terms. Developing nations are encouraged to do so as their capabilities evolve over time. This has been the basic understanding upon which the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has finally been agreed and signed upon among countries. We were fortunate that our own President Maithripala Sirisena himself was personally there in Paris. Since he is the Minister in charge of the subject, he is in a pivotal position to implement and enforce the national obligations that we have agreed upon after having signed this historic Agreement.

The long-term objective of the Agreement is to make sure global warming stays well below 2 C and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 C, which I believe, is a very lofty ideal. But, we can make an effort to try and reach those levels. Having known the wrangling that has been going on for several years, countries have agreed to set national targets - for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, five years. More than 180 countries have already submitted targets for the first cycle beginning in 2020. Our country, not being a highly industrialized nation, may look at these targets with some cynicism, but yet we have other obligations. Having undergone extreme weather events of late, it is important for us to realize that the unprecedented floods that we have experienced during the past decade or two and the unprecedented extended droughts that we have been facing in this country, have caused immense hardships to many of our rural populations.

Food shortages emanate as a result of these droughts. We had suddenly a bumper harvest and then we face situations where we had to contend with extreme weather events on one side. Monsoons are not experienced during the expected period, resulting in serious difficulties for

planners in this country. So, as policy-makers and as a Government, we have had to adjust in order to try to keep to our targets.

The United Nations identified the Millennium Development Goals. Fortunately, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, our country is far ahead of our neighbours in our region in achieving our targets - the Millennium Development Goals. We have virtually achieved all the goals ahead of time than our contemporaries and compatriots in the region. We have been paid the kudos for this even by the UN Secretary-General who was here a few weeks ago. He openly acknowledged the success story of Sri Lanka in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

Now, there is another set of goals called, the Sustainable Development Goals which have now begun to be implemented. There are 17 such Goals and all the Ministries are now being given targets to achieve. My Ministry which has to look after the water supply sector has an important role to play in achieving these 17 Goals. A very important aspect of it is that we need to be conscious about the depletion of the forest cover in this country. When my State Minister was speaking a few minutes ago, she referred to the fact that our forest cover has now come down almost to 20 per cent and it cannot be sustained at that level for too long, unless we take some drastic steps.

His Excellency the President, as the Minister in charge of Environment and under whom the Forest Department comes, has undertaken a very ambitious programme called, Punarudaya" - "Accelerated National Environment Conservation Programme". Its target period is from 2016 to 2018, where we wish to set up climate-resilient villages and climate-smart cities. This is a very ambitious programme and I am sure His Excellency the President would be able to reach these targets of setting-up of climate-resilient villages and climate-smart cities, which is a very important step for us to progress in this millennia and then take forward the country.

Then, the Ministries have also been directed to factor in emission reduction in drawing up long-term plans. Now, we as a Ministry, have also looked at our energy consumption. We have almost 330 large water supply schemes all over the country where we appear to spend a lot of money on energy. Our expenses towards energy consumption is almost 25 per cent of our entire spending for a year. So, we are looking at ways and means of going for alternative energy sources rather than to depend on the national grid. This is something that we need to include in the future projects that we embark upon.

In the same manner, we also have to look at very importantly setting-up of an authority to look at river basins and watershed management. Because, river basins and watershed management is a very important area which has now fallen under different clusters of authorities and ministries. Particularly, we have the Mahaweli Authority, the Forest Department and many other agencies which tend to look at the subject of river basins and watershed management issue. Conflicting

507 508

2016 09

policies and people going to different agencies to get different accreditations and certifications has resulted in total confusion. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this particular subject of river basins and watershed management is an issue that we have to focus upon.

Since my time is up, may I say a few words in Tamil very briefly, particularly relating to a serious event, the coastal erosion that has affected the coastal communities in the Ampara District.

At least, there should have been some compensatory pecuniary payment to a world fund. If they failed to meet the target, a certain amount of compensation should have been payable to an international fund. But, there is nothing like that in this entire setup.

[3.37 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member.

I think, this Debate on the Ratification of the Paris Agreement is very important. More than 170 countries have already signed this Agreement and our future depends on this.

About a month back, the Hon. Mylvaganam Thilakarajah, Member of Parliament, and myself represented our country at the Asian Parliamentary Assembly in Islamabad. We were very lucky to have visited the Senate which is called, "the Green Parliament". They are completely using solar power and in most of the places we visited, the first preference was given to environment. If a country is to live in peace, if it is to be improved in all aspects, first we have to look at the environmental aspects. I am very happy that this Ministry comes under the perview of His Excellency the President. Under the previous Government he was in charge of the Ministry of Health and I know how he was able to overcome the problems that he had to face with regrard to cigarettes. Then, under this Government, he has taken a decision on drugs and now it is also under control. We are very happy that this Ministry comes under His Excellency the President and we have a dedicated Deputy Minister too.

When we speak of environment, we always forget about the coastal areas. I am from Puttalam and living in the west coast. If you go around the coastal villages from Galle to Mannar, you can see coastal erosion. I can remember that about 20-25 years ago, there was a nice beach from Galle right up to Mannar extending almost up to 1-2 kilometres. But, today, we can see, especially from Wennappuwa to Puttalam, Kalpitiya, that sea is eating up the land. So, we have to look into this. The Hon. Deputy Minister is here and I hope that he will listen to this. So, unless we take a firm action, in the years to come, most of the houses and industrial buildings situated along the west coast will be washed away. So, in order to prevent that happening, we can use not only rocks but we can also encourage the usage of plants and one such variety we are using is Kadolana. But, it should be done on a large scale so that the west coast soil can be safeguarded.

The other thing is that His Excellency the President is interested in using compost as fertilizer. As you know, I represent the Puttalam District where we have 16,000 acres of agricultural land in Kalpitiya where the soil is sandy. People have been using other fertilizers and pesticides and because of that the soil has become infertile. So, according to an environmental report, probably in another 10-15 years time, we will not have pure water in the whole of Kalpitiya. Therefore, I am also struggling to introduce compost as fertilizer to that area and with the help of His Excellency the President, if we can encourage the use of compost, I am sure that we will be able to do something early in order to protect that area.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Please, give me two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No. I am sorry. Please, wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Okay.

So, I think the ratification of the Paris Agreement is very important to save the country.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Ameer Ali Shihabdeen. You have five minutes.
