(i) separately, the number of children of the officers and the number of children of the soldiers studying in these schools; and

147 148

asked the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government:

(a) Is he aware that- (i) 270 officers who were permanent residents

in the Eastern Province were attached to the Northern Provincial Council when the North Eastern Provincial Council which had been once merged was demerged as Northern and Eastern Provincial Councils; (ii) those officers have undergone much

difficulty having had to work in an area away from their permanent residence for about 7 years in this manner; (iii) the attempts made by these officers on a

number of occasions to get transfers to the Eastern Province were unsuccessful; and (iv) only a few officers have obtained transfers

with the assistance of authorities?

(b) Will he inform this House- (i) whether the reasonable request of the

residents of the Eastern Province for working in that Provincial Council will be granted; and (ii) if so, the actions taken in that regard?

(c) If not, why?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Sir, the answer is as follows:

(a) (i) No. One hundred and seventy five (175) officers who are permanently residing in the Eastern Province have been attached to

151 152

the Northern Provincial Council. It was decided to attach these officers to the Northern Provincial Council at the time of seperation of the "Northern and Eastern Provincial Council" that was functioning as one administrative unit into two seperate Provincial Councils.

Accordingly, the officers who worked at the main office of the Northern and Eastern Provincial Council were attached to the Northern Provincial Council and Eastern Provincial Council seperately on the basis of a raffle system.

(ii) No.

Northern Provincial Council was functioning in the Trincomalee District up to 31.12.2010 and the relevant officers worked in the same district. Thereafter, when the main office of the Northern Provincial Council functioned in the Northern Province with effect from 01.01.2011 some officers came to the Northern Province with their families and resided. Officers who have been permanently residing in the Eastern Province requested transfers to the same district and they were transferred as per the existing vacancies.

(iii) No.

A group of officers attached to the Northern Provincial Council were again released to the Eastern Provincial Council for existing vacancies as per transfer requests. Some officers were transferred and released to the Eastern Province on the basis of mutual transfers. Nine (09) officers were released to the Eastern Province in 2011 in that way.

Thirty nine (39) Officers; two (02) Development Officers, two (02) Technical Officers, ten (10) Management Assistant Officers, fifteen (15) drivers and ten (10) office employees were released to the Eastern Provincial Council by the Northern the Provincial Council on a priority basis in 2015.

(iv) No.

(b) (i) Yes.

(ii) The number of officers remaining as at

01.01.2014 in addition to the officers who were transferred to the Eastern Provincial Council from those who were absorbed to the Northern Provincial Council and permanently residing in the Eastern Province is one hundred and seven (107).

Accordingly, the Hon. Governor of the Eastern Province has granted approval to absorb one hundred and seven (107) officers to the Eastern Province within 2015 - 2018 as per the existing vacancies.

Accordingly, Thirty nine (39) officers have been absorbed to the Eastern Province in 2015.

(c) Not relevant.

Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, there is a very interesting article in The Sunday Times of January 24th, 2016 captioned, Limitations in Prof. Hausmanns policy recommendations. I think all the Hon. Members should read this. Firstly, Professor Hausmann very clearly said at the Colombo Economic Summit that the policy the Government is adopting is not going to work. Secondly, he said that the Government should understand the international situation, especially the international economic and monetary changes that are taking place overnight, within weeks and within months and therefore, a dogmatic approach would not be helpful in our economic development.

Hypocrites of the first order, Sir. [Interruption.]

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this Government was elected on a mandate to create one million jobs within five years by increasing investment and boosting exports. In fact, it is now the responsibility of the Government and this House to make that vision a reality. The Prime Ministers Economic Policy Statement on the 5th of November last year outlined more detailed plans to boost investments, exports and growth so that Sri Lanka could meet this target by 2020. In fact, making that Statement, the Prime Minister said on the Floor of this House that day, I quote:

In order to achieve these results, we have to encourage foreign investment and investment by individuals. We lag behind the other countries in the region when it comes to meeting investor requirements.

This also echoes President Maithripala Sirisenas own election pledge on page 20 in the Manifesto which says, I quote:

I will prepare the Sri Lankan economy by diversification of investment and non-reliance from a single country

Achieving this vision for job creation, raising standards of living and reduced dependency on a single country is not an easy task. In fact, first, the previous Government had left this economy in a state of crisis. The number of unemployed Sri Lankans basically remained the same between 2009 and 2014, meaning that there was no job creation during this period despite the war had come to a conclusion. And also there was no investment. FDI was at war-time levels. The peace dividends did not come to Sri Lanka. Export growth fell to 16.7 per cent of GDP from 33.3 per cent in the year 2000. The growth we had, according to the previous Governments cooked up statistics, was fuelled by unsustainable and poorly negotiated borrowing.

Second, we are now heading into a period of global instability and economic uncertainty. George Soros, one of the most farsighted investors in the world, speaking at the recently held Economic Forum in Colombo, warned that the world could be on the verge of another serious economic crisis. So investors are increasingly reconsidering expansions abroad, especially in frontier markets like Sri Lanka. In fact, I am sure the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama will soon make a statement here in Parliament about the kind of response they received at Davos, when they went there recently. Sri Lanka is today considered as a frontier market and to do so, we will have to stand out; we will have to compete harder and smarter than the others. So, the question for the Government is, in such a difficult, domestic and international climate, how do we attract investment, generate jobs and growth while also ensuring that we reduce our dependency and risk? How do we do this when governments across the emerging world are asking the same questions and taking concerted action to answer those questions?

With over-borrowing and low tax revenue, there is little leeway for Government spending to generate jobs and growth. Already, one in three jobs in the country is directly provided by the public sector. As a middle-income country, the prospect for securing further aid is also minimal and limited. Therefore, the only choice available for Sri Lanka is securing FDI - Foreign Direct Investment - and enabling private sector-led growth. As the experience of many countries, especially our East Asian neighbours show, FDI is the common feature of every major development success story - from capitalist Hong Kong to communist China and every stripe of

217 218

[ ]

2016 26

governance system in between. And as a result, investors are the key to moving from a low productivity poor plantation economy to a high productivity upper-middle income manufacturing and services economy. Investors building factories, opening hotels, bringing in new technology and opening up access to markets abroad, improve our productivity and Sri Lankas competitiveness. They are the only way we can deliver the jobs and economic development that the people of our country need and require.

In the last year, we have taken concerted and consistent steps to secure investments. We have re-established the independence of the Judiciary and the rule of law. We have restored relations with many key economies including the USA, the European Union and India which are vital trade and investment partners. For example, just the day before yesterday, the EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka said that Sri Lanka was on track to regaining GSP Plus concession, which your Government lost some years ago, and he has said that it may be regained even in a few months time. This was reiterated by the EUs Deputy Head of GSP who said, I am confident that Sri Lanka will receive the scheme again. "The scheme" means, the GSP-Plus scheme which again will provide jobs for thousands and thousands of young Sri Lankans all over the country.

But, Sir, as you know, regaining investors confidence in Sri Lanka after the wasted and corrupt last five years will not be an easy task. We must remember that for every reform we initiate, other emerging economies are competing ten. Therefore, one quick and important way of demonstrating our good faith and signaling that Sri Lanka is open for business is by signing investment promotion and protection agreements. Signing these agreements helps ensure that there is a transparent and level playing field for all investors. There is nothing to fear from these agreements. All they do is protect investors from expropriation, ensure fair compensation, and ensure that companies can repatriate their profits.

Let us look at the effects of investment agreements that were signed in the past. Between 1970 and 1976, during the days of the closed economy, Sri Lanka did not secure a single cent of Foreign Direct Investment, but with broader economic reforms, including the signing of such investment promotion agreements in the five years between 1979 and 1984, Sri Lanka obtained nearly US Dollars 250 million in FDI. Let me illustrate this with an example. After ratifying an investment agreement with Australia at that time, the investments were more than doubled in the three years after the ratification when compared to the three years before the agreement was ratified. This is why when these agreements come up for renewal every 10 years, no one has ever made an issue about renewal as they only brought benefits to this country.

In fact, a study of investment agreements around the world shows that Sir Lanka is lagging and is thus at a disadvantage when competing for investment. There are around 3,000 such investment promotion and protection agreements in effect around the world. China, according to the UNCTAD, has signed 138 such agreements; India has signed 97; the United Arab Emirates has signed 61; Singapore has signed 71 and Vietnam has signed 81. Until this House passed the 12 Agreements in Parliament on the 19th of December, Sri Lanka only had 28 investment agreements. But now, we have 40. But, unfortunately we are still behind and we need to remember that countries like Vietnam and India are twice as far ahead of us.

To be clear, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the problem is not that Sri Lanka is behind on the rankings, the problem is that being an uncompetitive investment destination has a direct effect on the number of jobs available to our citizens, the quality of their jobs and their income levels. These Agreements are just one tool that the Government is using to bring these jobs and the growth to Sri Lanka.

Before winding up my speech Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would also like to briefly outline some other benefits to the people from the Governments decisions.

First, these Agreements are not one-sided, investor protection cuts both ways. They also cover investments by Sri Lankan companies abroad which amounts to a total stock of over US Dollars 600 million. Ratifying these twelve Agreements mean that Sri Lankan investors who own apparel factories in India, hydropower plants in Uganda and plantations in Indonesia will have greater protection from expropriation and unfair business practices in those countries as well.

Secondly, these Agreements will also help us secure access to investments from some of the fastest growing markets. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Sri Lanka has had investment Agreements with the US, UK and Germany for decades, but this Government has ratified Agreements that will help secure investments from rapidly growing China and India as well which are emerging as investment super-powers while also building up prospects for investments from other friendly countries like Pakistan, Malaysia and Thailand. Obtaining diverse sources of FDIs is also important for reducing our dependence on apparel and tea, which account for over half the value of our exports.

Thirdly, Sir, we need our international competition to create world class companies. Look at our companies that are truly globally competitive: our apparel firms, our IT firms, our hotel management companies and even our banks. They are all in sectors that are open to investments from abroad. So, they learn, adapt and compete. By contrast, wherever we have closed the economy inefficiency and lethargy have set in.

219 220

As Sri Lanka expands its ties with countries, investors and organizations around the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will have to both improve the quality and the quantity of its work. In fact, we are right in the middle of restructuring the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so that it meets the challenges of the modern world and we have a lot to do because when this Government came into power both quality and quantity were in a state of crisis. In fact, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sir, had over 100 officers missing from its 264 cadre. That is, 40 per cent of the staff it needed to function was not hired. Sri Lanka Foreign Service Exam was not held regularly. Most Foreign Ministries have intakes every year, which was also our practice in the past. But during the last ten years there were only two intakes until this Government was elected. Within six months of office, we recruited 25 new officers on the basis of open competitive examinations and we hope to have this exam on an annual basis for the first time in many years.

But even the approved cadre, Sir, is insufficient. We have 67 Missions abroad. As the Hon. Gunawardena raised this issue, I would like to say that before January, 2015, out of the 67 embassies there were only 15 SLFS Heads of Missions. All the others were political appointments, personally selected at that time, by the Head of State and actually many of them were relatives of the First family at that time. As the details are now coming out, whilst serving as Heads of Missions in some of the most important places in the world, many of them indulged in their own private businesses and some of them even sold the buildings belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and money was deposited in their own accounts. Investigations are continuing on them. But now, from 15 Foreign Service Officers, it has been increased to 34 Foreign Service Officers. It has doubled since the last Government was defeated. There are twenty non-SLFS or political appointments. But, I would say all of them - unlike previously appointed officers - are of the highest caliber and are very competent, able and efficient people.

But even the approved cadre, Sir, is also insufficient. We have 67 Missions abroad, which means that even if we have no one at the Foreign Ministry, that is just four officers per embassy. We currently have just over 70 officers at the Republic Building in Colombo, which means that for every officer in Colombo we have three in Missions. This is far from the best practice. For example, Singapore has an equal number of officers abroad and at home. To summarize, the Foreign Service cadre is not large enough and it is only two-thirds full.

On the quality side, we have made three important changes. First, we removed all the unqualified and corrupt political appointees of the previous Government - people who used embassies for tea trading and gunrunning. We replaced many of them with officers from the Foreign Service and the ratio of Foreign Service Heads of

Missions doubled within a single year from one-third to two-thirds. Then, because of the lack of qualified officers of the appropriate grade, we appointed business people, academics and other eminent people to be Heads of Missions. In the longer term, we are restructuring the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure that our resources are developed, deployed and managed as efficiently as possible. This is why we are closing down Missions where there is no clear rationale for existence. We are also studying the foreign ministries of other countries to transform our Ministry of Foreign Affairs into a globally competitive service. In fact, a team just returned from studying the Singaporean Foreign Affairs Ministry and based on their recommendations, we are about to introduce a scheme for non-resident ambassadors which will cut down the costs drastically. We would also be having a special Human Resources Division to ensure that members of the Foreign Service are selected rigorously, trained regularly and rewarded for results.

Perhaps most importantly, we are also putting in place the necessary checks, balances and controls to ensure that the Service is accountable. We will soon roll out a scheme of regular inspections - we are going to appoint regular inspectors general or inspectors who will have the power to inspect our Missions abroad - that will not only audit financial matters but will also ensure that all aspects of a Mission's operations - from building maintenance to customer service - are all in order. Each Mission will also be given annual targets for their political, economic and consular activities and these targets will be strictly and regularly reviewed and monitored.

Sir, allow me to conclude by saying that there are many issues where debate and deliberation by the House is important. There are many issues where I respect the Opposition for their reasoned disagreement with the Governments policies, even though I still disagree with them.

But in this case, I am sad to say that the Opposition is being mischievous. These Agreements are clearly in the interest of the country and its people, ratifying them is clearly based on the mandate of the people and they are long-overdue measures that need to be taken if we are to move the country forward. What should be a mere formality has been sensationalized. There are many valuable and important issues the Opposition can take up and that should be debated, but this, I feel, is not one of them. Thank you.
