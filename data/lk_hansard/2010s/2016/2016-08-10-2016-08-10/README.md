( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, the Central Government has defined responsibilities in respect of the resettlement of the unfortunate people in the North. Therefore, the Cabinet wanted three Ministers to go into this issue and to make proposals as to how we can do this work with better coordination within the Government and also to speed up the process, because we felt that better coordination was required in the Government sector. The three Ministers - the. Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen and the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - were to report in that regard. The first is the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, the second is the Minister of Industry and Commerce and the third is the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government and they are Ministers in the Cabinet who represent these areas.

They decided that there should be a Director-General appointed with the relevant staff and a task force of the three Ministers to ensure proper implementation. They also wanted the Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council to ensure that there was coordination with the Northern Provincial Council and there was no misunderstanding.

So, this is done mainly for the Government to implement its work. Similarly, the Northern Provincial Council also has work. We understand that the Chief Minister and the Board of Ministers are also undertaking work within those areas. Since that work has to be done by the Provincial Council, we have not gone to interfere into the work of the Provincial Council. We have left that as it is. We only wanted some coordination and that is why the Chief Secretary has been called in.

Since the Hon. Member has mentioned, the Members of Parliament of Northern Province, we can ask the task force to talk to the Members of Parliament of the Northern Province, but we have not included anyone outside the Cabinet Ministers to be there. They can always work together with the Chief Minister and whatever committee or task force that the Chief Minister has established for the Northern Province. We did not want the two to clash. That is all. This seems to be the best arrangement possible. If there is an alternate arrangement that the Chief Minister of the Provincial Council is contemplating, we can certainly consider it. But, we went on the basis that we had to perform the functions that came to us in accordance with the

Constitution and then there were other functions in regard to resettlement, which has to be done by the Provincial Council, the Chief Minister and the Board of Ministers of the Provincial Council. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Is that solution acceptable to you, Hon. Member? . ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) , . . , . . . , .

, , . ? . . , , . . . , . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister, please. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker, actually the work is being carried out. The proposals are - there are people who have returned to their places of origin after normalcy has been achieved; there are those who have returned to their places of origin but not living permanently due to lack of housing and other facilities; there are those who have deregistered in the place of displacement willing to return and unable to return and there are those who have integrated with the host family therefore not willing to return.

So, it is a question of the measures that has to be taken. In order to address these issues arising from lack of status, there is a circular issued by the Ministry of Public Administration. Secondly, there is registration of electors under the Elections Acts. Thirdly, there were monies that had been voted for the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs for resettlement of these people. Finally, determining the number of houses that are required and how we are going to build them - there is already a controversy about the prefabricated system - then, there were monies for the other items that had to be given either to the relevant Central Government Agencies or to the Provincial Council.

Then there is a question of the Muslims who left Jaffna and went to Puttalam. We have to find out who are the ones who want to live in Puttalam and who want to

return and what are the problems that will be there. What we have done is, we have appointed a task force which consists of the Secretary to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, the Secretary to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, the Secretary to the Treasury or a representative from the Ministry of Finance, the Secretary to the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government and of course the Secretary to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. These are the people who will be there in that task force. In addition, we also have the Chief Secretary of the Northern Province.

But certainly I will ask these Ministers to consult the Chief Minister also in matters that concern them. I do not think it is fair to put the Chief Minister among the Secretaries to these Ministries anyway. Three Cabinet Ministers are overlooking the work as Cabinet Ministers. The task force is there to implement and these Secretaries have been named for that. . ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) ? . . . , . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The task force consists of Secretaries. That is why the Chief Secretary is there. The Cabinet Committee consists of these three Ministers. They appointed a task force of these Secretaries. . ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) The Chief Secretary . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The three Ministers are in a Cabinet Subcommittee. The task force has the Chief Secretary of the Northern Province. We will ask the Cabinet Subcommittee to consult the Chief Minister and have discussions with the Chief Minister from time to time. This is to ensure that the Government does its work properly. Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, would you like to explain this?

.. ( , , ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Yes ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Okay, you can do that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Speaker - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan has asked three questions and I think the Hon. Prime Minister has given his answer. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I think, the Hon. Minister can explain it. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Swaminathan. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you, Hon. Speaker. With the permission of the Hon. Prime Minister, I wish to state that I have discussed this issue with the co-chairs of the subcommittee appointed by the Cabinet and at any stage, we will be inviting the Chief Minister or any representative from the Northern Provincial Council to discuss any issue in regard to resettlement. So, we are not, in any way, trying to jeopardize the Tamils or the community in Jaffna. They will be invited. . ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) , . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) That is not a decision that I can take. That is a decision to be taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. It is

only the Cabinet of Ministers who can be the Members of the subcommittee but we will be inviting the Chief Minister. There is no reservation on that. . ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) , , . ! , " " !

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Speaker, I think the Hon. Prime Minister replied to that very clearly, because it is the Cabinet of Ministers who have been appointed for the Cabinet subcommittee. I am reiterating that the Hon. Chief Minister or his representative or any Member of the Northern Provincial Council could make representation to this subcommittee and then we will adhere to their request. That is all we can say. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, Hon. Prime Minister has explained that it is only the Cabinet Ministers who will be in this subcommittee and also he has given the assurance that the Chief Minister will be consulted at all times, if necessary. So, since it is the policy I do not think, we could argue it any further. We will see how it works.

Even though the Cabinet has proposed to grant only a provision of 50 per cent of the total outstanding step-by-step under midterm framework, the said provision has not been granted up to 2015. An allocation of Rs. 100 million has been made by the 2016 Budget Proposals and at present, actions are being taken to write off the loans granted to co-operative societies and co-operative unions.

(b) (i) Yes.

(ii) Yes.

(c ) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Minister, by your long Answer, it is clear that you intend to have all these loans written off and that provisions are being made in order to do so. How much allocation has been made up to now by the Budget in order to write off- ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Hon. Member, only Rs. 100 million has been allocated from the 2016 Budget.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) How much more is required to settle those? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) We need Rs. 354 million. We have asked the Department of National Budget to allocate it in 2017. If we get that allocation, Insha Allah, I think we can complete that next year. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Are you confident that the Hon. Minister of Finance will agree with you in order to allocate such an amount for this purpose? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) He allocated Rs. 100 million by this year's Budget. The balance, we hope he will give us. : : MOHIDEEN JUMMA MOSQUE IN TRINCOMALEE: WAKF PROPERTY 508/16 4. ... ( ... ) (The Hon.

, . . , : : MEASUREMENT UNITS, STANDARDS AND SERVICES ACT: REGULATIONS [3.16p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Sir, I move,

"That the Regulations made by the Minister of Food Security under Section 60 of the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Act, No. 35 of 1995 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1921/54 of 2nd July 2015, which were presented on 05.04.2016, be approved."

Hon. Presiding Member, each country in the world has a special establishment responsible to realize, establish and maintain the national measurement standards. It is generally called, National Measurement Institute (NMI). Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department (MUSSD) under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is responsible for the NMI in Sri Lanka.

This was established under the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Act, No. 35 of 1995. Establishment, maintenance and dissemination of national measurement standards in Sri Lanka is done by the National Measurement Laboratory (NML) established under the Department. Moreover, various calibrations and verification services for measuring instruments used in fields such as industry, engineering, environment, health protection, road safety are provided by MUSSD.

Measurements Units, Standards and Services Department under my Ministry is the apex institution responsible for providing accurate and reliable measurement procedures and metrology services, safeguarding the interests of the consumer, maintaining and updating the National Measurement Standards in conformity with the international measurement system by implementing the law and regulations of this Act.

To ensure that Sri Lankas measurements are on par with international standards, MUSSD continues its relations with international metrology organizations such as the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML), Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP), International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA).

Also MUSSD has participated in international comparison programmes pertaining to various physical quantities. Officials from MUSSD have participated in many foreign training programmes and conferences relating to metrology in 2015 with which I shall deal later in my speech.

Actual Recurrent Expenditure of this Department in 2015 was Rs. 94.9 million. Capital expenditure for the same period was Rs. 220.3 million, and actual expenditure for the same period was Rs. 315.3 million. At a cost of Rs. 15.3 million, the National Measurement Laboratory under this Department procured 25 standard measuring instruments in 2015. The total income stood at Rs. 144.4 million and 97 per cent of this came from stamping charges.

Let me now briefly update the House, on the performance of the Department in 2015.

Pattern approval is a technical assessment, and it is the most important activity of this Department. Pattern approval is a confirmation of any weight, measure or weighing/measuring instrument after a pattern test performed by a recognized laboratory to check whether they are on par with the measurement law in Sri Lanka before they are sent to the market by a producer or before they are imported. The original model of the instrument undergoes a series of tests at the National Measurement Laboratory.

The design and the structure of each of the components of the instruments are checked against the recommendations on type approval defined by the

1175 1176

2016 10

International Organization of Legal Metrology. Subsequently, based on the evaluation of the test results, a pattern approval is granted by the MUSSD for the intended weights and measuring instruments including vehicle emission testing units and fuel dispensers.

I am pleased to say that 39 pattern approval of weighing and measuring instruments were done with a revenue of Rs. 395,000 for the year 2015. Four approvals of fuel dispensers were granted and 25 weighing machine approvals were also granted.

Then, I am pleased to inform this House that calibrations facilities for pressure gauges, thermometers, weights, scales and length measuring instruments, electrical measuring instruments, moisture meters, laboratory balances used in industry, engineering or any other related field are now available at the MUSSD. Calibration certificates are also issued with such calibrated instruments. Industrial calibration is one of the main services provided by the National Measurement Laboratory. Moreover, verification of vehicle speed detectors and vehicle emission testing instruments has been started. The National Measurement Laboratory of the Department earned Rs. 3.19 million in 2015, by its various calibration services.

Sir, verifications, inspections and raids of weighing and measuring instruments are conducted on district basis. Inspections and raid programmes are implemented by the MUSSD to ensure that the weights, measures, weighing and measuring instruments used in the country are utilized in conformity with the weights and measures laws and regulations of the country. These programmes are very helpful in terms of legal metrology, not only to protect the customer but also to ensure an accurate and reliable measuring practice in the country. Verification of weights, measures and weighing and measuring instruments used in trade is done by Measurement Services and Devices Inspectors at each District Secretariat. Verification centres are held in Pradeshiya Sabhas and any other Government institute of each District under the prior approval of the District Secretariat. Moreover, a mobile verification unit for weighbridges has been commissioned to verify annually all weighbridges placed in every District.

All fuel dispensers mounted at every fuel station in the country are verified once every year. A Fuel Dispensers Verification Unit has been introduced. I am pleased to say that the Department earned Rs. 232 million through its verification services in 2015 by verifying 888,422 units. The Department conducted 15,777 raids and collected Rs. 2.88 million in fines in the year 2015 concluding 1,220 cases. We continued with our annual re-verification of working standards as usual with no special events to mention.

Sir, the commodities that have been packed before selling to the consumers are called pre-packed

commodities. Net content mentioned on the pre-packed item is undergone for inspections of verifying whether the right content is available at the display of goods in the market. Inspection of pre-packages is performed according to OIML Regulations. When inspecting pre-packages, samples of a particular item available at the display in the market are arbitrarily selected and subsequently, the net content such as weight, volume and length et cetera of the item is measured.

Three companies that are involved in milk powder and domestic LNG trades have been inspected successfully.

Any organization or individual who is engaged in selling, manufacturing, importing and repairing of weights, measures, weighing and measuring instruments must get registered with the Department as per Section 21 of the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Act. For that, the person must apply via a prescribed application form determined by the Director of Measurement Units, Standards and Services and the corresponding fee must be paid. The certificate issued in such registration will expire on 31st December of the year.

Before starting a business of repairing weights or measuring instruments, the interested person should, first, face a practical test conducted by the MUSSD to prove his competencies and qualifications related to such repairing activities. The examination fee should be paid by the person. After qualifying through the practical test and satisfactory witness of the workshop, a registration certificate is issued to the applicant. This certificate is not transferable. In case of any change of the business ownership, a qualified technician must be appointed to handle the business immediately. We registered 556 private entrepreneurs engaged in commercial activities, controlled over legal metrology in 2015, earning a total registration fee of Rs. 466,650.

The Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department possesses the honour to be the pioneer of generating and broadcasting the Standard Time of Sri Lanka since 2011. The website www.sltime.org was launched in April, 2011 to broadcast the accurate time. People are now able to set their time correctly via the website at any time in the day. Presently, steps are being taken to upgrade this extensively developing service by introducing a Caesium Atomic Clock, which is able to generate the most accurate time in the world.

Sir, as I mentioned earlier, officials from the MUSSD have participated in many foreign training programmes and conferences related to metrology in 2015. The Department sent 22 of its officials to India, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and China for measurement trainings. They have also been trained at 40 local sessions for a very nominal sum of Rs. 264,000 and six of them received the training free of charge.

I am pleased to say that now the Department has the capacity of calibration of measuring instruments in the health sector. We are trying to ensure the accuracy of measuring instruments such as weighing machines, scales, blood pressure meters and thermometers used in the health sector and the calibration of those instruments will , in turn, result in a reliable diagnosis and treatment.

We have already tested ten such meters of importers and of some private hospitals and we are continuing to test more. We have also requested government hospitals to send us the details of their newborn baby weighing scales and blood pressure meters, but so far, we did not receive any details from them, understandably due to their budgetary constraints. The Department strongly recommends the health authorities to assess baby weighing scales and blood pressure meters of all government hospitals, private hospitals and clinics.

Sir, it is important for me to inform this House about the future plans of the Department as well. Today, people have become highly dependent on three-wheelers and taxi services. Often, the passengers are cheated by them and they pay higher than usual rates. Realizing this, I am pleased to inform, the Department is proposing a project to set up a Verification Centre of Taxi Meters in Sri Lanka. This project has been proposed to facilitate people with an accurate and reliable travel fare counting system in taxi meters, of which the accuracy must be verified. We have already started giving pattern approval for manufacturers and importers under the regulations of the OIML, of which this Department is a proud member. Through this process, the metrological parameters related to taxi meters are controlled.

Same as every other measuring instrument used in trade, the legal control of taxi meters will comprise four components: the pattern approval of the meter, initial verification, road test after the installation of the meter and annual verification. It has been planned to appoint a staff consisting of a technical officer and a supporting officer to assume the duties of taxi meter verification and inspection, covering all the districts.

The construction of a Verification Centre of Taxi Meters consisting of all the facilities required to verify and grant approval for the pattern of such meters which are mounted on taxis and the installation of measuring instruments necessary for the centre have to be completed. It is expected to initiate granting pattern approval for taxi meters as a pilot project in 2016. Accordingly, it will be possible to provide necessary facilities by mid-2017 for obtaining pattern approval by the institutions which import and distribute taxi meters.

Then people living in 3000 will say that the prices of goods were much less in the year 2000, just as we talk about the prices of goods in the 1960s.

[5.27p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Mr. Presiding Member, as the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Business and Commerce, I presented the Committees Report on the Revision of Regulations under the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Act to the House yesterday. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! . . .. ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) , " " . , . . Question put, and agreed to.

, . , , .

Whereupon THE HON. VELU KUMAR left the Chair, and THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Sir, as the House is aware, the prevalent Measurement Units, Standards and Services Act carries overbearing responsibility in allowing for the accurate quantification of goods, ensuring applicable compliance standards on the diffusion of commerce and trade within and with Sri Lanka.

As it was correctly mentioned by the Hon. Minister, the purpose of the MUSSD is to establish, maintain and disseminate the National Measurement Standards in compliance with international standards, ensuring justice and equality for producers, traders, metrological and other service providers and consumers through the regulatory and service activities based on measurements to uplift the quality of life and living standards of Sri Lanka.

However, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Business and Commerce was able to denote and uncover certain shortcomings within the Department and has issued certain recommendations, most of which were highlighted in my Report to the House yesterday and some of which I shall mention here.

As it was very correctly mentioned by one of our Members of the Committee, the Hon. Harshana Rajakaruna, with regard to the lack of staff, problems in fuel dispensing and easy access to services from the Department, the Committee offered several recommendations to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and also with respect to the enacting of a revision of the said Regulations, specifically those with respect to an increment in fees payable towards services rendered by the MUSSD, for providing adequate services in this respect to individuals and business entities which are applicable to these Regulations. In addition, it also strongly recommends the increase of cadre positions within the measurement service to ensure that these Regulations are properly enacted and the standards adopted by the said Department are enforced in all aspects.

The primary reason behind the increment of fees payable is that it has not been revised over an extended period of time - for over eight years - and the necessity

1213 1214

for it to be adjusted is, for inflation and providing sustainable revenue towards the Department to ensure continued productivity in operation.

However, there are various by-lines within the Regulation that have a stipulation of fees payable in exchange of services rendered, which are mandatory for those engaged in commerce that requires the examination and verification of weights, measures and weighing or measuring instruments, and these fees were found by the Committee to be applicable and reasonable to be levied against individuals or businesses as payment in exchange for services. Further, the Committee found that the total verification number of measured instruments amounted to 38,808 in the year 2015, with a verification revenue of Rs. 1.37 million.

With respect to increasing the cadre, the Committee found that currently, there is an insufficient number of officers serving as Inspector of Measurement Services and Devices under the Department of Measurement Units, Standards and Services. The Committee is of the strong opinion that it is absolutely necessary to ensure that these said Regulations are followed and enforced and that compliance by all individuals or entities is maintained at all times. Therefore, the Committee strongly recommends to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to address this issue by taking necessary steps to increase the cadre positions of the staff officers, non-staff officers and junior grade officers in order to attach each category of officers to each Divisional Secretarys Division.

There have been only 6,204 raids reported to the Committee with the revenue from raid fines amounting to Rs. 709,250. By ensuring that there is an officer attached to each Divisional Secretarys Division, there would be awareness created among the business society, which utilizes such mechanisms for their trade, to ensure that there are no falsifications or disparity in valuations, and further, the said Regulations are enforced adequately.

Further, Auditor General's Department has furnished a report to the Public Accounts Committee in which it found that as at 31st December 2015, 76 per cent of staff posts, 42 per cent non-staff posts and 33 per cent of junior grade posts have been vacant. I thereby would like to defer to the Hon. Minister of Industry and Commerce to kindly provide clarification on these vacancies, and how his Ministry aims at filling these slots?

Further, in terms of Section 20(1)(a) of the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Act, No. 35 of 1995, all measurement equipment used in trading should be annually verified. Nevertheless, there is currently no methodology in the Department to ensure whether it has been done accordingly. I urge the Hon. Minister to ensure that these compliance methodologies are followed.

In 2011, it was reportedly planned to set up a computer network linking the Head Office and District Offices. Only the distribution of computers to 13 district offices had been done by 31st December 2012, and had not even been implemented by 31st December 2015. I understand they are taking necessary action to overcome this situation.

There is a lag or improper maintenance of journals and registers pertaining to the financial statements.

As per the Auditor-General's Report, the following registers had not been properly paid up to 31st December 2014: Register of Fixed Assets; Register of Fixed Assets for Computers, Accessories and Software; Register of Losses; Register of Liabilities; Bid Calling Register.

Therefore, Sir. I request the House to review the recommendations by the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Business and Commerce and I urge the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to implement such recommendations at the earliest.

While winding up, Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to bring to your attention and to the attention of the Hon. Prime Minster, that while lauding the recognition and enactment of legislation towards allowing for Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committees by His Excellency the President, Maithripala Sirisena's Government, and that of being proposed and effectuated by the Hon. Prime Minister, there are a few administrative and departmental shortcomings that I witness as Chairman of my Committee and which my fellow Members have voiced as well, that I would like to present to you. Hence, I request a convenient time from you Sir and the Hon. Prime Minister to do so, and I am sure other fellow Chairpersons of other Sectoral Oversight Committees would join me in resonating the same.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 5 . [.. 6.22] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) , . .

The Hon. Minister has introduced a new fees structure for various services that is to be provided by the Department of Measurement Units, Standards and Services. This Department has a very long history of serving the consumers in this country, particularly relating to calibration services, measurement units and standards. This is a matter of routine that needs to be passed by this House. In the meantime, I would like to deal with certain issues relating to the Consumer Protection Authority since that matter comes within the overall purview of this Ministry.

Sir, one particular issue I would like to deal with is the recent announcement by the Ministry of Health where they have introduced colour coding for soft drinks in order to prevent excessive sugar consumption by consumers in this country, which results in the increase of diabetic patients. In order to control this spread or this non-communicable disease, the Ministry of Health has taken a very welcome move to introduce this colour coding for soft drinks which I believe is an initial measure. I am sure they will follow the same pattern to other consumable items which can contain excessive sugar in their production.

I would like to ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to support the Ministry of Health in this initiative by preparing an enforcement mechanism. I am sure that there has been some objections by certain manufacturers regarding the new measure that the Ministry of Health has introduced. While welcoming that measure, I think the Consumer Protection Authority, which comes under the Hon. Ministers Ministry, must support by having an enforcement mechanism to ensure that the colour coding regulations are followed and those violators are punished; otherwise, this may not work.

While saying this I must also say that our country has a per capita sugar consumption of almost 31 kilos per person, which is very high considering the regional standards and even world standards. We are a country,

which imports almost 92 per cent of our sugar and we are only producing locally about 8 per cent of the sugar. The Hon. Minister and I are quite aware about the difficulties that the sugarcane farmers are faced with, in areas where sugarcane farming is going on.

I would like to say a few words in Tamil regarding that because that must get recorded, so that, tomorrow at least these matters will be reported.
