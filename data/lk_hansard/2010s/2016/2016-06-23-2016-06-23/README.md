[2.29p.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. We are debating an important Bill, the Right to Information Bill in the House today. This Bill should have been brought to Parliament a long time ago, but unfortunately, that did not happen. The Right to Information Law has been passed in many countries world over and is considered as a very important piece of legislation. I am happy, Sir, to speak a few words when this Bill is being debated in our Parliament.

The right to information, Sir, strengthens Fundamental Rights. It strengthens democracy and consequently it strengthens the citizens. I would like to say a few words behind the rationale of this Bill. It is the people who are sovereign and sovereignty is vested in the people. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, legislative power, executive power and judicial power. It also includes franchise and Fundamental Rights. Various institutions exercise these powers on behalf and in the name of the people. The doctrine of separation of powers is meant to ensure that these powers of governance are exercised by the different institutions of governance: the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary, independent of each other and without any interference with each other. That is fundamental to preserve democracy. It is also fundamental to preserve the sovereignty of the people. If the people are to meaningfully contribute towards the preservation of their sovereignty and the preservation of democracy, they need to be properly informed of all that is happening in the country, particularly in relation to matters of governance. It may not be practical for all of them to be well informed. But it is important that at least those amongst them, who are more civic conscious than others, who may be more enlightened than others, should be able in the name of the people to obtain reliable and accurate information pertaining to matters of governance.

The Government, Sir, is a trustee for a period of time performing certain functions and duties in the name of the people, for and on behalf of the people, and these duties cannot be performed shrouded in a veil of secrecy, away from the public eye and away from public scrutiny. Such scrutiny is possible only when the public is well informed and correctly informed. Therein lies, Sir, the rationale behind this Bill, the need for this law, which gives the right to the public to such information.

For far too long in this country have Governments carried on as if they were not answerable to the people who placed them in that position of trust. They only became answerable to them, perhaps at the time when elections were held. So, this law should substantially contribute towards the reversal of this trend. This law should facilitate effective curbs being imposed on extravagance, waste and corruption. It will also help to ensure that public finance voted by this Parliament is expended for the purpose for which such expenditure was sanctioned by this House and is not misspent in any way. We have good reason to believe, Sir, that this had become a frequent practice in the past.

This law can prevent the concealment of information, the revelation of which would be in the public interest. I would like to say, Sir, that if this law is to achieve its objectives, certain values and principles must be observed by persons responsible for the implementation of this law. It is the culture in our country for every institution to be politicized. Even the Judiciary in this country, which

1453 1454

was held in high esteem, in fact, held in the highest esteem at one point of time, no longer enjoys the same reputation for its independence and impartiality. The rule of law has consequently become a casualty and consequently, the country has suffered much damage. Today, there is even a demand for foreign judges to ensure that justice is done and many people seem to think that justice can be done only if there are foreign judges.

The institutions established under this law should be able to function independently and fearlessly. If the objective of this law should be achieved, politicians should refrain from fiddling with the implementation of this law. If the true objective of this law should be achieved, that should not happen.

Soliciting information can relate to many matters of public activity in several areas commencing from even non-observance of constitutional provisions to callous discrimination and injustice in several functions of Government, which the public of this country would definitely frown upon, if they were well informed. Of course, the Bill itself provides for certain types of information pertaining to specified matters which cannot be disclosed and which are exempt from the right to information. Such exemptions would largely be, however, only in the national interest. I have with me, Sir, a copy of the Right to Information Act of 2005 passed by the Indian Parliament, the law that prevails in India, where they have referred to this question of exemptions.

They say in the Preamble, I quote:

AND WHEREAS democracy requires an informed citizenry and transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to contain corruption and to hold Governments and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed;

AND WHEREAS revelation of information in actual practice is likely to conflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the Governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information;

AND WHEREAS it is necessary to harmonise these conflicting interests while preserving the paramountcy of the democratic ideal;

NOW, THEREFORE, it is expedient to provide for furnishing certain information to citizens who desire to have it.

In other words, Sir, while emphasizing that there is a need to exempt from the right to information certain activities in the national interest, they also specified the fact that while that is done you must necessarily preserve the paramountcy of the democratic ideal, which means that the sovereignty of the people must be preserved and that there should be harmony between these various interests in such a way that the national interest is not harmed, but at the same time, the publics right to know the truth is not concealed, is not done away with.

Revelation of information should not result in harm to the public interest. But, at the same time, the immense good to the public interest that results from revelation of information must not be sacrificed. That would be, Sir, the correct balance that can be drawn.

Institutions established under this law have a very responsible task. One can only hope that in this countrys interest, this law will be fearlessly and impartially implemented by the institutions responsible for the implementation of this law and that consequently, the people of this country would be able to realize good governance, clean governance, transparent governance and this country would be set on a different course in the future as a result of all aspects of governance becoming a matter of knowledge to the public on the basis of information that can be elicited under this law.

Sir, the Sri Lanka Press Institute has given me a list of certain discrepancies that prevail between the English text and the Sinhala text of the Bill. Since, eventually, it is the Sinhala text that will prevail, I am tabling* that document to enable the Hon. Minister and his staff to look at these various discrepancies that have been referred to between the English text and the Sinhala text so that they make the necessary corrections when we meet at the Committee Stage tomorrow.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [.. 2.46] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Ashok Abeysinghe - Deputy Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation) . .

[5.15p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on one of the most important Bills. I am very happy, indeed, that this Bill was moved by our Hon. Prime Minister. Actually, when we speak of democracy, the essence of democracy is giving the right of information to the people. I think, this struggle has been going on for ages, years and years, without having a Bill being passed in this regard.

When you speak especially of the South Asian countries, you know, in most of them, many problems have arisen politically and otherwise. Without a Bill like

1503 1504

2016 23

this and without information coming out even in media, people are unable to find out, unable to think and unable to decide on their future. In fact, I think, real democracy would be coming into our country only after passing this Bill, because everybody wants to find out what the Government is doing; what the Departments are doing and what the officials are doing.

However, when you go through the history of Right to Information you can see that maximum effort has been taken earlier but it has never been fulfilled. I would like to refer to the struggle made in this regard since 1996. I think, in 1996, this was brought up as "Freedom of Information Bill"; then this was in included in the Proposed Constitutional Reform Package in 2000; in 2003, this was brought as "Right to Information Bill" and finally this was included in the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 2015. I can remember very well when I was associated with the late Hon. Dharmasiri Senanayake, former Minister, he tried his level best, but he too failed. Later on, the Government of Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga also tried and it also failed. I can remember one of the former leaders saying If you want to know information, you may come to me. I will give you. That was the setup of the earlier Government.

However, we can say now press also will have more freedom to come out with actual facts, so that the people of this country would know what we are doing and what the Government is doing. So, after this Bill is passed, true and accurate information can be handed over to the public. In this respect, just think of the problems that countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Burma face. People are not aware of what is happening in their own country; people do not know the actual facts. Because of that, many problems have cropped up and they face difficulties even in making their living.

Specially, Sir, because of this Bill, wastage of State resources, corruption and all such things could be curtailed, prevented or stopped. If an issue of corruption or wastage comes up, now what happens? In a way, it is covered by some people. But, with this Bill being passed - definitely it will come into effect within a few days - people can take the necessary action against the respective Ministers or officials. I am sure, after this RTI Bill is passed, millions of money in every Ministry and office could be saved and our country can move forward. Therefore, I am very happy indeed to associate with this Debate and to support the passing of this Bill. After having this Bill passed, the country can move forward with the help of all the people coming out with the truth and that is very important indeed. Sir, now what happens is, some information is not let out. Then, what happens is, information comes out in so many other ways to finally see that all those are false.

Therefore, I must especially thank the Hon. Prime Minister for bringing in this Bill, so that the future

generation will also be benefited and then, we can lead a peaceful life. Sir, why I say so is, even if a murder or a burglary or something like that is committed, true information is not given. When true information is not given some other innocent person will get apprehended. Therefore, by having this Bill passed, I am sure all such matters could be corrected in the future.

Thank you very much.
