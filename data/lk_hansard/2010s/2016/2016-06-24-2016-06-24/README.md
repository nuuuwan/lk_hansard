RIGHT TO INFORMATION BILL [ 23 ] ' '' [ ] . . - [ 23] " " [ ] . Order read for resuming Adjourned Debate on Question - [ 23rd, June ] "That the Bill be now read a Second time".- [ The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe ] Question again proposed.

[11.13 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for permitting me to participate in this Debate that has been resumed today on the Right to Information Bill. This is an important watershed, I believe, in the history of democratic reforms in this country. The attempt to legislate and ensure freedom of information has at least two decades of history, because in 1996 the Sri Lanka Law Commission at that time presented a draft Freedom of Information Bill as there was clamour that the right to information must be granted through Statute and made a legal right. In the early '90s, there were several attempts and the Law Commission tasked with that function drafted this Bill. However, unfortunately it was never presented to Parliament. In 2002, again there was a bi-partisan effort to introduce a Freedom of Information Law and there were attempts at drafting a Bill for that purpose and a draft Right to Information Bill, I understand, was approved by the Cabinet in the year 2004. However, with the sudden change of Government that came about in 2004 that effort was also stultified.

In 2010, the present Speaker, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya brought in a Private Members' Bill which was the 2003 draft of the then UNP Government and initially the Government of the day persuaded Hon. Jayasuriya to withdraw the Bill with the assurance that the Government will bring a Government Bill on Freedom of Information. But having given that assurance, that Government did not make any effort to present a Bill and therefore in June 2011, Hon. Jayasuriya reintroduced that Bill and it was defeated with a vote of 99 Members voting against the introduction of that Bill and only 32 Members voting for it. I am glad that today several of those Members who sat in the then Government and voted against Hon. Jayasuriya bringing that Bill are seated in the front row of the Government nodding vigorously at what I am saying and are in support of enacting this Bill. Such is the vicissitudes of political alliances dictating to one's policies and consciences. Nevertheless, it is - () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Special Assignment) Hon. Member, may I interrupt you for one minute? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. I am glad that you -

1569 1570

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Chairman, we have nothing to hide. We took up the position that it was a matter for the Government to propose to Parliament. That is why we voted against that Bill, not that we were against the contents of the Bill. If you look at the Hansard of that time, you will find - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Nevertheless, the Government never brought that Bill. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We were in the process of bringing that Bill when Hon. Karu Jayasuriya brought it as a Private Member's Bill. That was subsumed under the general position regarding Private Members' Bills and Government Business. That is really what happened. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Anura Dissanayake. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , . . . , . , , , . . , . , . . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank the Chief Opposition Whip for clarifying that situation and I fully concur with the sentiments that he

expressed. But, I am also thankful to the Hon. Minister for Special Assignments because when I made references to policies and consciences swaying, I did not make any reference to any particular Member. I am glad that he put the cap on his head that fitted him and identified himself. As the Chief Opposition Whip just stated to the House, it was a law point for this House that day when it voted against the right of a Private Member to introduce a Bill. Having delayed it six months, the rules are that if the Government does not enact or bring in a Bill on the urgings of a Private Member for six months, the Private Member is entitled to present a Bill and there should have been a debate on the Bill and a vote taken on the Bill; not on the question as to whether he was entitled to introduce a Bill and that was the lowest that this House went to and I am surprised and saddened that that conduct is also being sought to be justified today.

Nevertheless, this is an auspicious moment. We can forget your wrong doings in the past and welcome your present movement in the right direction and the right direction is that today you are presenting a Bill which has the right to information given to a citizen as a matter of right in law. In the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution also, a welcome provision was introduced as Article 14A which made it a Fundamental Right through legislation in Parliament to enable a procedure by which right to information would be guaranteed. That is not to say that right to information was not available before, because under Article 14 (1)(a), the Supreme Court in several cases had previously declared that the right to information as a Fundamental Right that existed - because they subsumed within that right, Article 14A, - stating that if a person has a right to disseminate information, then he must necessarily have the right to receive information and on that basis, the Supreme Court has ruled several determinations on Bills - Sri Lanka Broadcasting Authority Bill and various other determinations on Bills - that the right to receive information was in fact a Fundamental Right.

But in the Nineteenth Amendment under Article 14A, very specifically, a provision was made enabling the introduction of a law that would prescribe the procedures, the limitations and the scope of the right to information.

I also wish to refer to an unfortunate event in the Determination of this Bill we are debating now. In our Constitution, there are certain Fundamental Rights, the operation of which can be restricted on certain grounds. The exercise and operation of those Fundamental Rights maybe restricted, sometimes, on the grounds of national security, public order, protection of public heath or morality, securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and so on and so forth. Those grounds on which the exercise and operation of certain Fundamental Rights "maybe" restricted are listed in Article 15. (7). When this Bill originally went to the Supreme Court for determination - I would also disclose

1571 1572

2016 24

the fact that I appeared in the determination of this Bill in the Supreme Court - there was an argument advanced that there must be more restrictions placed in this Bill, that there must be more exemptions to the general principle of providing information, and it was pointed out that restrictions, if Parliament so wishes, "maybe" brought on account of certain grounds, but that Parliament is not mandated by the Constitution to enact restrictions. This, I say, is a serious difference between the two. There is no necessity, no obligation mandatorily for Parliament to enact restrictions to the exercise and operation of any Fundamental Right. Parliament is permitted to bring in certain restrictions.

Unfortunately, in the Determination that had been made, the Supreme Court has said that certain restrictions must be brought and that relates to the Judiciary. That is a more unfortunate fact, that it must be brought and that if it is not brought, you need a Referendum to pass it because it violates Article 4 of the Constitution. It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court lost sight of the fact that what the Constitution states about providing restrictions to the exercise and operation of any Fundamental Right are permitted restrictions. Parliament is permitted; Parliament may, if it thinks fit, bring those restrictions in the interest of various considerations, not that Parliament must or that Parliament is obligated to and that fundamental distinction has been lost sight of by the Supreme Court when it made the Determination in respect of this Bill. I am stating that for the record. Nevertheless, I believe the Government has decided to act in accordance - that is the right thing to do - with the flawed Determination of the Supreme Court in this case and is bringing in Committee Stage Amendments with regard to the Judiciary.

There are certain concerns though with this Bill and some of those are with regard to lack of clarity.

So, I would urge the Government, at this stage, to consider addressing that when you appoint the Right to Information Commission. Clause 12 of the Bill states, I quote:

In making such recommendations, the Constitutional Council shall recommend one person nominated by each of the following organizations

So, there are three organizations or categories of organizations put as (a), (b) and (c) and the Clause states that the Constitutional Council must consider the recommendation of one person from each of those organizations. The first is the Bar Association of Sri Lanka. There is no problem because that is a definite entity; we all know where the Bar Association of Sri Lanka is. But, (b) states organizations of publishers, editors and media persons, which is far too vague. There can be hundreds, if not thousands of such bodies and how is the Constitutional Council to receive the recommendation of one name from that organization? The main Clause states organization. But, (b) opens it

out to hundreds, if not thousands of organizations. Then, (c) is even worse. It states other civil society organizations. The Constitutional Council is supposed to pick one name recommended by the organizations that is listed in (c). ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) So, what is your suggestion? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) My suggestion is, obviously, there must be a definite organization named. I mean, the English is bad; I am sure the Sinhala and the Tamil are also bad. You say, You pick from each of the three organizations listed below and then give, in the plural, the possibility of thousands of organizations. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, you are complying with the Bar Association. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Bar Association is fine - (a) is all right because that is one organization. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We agree on that. But, the others do not have such a monolithic organization. That is the problem. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is true, I agree. But, when you say you receive one name from (a), one name from (b) and one name from (c) and in (b) and (c), you list the possibility of thousands of organizations, it might become unworkable and that is the point I am making. Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Minister of City Planning and Water Supply just asked me what my suggestion was. Since it has been the policy of the Government that it must present the Bill, which was stated just now, why do you not present a Bill that is workable? When a Private Member presented a Bill that had all of this perfectly drafted, you ousted that and then you are presenting a Bill that is unworkable in parts. I am only saying in parts because the whole object of the Bill is most welcome and we would like this to work, not be hindered from working through various technicalities because if the Right to Information Commission is not

1573 1574

appointed, then the rest of the Bill becomes useless. Sir, may I know how much time do I have? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have 10 minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

There are several other provisions that are vague. Clause 43 - "Interpretation" - defines, I quote:

non governmental organization means any organization formed by a group of persons on a voluntary basis and receiving funds directly or indirectly from the Government or international organizations and is of a non governmental nature;

We all know what a "non-governmental organization" is. If you merely say a non-governmental organization, I suppose, under the present regime, there is a requirement to register a non-governmental organization and therefore, that can be identified. But, that is not the only test here. There is an additional test that will identify what a "non-governmental organization" is, as defined by this Bill. That is, "receiving funds directly or indirectly from the Government or international organizations".

I suggest that that is also a rather vague description that might result in various organizations not being brought into the definition and being able to move out.

Additionally, the issue arises as to why private groupings of persons are being brought into the ambit of this Bill. The Government has an obligation to be transparent; it has an obligation to disclose information apart from information that is sensitive or should be held in secret for various legitimate reasons, but there must be this space for private persons also to form associations - that is there in Article 14 of the Constitution, in any case - with like-minded persons, the freedom of association. The freedom of association should necessarily incorporate within it the right to have certain matters within your private realm - as much as a private person is entitled to a circle within which he has the right, by law or even by implication of the law, not to allow others to invade. I should not be dictated as to what tie I should wear to Parliament, except, of course, there is a colour prescription. We know that in courts, you wear a black tie. - [Interruption.] There are many shades of black that lawyers wear. - [Interruption.] Yes, that is right. Even if it is a black tie, no one can tell me, "You must wear this black tie and not that black tie". There is a circle of self-determination, as it were, that entitles private persons to make certain decisions privately. If you take a family, what they must have for breakfast, what they must have

for lunch and what they must have for dinner, I do not think the neighbour or the people down the road should prescribe. There is a circle of decision making within that family. Similarly, when you grant a right of private association, that right envisages a certain circle of private activity into which there should not be invasion even by the State. - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. Deputy Minister? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Karunarathna Paranawithana - Deputy Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media) Hon. Member, why we included these associations in this Bill is, simply because this is applicable only to the associations which receive public funds. They become public authorities. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right. That is what I started with. Your definition states that. There is a justification for that, I am not denying that. All that I am saying is, if that be the objective, there must be a clearer definition. Merely saying "directly or indirectly" leaves the door wide open for horses to bolt and mules to be brought in and tied up. So, you need to be careful when the law is drafted. If specific bodies are to be identified, they need to be identified with definiteness. - [Interruption.] That is one concern.

I am just raising another concern about the private activity. Will this invade the space? That is my only concern. Insofar as they receive public funds, yes, I agree with you. They also must be bound by a transparency provision to disclose to the public what they do with that money and their activity. But, will the vagueness in this definition open the room to pry into even legitimate private activity of entirely private associations? ( ) (The Hon. Karunarathna Paranawithana) This is only with regard to public activity. Other than that, they are not supposed to disclose all the other details. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Your mike is not on. ( ) (The Hon. Karunarathna Paranawithana) They are not supposed to disclose all the other details apart from the details pertaining to work done with public funds.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you. I wanted you to state that for record and for the reason that I would like to have that assurance from the Hon. Deputy Minister in charge of the subject. Nevertheless, as you know, when the matter comes up for interpretation in courts, Parliamentary Debates are not a source. You cannot say that the Hon. Minister gave this assurance. Only in the interpretation of the Constitution can you can rely on Parliamentary Debates. So, we have that problem. Therefore, if adequate clarification can be brought in, even today, by way of a Committee Stage Amendment, I would welcome that.

With those comments, I will wind up my speech. Sir, I thank you for the opportunity given to me.

Hon. Presiding Member, it is a matter of regret that Sri Lanka being a nation that is almost in the forefront of all the social indicators, when it comes to Millennium Development Goals or Sustainable Development Goals in the region, happen to be the last or perhaps one of the last to be enacting this all-important legislation which empowers the citizen, which enthrones the voter to enable him to receive that basic information whenever he wants to receive it. Through that we are strengthening good governance; we are ensuring transparency; we are making governance closer to the people. So, ultimately, it is coming to fruition.

But together with that I must also say that a genuine attempt was made by the previous UNP administration - I was part of that administration between 2001 to 2004 - within that two-and-a-half years, a genuine effort was made by the then administration of the Hon. Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe. There we had a worthwhile partner in the Editors' Guild. They were involved in drafting the legislation. We only added and subtracted what needed to be done as a Government but then they were the progenitors. A Bill was prepared by the then Government for wchch we got the Cabinet approval to be presented. But, as Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran said, it was unfortunate that it was not presented to Parliament as a Bill since the then President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, dissolved Parliament prematurely.

However, now we have this Bill before us, and this is a historic moment because it is going to totally change the whole atmosphere of the governance in this country. We will see a total change in the political culture in this country. This country has had several insurrections both in the South and the North - all as a result of lack of transparency in the way we are governed. The normal bureaucratic attitude to deny basic information to the citizen has been the norm and not the exception. So, this whole move to make transparent governance through the Right to Information Bill, will make a paradigm shift in the way we govern this country.

So this has to finally result in changing our attitudes towards the way we wheel the Executive power in this country. So in that process, I reckon it might take a while before we are able to give full effect to the sum total of the intention that is contained within the different paragraphs of this Bill. But yet that will enable us to get rid of corruption at least to a manageable level and then also to make things happen. When it comes to poverty eradication, today a citizen can demand from the Executive information that would ensure that funds

allocated for a particular purpose is spent usefully and properly and a proper value-based audit of these things are done though a system of probity that is going to be installed through this all-important Bill.

This will also further enhance the confidence that minorities have in the governance structure. One reason for certain sections of the society to use violence as a means to achieve political objectives was the fact that there was deep-seated discriminatory practices that was embarked upon by successive governments against minority groups. Hopefully, we can, in the new Constitution, enact a very strong Clause for affirmative action to ensure reversed discrimination - to do away with the discrimination that we have suffered over a long period of time in public sector employment and in our rights for franchise. In a variety of different areas minorities have faced discrimination continuously. So, this Bill will also ensure that every citizen - whatever colour, caste or creed he may belong to - could demand and get information from the Executive to ensure that his rightful place as a citizen and to ensure that his right to equality is properly practised in this country.

I know, Mr. Presiding Member, by nodding you are saying that my time is up. Therefore, in winding up, I must say that in my almost two-decade old career in this House, I realize that today we are passing one of the most important pieces of legislation is history. This is a historic moment. I believe that we will have bipartisan support for this Bill. It may have certain shortcomings. I am sure that those shortcomings could be dealt with as we go along. But, I am sure this Bill itself is a great success story as far as the citizens are concerned and the voter is concerned. Therefore, I am pleased to be part of an Assembly in which we finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Thank you. [.. 2.01]

Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, that is what we are proposing. Hon. Sumanthiran may defend by saying that the Bar Association should be the sole body to nominate such a person to the

Commission. That is a different opinion. But there is an opinion in the country that it should not solely rest on the Bar Association. The Bar Association wavers. I am sorry, I can criticize the Bar Association because I am not a member of the Bar Association. The Bar Associations shifts, my good Friend, the Leader of the Opposition knows that. As time goes on, a wave comes and they go with the wave. At times, the wave recedes and they withdraw from the wave. So, this type of an Association should not have the sole authority to nominate a person to the Commission. It should be a Commission which should stand on its own to dispose of this very responsible task in relation to the right to information. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the OPA - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) What happened to the OPA? It was in the first draft. I have seen the first draft. Why did you drop the Organization of Professional Associations which was there in the first draft? I do not want to question any further. It has been dropped. I do not know what the reason is. Nobody has given a reason. I can quote from the original draft.

So, we have had the experience of experts from other civil organizations who have come in. That is a very good proposition that is being made.

I am sorry to say that in every Sunday newspaper, I notice that there are criticisms on the Constitutional Council. It was even pinpointed by the UN experts who came to Sri Lanka, in their Report that you all have not kept the Constitutional Council at very high standards by appointing political nominees. This is the whole problem. We appoint commissions - even, this is a commission that is being brought in. But if we go to pack a commission with yes-men, it does not make any change. This is the most serious issue that is before the country today.
