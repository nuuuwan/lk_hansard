I might say that it was the enactment of the 1972 Constitution that paved the way for the demand for a separate State.

Effective democracy and the making of a Constitution in keeping with the consensus of the whole nation were subverted by majoritarianism. The views of the distinct peoples who constituted the nation were regarded as irrelevant. This is precisely why, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that even almost seven decades after Independence, we have failed to evolve into a single Sri Lankan nation. This country has had the unfortunate experience of being ruled under Constitutions which did not have the consensus or the consent of all its people. If all the peoples in this country are to evolve into a single nation, the Sri Lankan nation, this grave error needs to be corrected.",

The war has come to an end and more importantly, there is no longer a demand for a separate State. The demand for a separate State was given up even before the war came to an end. The Tamil people have at successive elections - Parliamentary, provincial and local authority elections - after 1987 clearly confirmed and democratically endorsed that definite policy.

That, Sir, would be the greatest day in this countrys history, the day on which all the people in this country would have come together to form the Sri Lankan nation - where and in which country every citizen has a sense of belonging to Sri Lanka and a sense that Sri Lanka belongs to him or her together with his or her fellow citizens. I would very earnestly urge all Hon. Members of this House to wholeheartedly participate and support this initiative across party or other divisions in keeping with universal values and constitutional arrangements that prevail in several countries the world over in circumstances and conditions similar to what prevails in Sri Lanka, so that this country can march towards genuine reconciliation, peace and prosperity with a better and brighter future for all our people.",

He himself has taken steps towards remaking the Constitution so as to address the national question. There have also been instances when he did the right thing. He would pave for himself a new future if he now did the right thing by being positive in the making of a new, just and equitable Constitution that also resolves the national issue and serves the country.",

Both the Governments of that day - the United Front Government in the early 1970s and thereafter the UNP Government that came in 1977 - had the requisite two-thirds in Parliament and therefore, what they enacted as a Constitution for the whole country merely mirrored their own versions; what for that time being they thought was good, not for the country but what they thought was expedient, was enacted as a Constitution. Most importantly, in both those procedures, the Tamil-speaking people of this country, particularly the Tamils, were left out.",

As I stated while he was speaking, when he accused the Tamil National Alliance of not being close to our people, not getting involved with the day-today difficulties and the problems that they face, the reason is the Sinhala newspapers do not publish any of those stories.

We must realize this and accommodate all the different communities, all the different peoples of this country by granting them equal status, never mind what their numbers are. The type of Constitution that we were given, Ceylon Independence Act in 1947, gave us a system of simple majority rule and that is what gave rise to majoritarianism. What some people do not realize today is that what they call a \"unitary State\" is actually a majoritarian State. Because if you implement one important aspect of democracy, which is majority rule, in a heterogeneous country like ours, where there is a permanent majority and permanent minorities, all the time it is the will of the majority that prevails. That is why it was possible in 1949 to deprive a section of our people of their citizenship itself - their absolute fundamental right to be a citizen of this country. People who had voted in the first election, who were able to elect seven representatives to Parliament, were deprived of their franchise because they did not have the majority in numbers. That was repeated in 1956 when the Official Language Act was passed. Because of the fact that one people have an overwhelming majority in the country in matters that affect them and the permanent minority peoples - I am using the word minority only in terms of numbers; those who are minority in number - it is always the will of the majority that prevails.",

When such an adjustment is made, even those who are smaller in numbers are able to exercise governmental power at least in the areas in which they live substantially in numbers. Then, there can be a balance that is struck. Then, it is possible for all these peoples to live together as one country because they share power in an equitable way, not leave it to one Centre that decides overridingly what happens to the others and they have no say whatever because they are minority in numbers. This is a fundamental thing and the world has had different ways in countries in which different peoples live and they are able to share power and live together.",

You cannot hold on to them and insist that your writ must run in their lives too. That was sought to be changed. This fundamental flaw was addressed in the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord. I heard the Hon. Anura Dissanayake say that all the Agreements have had foreign pressures. I would like to ask him the question what foreign pressure was there for the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact? What foreign pressure was there for the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact? There was no foreign pressure. But, two Prime Ministers of this country, great leaders of this country, made Pacts with the leader of the Tamil people but failed to keep those promises; they failed to honour those Pacts. ( ) (An Hon. Member) They were not allowed to. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) When they failed to do that, the Tamil people could do nothing, because we were small in numbers. That is when we appeal to the outside world; we have to. If you do not do the right thing by us, you cannot expect us to fold our hands and collapse; we will not do that. That is when our youth took to arms. You cannot expect that you can do this - write, sign pacts, tear them up - and then expect us to be meek and mild and be obedient. No, that will not happen and that did not happen. But, now we have come a long way from that.",

So, the Constitution is quite clear for anybody who is able to read.

The provisions of the Standing Orders talk about a Committee of the whole House. Technically, this is not a Committee of the whole House, but it is by Resolution. You can either do it by Standing Orders or by Resolution, but the end result is the same thing. How does that change?",

The Constitution itself states that when there is a Bill for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. You only have to read Article 120 (b). It very specifically states, the moment the Cabinet of Ministers certifies that it is a Bill for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, the Supreme Court shall not exercise any further jurisdiction. It is quite logical. Do you not think so? The only point that the Supreme Court can ever rule when a Bill is challenged is whether it is inconsistent with the Constitution. If you are replacing the Constitution, by definition, it is inconsistent with this Constitution. If it is inconsistent with the Constitution, the Supreme Court can only say - the Court cannot say that it cannot be enacted - that you must place it before the people at a Referendum. The Resolution contains the certificate of the Cabinet of Ministers; that it is intended to be passed by a two-thirds majority and placed before the people at a Referendum. There is no place for the Supreme Court also to rule that you must place it before the people at a Referendum, that is superficial. That is why, when the long title states that it is \"for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution\", Article 120 (b) very specifically states, I quote:",

They will only draft it. They are not going to adopt it like the Constituent Assembly in 1972. It is not a Constituent Assembly. The new Constitution - it is stated very clearly for avoidance of doubt - will be adopted by this Parliament through the procedure that has been laid down in the present Constitution.

Do you agree with the Thirteenth Amendment? I was next to our Prime Minister translating his English and Sinhala into Tamil. So, he replied, Yes, I agree with the Thirteenth Amendment. I want to improve it, but again there was an opposition from the South and you too were not in agreement to that. Even you opposed to it. He was referring to the then Tamil leadership, maybe the LTTE and others, who were not even willing to accept the Thirteenth Amendment.
