Ranil Wickremesinghe] . . Question again proposed. [9.55 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I commence my speech on this historic Resolution that has been brought to Parliament by the Hon. Prime Minister, may I extend to you my warm congratulations on your election as the Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket - quite a prestigious position held by important persons of this country in the past. May I as a Colleague of yours in this Parliament wish you the best in the conduct of your duties as the Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket.

Sir, this country has had three Constitutions thus far. The first has been the Soulbury Constitution enacted by our colonial rulers.

We had the first Republican Constitution in 1972, which brought about several radical changes to the Soulbury Constitution. I will not go into the details of those changes. It would be sufficient for me to state that the main flaw in the 1972 Constitution was that it removed the safeguards provided to minority peoples in the Soulbury Constitution and entrenched majoritarianism.

It was enacted without the consent of the minority people. My Leader, the late Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam - the acknowledged leader of the Tamil people - did not accept the 1972 Constitution. He resigned his Seat in Parliament and wanted a verdict pronounced by the Tamil people on whether the 1972 Constitution was acceptable to them or not. The verdict of the people was overwhelmingly clear. They rejected the 1972 Constitution. I might say that it was the enactment of the 1972 Constitution that paved the way for the demand for a separate State. It was not long before the 1972 Constitution was replaced by the second Republican Constitution of 1978. This too was enacted without the consensus of the Tamil people. The 1978 Constitution too entrenched majoritarianism.

The main objectives of the 1978 Constitution were the installation of the Executive Presidency and the introduction of a new electoral system - the Proportional Representation System. Both in 1972 and 1978 the Governments of the day were able to muster a two-thirds majority on their own and were able to enact the Constitutions, as desired exclusively by them without the need to look for a national consensus. Effective democracy and the making of a Constitution in keeping with the consensus of the whole nation were subverted by majoritarianism. The views of the distinct peoples who constituted the nation were regarded as irrelevant. This is precisely why, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that even almost seven decades after Independence, we have failed to evolve into a single Sri Lankan nation. This country has had the unfortunate experience of being ruled under Constitutions which did not have the consensus or the consent of all its people. If all the peoples in this country are to evolve into a single nation, the Sri Lankan nation, this grave error needs to be corrected.

Over the past several decades, we have experienced several dire consequences of this failure to evolve a Constitution based on consensus. There has even been a demand for a separate State. We have had a war that has raged for over two-and-a-half decades. The war went through various phases. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Members, please be seated in your

respective seats. Otherwise, you can leave the Chamber and have your discussions outside. Thank you very much.

Hon. Sampanthan, please continue your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I do not think there is a need to state too much about the war, Sir, except to state that this vicious war pushed the country backwards at least a further 50 years and caused immense suffering to all its people, particularly the Tamil people. The war has come to an end and more importantly, there is no longer a demand for a separate State. The demand for a separate State was given up even before the war came to an end. The Tamil people have at successive elections - Parliamentary, provincial and local authority elections - after 1987 clearly confirmed and democratically endorsed that definite policy. And it is in this background that there is no longer a demand for a separate State and it is also in this background that we are seeking to resolve the national issue within the framework of a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka. It is within this framework that we are looking at a new Constitution that will also resolve the national question.

I might read the relevant paragraphs of this Resolution, Sir, which state, I quote:

AND WHEREAS the People have at the Presidential Election held on 08th January, 2015 given a clear mandate for establishing a political culture that respects the rule of law and strengthens democracy;

AND WHEREAS His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka has clearly expressed his desire to give effect to the will of the People expressed at the aforesaid Presidential Election by enacting a new Constitution that, inter alia, abolishing the Executive Presidency;

AND WHEREAS it has become necessary to enact a new Constitution that, inter alia, abolishes the Executive Presidency, ensures a fair and representative Electoral System which eliminates preferential voting, strengthens the democratic rights of all citizens, provides a Constitutional Resolution of the national issue, promotes national reconciliation, establishes a political culture that respects the rule of law, guarantees to the Peoples fundamental rights and freedom that assure human dignity and promotes responsible and accountable government. There can be, surely, no dispute, Sir, of the urgent necessity to fulfil these needs and there can also be no question that the people of this country have given to President Maithripala Sirisena and to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe a mandate to fulfil these urgent needs. That position, Sir, is abundantly clear.

All the Members of this House are going to come together, discuss every issue and devise a new Constitution that will achieve the total or maximum consensus in this House, which, after Cabinet approval, will have to be approved by Parliament by a two-thirds majority - which is achievable only by cutting across

47 48

party divisions - and which must also be approved by the people at a Referendum cutting across ethnic, linguistic or any other divisions. Then, this country will, for the first time, have a Constitution based upon not merely consensus within this House, but also consensus amongst the people in this country based upon the sovereignty vested in the people. That, Sir, would be the greatest day in this countrys history, the day on which all the people in this country would have come together to form the Sri Lankan nation - where and in which country every citizen has a sense of belonging to Sri Lanka and a sense that Sri Lanka belongs to him or her together with his or her fellow citizens. I would very earnestly urge all Hon. Members of this House to wholeheartedly participate and support this initiative across party or other divisions in keeping with universal values and constitutional arrangements that prevail in several countries the world over in circumstances and conditions similar to what prevails in Sri Lanka, so that this country can march towards genuine reconciliation, peace and prosperity with a better and brighter future for all our people.

I want to make a special appeal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa - unfortunately he is not here now. He has the stature of a national leader and his support in this national endeavour is important. The country, all its people and the nation need his support. It would be my submission, Sir, that he needs to place the interests and the well-being of the country before anything else and positively contribute to this initiative. He himself has taken steps towards remaking the Constitution so as to address the national question. There have also been instances when he did the right thing. He would pave for himself a new future if he now did the right thing by being positive in the making of a new, just and equitable Constitution that also resolves the national issue and serves the country.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena have referred to many matters, many missed opportunities in the course of their speeches. President Maithripala Sirisena referred to the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact, the Dudley Senanayake - Chelvanayakam Pact and the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. The said three documents contained vitally important commitments made by national leaders of the greatest stature.

Leaders such as the much-respected Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the much-respected Hon. Dudley Senanayake and the much-respected President J. R. Jayewardene made very positive contributions through their commitments in those three documents to the resolution of the national question.

As pointed out by President Maithripala Sirisena, many things have happened since the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Much work has been done towards framing a new Constitution under different Governments, under different leaders, starting

with President Ranasinghe Premadasa, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Much work has been done.

So, once you have this removed - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) This is our position - ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) This is a matter in regard to which the whole country is in agreement: that there must be an abolition of the Executive Presidency; that there must be reforms in the electoral procedures and - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Of course, we have deliberated this matter at length. So, this is our position. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) The Preferential Voting System must be done away with and that there must be a political solution; a Constitutional Resolution on the national question. All that is there. Why do you want to remove it? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, do not express your views prematurely. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon.

Sir, I would like to quote from the Hansard of 03rd November, 1977. The Hon. Speakers Announcement states: I have nominated the following Members to serve on the Select Committee on Revision of the Constitution, with Mr. J.R. Jayewardene as Chairman: Mr. R. Premadasa Mr. Lalith Athulathmudali Mr. Ronnie de Mel Mr. Gamini Dissanayake Mr. K.W. Devanayagam Mr. M.H.M. Naina Marikar Mr. S. Thondaman Mrs. Sirimavo R.D. Bandaranaike Mr. Maithripala Senanayake.

The Hon. R. Premadasa spoke thereafter appealing to the TULF to serve on the Select Committee. This is recorded in Hansard.

. 1978 . Hon. Leader of the Opposition, with due respect, I would like to quote the particular Motion moved in 1977. , - I refer to Hansard of 20th October, 1977; Column 1764 of Volume 23. . .

That Motion states, I quote:

That a Select Committee of the National State Assembly be appointed to consider the revision of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka and other written law as the Committee may consider necessary.

The Committee and its Chairman shall be appointed by the Speaker.

It contains paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d). That is all; it is very short.

Then, the Select Committee takes over and conducts itself to draft a Constitution. This is what the Joint Opposition's stand is and this, I think, is also the stand of the average Members of the SLFP and the average people of this country. No one is opposed to drafting a new Constitution; no one is opposed to having a discussion; no one is opposed to amending the present Constitution.

The Government did the major mistake of deviating from the foundations of the Constitution by presenting the Resolution that the Hon. Prime Minister read out on the 09th of January, 2016. This is where the difference is and we are moving the relevant amendments to that Resolution. The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha mentioned that the SLFP will also move amendments and he read out the amendments.

I would also like to quote what the Hon. A. Amirthalingam, the Hon. Member for Kankesanthurai, said when that Motion was presented in 1977. How did he react soon after the Hon. R. Premadasa, the Leader of the Assembly, moved the Motion? He said, I have no objection. It is on record.

All of us must protect Parliament's supremacy. Though we represent different political parties, we can together and embark on a constitution-making process. We do not have to go outside the Parliament to do that.

Clause 5 33(1) The President shall be the symbol of National unity.

Mr. Canishka Witharana brought to the notice of Court that the origin of our National Flag is based on a Report of the National Flag Committee. Counsel submitted that in 1979, a Cabinet Memorandum has been submitted by the Minister of State on the use of National Flag and was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 1981. The Code for the use of National Flag prepared by the Cabinet Sub Committee provides that each of us have to think more deeply of the National Flag and when we see our National Flag automatically our shoulders will strengthen, our hearts lift and our thoughts go to our motherland. Thus, the message and the significance of the National Flag is stated as follows:-

'Respect the National Flag and it will inspire you. This is the basic message of the National Flag. It is a message which should reach every Sri Lankan because the National Flag is a symbol of our motherland, our independence and the unity of our people. It is a symbol of our hopes and aspirations in the Nation's future.'

Thus, it has been categorically stated that the National Flag is the symbol of the unity of our People. Considering the above, we are of the view that Paragraph 33 (1) in Clause 5 is incorrect and be deleted."

Towards this end, the President expressed his resolve to continue to implement in particular the relevant provisions of the Constitution designed to strengthen national amity and reconciliation through empowerment.

Both sides agreed that the end of armed conflict in Sri Lanka created a historic opportunity to address all outstanding issues in a spirit of understanding and mutual accommodation imbued with political vision to work towards genuine national reconciliation. In this context, the External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil Parties. A devolution package, building upon the 13th Amendment, would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation.

[1.02 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to speak on this historic occasion. I say, "historic" because we have a Resolution before the House that has been signed by the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe; the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva on behalf of the SLFP; the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Leader of the House; the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress; the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama; the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan; the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Leader of the Jathika Hela Urumaya setting out the purposes for which this country has to enact a new Constitution and thereafter listing out the modalities by which this drafting procedure is to take place.

So far as I can gather from the Debate today, I do not think there is anyone in this House who says that the country does not need a new Constitution, although outside this House there have been pronouncements made that all we require is amendments. I do not hear anyone seriously challenging the proposition that the country does need a new Constitution.

We had the First Republican Constitution in 1972 and the Second Republican Constitution - under which we function now - adopted in 1978. Although these two are called, "Republican Constitutions," speakers from both Sides of the House have already clearly stated how these two Constitutions were made. Both the Governments of that day - the United Front Government in the early 1970s and thereafter the UNP Government that came in 1977 - had the requisite two-thirds in Parliament and therefore, what they enacted as a Constitution for the whole country merely mirrored their own versions; what for that time being they thought was good, not for the country but what they thought was expedient, was enacted as a Constitution. Most importantly, in both those procedures, the Tamil-speaking people of this country, particularly the Tamils, were left out.

If there is a recognition that there live in this country different peoples belonging to different linguistic cultural ethnic groupings, who have different religions and

together there is a mix of rich diversity that must enhance the character of this country, then, certainly, the First and the Second Republican Constitutions must be done away with and we must start from that declared status that all are equal in this country, not just as individual's equality but even as communities, as peoples, they are equal to each other.

That fundamental premise is a sine qua non for this Island to continue as one strong country. It was the non-recognition of that fundamental character of this country that resulted in large amounts of misery, three decades of actual fighting and a conflict that has waged since Independence even to this day. The Constitution cannot grant pre-eminence to one or the other group of people. I am glad His Excellency the President while speaking, after the Resolution was moved, very clearly said that. The Leader of the United National Party moved this Resolution on which His Excellency the President as the Leader of the SLFP as well very clearly enunciated the thought processes last Saturday.

So, we have seen a paradigm shift in the thinking, in the presentation of this Resolution, which has been affirmed by the Leaders of the two main Parties of this country. This is significant because the history of our country, particularly that of Constitution-making and also of various efforts at reconciliation is marred by one Party or the other opposing the initiatives taken by the Party that was in office at that time. This is the first time we have the Leaders of the two Parties clearly enunciating to the country that this must be done and setting out the fundamental or the premise on which we must build a new Constitution.

I heard the Chief Opposition Whip, my Friend, the Hon. Anura Dissanayake stating that the problems faced by the Tamil people are not that of the Constitution but day-to-day affairs, economic difficulties, lack of job opportunities and the like.

Our people face all of that and more particularly, after the cruel war that they had to face for such a long time, the recovery from that has been very, very difficult. For lack of political will, for various other reasons, our people face an enormous amount of day-to-day problems. But that is not the fundamental issue faced by our people. And I am sad that a Party like the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which expounds such progressive thoughts and ideas on other fronts, is not able to see this. They are not able to see it also because of the language divide. As I stated while he was speaking, when he accused the Tamil National Alliance of not being close to our people, not getting involved with the day-today difficulties and the problems that they face, the reason is the Sinhala newspapers do not publish any of those stories. What happens there stays there, and in the Tamil media. What happens here stays here, and limited to the Sinhala media and the converse is also true. If you go to a Tamil-

113 114

[ ]

2016 12

speaking area today and talk to them about some of the developments in the South, particularly by a small group of people who are trying to whip racial tensions in this country, they are totally unaware, because that is not depicted there. So we journey along - whether the Constitution says separation is illegal or not - in fact on the ground as two separate worlds, not meeting in any way.

Now if we are to forge ahead as one country we must realize this. We must realize this and accommodate all the different communities, all the different peoples of this country by granting them equal status, never mind what their numbers are. The type of Constitution that we were given, Ceylon Independence Act in 1947, gave us a system of simple majority rule and that is what gave rise to majoritarianism. What some people do not realize today is that what they call a "unitary State" is actually a majoritarian State. Because if you implement one important aspect of democracy, which is majority rule, in a heterogeneous country like ours, where there is a permanent majority and permanent minorities, all the time it is the will of the majority that prevails. That is why it was possible in 1949 to deprive a section of our people of their citizenship itself - their absolute fundamental right to be a citizen of this country. People who had voted in the first election, who were able to elect seven representatives to Parliament, were deprived of their franchise because they did not have the majority in numbers. That was repeated in 1956 when the Official Language Act was passed. Because of the fact that one people have an overwhelming majority in the country in matters that affect them and the permanent minority peoples - I am using the word minority only in terms of numbers; those who are minority in number - it is always the will of the majority that prevails.

That is why it is important that the system of government must be changed; that it will not be possible for one community to override the others merely because of the strength of their numbers in this country. There must be some fundamental safeguards. When such an adjustment is made, even those who are smaller in numbers are able to exercise governmental power at least in the areas in which they live substantially in numbers. Then, there can be a balance that is struck. Then, it is possible for all these peoples to live together as one country because they share power in an equitable way, not leave it to one Centre that decides overridingly what happens to the others and they have no say whatever because they are minority in numbers. This is a fundamental thing and the world has had different ways in countries in which different peoples live and they are able to share power and live together.

Then, there are other fundamental issues like human rights, which will have to apply to all equally. So, institutions of Government must be so worth that all the different peoples groups have a stake in it and have participation in it.

It is the exclusion of the Tamil students from tertiary educational institutions in the 1970s, coupled with the First Republican Constitution, which effectively alienated the Tamil people from the institution of the State, that resulted in a call for a separate State and it is justifiably so because if you cannot accommodate, if you cannot live together, if you do not have the will to share power with everyone irrespective of their numbers, then you must let them live by themselves. You cannot hold on to them and insist that your writ must run in their lives too. That was sought to be changed. This fundamental flaw was addressed in the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord. I heard the Hon. Anura Dissanayake say that all the Agreements have had foreign pressures. I would like to ask him the question what foreign pressure was there for the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact? What foreign pressure was there for the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact? There was no foreign pressure. But, two Prime Ministers of this country, great leaders of this country, made Pacts with the leader of the Tamil people but failed to keep those promises; they failed to honour those Pacts. ( ) (An Hon. Member) They were not allowed to. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) When they failed to do that, the Tamil people could do nothing, because we were small in numbers. That is when we appeal to the outside world; we have to. If you do not do the right thing by us, you cannot expect us to fold our hands and collapse; we will not do that. That is when our youth took to arms. You cannot expect that you can do this - write, sign pacts, tear them up - and then expect us to be meek and mild and be obedient. No, that will not happen and that did not happen. But, now we have come a long way from that.

From the speech that His Excellency delivered on Saturday and the objectives that are enunciated in this Resolution, it is clear that there is a realization now. At least now, there is a realization that we must change the rules by which we engage, the rules by which we live. That social compact under which the country attained Independence in 1948, where there were safeguards put in, that even Parliament could not pass laws, and that took away rights of certain people or conferred on others rights that were not conferred on everybody. That was done away with through a procedure in 1970 to 1972, which proclaimed that it was an "autochthonous Constitution", but there, "autochthonous" only meant that the people who were majority in numbers of this country had their way and not the others.

In 1978, they followed the procedure that was laid down in the First Republican Constitution: had a Parliamentary Select Committee. As the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena read out portions from the relevant

115 116

Hansard, the TULF stayed away; had to stay away on that occasion. With a five-sixths majority, that Government steamrolled and enacted a Constitution. That should not happen. Today, we are at a stage when history is to be made. The bitter experiences of the past must not be missed. We must learn from that and that is why the leaders of the two main Parties have put this Resolution forward and that is why we are supportive of this procedure.

Now, there is so much talk about this procedure. I was glad that the Hon. Douglas Devananda said, "The discussion in this House is akin to splitting hairs". Everybody wants a new Constitution to be made in terms of what is laid down in the present Constitution, that the present Constitution should not be violated. I do not see anything in the Resolution that has been placed before the House violating the present Constitution. If you care to read Article 74 of the present Constitution, it very specifically gives the power to Parliament, either by Standing Orders or by Resolution, to deal with the matters that Parliament is authorized to deal with and in Article 75, making of a new Constitution is one of the matters that Parliament has been authorized to deal with. So, the Constitution is quite clear for anybody who is able to read. Parliament has been given the power to enact, repeal the Constitution and replace it with a new Constitution and for doing that, it has one of two options - it can it do it under the Standing Orders or by Resolution and the Resolution then will control the whole procedure.

But here, what does the Resolution itself say? The Resolution is not giving this power to somebody else outside. That is semantic to say so. This Resolution is calling on Parliament to form a Constitutional Assembly consisting of the 225 Hon. Members of this Parliament, no one else. The provisions of the Standing Orders talk about a Committee of the whole House. Technically, this is not a Committee of the whole House, but it is by Resolution. You can either do it by Standing Orders or by Resolution, but the end result is the same thing. How does that change?

How does the nature of the Constitutional Assembly in this Resolution change from a Committee of the whole House? It is a Committee of the whole House. Even though Parliament could have resolved otherwise, this Resolution only authorizes Parliament to make a Constitutional Assembly consisting of the Hon. Members of Parliament themselves and no other. Eventually the Resolution clearly states, for the avoidance of doubt, it follows the procedure that is laid down in the Constitution - that there must be a certificate by the Cabinet of Ministers that this is a Bill for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution and that it is intended to be passed by a two-thirds majority and placed before the people at a

Referendum. That is a requirement in this Constitution and the Resolution states so specifically.

I was alarmed when I heard the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena say, We want to go to Court. You cannot go to Court . He says, We want to follow the constitutional procedure. The Constitution itself states that when there is a Bill for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. You only have to read Article 120 (b). It very specifically states, the moment the Cabinet of Ministers certifies that it is a Bill for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, the Supreme Court shall not exercise any further jurisdiction. It is quite logical. Do you not think so? The only point that the Supreme Court can ever rule when a Bill is challenged is whether it is inconsistent with the Constitution. If you are replacing the Constitution, by definition, it is inconsistent with this Constitution. If it is inconsistent with the Constitution, the Supreme Court can only say - the Court cannot say that it cannot be enacted - that you must place it before the people at a Referendum. The Resolution contains the certificate of the Cabinet of Ministers; that it is intended to be passed by a two-thirds majority and placed before the people at a Referendum. There is no place for the Supreme Court also to rule that you must place it before the people at a Referendum, that is superficial. That is why, when the long title states that it is "for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution", Article 120 (b) very specifically states, I quote:

where the Cabinet of Ministers certifies that a Bill, which is described in its long title as being for the amendment of any provisions of the Constitution; or for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, intended to be passed with the special majority required by Article 83 and submitted to the People by Referendum, the Supreme Court shall have and exercise no jurisdiction in respect of such Bill;

You want a new Constitution drafted and adopted in terms of this Constitution. That is your position. If that be so, how can you then say that this matter must to go to the Supreme Court? The present Constitution states you cannot go to the Supreme Court. You must choose one of the two - you must either choose to do it under the Constitution or you must say, "We will stand outside the Constitution and we will go to Court". If you do it under the provisions of this Constitution, there is an expressed prohibition to challenge it in the Supreme Court, as I said, logically so because that long title itself, by definition, is inconsistent with this Constitution and will require a Referendum.

So, therefore, I appeal to the Members of this House, please do not split hairs on a procedure. All of your concerns - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Member, can I - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have only one minute more. You can speak later. - [Interruption.] I have only one minute more. So, please do not disturb me. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) All that will be determined by the Court. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Members of this Parliament have expressed their concerns and I respect and value those concerns. I say with respect, Sir, that all of those concerns are contained in this procedure that has been laid down. It is the Hon. Members of this Parliament who will draft the new Constitution. They will only draft it. They are not going to adopt it like the Constituent Assembly in 1972. It is not a Constituent Assembly. The new Constitution - it is stated very clearly for avoidance of doubt - will be adopted by this Parliament through the procedure that has been laid down in the present Constitution. Therefore, I would like to appeal to those Hon. Members who are seated in the Opposition, who call themselves the Joint Opposition - I do not know why they call themselves the Joint Opposition - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Because we are joined. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Ah, because you all are joined. But, you are not joined with us. Anyway, I appeal to you all. When you were on the other side under President Rajapaksa, he made various efforts to change the fundamental premise of the Constitution. He even singed joint communiqus with international actors and various others saying that this premise will be changed. All of those are in writing. Now, it is true that some of you are on that side and some of you are on this side. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please wind up now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am winding up.

Please do not repeat the grave mistakes that were made in history by the two main Parties. Even though you are part of one main Party, please do not fall into that error yet again. Be statesmanlike and join in this process so that we all can join together and go forward as one country.

Thank you. [.. 1.30] ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) , - , - , . . , . . .

If it contains the same thing, let us go with what everybody - the majority - agreed: Standing Orders 86 (1), 120 and 130. So, there are no differences, if that is

the case. There is no point wasting time. You raise your hands from the Opposition. Our Hon. Members of the SLFP who are in the Cabinet have brought in certain amendments to this Resolution and we are very grateful and thankful to them. In fact, we had a number of discussions. What I am saying is, until 9th Saturday, when this Resolution was to be brought in, none of us knew about it. Then, fortunately somebody pointed it out and we had only three days. We met His Excellency the President; we as a group, met the Prime Minister; we met the Hon. Speaker and discussions went on till 12.30 in the night. All this happened within 72 hours. Where is justice? You are talking of a Constitutional change. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This was on the Order Book for more than a month. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I will tell you that. I agree with you. What happened? It was on the Order Book on the 19th December, the last date of the Budget Debate. Is that the way that you should deal with the Constitution? If the Hon. Sumanthiran says, That is the way, that is not fair. You leave it on the Order Book at the last hour, on the 19th of December, and you say that it was there for a month. That itself is dubious; that itself is questionable.

I would like to commence my speech expressing my best wishes to my good Friend, Hambantota District Parliamentarian, Hon. Sajith Premadasa who is celebrating his birthday today. Long live Sajith! I am also glad that I am able to speak immediately after my good Friend, Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella who represents the Joint Opposition.

Sir, I would like to begin with a comment made by the Father of the Nation, Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake on 10th February, 1948 after Sri Lanka gained Independence. He stated, I quote:

"Freedom carries with it grave responsibilities. Our acts and omissions henceforth are our own. No longer can we lay the blame for defects and errors in our administration on others. It is therefore

the duty of every citizen of Lanka to grasp this opportunity and to strive and toil willingly for advancing the happiness and prosperity of the country".

Then, comes his grand opinion: "Our nation comprises many races, each with a culture and a history of its own. It is for us to blend all that is best in us, and to set ourselves with the resolute will to build up that high quality, and to join with the other nations of the world in establishing peace, security and justice for all peoples."

This is what the Father of the Nation, D.S. Senanayake said in 1948.

Sir, two years ago I went to Jaffna with our current Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, leading " "- the Movement for Opposition. When we were addressing a media conference, a young journalist, obviously from our good Friend Hon. E. Saravanapavans media unit, questioned the then Leader of the Opposition, our current Prime Minister. He asked, Sir, how do you see the position of the power-sharing today? Do you agree with the Thirteenth Amendment? I was next to our Prime Minister translating his English and Sinhala into Tamil. So, he replied, Yes, I agree with the Thirteenth Amendment. I want to improve it, but again there was an opposition from the South and you too were not in agreement to that. Even you opposed to it. He was referring to the then Tamil leadership, maybe the LTTE and others, who were not even willing to accept the Thirteenth Amendment. I not only translated it but I did it in agreement with his views.

I agreed with him, because when the power-sharing concepts were discussed and reached some agreement, it was not only the South but even the North-East that had some disagreements. Even when the so-called devolution package was presented to Parliament in the year 2000, it was not only the UNP that disagreed with it but also the TNA disagreed with it. At that time, TNA was instructed by the LTTE to disagree with it for different reasons. I knew that.

That is what we are doing right now, Sir.

I believe that this opportunity should be well-used and well-understood by the Parties representing the Sinhalese people in the South. Not only the Government, but also the Opposition must understand that this is a golden opportunity we have got today. So, send a clear and correct message to the people of the North and the East, particularly to the Tamil people.

Thank you.
