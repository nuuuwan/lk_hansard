.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Member, what I want to mention is, none of our products have been . In the sense, there is nothing wrong with the products. All the products have been sold into all the markets without any hindrance. First of all, I disagree with . -[Interruption.] Yes. So, I do not accept that position. The second position is, as far as the palmyrah based products are concerned, I had a very successful exhibition in Jaffna last week where all products were displayed. Every single product produced by the Palmyrah Development Board, including handicrafts were displayed. Probably, we will have it very soon in Colombo, Kandy and also in all main towns, so that, we will be in a position to expand the palmyrah based products and develop the palmyrah industry.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much.

.. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake - Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I table* the Answer.

* * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) There are 14 Wards (07 Male and 07 Female Wards). 153 persons with incurable disabilities - male 63/female 90 - reside in it. (ii) Rupees 8 million is annually provided by the General Treasury for the Victoria Home and accordingly the total cost of Rs. 666,000 could be incurred for a month. In addition to this, Rs. 0.05 million is annually provided by the Ministry of Health for the maintenance of activities including buildings and also Rs. 1.5 million is provided by the Provincial Department of Social Services, Western Province. (iii) The aforesaid amount of money is not adequate for the said matters. The Victoria Home in Rajagiriya does not belong to the Government and it is under the Governing Council. However, Colombo District Secretary performs as the Chairman of the Governing Council and Public Officers are included among the members whom to be appointed to the Governing Council. (iv) The staff is insufficient. The approved cadre for the Victoria Home is 57 and currently there are 42 employees. Thus there are vacancies for 15 employees. I will inform the House that making new recruitments is a duty of the Governing Council. The salaries paid to the employees of this Home will be adjusted in accordance with the relevant posts of the Ministry of Health and their salaries will be revised accordingly. Required actions are in the process. (v) Additional provisions of Rs. 07 million have been requested from the Director General of Budget on 21.06.2016 by the letter signed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare for increasing the salaries of the staff in the Victoria Home.

(ii) The Governing Council is working to recruit new employees.

(c) Not applicable.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Minister of Finance?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As it has taken a political twist, I need to mention that the Hon. Member of Parliament has forgotten that there was Rs. 1,000 million imposed on that company, which they did not pay. We sent them two or three reminders. That is a basic requirement. But, this was a specific requirement. If we do not clarify this, it will be reported by the media that the Hon. Member raised this Question and there was no valid reason for this move. One of the most important and valid reasons for this action is that that Rs. 1,000 million, which has to be paid, was not paid.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, the reason held by the Secretary - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No duty was paid for the equipment. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That is of no relavance to this issue.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga - Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs and Minister of Lands) Thank you Hon. Presiding Member.

I was just listening to the Hon. (Mrs) Shanthi Sriskandarasa. I was very sorry to hear of the deaths that have taken place in Jaffna. We all sympathize and I can assure you that there will be justice. This Government is very keen to mete out justice and ensure fair play to all communities in this country. That is the motto of His Excellency the President and that of the Hon. Prime Minister and the Government itself.

You spoke about land. I think this is not the first time. We had another Debate here on the land policy. I must tell you that His Excellency the President is taking a personal interest in this matter. He has set up a Task Force inviting all members of the armed forces and the Government officials in order to resolve the problem that you were complaining of. I am sure, by now, some lands have been returned, not all. There is a lot to be done and at the same time, the Government has to find alternative lands for the armed forces in order to move them out. So, this is the delay. You must understand that. For 35 years you have suffered. Please do not allow the repetition of what happened. It is up to you to look after the people of Jaffna and if you are careful not to instigate or rouse tension, then, there will be peace and there will be no more problems. Your people have suffered enough. Please keep that in mind.
