Hon. Minister, I do not know whether the officials of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission are here in the Public Officials Box.

Also I have to mention that there is a large number of complaints which I have received from Kilinochchi and other respective Divisional Secretariats as the Co-Chairman of the Jaffna District Coordinating Committee. The administrative officers complained to me that hundreds of vacancies remain in the respective administrative institutions. What is important is, they have already identified the cadre and that cadre should be taken in. So, they are expecting approval for the cadre from the National Salaries and Cadre Commission. That is the main problem that they are facing in filling the vacancies. Therefore, it is a very important issue for our areas devastated by the civil war. Hon. Minister, I hope you would take prompt action on this important matter.

action to give their approval for whichever vacancies that exist - it is the need of the hour - to fulfill the obligations and to implement the decisions of the Government in the respective areas.

, Yahapalanaya has unshackled the people and crippled the country , which appeared in the "Daily Mirror" of Wednesday, 6th July, 2016, .

Rhetoric does not match the actual deeds; meetings, discussions and workshops dont substitute for visible implementation and debates in parliament arent a viable alternative to hard-work. No Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers or ordinary MPs are seen on the paddy fields scattered across the land; they are not seen inspecting new factories, nor are they visible in the shack-houses of the urban proletariat. Of course, they are amply portrayed as deliverers of economic empowerment. They are received by hundreds of henchmen and cronies with garlands and beetle sheaves. The same old caravan is taking its inevitable trek, towards what end, fortunately or unfortunately, none seems to know.

. , . , .

It further states, I quote:

In this cruel journey of life, every attempt must be made to make sure that the ordinary Pathiraja and Pathmasiri are proud to embrace their lives as a whole, irrespective of circumstances. Time is running out. Its time that Yahapalanaya was reintroduced not only as a means of good governance, but a summit of all dreams and aspirations of the masses -- economic, social, cultural and spiritual aspects.

Before I conclude my speech, I want to say this, which might be of interest, Hon. Deputy Chairman, to you as well. Sir, just give me one more minute.

Article 5 of the Constitution is about the territory of the Republic. It states, I quote:

"The territory of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall consist of the [twenty- five] administrative districts, the names of which are set out in the First Schedule and its [territorial waters:..."

The First Schedule has 25 names. That schedule is with regard to Article 5. The First Schedule states all the Administrative Districts starting from Colombo to Kegalle. But, there is no Schedule for - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ! . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Okay, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, please conclude your speech in one minute. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I am going to conclude. I am just making this reference to bring the attention of Parliament as well the Hon. Minister and the Government to an important matter.

Then, there are the Provincial Councils. What are the boundaries of the Provincial Councils? It is not mentioned in the Constitution. Article 5 clearly states that the territory of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall consist of the 25 Administrative Districts. First Schedule for Article 5 very clearly states the 25 Administrative Districts. Where is the limits of provinces mentioned? How is it constituted? Is there a gazette? There is no gazette. There is no Act of Parliament. I am questioning this today because it is a very serious issue, where even some of the public servants can be taken to court for actions they are taking without proper powers vested in them by the Constitution.

Thank you, Sir. [.. 11.14]

Sajith Premadasa) No, no. It is for the war victims in the North. It is a new programme which we are hoping to initiate in the year 2017 by our Ministry, the Ministry of Housing and Construction. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Thank you very much. It is a burden on our people and they are suffering as they are unable to repay the loans to the banks. So, we have taken a decision at the DCC meeting that they need not pay because they have no money to repay the loans to the banks. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) If I may clarify, recognizing your need or necessity, urgency and the policy imperative, His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Minister of Finance have decided on a programme to provide a grant of Rs. 500,000 per household and the National Housing Development Authority will get physically involved in the peoples participatory house-building system. So, your problem will be solved. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Okay. Thank you very much.

At the DCC meeting, our resolution regarding the loans was also to ask the Government to write off rupees one lakh, not much, from a loan taken by an individual. If the necessary action is not taken, we will take up that matter and sort it out later. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) If I may say so, we commenced the Rs. 100,000 loan programme last year and prior to giving the loans, we got the consent and the acquiescence of the recipient specifically to repay the loan. It is only on that belief that the National Housing Development Authority disbursed the money. I am afraid these are government funds. So, do keep in mind, when the loans are repaid, those will be recycled back to the people in the Northern Province.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Member, I recognize the pain in your expression. I see the housing problem in the North-East as a very serious issue that we need to address. But, I would humbly request you to be cognizance of the fact that the subject of housing is basically decentralized into several Ministries right now; including the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, the Ministry in charge of urban development, moving on to the Ministry in charge of estate infrastructure and also to the Ministry of Disaster Management. There have been a large number of Ministries that have been dealing with this subject of housing since 1994. So, to the extent that is possible, I shall strive to do my very best to alleviate the pain of the people who have suffered during the war and right now in the aftermath of the war due to the land and housing problems.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Member, as a responsible Member from that particular District in the Eastern Province, if you can intervene with the relevant administrative authorities to allocate the requisite land, we can always ensure that more subfamily units can be accommodated in the model villages that we have planned for the next year. For example, for the North and the East, the Finance Ministry has gone ahead to provide grants worth Rs. 500,000 each per household. This is not a loan. As far as the Batticaloa District is concerned, the problem is the scarcity of land. I think you should intervene with the relevant administrative authorities to allocate the requisite land for the model village programme. So, please try to do that. ( ) (The Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan) Okay. I will discuss this matter with the particular DS and GS. I can get the data and I will submit them to you. Please, take an immediate action to send these poor people who are in our area. Thank you.

"Ownership and Operation of the National Payment Platform (NPP):

I write to you with regard to the telephone conversation you had with me on the above subject."

"ICTA is an institution established in 2003 and functions under the ICT Act No. 27 of 2003 and as amended in 2008 is owned 100% by the Government of Sri Lanka.

National Payment Platform is architected, designed, owned and operated by ICTA. There are rumors being spread by persons who are trying their very best to sabotage this project. These parties are discrediting the integrity of the National Payment Platform (NPP) by stating that the operation and ownership of NPP is entrusted to a private company.

1523 1524

We hereby wish to reiterate that there have been no contracts or any negotiation with any third parties to transfer, own or operate the National Payment Platform.

NPP is open platform for persons and business to connect with NPP and digitally transact.

Thank you.

Yours Sincerely,
