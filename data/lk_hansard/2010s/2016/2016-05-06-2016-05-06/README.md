asked the Minister of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development:

(a) Will he inform this House- (i) whether nearly 400,000 (4 lakhs) families in the estate sector remain landless at present;

(ii) whether it is not possible to provide a 07 perch plot of land for those families immediately as per the pledge given to them and grant permission for transfer of succession to a member of those families while holding such lands in a land trust subjecting them to conditions that prohibit the sale of those lands;

(iii) whether it is not possible to provide the opportunity for those recipients of land to carry out the constructions on such land at their discretion and grant them the right to sell such constructions only; and

(iv) whether it is not possible to take action to prevent the selling of land by enforcing laws that prevent the sale of land while providing the opportunity to sell only the constructions done on such land so that land prices would not go up and people will be able to engage in mortgaging etc. to meet their needs?

(b) Will he state whether we could not use the similar land trust policy followed in India as an example?

(c) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development I table* the Answer for Question No. 9.

* : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) No. The number is around 250,000 families in Tea and Rubber Plantations.

(ii) It is possible to provide 7 perch plot of land. However, the difficulties in providing land immediately are ,

(1) Most of the lands suitable for house construction are under tea cultivation.

(2) NBRO has identified a large extent of lands as landslide prone areas and

also the houses cannot be constructed on high slope lands.

Transferring the land to member of families is also possible. But subjecting them to conditions that prohibit the sale of those lands is debatable.

(iii) The first part is possible but the second part may be difficult.

(iv) Selling only the construction without the land is possible under the Condominium Act where housing complexes with multi storey buildings are covered. But in the Plantations, the accepted policy of the Government is to build a single house in a 7 perch of land.

(b) No.

(c) Land Trust Policy is implemented in India in order to safeguard the interest of the tribals to prevent outsiders owning the tribal land. Plantation Industry also feels that outsiders should not be allowed to own the estate land which will be detrimental to the industry. But the communitys long standing demand is to own a land and a house like other communities. Further this is the only community where the majority do not own a piece of land or a house. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) 11 - 375/'15 -(1), () .
