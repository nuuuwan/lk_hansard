.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. John Amaratunga. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Member, I am extremely thankful to you for inviting our attention to a wonderful place, which is ideal

1687 1688

for a tourist centre. I was not aware of that. As you have brought it to our notice now, I will inform our officials to make an immediate inspection and find out as to how it can be developed as a resort and then infrastructure can be added. But developing places like hotels and other things comes under the private sector. So, certainly we will try to invite some of the investors to go and have a look and put up a hotel there. I do not want to interfere with whatever the Provincial Council is doing. The Hon. Douglas Devananda, the Chief Minister is a good friend of you. So, why do you not ask him to invest Rs. 6 million and then make the infrastructure? - [Interruption.] Yes, you have elected him. - [Interruption]. So, the problem is there. Sometimes, whatever we try to do, the Chief Minister does not like. He did even not attend the Investment Forum that was set up in Jaffna. This problem is there. You all should get together and persuade him not to have a tug of war, but to join hands with the Government and develop the Jaffna District. That is what is required today. We are ready to do anything for you. ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) . . rose.

2016 21 " " : 2016 21 " " : "THE SUNDAY TIMES" REPORT OF 21ST AUGUST, 2016: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Speaker, I would like to make the following statement on the article which appeared under the heading

''Malik hires another US firm to lobby for Lanka'', which is based on incorrect and misleading information in "The Sunday Times" on 21st August, 2016.

It appears that the mere intention of the article is to unjustifiably make a comparison of previous Government retaining different lobbying firms in the US as an image building exercise of the country with the recent agreement with Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg. This agreement with ST&R is purely made on an economic rationale to obtain expert assistance to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade to pursue the objective of maximizing Sri Lankas access to the United States market at a juncture the country needs enhanced opportunities for trade.

Sir, the scope of engagement as per the agreement signed after obtaining Attorney Generals approval is as follows:

"The party represents the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade in connection with representation of Sri Lanka in Washington DC before government agencies and the US Congress focusing efforts on educating about the peace process in Sri Lanka: exploring options for greater economic and commercial ties between the US and Sri Lanka; identifying and expanding options for market access of Sri Lankan goods to the US; expanding the Sri Lanka caucus and building a friends of Sri Lanka caucus in the Congress; assisting in visiting delegation agenda development; promptly notifying Sri Lanka of any congressional or administrative action of importance to Sri Lanka; preparing brief analyses of developments in Congress and the Executive Branch on particular issues of concern to Sri Lanka; interacting with the interested US stakeholders and advising Sri Lanka on its free trade negotiations with other partner countries and possibly the Unites States.''

Sir, the said article in "The Sunday Times" refers to an engagement of a firm for nonexistent peace process part of the deal. Therefore, it is clear that this statement in the article is incorrect and totally misleading. The scope of engagement includes lobbying of US Congress with a view to introducing and passing a bill to have conflict-affected areas and lagging areas of our country as qualified industrial zones and thereby obtaining preferential market access to goods produced in these industrial zones.

Sir, this contract with the US firm ST&R has been entered into in the fullest transparent manner. The proposals have been evaluated by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington and their recommendations have been obtained. The proposal to enter into a contract with this firm was endorsed by the Cabinet Subcommittee on Economic Management - CCEM - on 25th May, 2016 and subsequently approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on

1699 1700

14th June, 2016 after submitting a comprehensive memorandum which gave all details of the objectives, output of the contract, type of engagement with a comparison of costs among the offers. It is untrue to say that the Foreign Ministry is unaware of the engagement, as it has been presented to the Cabinet of Ministers and the decision approving the recommendations of the Cabinet Memorandum has been sent to relevant Secretaries including the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Attorney Generals approval has been obtained for the Agreement before signing.

Hon. Speaker, funds for this contract is to be obtained from the National Budget from the allocations with Parliamentary sanction for the Ministry unlike in the case previously where such lobbying firms have been paid through the Central Bank costing the country around Rs. 1.6 billion which is approximately US Dollars 11.3 million. The total cost of this Agreement with ST&R is US Dollars 630,000 which is approximately Rs. 91.3 million.

Services of well-connected professional advocates, often lawyers who have the access to various powerful networks are hired, to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies like the United States Congress and that is the standard practice in the United States of America. ST&R being a prominent trade services provider with multifaceted experience in engaging in assisting governments to pursue economic growth through enhancing opportunities of trade has been properly assessed by the Sri Lankan Embassy in the USA. The previous engagement of the firm ST&R is considered an added qualification.

In view of the above facts, I inform Parliament that the baseless interpretation given in the above newspaper article is false and such information seriously misleads the public.

Hon. Speaker, I am also a strong advocate of media freedom. However, media should not abuse that freedom. Before allegations are made against politicians - whichever side they are on - or public officers or even the businessmen, media should obtain their explanations and clarifications before publishing incorrect articles.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .

INCREASE OF NATIONAL SCHOOLS ON ELECTORAL BASIS [5.30p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Mr. Presiding Member, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

" Almost all over the country, it is observed that many districts have a very few National Schools functioning under the Central Government. Majority of the existing schools belong to Provincial Councils and each electorate contains only three or four schools. Many schools operating under Provincial Councils are found to be short of teachers, equipment, building etc., which are the essential facilities for a smooth functioning of a school.

The existing National Schools having such facilities are not equally distributed even among such electorates and therefore, often children in rural areas are not provided with equal opportunities for education as enjoyed by those who are in close proximity to cities.

Therefore, the Hon. Minister of Education is requested to take over at least two schools that are functioning under Provincial Councils from each electorate in the island to the Central Government and convert them to be National Schools providing them with sufficient resources so that equal opportunities will be opened up for children in all over the country thus shedding off the presently existing differences for educational opportunities for them."

Sir, with this Motion, I wish to draw the attention of the Hon. Minister of Education to the educational problems in different electorates.

As you know, there are a very few National Schools, probably two or three, in each electorate. Out of 75-100 schools in an electorate, only about three or four schools are being managed by the Central Government. In those schools administered by the provincial councils, children are suffering because of lack of facilities and are undergoing a lot of difficulties. When parents find out that facilities are not available in such schools in their electorate, they send their children to better schools in other areas. Therefore, if we open two or three National Schools with facilities in each electorate, we can solve this problem. Through the establishment of two or more National Schools in each electorate and upgrading the level of education of the students, the standard of education in each electorate could be made parallel to that of the schools in big cities like Colombo and Kandy.

Further, we have to upgrade the education in girls' schools administered by the provincial councils. It is also a problem. If we upgrade the education in those schools to the level of the National Schools, it will pave the way for us to provide equal opportunities for female students in higher education and also future development.

Through providing more National Schools in each electorate we can uplift education level in rural areas so that the standard of education in those areas would be the same as that of the big cities. With the establishment of more National Schools, the competitive situation that prevails at times of school admission will ease. Generally, all parents would like their children to go to good schools. But, if you establish two or three National Schools in each electorate and provide all the facilities - teachers, labs and so on - this competitiveness will definitely ease. Through the establishment of National Schools in each electorate, the personality of students in those areas will develop immensely due to opportunities available to take part in competitions at national level in the fields of sports, education and culture.

Also, the transfer of teachers serving in these National Schools, which has not taken place for a long period, could be properly implemented. Progress in the field of education can be achieved by sharing human and physical resources available in each National School. Through the establishment of more National Schools, the educational standards could be uplifted and backward areas could be developed.

Sir, why I brought this Motion is because we come across these problems in every area, every electorate and in every district we go to. The Hon. Minister of Education is doing his level best to uplift the level of education. As you know, earlier, only 2 per cent of the GDP was allocated for education, but this time, it has gone up to 6 per cent. The Hon. Minister is trying to provide facilities to all the schools.

According to my point of view, if we increase the number of National Schools that come under the Central Government, we can improve the standard of those schools in the future. Then, the students in rural areas or backward areas need not go outside and they will get an opportunity to enter a National School. In the Puttalam Electorate, which I represent, there are a lot of students who always try to go to Kandy, Colombo or Chilaw for education. But, there are poor students who are unable to do this. My electorate has only three National Schools whereas there are about 200 provincial schools. So, Hon. State Minister of Education, according to my suggestion, if we make another two or three National Schools under the Central Government, the Central Government can provide all the facilities and bring those schools up to the level of leading schools in the country. Then, the poor students who are capable, who are unable to leave their electorates for education, will definitely go to those schools and they will have the same facilities in the

1767 1768

future and they will prosper like the students of big schools such as Royal College, Trinity College and so on.

In my electorate, I have personally seen these problems. Sometimes, the poor children are unable to carry on their education. I know, earlier the setup was entirely different. Now the Government is spending so much money. The allocation for education has been increased to 6 per cent. But, still, the provincial schools are not getting adequate facilities. There is a shortage of teachers. If we establish a few more National Schools and provide them with teachers and other facilities, the children will get that benefit. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister of Education and the State Minister of Education to consider my Adjournment Motion, so that the poor students who are capable can study in the their area without going out to another area.

Thank you very much.
