- Vote of No Confidence on the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance,- Whereas Parliament shall have full control over public finance in terms of Article 148 of the Constitution, and whereas in passing the 2016 budget, the Minister of Finance misled the Parliament and the general public through misrepresentation and made the budget a mere fabrication even though it is the primary duty and responsibility of the Minister of Finance to present the annual budget, the key instrument in the management of public finance, in a highly detailed manner with transparency, maximum credibility and accuracy when it is presented to this august Assembly;

And whereas an arbitrary, inflexible and capricious public finance management policy is followed causing seriously damaging impact on the macro economic variables of the country such as the total output, income, employment, price levels, balance of payment, savings and investments, leading the entire economy towards total destruction;

2016 09

And whereas an import inflationary pressure is building as the Sri Lankan rupee continues to depreciate and a vulnerable situation has been created with the overheating of the economy as a result of severe depletion of the official foreign reserves held by the country;

And whereas Sri Lanka has been dragged into a vulnerable situation in relation to the debt repayment capacity of the country with the B+ negative outlook (minus) rating of Sri Lanka in the sovereign credit rating (Fitch Rating);

And whereas the financial and banking market states that no massive influx of foreign exchange to the banks took place even though a statement made by the Minister of Finance published in the national newspaper Dinamina of 30th January 2016 on the front page with the headline Pleased with the financial policy of the government - Foreign investors have deposited 1.2 billion dollars in local banks has been given worldwide publicity;

And whereas the Minister of Finance has intentionally or unintentionally violated the provisions of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act through the serious statement Over another hundred thousand crores taken by the Mahindas government has not been accounted, made by holding a special press briefing;

That this Parliament resolves that it has lost confidence in the competence of the Minister of Finance to function further in that office as the Minister of Finance, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has totally lost credibility in this august Assembly."

We will not be able to face the monetary crisis that is being propelled on us by the IMF and this Minister of Finance. Hon. Speaker, if you take examples from other countries which followed this prescription, you will see that they are all in chaos today; their economy is also in chaos; pensions are being withdrawn and people are being laid off in hundreds of thousands in those countries which followed this dictate.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . . Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you have ten minutes.

[10.56a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Today, we are debating, Sir, a Motion of No Confidence brought by a section of the Opposition against the present Minister of Finance, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. We were not consulted in regard to this Motion of No Confidence. So, I wish to make certain common observations, Sir, in regard to both the Motion and the state of the countrys economy.

The economy of this country has been in a parlous state for a long time. It is not something which has come about after the change in government and during the term of the present Government. The country had been in debt, both domestic and foreign, for a long time as never before, largely because of the manner in which public finance was used and expended. There were no returns from projects on which large sums of money were invested. These projects were meant to promote personal ego than be for the public good or the benefit of the country. One might say that extravagance and profligacy have been quite excessive in this country for a long period of time.

Various matters that are now coming to light would seem to suggest that public finance was unjustifiably used in several ways for several purposes as if public finance was personal and private property. Everybody who was in the former Government must accept responsibility for that situation and I must say that all the signatories to the present Motion of No Confidence were persons holding positions of responsibility in the former Government.

( ) (An Hon. Member) You are also a part of the Government, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) The fact that I am making this observation does not mean, however, Mr. Speaker, that the supremacy of Parliament over public finance can in anyway be disregarded or diminished. It is our duty to ensure that public finance, which belongs to the people, is properly and usefully expended and expended only with the approval of Parliament. Observation of several events that have happened in the recent past, would suggest that greater accuracy and perfection based upon careful study and preparation is compulsory in regard to proposals made to Parliament, whether it be through the Budget or other financial proposals that are made from time to time. There can be no room for any other approach in regard to this matter. It is also absolutely fundamental that persons dealing with public finance must be completely above suspicion.

There can be no compromise in regard to that matter either. In that sense, one might say that the present Motion could be an alarm bell. We, on our part, will never compromise on these fundamental values. We are amongst a very few who can claim that we be counted amongst those whose hands are absolutely clean. We would like to caution the Finance Minister, the Finance Ministry, and the Government that you are being carefully watched by the people of this country.

There is no purpose in trying to establish guilt amongst others or against former culprits unless you are absolutely and perfectly clean yourselves. With the

677 678

people of this country we would be continuing to watch carefully further developments. We must say that we have reason not to be totally satisfied with the way in which the Finance Minister and the Finance Ministry have dealt with financial proposals as far as this Parliament is concerned. It must be remembered by everyone that this Parliament owes the responsibility and duty to the people of this country to ensure that every cent that is expended as public expenditure is for the benefit of the public and not for the benefit of anyone else. I do not think the Finance Ministry can say with certainty and with complete veracity that they have recognized that fundamental importance of Parliament and the duty that Parliament has to perform in the execution of their responsibilities as those in charge of public finance.

The country is today acquiring a new image. Our President has been visiting various countries the world over and wherever he has been going we can see that those countries are receiving him with a great deal of respect. That is on account of the new policies pursued by the new Government; that is on account of the inclusive approach that is being pursued by the new Government; that is on account of the efforts being made by the President which are being recognized by the international community to bring all the people of this country together. So, I think this country does have an opportunity with the present turn of events to ensure that we can develop, we can get rid of our debts - both domestic and foreign - and that we can take this country forward.

So, I think, this is a responsibility cast on all of us. The Finance Ministry plays an important role in regard to this matter and the observations that we have made are for the benefit of the people of this country and we do hope that these observations would be taken into serious account. I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, by law, locals must bring in foreign investments through an SIA account. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has brought in US Dollars 3 million not through an SIA account, but through a mysterious account. That was the case. And what did he do? In the last Budget, he brought in a clause under paragraph 208 to cover that with retrospective effect. I will read that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have basically got to mention this to the Hon. Member of Parliament that there was not a single cent that was brought in under my name. That is what they do not understand. Mr. Nivard Cabraal and Mr. Basil Rajapaksa have concocted this yarn. Tell me if there was one cent that came in under my name? - [Interruption.] Do not tell that. You are in Parliament. There is a live telecast. Do not mislead the people.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I am not misleading anyone. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, if the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella thinks that he is such a macho, I ask him to come out of Parliament and tell this. Then, I will ensure that he will be taken to courts for defaming me. I challenge him to do so. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, he may have the right to say any scurrilous thing and table it, but you as the Presiding Member, has the right to see the veracity of that. He cannot just come and table anything. He must show you where it comes from. He has to give credible evidence to Parliament. He cannot bring anything and place it here. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , what he says is, you have to substantiate what you are saying. At the same time, please make your submissions without mentioning names.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Okay. I would like to bring to your notice paragraph 208 of the Budget Speech - 2016. In paragraph 208, he has taken that off. In paragraph 208 it states, I quote:

Instead, I propose that investors should be allowed to bring in money to Sri Lanka through any bank account existing in the formal banking system. The Government shall not take any criminal action against any persons making inward remittances of such monies....

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, what is he trying to implicate? He is trying to implicate that there was an apparent case and subsequently there was a release. This clause was to overcome the draconian policy that was there. That has nothing to do with my case. The money is still in the Central Bank. You can check that. You cannot say anything you want here. There should be due recognition. On that particular basis, I challenge you. The money is still in the Central Bank. What are you talking about?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Roton Vander was a freight forwarding company owned by somebody who is connected to the finance sector. I am not mentioning names. By law, foreigners cannot own more than 40 per cent in a freight forwarding company. Somebody sells the majority shares of Roton Vander and to an American company named IJS Global. Then, what happens? To make this transaction legal, a clause was brought into Parliament through the Budget Speech.

Paragraph 484 of the Budget Speech - 2016, under caption Freight Forwarding, states, I quote:

Entry into international freight forwarding will be liberalized so that foreign participation could extend up to a maximum of 75 percent with a .

Budget , , - [ ] . [ ] .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) At any time when a Member of Parliament refers to a subject matter that I am involved in, I also have a right to respond to that.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You are taking it upon yourself.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He is basically implying that there was a company that had been owned by us and sold out. If that is so, it should have been rectified ten years before. What is he talking about now? He does not know business ethics. This type of heinous campaign should not be maintained in Parliament. This is a Debate on the Motion of No Confidence. If that is the case, bring those into the No Confidence Motion. These are substantive motions.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am drawing your attention to paragraph 484 of the Budget Speech-2016. My submission is that there are certain clauses that have been brought into the Budget for his personal interest. I have proved that and beyond doubt and I am tabling* them.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How can you take up a matter that had happened ten years ago? You do not have an ounce of brain. That is why you are talking like this.

I am trying to say, Mr. Presiding Member, that with regard to the Government revenue as a proportion to the Gross Domestic Product, we have seen a declining trend from the time His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa took over as the President - from the year 2005 up to the time he left office. In 2005, the Government revenue was 20 per cent as against the GDP. From 20 per cent, it came down to 12 per cent. But now, it has begun to climb up. So, this is the situation. When you compare our Government revenue as against the GDP with that of countries with the same per capita income like ours, ours is a very low percentage - the lowest in the Asian region. So, the effort of Hon. Minister of Finance has been to bring this up.

As the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne quoted, we particularly see a very devious trend in the collection of VAT. The falling VAT collection has been the main driver behind declining tax revenue in recent years. That is why we wanted to introduce some major reforms. The VAT revenue in 2005 was 41.2 per cent of the total tax revenue. It came down to 16.2 per cent in 2015. Therefore, there is some point in this effort to levy a slightly higher proportion of VAT, because we observed that we have had a declining trend in the past. During the disastrous five-year post-war period - from 2009 up to 2014 - the then Government did everything without any fiscal prudence. All were seduced into a spending spree by the post-war euphoria. They said, We will make this country a miracle of the world. The "miracle", Sir, was that the nation was lulled into a false sense of prosperity. Finally, the society woke up, challenged and rejected a regime that will be remembered only for its unbridled profligacy and extravagance.

The Hon. Kabir Hashim laid out in detail as to what had happened, particularly, during the past five years or in the post-victory period. Everything was done without any fiscal prudence - heavy foreign exchange borrowings at very high commercial rates resulted in this parlous situation of our countrys external debt. While they did all those foreign-funded costly infrastructure development, if there were some acceptable changes in the tax regime, we could have appreciated it. But, there was a serious imbalance. As I have showed and enumerated earlier, the Government revenue, as a proportion to the Gross Domestic Product of this country, had a steady decline from 2005 up to the time the last Government relinquished office.

That happened, not due to anything else, but because of the serious negligence of the Department of Inland Revenue. Tax exemptions were given at the whims and fancies of the ruling class; tax avoidance was uncontrollable; tax evasion was not being properly monitored and finally we had a tax base which was too narrow to yield an adequate revenue. That is what resulted in us having to reverse that trend. So, some pragmatic approach for taxes to be effectively collected had to be undertaken and that effort has resulted in this particular Motion being brought about.

The VAT is not intrinsically regressive. It is levied on consumption expenditure. Higher-income households that consume more would be paying higher amounts. But, when you have exempted essential basic items of household consumption, there is sufficient safeguard for vulnerable sections of the population. We have seen to it- essential food items have been exempted from the increased VAT formula. Increasing the VAT is an effective means of increasing Government revenue and it is a more reasonable form of tax as there is no cascading effect on prices. But, some still argue that the BTT was more efficient and that we were able to collect more revenue. But with a very low proportion of direct taxation, our entire tax system comes to be blamed as regressive.

There is one point which I must enunciate, Sir. In the past, the ratio of direct taxes to indirect taxes was estimated to be 40: 60 or something to be in that region . But, in our recent Budget, this gap has widened even further. This is as a result of our inefficient tax collection paradigm. This disproportionate ratio that places burden on indirect taxation is due to the inability of the tax administration to collect taxes from some of the high earners in this country.

In order to face this situation, the response of successive Governments has been to resort to ad hoc tax measures from time to time, rather than a system of taxes that would be effective in collecting higher revenue. That is why we have seen in the past there was a Tax Commission appointed. A Presidential Commission was set up in 2009. Reform of the tax system and tax administration was their recommendation. But, what happened to the Report of that particular Presidential Commission is still a mystery. The Report was handed over to the previous administration. I would request the Hon. Finance Minister, against whom this Motion has been brought, to bring to light the results and the Report of this particular Presidential Commission which looked into the need to reform the tax system and tax administration of the country. That must be published as a White Paper for all of us to look at and perhaps even debate in this House to see how we can reform the tax system.

When I was the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I probed the largest fraud that took place in the Inland Revenue Department - the VAT scam. The way in which money was pilfered from the Inland Revenue Department - the amount that the Auditor-General found out was about Rs. 4 billion, but my estimation is, it could be six times more; but evidence was available only for Rs. 4 billion. It was such a massive fraud that took place within the Inland Revenue Department. I was the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and we were able to expose the fraud and finally those people had to be taken before the High Court and punished. Since there were loopholes, there was a possibility to commit these frauds. But then, this

729 730

House is the principal watchdog over finance. It is good that at least in a Debate, such as this, we are able to look at the need to bridge this declining trend of Government revenue as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product and find ways and means of improving it. I must congratulate the Hon. Finance Minister that during his tenure, efforts at improving the collection efficiency of the Inland Revenue Department has gone up by leaps and bounds. We see between 2014 and 2016, a large difference. The total revenue in 2014 has gone up from Rs. 1,195 billion to Rs. 1,550 billion. That is almost a Rs. 500 billion increase in the tax efforts of the Inland Revenue Department. This alone is enough for us to bring a Confidence Motion on our Finance Minister and therefore, this whole puerile No Confidence Motion has already fizzled out.

As I told originally in my speech in Sinhala, this is only a symbolic gesture at targeting the economy of this country. What the Opposition, or these few Hon. Members of the Opposition, are trying to do is to weaken our economy by targeting the Minister of Finance who has done, within the short one-and-a-half years of our rule, much more than what the former regime did within the entire ten-year period.

Mr. Presiding Member, with those comments, I very categorically say that we, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress - we have seven Members of Parliament- would extend our full cooperation to defeat this No Confidence Motion today. Thank you.

[1.50p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, the No Confidence Motion against our Finance Minister has signatures of 37 Joint Opposition MPs. It states that the Minister mishandles the economy and puts the country into an economic crisis.

Sir, we need to clearly understand that the Unity Government of His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe along with the Finance Minister, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, is trying to handle an already mishandled economy as a result of waste and luxuries of the previous Government. We all now know of the wasteful expenses and the international borrowings of the previous Government that has created this difficult situation in the country today.

A single family was directly managing the economy and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka during the former Government. This single family controlled almost 70 per cent of the GDP. As a result, the inflation increased to 15 per cent. As the economy faced more difficulties, they turned to other countries requesting loans, but at high interest rates. At the beginning of this year, short-term external debt totalled 104 per cent of foreign exchange reserves. Our foreign debt increased by three times, to 94 per cent of GDP, from 2010 to 2015. Reports say that our interest payments for debt obtained from one country alone is around US Dollars 30 million per year. Reports also say that the total debt obtained by this country stands at 10 per cent of our GDP. Sir, this is the sad state of the broken economy that the unity Government of His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister received from the previous Government.

I believe that the Budget of the Finance Minister, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is the most important instrument that can correct this problematic economy and place us in a reform-oriented development drive envisioned by the Unity Government of His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The other allegation in the No Confidence Motion is that the country is in an economic crisis. We all know that our difficult financial situation is due to debt repayment and global market situation. In 2014, the IMF warned us on our increasing foreign debt. The IMF Assessment-2014 states, The rapid increase in debt servicing costs that have accompanied - the shift from bilateral concessional debt to new loans on commercial terms. The Market Access Debt Sustainability Analysis -MAC-DSA - highlights the sensitivity of Sri Lankas debt sustainability to growth and foreign exchange stocks. The staff of the IMF urges caution with respect to external borrowings through the banking system

As I just mentioned, the total debt obtained from one country alone stands at 10 per cent of our GDP and repayment of foreign debt is a big burden. A huge 65 per cent of foreign borrowings went for repayment of existing foreign debt in 2010 to 2015.

Even 98 per cent of domestic borrowings is spent for repayment of existing debt, but we are expecting an improvement this year. Thanks to the latest budgetary efforts of the Finance Minister, we now expect an improvement in 2016.

In fact, we should commend the Finance Minister, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, for taking the lead in reforms through his many budgetary initiatives. Among his reforms, there is reduction of handing out free money. As we make our efforts to upgrade Sri Lanka from lower-middle income ranks to higher levels, we are also compelled to reduce giving free money and subsidies.

Subsidies are a burden on the economy and on our taxpayers. At the same time poor people in Sri Lanka cannot be ignored as well. Therefore, we cannot stop subsidies but we need to use it correctly.

Despite the fiscal challenges and difficulties, expenditure on subsidies such as fertilizer and Samurdhi has increased. For example, there is 73 per cent growth in pension alone in 2015. Realizing this situation, in his Budget for 2016, the Hon. Karunanayake made special efforts to link subsidies with employment. This is in line with the Governments efforts to provide targeted subsidies rather than subsidies for everyone and a successful effort to fulfil the election promises given to Sri Lankans.

As we struggle to meet our debt repayment obligations, we have less funds to give back to the economy. This affects the private sector and we are trying to bring back faster credit and businesses. The good news is that interest rates on Government Securities increased greatly in 2015. This helps the market. The rate of 364-day Treasury Bills has increased from 6 per cent to 21 per cent in 2015. The two-year Treasury Bond rate has increased to 25 per cent in 2015.

I am pleased to say that, despite these difficulties, in the last Budget, we have increased our development expenditure as well as subsidies and transfers so that we can fulfil our promises to all Sri Lankans.

Finance Minister, the Hon. Karunanayake, despite fiscal challenges, has allocated Rs. 65,000 million for education in the last Budget. Thishas increased our education expenditure as promised in our election campaign.

Sir, many people criticize the Government on VAT. Many times, the Hon. Karunanayake was criticized more than the Government regarding VAT. I would like to ask this august House as to on what logical basis that the Hon. Karunanayake could be criticized on VAT. I believe that such criticisms against him are mostly politically motivated.

I would like to say that the reality about VAT is different. Do you know that VAT is only 16 per cent of the Governments total tax revenue in 2016? Even income tax stood at 19 per cent of total tax revenue this year. In fact, I would like to inform this august Assembly about the correct picture today. The VAT income collected by the Government has been actually declining since 2005. In 2005, 41 per cent of the Governments tax revenue was VAT. Today, only 16 per cent of Governments tax revenue is VAT. In this background, I would like to ask this august House on what basis that the Minister, the Hon. Karunanayake, is criticized regarding VAT? I urge the criticizers and promoters of the No Confidence Motion to focus on the countrys fiscal background rather than the Hon. Minister of Finance.

Another challenge the Minister of Finance is faced with is the foreign debt issue. Thanks to him, this Unity Government is working on the repayment of the huge debt collected by the pervious Government.

The annual growth of the Government debt in 2009 was 18 per cent, but today, we have reduced it to 15 per cent. I also wish to highlight another challenge that is before us. Due to global market pressures, our exports have been suffering. When exports decline, it is clear that all connected sectors such as suppliers, SMEs and value adders too will suffer. This too contributes to our present economic difficulties.

In this background, I commend the Finance Minister for his work towards the successful IMF agreement for US Dollars 1.5 billion and the three-year extended fund facility programme for Sri Lanka agreed in early May. We should specially praise the Minister, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, for getting IMF to agree to give this loan facility without any condition. This shows that Sri Lanka has regained the lost confidence of international community as well. Unfortunately, we all know, at this moment, our valuable national resources and funds are sacrificed to clear the mistakes made by the previous Government rather than starting the economic reforms and the social market model of development that we are keenly seeking today.

It is even more unfortunate that some Members of the Opposition, despite always blaming the Rajapaksa Government for creating this economic situation, are now coming forward to defeat the development and economic reform agenda of our Unity Government - which came into power through high political and personal risks - has brought in freedom and good governance after years of suffering.

Sir, therefore, today, I would like to tell the Opposition not to get caught up in narrow political agendas, but to act towards national development.

Sir, now I would like to say a few words in Tamil.
