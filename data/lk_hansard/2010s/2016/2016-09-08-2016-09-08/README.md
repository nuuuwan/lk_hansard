[6.24p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion. As a practicing Muslim, I have not gone to the theatre for a long period nor have I seen many dramas. However, I would like to explain why I speak on this Motion. As you know, today most of the cinemas in our country are closed; we do not come across many dramas today and people do not watch them. We have to find out the reason for this.

My argument is, today, almost in every house we see Dish TV. This Dish TV is ruining not only the chances of films being screened but also plays being staged in the theatres. The reason is, Rupavihini, ITN or any other local channel always wind up their programmes by about 10.00 or 11.00 in the night. But this particular Dish TV goes on for 24 hours. Between 6.00 p.m. and 10.00 p.m. - the time when children are supposed to do their studies and engage in their spiritual activities - today they are not studying or engaging in their spiritual activities and their eyes are glued to the Dish TV. This is how they ruin their lives. Today, our Rupavahini, ITN and the other local channels are showing cricket matches giving commentaries. There are so many companies which are advertising through these channels. But today what has happened to our local channels? Today, even I have Dish TV at home. Unfortunately, we are watching the cricket matches which are played in Sri Lanka through Dish TV. This is what is happening today. All these are illegal. The Government is not at all benefited by this.

Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to look into this and sensor them. Films are shown through Dish TV throughout the day - all 24 hours. They are all rotten films which are not suitable for youngsters. The young generation is wasting their time by watching these films. They are not studying. Some children watch them even after midnight. Many problems have been created because of this Dish TV. Every religion has a culture; every caste has a culture. As Muslims, we have got so much of cultural events, but today, they are not practiced. Younger generation from all the religions are not at all interested in respecting their culture because of this rotten TV. Earlier, in Sri Lanka, we had good dramas and good films and people have been watching these. But those are not available today. Earlier, the general public after a long hard work, used to go to see a film for three hours which is a good rest for them. But, today, it is not there. That three hours, they spend on watching Dish TV or they are engaged in some other activity by which so many problems have cropped up.

I think to safeguard all these, our Hon. Minister must look into this Dish TV issue and sensor that; and bring that to the attention of the Government. By doing that, not only the film industry will develop and poor artistes will be benefitted, but also the culture of all religions will be saved. If you can control this, I think, in future, like our good old days, we can go back to a system of staging cultural shows. I do not think that we have any cultural shows today. There are no artistes who are prepared to take part in them because they are poorly paid.

So, these things must be taken into consideration. Especially the two factors, the religion and the culture must be maintained by helping the artistes. Then to save the future young generation, they should be encouraged to do their studies properly and not watch these bad films. The Dish TV must be brought under the control of the Ministry and a censorship must be imposed in order to save the people. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you.
