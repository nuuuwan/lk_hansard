( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) . table* . It is a lengthy answer. * : * : * Rest of the Answer tabled:

() . ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Thank you. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have a Supplementary Question.

Can the Hon. Minister explain the measures taken in order to prevent this human-elephant conflict? This is one of the Governments election pledges. As you know, those people had been affected by the ethnic conflict - a man-made disaster - and subsequently they had been affected by the tsunami and floods, which are natural disasters and now they are affected by this human-elephant conflict. So, this is a very serious issue. Hon.

Minister, you, yourself had visited this area during the conflict time. Now, this is the right time - the post-conflict time - for you to visit this area. Some of your officials are not competent enough to handle this issue. Whenever we ask questions from the relevant officials in the Kachcheri, they are not coming out with strategies or they do not have any action plan. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Hon. Member, why do you not ask your Supplementary Question rather than giving a lecture? ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) So, could you kindly explain in brief your strategies or action plan in this regard? ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Sir, I visited there on Thursday. I have informed all Hon. Members of Parliament from the area and others also to attend. Arrangements were made earlier to visit there, but we had to postpone five times due to some urgent matters here. Finally I could visit there only on the sixth time. I am very sorry to say that there were only two Members of Parliament. In fact, I told my Friend, Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana also to attend. I was very sad to learn that there is no cooperation between the Chief Secretary and the District Secretaries. There is no link. I complained about that to the Cabinet also.

So, a lot of people are suffering there. That is correct. I agree with the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana. The Kumana Bird Sanctuary and the Lahugala National Park come within this area. There is a vast forest area where elephants are roaming around. When the Hon. Prime Minister visited there once, he also asked about this matter. Killings, poaching and various other things are happening there. When I visited the Kachcheri, I asked, Where are the Provincial Council officials, Ministers and the Forest Conservator? The Chief Secretary was the only official there and he said, They are absent. While I was questioning him, they came. I have questioned them also. That is the situation there.

We will pay compensation to the families affected by this human-elephant conflict in full. A new housing scheme will be introduced by the Hon. Sjith Premadasa and also a new Samurdhi scheme for the widows and their families will be introduced by the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake. We will also introduce a crop insurance scheme and we are going to pay Rs.200,000 instead of Rs. 100,000 that was paid to such families earlier. These will be done with the participation of four Ministers.

Thank you.

asked the Minister of Higher Education and Highways:

(a) Will he inform this House-

(i) the number of approved leave proposed by the University Grants Commission to Sub-Wardens (Non-Academic) of Universities ;

(ii) whether the number of leave which was 90 days per year earlier has been reduced up

to 45 days by Circular No. 912/1 of the University Grants Commission;

(iii) if so, the reasons for it;

(iv) whether the aforesaid amount of leave has been revised again as 90 days, which is inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, ordinary government holidays and Poya days as well, by the Circular No.04/2003; and

(v) if so, the reason for it?

(b) Will he also inform this House-

(i) whether he admits that the aforesaid employees have been deprived of a privilege which the other ordinary employees enjoy due to the calculation of the 90 days of leave that they are entitled to having included into it the leave which the government employees are entitled to; and

(ii) whether an accepted methodology will be formulated to grant leave to Sub-Wardens (Non-Academic) of Universities without reducing the privilege of leave which the ordinary government employees are entitled to?

(c) If not , why ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I table* the Answer. * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) 90 days per year.

(ii) The University Grants Commission has not issued a circular as No. 912/1. The circular that was issued in this

regard is No.912. According to that, the amount of annual leave is 45 days per year.

(iii) Since it was observed that the annual leave of 90 days that had been granted to sub-wardens (full-time) were granted without consistency by each university, the University Grants Commission has decided to grant the same amount of 45 days of leave, which is granted to the non-academic staff of the university system, to the sub-wardens (full-time) as well, and the circular No. 912 has been issued accordingly.

(iv) The University Grants Commission has not issued a circular as 04/2003. By the circular No. 04/2013 dated 19.03.2013 issued in this regard, the amount of leave has been increased up to 90 days, again. When calculating the relevant 90 days, public holidays, Saturdays, Sundays, and Poya days are also taken into the account.

(v) As per the nature of the appointment of sub-wardens (full-time), they have to engage in duties in all the seven days of the week. A full-time service of seven

days is required for the duties with regard to solving of day-to-day issues arisen for university students and for the duties on other welfare activities. Accordingly, these officers are granted with a leave of 90 days that is not entitled by ordinary public servants, and if obtained a leave whenever on a weekday, that leave would be curtailed from the approved leave.

(b) (i) Sub-wardens, who are performing duties on full-time basis are entitled to certain privileges that are not entitled

by the other university employees. Accordingly, they are paid with an allowance of 10% of their basic salary, and an allowance of 5% of the basic salary for sub-wardens who do not receive accommodation facilities.

A deprivation of privileges does not seem to have taken place as per the nature of the duties assigned.

(ii) Since sub-wardens are assigned with a duty that is entirely different from the subject scope of an ordinary public servant, there is not any possibility to grant leave for sub-wardens in the same manner that of an ordinary public servant.

(c) Does not arise.

: : PRIVILEGE: FALSE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY HON. MAHINDANANDA ALUTHGAMAGE DURING VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE ON MINISTER OF FINANCE ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - Minister of Finance) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, on the 09th of June, 2016, during the course of the Debate on the Vote of No Confidence on the Minister of Finance brought by the Joint Opposition, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Member of Parliament, made certain false, untruthful and unsubstantiated statements against me. The said Hon. Member referred to me personally by name, willfully and deliberately with the intention of insulting and defaming me in the eyes of the public and damaged my reputation and dignity as an Hon. Member of this august Assembly as well as a law-abiding citizen of this country.

The Hon. Member, in his speech, referred to five reasons why that Vote of No Confidence was being moved. Those are, according to him, one, I do not have the confidence of the Government to hold this position; two, the President and the Prime Minister do not have confidence in me; three, I have destroyed the economy of the country; four, I am an accused in an exchange control fraud; and five, I have used my position to influence private businesses. However, he also made a host of other unfounded allegations in the course of his speech.

He informed the House that he has documentary proof of all what he said. However, I must state that the first and the second accusations were proved wrong on that day itself as 145 Hon. Members or 74 per cent of the Hon. Members of Parliament from the Government and the Opposition voted together to defeat the No Confidence Motion. Both His Excellency the President and my Leader, the Hon. Prime Minister, have proved that they continue to have faith in me by being present in the House during the entire Debate.

The third accusation that I am an accused in an exchange control fraud is false and malicious. It is a well-known fact that the Rajapaksa regime made several attempts to entangle me unscrupulously in legal battles,

1243 1244

[ ]

2016 22

including the alleged exchange control matter, from which I was honourably discharged by the court. You will surely recall that in the course of the Debate, the Chair too requested the Hon. Member to produce documentary evidence of his accusations. The Hon. Member vehemently stated that he has sufficient evidence to prove his accusations and that he would table those. Sir, I have got the CD of the relevant proceedings and Hansard with me. He had tabled irrelevant documents that had nothing to do with the accusations he had made. So, the documents he had tabled had neither any relevance nor do they substantiate the specific charges he levelled at me during the Debate. Almost all the so-called "documents" are mere scraps of paper downloaded from gossip websites and unverified notes prepared by himself. At one place, he mentions a vehicle, where the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella writes to me, and says that those were duty-free vehicles that were brought in. They basically did such callous political witch-hunts for nothing else, but to throw mud at us. I invite you to peruse those documents and come to a conclusion on their veracity. The Hon. Member has deliberately misled and hoodwinked the Hon. Members of this august Assembly, where both the President and the Prime Minister were present in person. I asked the Hon. Member whether he was able to stand up and say the same thing outside Parliament because then, I would sue him for every cent he has for what he said. But, he neither has the courage nor the backbone to do so. At this moment, I am horrified, Sir, that as a Member - [Interruption.] Hon. Aluthgamage, you do not have one at all. ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) How do you know? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will tell you who told me that. - [Interruption.] Sir this was a situation where he was unable to substantiate the allegations and that only proves his bankruptcy.

Sir, we have been elected by the people to represent them in Parliament and it is our paramount duty and responsibility to serve them honestly and with commitment. Sir, I can assure you that, as a Member of Parliament who has been serving this House continuously for 22 years, I have acted honestly and true to my conscience. Today, I am appalled at the quality of some people who have been elected to this House. Some who do not even have the basic qualifications to be engaged even at primary level of employment in any organization have been elected as Members of Parliament.

Sir, there is a saying that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones at others; it only shows their own nudity. I do not have to emphasize to this House

as to who has been indicted by court for undeclared assets as he was unable to explain his ill-gotten gains. Very soon it will be known as to who robbed the country and where that wealth is.

Sir, the Hon. Member took undue advantage under the cover of Privileges accorded to Hon. Members of Parliament as well as of the live coverage on the national television to make the wild and unsubstantiated allegations against a fellow Member. Therefore, the only option available to me is to raise this matter in this House and seek justice for the damage caused to my dignity and reputation as a professional, a politician and more or less, to that of the Government of Good Governance, which we have been elected for.

Sir, the Hon. Speaker is the custodian of the rights of the Hon. Members of Parliament and from him, we seek redress when we are attacked from outside or from within. The relevant speech of the Hon. Member appears from Column 771 to Column 782 of Hansard of 09th June, 2016. I request the Hon. Speaker to look into this matter because this not only concerns the Privileges, but he has gone well outside the limits. Therefore, I call upon him to provide the necessary redress.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, what is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) , . [ ] . So, let me speak. , . . [ ] , . [ ] , . . , , . . , . . , -[ ] . , . 1,500

Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . [ ] Wait. I am making a submission. You cannot criticize the Auditor-General in this manner. You can give a reply to what the Hon. Anura Dissanayake asked. But, if you are going to criticize the Auditor-General who acts under the Constitution, it is very clear that you have to move a Resolution. -[Interruption.] No, you just started criticizing what he has done, which is wrong. I am making here a submission because the Auditor-General guides Parliament. We cannot just criticize him in the way we want. That is not done; it had never been done. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Auditor-General's Reports are tabled in Parliament. It is for us to

decide what we do with the Reports. Auditor-Generals conduct cannot be criticized in Parliament without bringing in a Substantive Motion. But the Reports of the Auditor-General can be commented on in Parliament as long as his personal conduct is not involved. It is going to be very difficult for Hon. Members whether from the Opposition or from the Government, to take up some issue or to explain some issue if you say that the Reports put forward by the Auditor-General cannot be questioned.

I think the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip raised a very important issue and I asked the Hon. Minister to reply to it. But, there is a difference between commenting critically or otherwise on the Statements and the Reports issued by the Auditor-General and commenting on his conduct. Certainly, no one wants to comment on his conduct. I think the Hon. Minister is replying to this and as far as the Auditor-General's Report is concerned, very much like the Attorney-General's, the opinions are expressed and finally, the House has to decide, because public finance is under the control of the House.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Hon. Piyal Nishantha De Silva raised a very important matter.

Therefore, I request you to call up the IGP and ask him what has happened; what further action has to be taken and take whatever steps you think is necessary. Since it was brought to your notice, I think, the IGP must come and tell you. I will tell the Hon. Minister also to ask the IGP to come and meet you. Then, if additional measures are necessary for the security of the Member, we can provide that. That is all we can do, since the matter is addressed to you.

Secondly, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in addition to the threat to his life, he made a reference to what is purported to be the law and order situation in Beruwala. I said that it has improved. That is all. BILLS PRESENTED (, ) (, , ) OFFICE ON MISSING PERSONS (ESTABLISHMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND DISCHARGE OF FUNCTIONS) BILL " ;

Even in America and Britain, it has been brought in by the law. How can the Elections Commission be silent on this issue? This is a prime issue. It has become a prime issue even in India. The Elections Commission has to be able to impose controls in order to allow all candidates at least to have an equal status. So, I would request the Elections Commission to give the highest priority to this issue when we call them before the Committee. This is an important issue where both sides have come to an agreement.

, . . .

, the Elections Commission has no powers to delegate authority to any other body. But, today, you are trying to delegate authority through this Gazette. You have no legal authority to delegate powers to any other body. You can have advisers; there is the PAFFERAL and there are other organizations. I mean, they have been very useful. Political parties may come to the Elections Commission and give their response on the issues that arise during elections. That is a different matter. But, you cannot delegate powers to any other body. That is why an Election Commission was established. The Elections Commissioner alone cannot

act. An Elections Commission was established, so there would be others also participating in decision-making than one person. So, that is an issue the Elections Commission should give its attention to rather than attempting to delegate powers to other bodies and say, This was not done by us.

Dinesh Gunawardena) The Election Commission should act with responsibility and not in haste. We might face a referendum in this country. I do not know whether these guidelines are being pushed in haste in order to face a referendum. But I propose all these recommendations should go through the Committee Stage in some manner and our amendments - if we come to an agreement- should be accommodated before this is adopted because these recommendations, the guidelines, should have been adopted within three months and that three months have lapsed. We are not questioning that. It has been placed before Parliament, but it has lapsed. But, by agreement, Parliament can act in order to pursue. So the Election Commission should know that the law of the land has to be followed; Parliament must follow the law of the land. Within three months, you are supposed to get approval

Sir, I am thankful for the opportunity given to speak on the Resolution with regard to the guidelines in relation

to print and electronic media during elections. I would like to go to the history of this Resolution. According to the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, with regard to a violation in State media there could be a competent authority. However, the Legislature thought it fit that private media should be excluded. Therefore, the private media had a self-regulatory process.

? , . - [ ] . . [ ] . [ ] . I was there. What is right is right. What is wrong is wrong. Please do not interrupt. The Eighteenth Amendment- [Interruption.] Yes, I was part of it. I am speaking facts, Hon. Member. I am entitled to state facts.

What did the Eighteenth Amendment do? It took away the control over State media. Then the State media was blatantly violated but the Election Commission could not do anything. We know what happened during the last Presidential Election. We know how the State media was abused. Why was that done? That was because there was no provision in the Eighteenth Amendment. That State media could not be controlled by the Election Commission because there was no teeth- [Interruption.] I was there, but I was wrong. You were wrong. I was wrong. I would like to ask the Hon. Members, was it right by the Eighteenth Amendment to remove the restrictions that were there to control the State media? -[Interruption.] No, by all of us. ( ) (An Hon. Member) . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I say it is wrong. Let me speak. [Interruption.] I can tell it now. [Interruption.] Hon. Member, let me continue. You can speak later. Please do not disturb me.

However, President Maithripala Sirisena brought in the Nineteenth Amendment. The Nineteenth Amendment is the most progressive piece of legislation. It brought in control and there is also penal sanction, including a jail sentence, if a public officer violates these guidelines.

. . There is no teeth to control private media. Therefore, I respectfully urge private media to act with responsibility because there is a greater obligation on the part of the private media to the country as the private media often speaks about freedom of expression. This Government

has thought it fit that there should not be any penal sanction. If there is a violation, the only mechanism used is persuasive effect. However, public officers today are more conscious. We know how public officers acted in the past. Therefore, every officer involved in State media is conscious of the fact that there is penal sanction if there is a violation.

The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena pointed the finger at the Election Commission with regard to finances and said that it should have been included. However, we should congratulate the Election Commission for being progressive in bringing this. If there are lapses, if there are new things which should be added, that could be added.

Before I conclude, I would like to state another matter. We know that media freedom is vital for the country. We know how Sirasa media institution was attacked and we know about the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunge and the dissappearance of Ekneligoda. Therefore, there is a greater obligation on this Government to bring the perpetrators to book. We need to protect media freedom. The media should know their social and legal obligations and act with a sense of responsibility. They say that the pen is mightier than the sword. You could tarnish a persons character or you could finish a persons life by writing something which is blatantly false. However, this Government has given media freedom. There are no incidents where media has been attacked. Therefore, now the media enjoys a wider freedom which it never had. I think, Hon. Members, you all also will admit that fact. Even as politicians, the freedom which we have is greater under this regime. -[Interruption.] No, not two tongues; you can say two or three tongues. But, Hon. Member, I am speaking facts. Facts are stubborn. You and I know, there were certain lapses on the part of all of us. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena) I am surprised. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Why should you be surprised when I am speaking facts? Are you contradicting it? Are you saying that there is no media freedom in this country today? Today you have to accept the fact that there is greater media freedom and you have to be thankful as a politician. Even if you are in the Opposition or in the Government, you have the freedom. - [Interruption.] Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma, is curtailing of media freedom right? Especially, taking away the teeth that was there to penalize the State media by the Eighteenth Amendment was wrong. I know you are a very conscious person. You will agree with me that the Clauses in the Eighteenth Amendment which took away the right of the Election Commission to control State media during an election is wrong. Teeth of

enforcement is necessary. Therefore, I hope this House and the media will work together in giving greater media freedom to this country.
