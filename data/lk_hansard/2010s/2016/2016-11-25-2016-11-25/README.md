Sir, the subject of Forest does not cover the movements of elephants - elephants moving from one side to another. There is no borderline. So, we have to protect the rights of the animals. My job is that. But, rights of the human beings are protected by the Ministry of Justice. I have to protect trees, water and marine under the CITES rules.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Okay. Hon. Member, I apologize for it. I saw it. I thought within one week I would produce not only a CD but some documents. I appreciate your pointing it out. I apologize if there are any errors in the Tamil version. You will not believe, Hon. Member, yesterday evening I said that I wanted it to be printed it in Tamil also. I must thank those boys who did it. They were not private sector advisors who did it; our people did it. So, there may be some errors. It is in Sinhala and Tamil for Sri Lankans. We printed this book in English as well since I am taking this to the international community also. I am marketing Sri Lanka internationally. So, if there are any errors, I apologize for them, because those are human errors. We will correct them. That is why I asked your Colleague, the Hon. Member from Batticaloa, to go through the book and let me know if there are any errors, because it was done in a hurry and we could not proofread before printing.

[5.29p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, on the Discussion pertaining to the Votes of the Ministry of Lands, I wish to take this opportunity to commend the very astute Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs and Minister of Lands, the Hon. John Amaratunga. I have known the Hon. Minister for many years and have witnessed firsthand his unshakeable commitment towards the development and growth of our nation, especially through his dedication to his current offices, which allows for a renewed hope that the Ministries of Lands, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs would achieve new frontiers during his tenure.

I wish to begin with issues and proposed solutions with regard to the Ministry of Lands, that I hope the Hon. Minister would execute within this fiscal year. In the Batticaloa District, which I represent, proportionate land allocation amongst all ethnicities domiciled has been a long-standing issue. I am sure, the Hon. Minister is aware of the issuance of land, or lack thereof especially to Muslim community has been disproportionate. Although currently Muslims represent 30 per cent of the population in the Batticaloa District, they own only two per cent of the land. Further, even Local Authorities, which have a Muslim majority populace, do not have adequate land allocations to effectively cater to their residents within their townships. For example, Kattankudi Urban Council, which is one of the most densely populated towns in South Asia, does not even have adequate land allocated for waste management, which severely affects the health, safety and cause environmental hazards.

Batticaloa District consists of almost 2,610 square kilometres of land of which only less than 2 per cent has been allocated towards the Muslim Community. However, if it is proportionately divided by ethnicity, Muslims should in fact be provided at least with 30 per cent of land, which would satisfy all their requirements.

1257 1258

Hon. Presiding Member, I bring up these points not to create tension amongst our ethnic communities, in fact, it is far from it. My intention of bringing up these issues on the basis of ethnicity is in fact to provide solutions for these ongoing disparities. Proportionate representation and recognition of all communities would be one of the key steps towards identification, respect and coexistence amongst all our communities.

Further, land allocation amongst the ethnic divide has been a long-standing issue, which was further incited by the civil conflict. Terrorism which plagued our country for three decades led to the illegal seizure of lands for the purpose of waging war against our nation, and also some were taken by our military to ensure the safety and sovereignty of our nation. The Hon. Minister has already made significant changes in relation to the provision of acquired land. This process would assist the people to acquire their lands back, who suffered due to three decades of war.

However, I am ashamed to bring to the attention of this House that although the Hon. Minister and the officials of the Ministry have set down definitive measures, the implementation agents, especially the officers in the Divisional Secretary's Office and the land officers et cetera, are unfortunately manipulating and working against the general public, who are merely trying to reacquire their lands. These officers, who use their authority on the behest of the Government to their advantage, can be resembled to a local mafia. They also control the lands, the allocation of such and even stoop down to the lowest level in altering deeds and other documentation to gain monetary benefit out of it.

However, I understand that a Committee has been formed to address discrimination and malpractices in allocation of land. I request that this Committee must be a comprehensive one to make the necessary arrangements to meet people in every district including Batticaloa, Trincomale and Ampara to hear their grievances, failing which, I request that a special commission be formed, presided over by His Excellency the President to ensure that an effective and long-reaching solution is reached, and necessary action is taken against the relevant officials to avoid reoccurrence of such heinous crimes.

In respect of tourism, with the cessation of hostilities, the Eastern Province is a new haven for tourism which provides a new untapped arena in the area for economic growth. In the recent past, there has been development of tourist corridors in Pasikudah, Kuchaveli and Arugam Bay, and it has brought in an influx of tourist-based investments.

Further, as the Hon. Minister is aware, the plethora of untouched stunning coastlines that fringe the District, the vast lagoons and the high potential of eco-tourism available is second to none. The Hon. Minister saw this in his most recent visit to Batticaloa. I wish to request his attention especially to the development and zoning of the Punnakudah, the staggeringly beautiful protected bay, which has a tremendous potential. Zoning and development of the area would lead to an economic upheaval to those domiciled in the area.

Further, I highly endorse the proposal towards encouraging MICE tourism exhibition cnetres in Batticaloa on a PPP basis. Sir, I would like to mention here the proposal of allocating Rs. 300 million towards providing scholarships and incentivising skills development of youth who are keen to join the hospitality industry is a welcome move. This will help to cater to the void in skilled personnel and to increase the employment opportunities for the development in the region.

I am pleased to note that the Budget Proposals state that the Government will implement steps to transform and upgrade the developments in the Eastern Province for the tourism industry, as there is a requirement for recreational and accessibility options to be provided for tourists who are keen on travelling to this region.

Having said this, Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to conclude by thanking the Hon. Minister for his cooperation and I look forward to working closely not only with him but with his able, young Deputy Minister as well and the staff of his Ministry towards the development of Batticaloa, the Eastern Province most importantly and our nation.

Thank you.
