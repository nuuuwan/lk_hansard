[3.41p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. From morning we have been discussing the increase in VAT. What is the reason for this VAT increase? That is the most important thing. Why are they increasing the VAT? As you know, massive projects such as Mattala Airport, Hambantota Habour and Hambantota Cricket Stadium were started by the previous Government and they spent billions of rupees on those projects. I would like to ask you, what is the return that we have got today from these projects? How many ships are coming to that habour? How many planes are landing in that airport? How many matches are being played in that stadium? This is the problem. Had those projects been done in the proper way, we would not have faced this problem of getting the anticipated income out of these projects. Billions of rupees have been spent, but unfortunately, we are not getting a red cent as income. So, that is one of the reasons. We have to pay for their sins.

Take the case of SriLankan Airlines. When our Government took over, as the Hon. Prime Minister mentioned in Parliament, there were only 22 planes but there were 330 pilots and 8,000 employees. Those days the SriLankan Airlines flights were always full and it was always difficult to get a seat. But they said that SriLankan Airlines was running at a loss. So, we have to pay for all the sins that they have committed. We have to face all the problems that the previous Government created. The Hon. Prime Minister mentioned in Parliament that we need Rs. 2,000 billion monthly to run the country and out of that amount we are paying Rs. 1,000 billion as loan instalments for the loans taken by the previous Government. So, these are the reasons for the VAT increase.

As you know, I come from Puttalam, which is a coconut cultivation area. In Puttalam there are big coconut estates that have been taken over by the Government which were running at a profit at that time. But I am very sorry to say that 75 per cent of these coconut estates which come under the JEDB- Chillaw Plantations Ltd. and Kurunegala Plantations Ltd.- are barren today. That is because of the fault of the previous Government. If they had managed those coconut estates well by replanting during the last ten - fifteen years, today we would have been in a position to gain a good income from those estates. But those coconut estates were never looked after. That is one of the reasons we are suffering today.

Now how are we going to solve this problem? This VAT increase is only a temporary issue. So, once these things are settled, once we go back to our previous position we can stop this. Today we are negotiating with governments of other countries with regard to

907 908

Hambantota Habour and Mattala Airport. Also with regard to the SriLankan Airlines, we are negotiating with other countries. Earlier when one of the Arabian airlines took over AirLanka, it was running at a profit. But what did the then Government do at that time? Just because two flights were not given for one of their groups to go somewhere, SriLankan Airlines was taken over and from that day onwards it has been running at a lost. To whom did the previous Government hand over its management? It was handed over to one of the close relatives of the Head of the then Government. I can remember one incident that occurred during that time. On one occasion, when the then Chairman of SriLankan Airlines was in Singapore, a flight that was coming from Malaysia to Sri Lanka landed in Singapore just to get him on to that flight. This is how it was run. There is a mansion in Mattala Airport. This was useless work done by those people. That is why we are suffering today.

Today, our Prime Minister and His Excellency the President are negotiating. Every other week His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister are going to other countries and trying to get their help. They go there not to beg and plead to get loans and not to put people into more difficulties, but to find a way to increase our income, so that we come out of this situation that we are in as a result of these unwanted and unnecessary things done by the previous government.

Take the case of the SLTB. I can remember that the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation said in his speech that there are 100 per cent excess employees than the required number. What is happening there today? There are more clerks than drivers and conductors. There are buses, but there are no drivers. They are unable to employ them because of the excess staff that is there. This is the problem. When the previous government wanted to employ people, they simply employed them. In fact, I was also in that government with them, but I never did that. Today, there are buses, but no drivers are there and we are unable to recruit them. This is the problem we have.

Take for instance the Ministry of Samurdhi. Where are the billions of rupees collected from the poor people at that time? That is missing today. When this Government took over, that money was not there. It has been taken away for some other reason.

What happened to the EPF and ETF? That money is not there. Our Minister of Finance is facing difficulties in organizing these things. This is a temporary issue. What was the position earlier? The previous Government was only friendly with China. Only China was helping us. Almost all the other countries including India - our big neighbour - was against us; America was against us.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) I can remember, a few months back, there was a G7 Summit in Japan. All rich countries got together and they invited our President. There he met President Barack Obama and all other leaders. This is the position now. The earlier position has completely changed. We have got the confidence of almost all the countries in the world and they are ready to help us. It will take some time; it may take a few months or even one or two years. So, in the meantime, we have to run this Government. That is the main reason why this Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill is brought in. Probably within three months or six months, once everything is in order, definitely this can be withdrawn. Therefore, there is nothing to get excited. The Government will go on. You can blame anybody. You can say anything. But the Government is going on. We will do the correct thing because we work under His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister- "Mr. Clean."

Thank you very much.
