( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , . . . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) copy ? ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . , . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Swaminathan, now you can reply. .. ( , , ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Hon. Speaker, I think the Hon.Member of Parliament has got the facts wrong. I will clarify the situation to this House now.

The first question is, why has the recommendation of the Technical Evaluation Committee not considered in selecting a new building for the Ministry? Sir, the Ministry Procurement Committee - MPC - analyzed the recommendations made by the Technical Evaluation Committee. As there was an expansion of the scope and mandate of the Ministry from its original function of Resettlement, to cover additional functions such as Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Hindu Religious Affairs there was an immediate need to shift to another building.

Further, all institutions of the Ministry will have to be brought under one building for its efficiency, effectiveness and to utilize development funds effectively with more collaboration and coordination. Therefore, the Ministry invited open bids to identify a suitable office building. Out of the eight bids received, the lowest bid was not considered because the building is presently occupied by the Department of Immigration and Emigration, and it is not in a vacant position for immediate use.

843 844

The second lowest bid for the office building was No. 28, Lauries Road, R.A. De Mel Mawatha, Colombo 4. This entire building consists of more than 75,000 square feet. There is an apartment complex adjoining the proposed building and the parking area has to be shared with the occupants of that apartment. Since the Ministry has to share this building with some other organizations, the common areas of the building such as lobby, lift and other facilities has to be shared. It may lead to conflict of interests and we might have to face unwanted issues, such as security and privacy concerns. This was going to be a shared arrangement and not exclusive for the Ministry.

The third lowest bid was No. 35/1, Kollupitiya Road, Colombo 03. This building is situated in a prime location next to Galle Road and it is close to the railway station and bus stands. Further, this building was previously occupied by a Ministry - it was a Senior Ministers office. It can be easily accessed by the staff, general public and other stakeholders. Further, other government offices such as the Presidential Secretariat, the Prime Ministers Office, the Office of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of Defence are close to the proposed building. The building has recently been fully renovated and it is in a very good condition. Therefore, the quality and condition of the building is very good and it complies with all the requirements of this Ministry. Further, the bidder informed the Ministry Procurement Committee that additional parking space may be arranged on the request of the Ministry.

Hon. Speaker, this is very important. The rate per square foot of this bid was Rs. 145 while the second lowest bid was Rs. 140. The only difference was Rs. 5 per square foot. Although the quoted rate was Rs. 145 per square foot, the Ministry Procurement Committee analyzed and revealed that the effective rental per square foot was only Rs. 114; that is, 44,600 square feet at a total rent of Rs. 5,089,500. So, we are paying at the rate of only Rs. 114 per square foot at Galle Road. The third lowest bid has many advantages including the factors such as location, quality, condition and easy access, exclusiveness, privacy and security of the building and as such the Ministry Procurement Committee decided to select that building.

The Ministry Procurement Committee observed that the total area which is included in the draft lease agreement of the new building was 44,600 square feet. Anyhow, the proposed bidder requested to pay a rental for only 35,100 square feet at the rate of Rs. 145 per square foot and as such, the effective real rental was only Rs. 114 per square foot - if the requested rental of Rs. 5,089,500 per month divided by the total area of 44,600 square feet.

This matter was referred to the Cabinet of Ministers as a Note to the Cabinet on 8th February, 2016. The Cabinet

of Ministers directed that the decision be taken by the Ministry Procurement Committee. The Cabinet decision empowered and authorized the Ministry Procurement Committee to take a decision in this regard. Therefore, the Ministry Procurement Committee took the decision in line with the Cabinet directive after analyzing the Report of the Technical Evaluation Committee.

Then with regard to the second question as to whether the Procurement Committee has been legally appointed, I would say, "Yes." This is in line with the Procurement Manual (To be used along with Procurement Guidelines 2006 Goods & Works) issued by the National Procurement Agency. Section 2.7.4 of that provides for the composition of the Ministry Procurement Committee. Further, section 2.7.4 of the Procurement Manual clearly sets out the composition and the appointing authority. Accordingly, the Ministry Procurement Committee has been established and similarly the TEC was also appointed following the same Procurement Guidelines.

With regard to the third question as to whether it is satisfactory that a legal procurement process had been adopted, I would say, "Yes." The appointment has been made in line with the Procurement Guidelines as set out in the second question above. The legally appointed Procurement Committee has followed a transparent process following open bids through English, Sinhala and Tamil newspapers. The Technical Evaluation Committee evaluated the bids and the Ministry Procurement Committee unanimously made the decision after analyzing the recommendations of the Technical Evaluation Committee.

Then in reply to the fourth question regarding an appeal being made to the Chief Valuer to revise the rental, I would like to state the following. In the opinion of the Ministry Procurement Committee, if the Chief Valuers valuation is not reflecting the market value, the Ministry Procurement Committee can make a request to the Chief Valuer to re-examine the valuation. Sir, there is nothing wrong there. If the Chief Valuers valuation is not reflecting the market value, he can be asked to revalue it because this is a property situated at Galle Road. Appeal is a common phenomena and the Ministry Procurement Committee only decided to make an appeal. If the appeal was made and if the Chief Valuer said that he could not increase or reduce it, that was his view. So, we have not interfered with the Chief Valuers decision. The building is situated in a prime location in Colombo - 3, which can be easily accessed by the staff, general public and other stakeholders. Another most important thing here is, the building has been recently renovated fully and is in a very good condition.

The rental per square foot in Sethsiripaya, as mentioned earlier, is Rs. 155 and in Rajagiriya, the rental per square foot is Rs. 233. Some Ministries located in World Trade Centre pay Rs. 350 per square foot and here,

845 846

[ .. ]

2016 24

we are only paying Rs. 114 per square foot. So, I do not understand why these questions are directed at me when we are taking a premises in Galle Road for only Rs. 114 per square foot.

Then with regard to the fifth question, whether the approval of the Treasury been sought according to the bid value before obtaining a valuation report and if so what are the reasons; the answer is as follows. The procurement committee has decided to select the substantially evaluated most responsive bidder. Accordingly, approval was sought from the Treasury to release funds for a refundable security deposit. Effective lease rental is lower than the Chief Valuers valuation of Rs. 120 per square foot. Further, a Note to the Cabinet of Ministers was also submitted with regard to the shifting of the office building and the rental arrangements to keep the Cabinet of Ministers informed.

The Ministry has also made considerable savings to the Government by bringing all the institutions under the Ministry in the same premises and that is through the savings done in water supply, janitorial services, security services, communication, transport, electricity, staff time, reduction in the travelling costs and other savings et cetera enabling more effective co-ordination.

Sir, we have brought under one umbrella about five institutions in this Ministry. Earlier they were all separated. One was in Wellawatta; one was in Bambalapitya and another one was in Borella. Now, we have brought all these institutions together. When all the institutions come together, we can save a lot of money. Sir, the entire expenditure of my Ministry comes to about Rs. 5 million a month. By doing this, we are saving more than Rs. 200,000 because we have brought everything together.

So, there is nothing to say that we have exceeded our rights. We have gone through the evaluation. What has happened is, the Hon. Member of Parliament has been misinformed. I think this is happening in all the Government Departments and Ministries. Some officers of a Ministry make false allegations about the Minister and the Ministry officials and ultimately we have to suffer. This is a very open tender. It has been properly procured and I vehemently object making this substantial statement against me for no reason as everything has been very clearly mentioned here. But, I must also thank the Hon. Member of Parliament for raising this Question because then only I can bring this to the knowledge of the general public and inform the public that what we have done is within the laws of this country and there is no base in what you say that we have exceeded our rights.

Then with regard to the sixth question, whether the procurement procedure has been adopted in the construction of 65,000 houses in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and if so whether the lowest bidder has been

selected and what is the name of the Company; I would like to state the following. Sir, this is also a burning issue. Media has wrongly interpreted this. They have given wrong information and they are publishing these facts in the newspapers without proper evidence.

Sir, the Cabinet of Minister on the 22nd of September, 2015 granted approval for the construction of 65,000 permanent houses for conflict-affected families in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. At the same time, the Cabinet decided to appoint a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee which is called, CANC and a Project Committee -PC- to invite Request for Proposals -RFPs- on the 22nd September, 2015 with confirmed financing arrangements and conditions most advantageous to the Government. When I say, confirmed financing arrangements, Sir, it is that we have got confirmed finances for this company where we can repay this in 12 years time without a hindrance to the budget of this country. So, the Government has to pay only the instalments. The first two years is a grace period and after that only we have to start paying the instalments. This "confirmed finances" has been given by the HSBC which is a triple-A bank in the world. Sir, I just wanted to bring that to your notice.

The Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee with the Project Committee invited Expression of Interest on the 04th of October, 2015 through local media and the Sri Lankan Foreign Missions abroad including international websites. According to the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee and the PC Report, there were 35 Expressions of Interest received from the interested parties to build these houses. Of this, 15 bidders were pre-qualified based on the criteria set out in the Expression of Interest covering the financial capacity and the ability to mobilize financing and past experience in the construction with secured financing arrangements. Sir, I would like to emphasize, secured financing arrangements once again.

Out of these 15 companies, only 13 companies paid the non-refundable deposit and collected the Request For Proposals, that is RFP documents. Out of these 13 companies, eight companies submitted RFPs. At the opening of the RFPs, the CANC and PC Reports stated that only two companies submitted acceptable bid security, fulfilling the criteria set out in the RFP document. At the evaluation stage, the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee and the PC Reports stated that in terms of the technical proposal, the two companies namely, ArcelorMittal Construction France and EPI-OCPL Consortium, which is an Indian joint venture, were technically qualified. However, at the financial evaluation of the CANC and the PC, only one company was able to submit confirmed comprehensive concessionary financing facility in line with the RFP criteria. However, ArcelorMittal Construction France has submitted a comprehensive confirmed financing arrangements with

847 848

optional package including lower interest, grace period and long-term repayment period through an internationally reputed bank, the HSBC. The concessionary financing includes six-month EURIBOR plus at 1.34 per cent for Euro financing facility and six-month LIBOR plus at 1.74 per cent for US Dollar facility, which is a very low interest rate as per todays borrowing capacity. The rates 1.34 and 1.74 are just over the present rate. The grace period is one year. It can also be extended for another period of one year. The repayment period is 10 years. So, it will be about 12 years to repay this loan by the Government of Sri Lanka. The bidder ArcelorMittal Construction France covering technical, financing and financing arrangements had been recommended for consideration with comprehensive report. The other bidder has not submitted a confirmed comprehensive concessionary financing report. He was one of the bidders, but he had not given the final concessionary financial agreements to the Committee.

Then in reply to the next question regarding the name of the Company, I would say, Sir, ArcelorMittal Construction France is an internationally well-known company with a turnover of US Dollars 79.3 billion and having a staff of more than 220,000 employees. The branch network is operated in over 60 countries. The share of the company has been listed in the Stock Exchanges of New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Luxemburg and Spain. Considering the international standing of the company Sri Lanka is fortunate to get a company of this nature for a project of this magnitude which will have many openings and linkages to the national economy.

Sir, my reply to the seventh question why the price of a house increased from Rs. 1.2 million to Rs. 2.1 million is, according to the above companys proposal, initially the basic construction cost, which is only for the shell, was Rs. 1.396 million and the exchange rate prevalent at that time was about Rs. 133 per US Dollar. Anyhow the total cost including toilets, tube wells, solar panel, electrical wiring, fitted pantry inclusive of gas cooker, Wi-Fi and other facilities comes to Rs. 2,010,500 at the dollar rate of Rs. 133 prevailed in September, 2015. At that time, a total house would have cost about Rs.2.1 million. The company under its Corporate Social Responsibility, has confirmed to provide furniture, beds and other fittings. It is a huge company in the world. They are virtually giving it free to the occupants. The company quoted a price per unit as Rs. 2.18 million at the currently prevailing exchange rate of Rs. 143 per US Dollar. Sir, the exchange rate has gone up. That is why the price has gone up. The reason for cost increase from Rs. 2.01 million per unit to Rs. 2.18 million is attributed to fluctuation in the US Dollar exchange rate. The other bidder EPI-OCPL Consortium - the Indian Joint Venture - submitted a price of Rs. 1.45 million for a basic house. We are giving solar power; we are giving water; we are giving toilet facility and a well and we are also giving furniture.

The eighth question was, Is it possible to certify that there is no corruption in the transaction? Sir, I do not understand what he meant by corruption. That should be explained because if a company of this magnitude, a huge company like ArcelorMittal Construction France is involved in corruption, which is similar to TATA or to Birlas or any other biggest ventures - Sir, I think that is not a correct statement to be made about them getting involved with corruption. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let the Hon. Minister finish first. Then, you can ask questions. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, I will wind up.

What does the Hon. Member of Parliament mean by corruption? In any event, in my explanation for your Question, the following procedural facts are included and will be placed before Parliament.

The procurement process has been implemented by a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee, appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers and this CANC, comprises of three Secretaries: the Secretary to the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media, the Secretary to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and the Secretary to the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs. It is supported by a Project Committee appointed in consultation with the Department of Public Finance, which comprises of an Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, also the Director-General of the Department of Buildings, the Director-General of the Department of Public Finance and the Director-General of the Department of External Resources. So, all of them have been members of this Committee. The Project Committee with expertise on construction and financing is expected to evaluate the RFPs to support and provide technical inputs to the CANC to take decisions.

With regard to the procedures followed, the following aspects are noteworthy:

a) The CANC supported with the PC - Procurement Committee - recommended ArcelorMittal Construction France for consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers with a comprehensive report.

b) The Cabinet of Ministers further appointed a committee headed by the Secretary to the Treasury with the Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Construction and the Secretary to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs to examine the CANC Report and make recommendations. Accordingly, this Committee also recommended ArcelorMittal Construction Finance for consideration with comprehensive report with recommendations.

(c) Based on the above Reports, the Cabinet of Ministers decided to construct two model houses for the inspection of the public and to obtain their feedback. This feedback reporting process will be completed by end of this month. So far, there are good responses from the public on the model houses.

Sir, I think, His Excellency the President has also inspected these model houses two weeks ago.

The objective of the 65,000 housing programme approved by the Cabinet of Ministers is intended to provide permanent shelter to the conflict-affected families who have lost their houses and assets. The following priorities will be considered in the allocation of houses under this programme:

i. Conflict-affected people residing in welfare centres

ii. Conflict-affected women-headed families

iii. Families with disabilities due to conflict

iv. Families with missing persons and disappearances due to conflict and

v. Refugee returnees who lost their shelters and lived in welfare camps

Based on the need assessment conducted through the District Secretaries, there are 137,000 housing requirements in Jaffna and in the Eastern Province. This project will provide support for only 65,000 affected families in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces under a humanitarian assistance programme. Since, I have explained this to the Hon. Member in detail now, if there are any other questions, I am waiting to answer. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . , . . , . .

. . . , 21 . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, I think the Hon. Member has completely misrepresented what I was saying. I have laid down very clearly the entire tender procedure, as far as the new building is concerned. That new building, we have taken at the rate of Rs. 114 per square foot, where the rate of the other buildings was about Rs. 200, Rs. 265 or Rs. 300 per square foot. So, I do not understand why the Hon. Member of Parliament is repeatedly asking this question. I have gone through the entire tender procedure, which has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, I do not think that I should allow this to be argued further as I have laid down everything in writing here.

As far as the building is concerned, this whole procedure has been gone through from September, 2015

and about four committees have been appointed to go through this whole transaction. There is nothing wrong in that transaction. We have given this to one of the best companies in the world. ArcelorMittal is one of the largest steel manufacturing companies in the world. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Since you have replied to that, we will not go into details. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am just saying, Sir, that this allegation that has been coming in is completely -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. Is that all, Hon. Minister? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M.

, . . . . , , , , . . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 20 . [10.55 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I appreciate some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa, and that is more the reason why we are introducing these new economic reforms and new proposals. Sir, being in Government only for six months, we cannot perform miracles. But, I can assure you that the foundations are being laid for a prosperous Sri Lanka.

In the modern world, where the domestic and international economic landscapes change very quickly, economic management is a continuous task. It is not uncommon, therefore, for fiscal measures to be introduced at various times of the year to respond to emerging challenges. A combination of both international and domestic factors have had an adverse impact on the prospects of the Sri Lankan economy.

On the external front, the rise in the US Federal Reserves interest rate, the slowdown in China, the net outflows of capital from emerging markets in general, the

871 872

disturbances in the Middle East, the sluggish recovery in Europe and Japan, the depreciation of the Russian Rouble and the uncertainty caused by the threat of Britain's possible exit from the European Union have all served to generate significant headwinds for a country like Sri Lanka.

On the domestic front, we are having to take constant remedial action to counter the effects of the highly burdensome legacy which we inherited. The previous Government pursued a policy which was inappropriate for a country like Sri Lanka. Its growth model was based on foreign commercial borrowing financed public investment in infrastructure. The quality of these investments was so poor that they are not earning or saving any foreign exchange. Instead, they have merely resulted in the building up of an unsustainable debt burden. More than US Dollars 10 billion was incurred as external debt, out of which US Dollars 8 billion is from China alone. This has contributed to financing white elephant projects like the port, airport, conference centre and the cricket stadium in Hambantota. The cost per kilometre of the roads has also become a subject of much controversy.

Our Government is now working on a number of projects to rescue the country and the people from the parlous situation of a port without ships; an airport without planes; a conference centre without conferences and a cricket stadium with very few matches. The projects we are pursuing include a 1000-acre industrial zone near the Port in Hambantota, an aviation hub for Mattala Airport as well as trade and logistics centres in the surrounding area. All these activities will increase usage of both the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport. The Port will be further developed on a joint venture basis to handle the anticipated increase in shipping. These plans are designed to reduce the massive debt burden imposed upon the people by the previous administration. We are also exploring ways and means of improving the terms and conditions of the loans taken to finance these white elephant projects.

Our Government is hopeful that it can transform these projects, which are imposing an onerous burden on the people through increased taxes and/ or a diversion of resources from high-priority public expenditure, such as hospitals and schools, into viable businesses earning valuable foreign exchange. Our legacy also includes a policy framework, which disproportionately favoured producing for our small domestic market as against selling into the global market place. The result of all these has been that the growth momentum in the economy has slowed down, debt payments have ballooned, and the economy is not generating enough productive employment. The previous Government created unproductive jobs by increasing the public service from 600,000 in 2005 to 1.4 million in 2015.

The fiscal space no longer exists to continue with this short-sighted policy. Our predecessors have created a ticking time bomb for future generations in terms of pension liabilities. We now need to draw a line under this misguided and burdensome legacy, which is extremely dangerous for subsequent generations. We are determined to restore the growth momentum in the economy by creating high-value employment rather than merely increasing the size of an already over-sized Public Service in an unsustainable manner and by invigorating our export performance with the support of increased Foreign Direct Investments -FDIs.

Sir, in this connection, it is extremely counterproductive that our efforts to create the conditions attractive to investment and to generate employment for our young people are being attacked for no good reason. The Partnership Agreements that we are negotiating with China and India have the potential to be the cornerstones of our development process. These Agreements can give us the access to capital, markets, technology, training and know-how to transform our economy for the benefit of our people. Those who are leading the campaign to attack our efforts should be aware that they are, in fact, undermining the path to prosperity of our people for narrow and self-interested political gain.

I should also place on record that it is unacceptable for Members of this House and others to make totally unsubstantiated and irresponsible statements about professionals who are ready to give their time for advancement of development of the country.

In my view, fiscal consolidation is the most important element of the remedial measures that need to be taken to create a competitive economy, which will create the enabling conditions for accelerated growth, productive employment and a sustained non-inflationary rise in real incomes of the people.

We need to move away from repeating cycles of unsustainable populist policies. We cannot afford to keep living beyond our means as a country. Sri Lanka has been able to live beyond its means largely due to the generous amounts of highly-concessional foreign aid it received over three decades since the liberalization of the economy in 1978. These aid inflows have served to fill the structural gap between revenue and expenditure in a less-burdensome manner. They have also assisted in financing the Current Account deficit of the balance of payments on very easy terms. The downside was that this generous access to easy money enabled successive governments to postpone making the difficult decisions necessary to achieve a sustainable fiscal framework. However, the circumstances have now changed. Sri Lankas graduation to lower-middle-income country status has introduced a new paradigm of fiscal management.

873 874

[ ]

2016 24

Over the last five years, the previous Government substituted foreign commercial borrowing for the declining ODA. As this money was much more expensive, a high premium had to be attached to the prudent use of these borrowed resources. Unfortunately, the opposite happened: much of this expensive borrowing, which has to be paid back by the people of this country, was wasted in the pursuit of a highly-personalized family agenda. The poor quality of much of the expenditure incurred has now meant that the headroom to continue to borrow from international capital markets has become much more limited because of the heavy burden of servicing such debt. In addition, the debt overhang has become a major obstacle to future development.

The time has now come to turn over a new leaf when it comes to fiscal management. It would be dangerous to adopt a business as usual approach. We need to get away from the repeating cycle of stop-go policies of the past that have caused unpredictability and uncertainty in the business environment.

Sir, at this point, it would be useful to take a historical perspective of fiscal performance over the last four decades. The budget deficit has been the main source of macroeconomic instability. It has meant that Sri Lanka has tended to be an economy with a high fiscal deficit, a high inflation, a high nominal interest rate and an overvalued, volatile exchange rate economy. This is diametrically opposed to the successful economies of the East and the Southeast Asia. Unlike in Sri Lanka, East and Southeast Asian countries pursued sound budgetary policies which facilitated macroeconomic stability. This enabled accelerated development in a way, which has not been possible in Sri Lanka.

An unsustainable budget deficit pumps money into the economy. This has two effects: it raises prices and draws in additional imports, thereby exerting pressure on the balance of payments. We must also recognize that the unsustainable budget deficit-fueled high inflation is tantamount to an implicit, very regressive tax on the poor and the vulnerable. The value of the assets belonging to the rich increases with inflation and acts as a hedge against its adverse impact. However, the poor have no such hedge as they own little or no assets. Rising inflation and the balance of payments pressure resulting from the excess demand created by unsustainable budget deficits also exert upward pressure on interest rates. This results in an increase in the cost of financing in the economy and acts as a drag on its growth. Sir, it is remarkable that in every year since 1988, the current expenditure has exceeded the revenue. This has meant that the Government has had to borrow to meet even some of its current expenditure.

In the new paradigm of Sri Lanka being a lower-middle-income country with exposure to rating agencies and international capital markets, this is a level of

profligacy we simply cannot continue. We have to make a decisive break from the past when it comes to the management of the Budget. Poor fiscal management has been one of the key reasons why we have had difficulty in creating an economy that has generated employment and incomes to meet the aspirations of our people. We must not forget our past, which has been marked by two youth insurrections in the South and a separatist conflict in the North and the East. A mismatch between expectations and opportunities has been a major cause of these social upheavals.

As I have already mentioned, the country is now exposed to rating agencies and international capital markets, which will punish poor economic management in the most brutal fashion. We have seen what can happen in Greece recently and during the East Asian and Latin American debt crises in the 1980s and 1990s. We must, therefore, initiate timely remedial measures to strengthen our budgetary outcomes and debt dynamics.

The previous Government allowed the tax revenue to fall to 10.9 per cent of the GDP in 2014. It was above 20 per cent in the 1980s. The norm for countries with our rating is around 18 to 20 per cent. The previous Government's mismanagement of revenue mobilization now means that we have to impose burdens on the people to increase revenue to acceptable norms, to levels which are aligned with the responsibility of the Government to deliver basic services and essential infrastructure to the people. It is our intention to increase revenue to 15 per cent of GDP within three years and eventually, to 20 per cent in line with the needs of a country at our level of development.

During its later years, the previous Government reduced the country to a point where debt servicing absorbed 90 per cent of the Government revenue. They took the country to a point where new borrowing has to be increased to pay off the previous debt.

The measures we are proposing will place us on the path to a fairer and a simpler tax system. They will widen the tax base and improve tax administration. We must also curb unnecessary expenditure while protecting Capital Expenditure and ensuring its quality as that is necessary for developing our economy.

Sir, we are determined to reduce the budget deficit to 3.5 per cent of GDP within five years. This is the level which would align with a sustainable fiscal outcome. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to put our fiscal house in order, once and for all. We need to get away from the ad-hoc approaches of the past that have given us repeating unpredictability and uncertainty in our economic life. The National Unity Government offers the best opportunity we have had to give primacy to the national interest rather than petty partisan politics. We owe it to future generations to seize this opportunity.

875 876

A strong commitment to fiscal consolidation to address the main source of instability in the system and create the conditions for a sustained path to prosperity for our people, their children and grandchildren is the hallowed responsibility of every Hon. Member of this House.

Sir, in conclusion, I hope this House will respond to this historic opportunity by rising to meet its responsibility to future generations of Sri Lankans by breaking with the past of unsustainable populist policies. We need a new era of fiscal prudence. The costs of not rising to this challenge can have devastating effects on our future generations. We must slay the twin dragons of large budget deficits and the unsustainable debt burden, once and for all. I hope this House will do its duty by future generations.

We need to respond decisively to the external and domestic challenges before us in order to meet the aspirations of our people for gainful employment and rising living standards.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . 10 .

M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity given to participate in this Debate on the Adjournment Motion on the Statement made by the Hon. Prime Minister on the 08th of March with regard to the state of the economy of the country and several revisions that he proposed to the annual Budget Proposals made by the Hon. Minister of Finance in November, last year.

The Hon. Prime Minister stated to the House that the countrys debt has now increased to Rs. 9.5 trillion after

929 930

[ . . ]

2016 24

adding the hidden Government dues, which, he says, amount to Rs. 1,442 billion. But, this is a strange statement to make; to say that so much of Government dues were kept hidden unknown to the Government and that now it has come to light and therefore it has necessitated a revision in the Budget Proposals in order to reduce the budget deficit, which has grown as a result of these hidden dues coming to light, and the revenue needs to be increased. I say strange because I do not think this has ever been stated before. A Government, even a new Government, comes and says, "When we made our Budget Proposals, this is what we thought was the debt. But, now we find that it is actually much more." and moves to revise their proposals.

That in itself shows a certain picture of the capacity of the new Government - I say "Government" including officials - and not just capacity but forthrightness as well, because this is not just Ministers changing seats. There are high officials who continue in their positions in the Ministry of Finance and in the various Ministries who have signed loans, who have signed documents, who have committed the country to debt and who continue even after the change of government. Therefore, it is indeed strange that the Government, and the Prime Minister at that, make a statement that so much was kept hidden, which has come to light within a short period of six months.

He says, A total of Rs. 1.2 trillion has to be paid this year as debt service payments, of which Rs. 647 billion as loan repayments and Rs. 562 billion as interest payments, and this does not include the debt that has to be repaid by State-owned enterprises, which amounts to Rs. 1.442 billion. The new debt, which is supposed to have been kept hidden, includes Rs. 365 billion of CPC; Rs. 260 billion of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority; Rs. 211 billion of the SriLankan Airlines and Rs. 21 billion of EPF and ETF overdue on the SLTB. The Ministry of Highways alone has to pay Rs. 24 billion. All of these staggering amounts, the Government says, were kept hidden. Whilst we understand that there can be some truth in saying that some of these were indeed kept hidden, we are constrained to think that the Government could not have been unaware of the general trend in which the economy of the country is moving. There is a capital flight from the country and there maybe reasons for that; there maybe external reasons for that and yet, these are not things that could have taken the Government by surprise.

As the new Government came into office in January, last year and proposed a mini-Budget in February, last year, there were a lot of reliefs and sweeteners given to the people, obviously targeting the General Election that was due last year. But after the election, in November, when the Annual Budget was presented, one braced oneself and got ready to hear the bad news; but the bad news did not come in November, last year. A kind of a Santa Claus Budget continued, only for the Government

in six months time to come and make this confession in the House and start changing their Estimates and Proposals. This is not a good state of affairs. As I said before, it lowers the confidence that investors will have in this country, when you disclose to Parliament that somehow you did not know that such a staggering amount was due; that you made your proposals on false premises and now you have to adjust it.

The foreign debt is a factor that we have lived with for a while, but it is something that successive governments seem to be comfortable to live with. It does not seem to be bothering us that a major portion of our expenditure is actually repayment of our debt. Unfortunately, no definite measures have been taken to reverse this. You cannot do it overnight, we all understand that. But, in the way that the Government proposes to spend money - and I wish to give some examples today - there is no indication that there is a desire to reverse this trend.

For instance, we are an island and ought to be exporting fisheries resources. But, we import fisheries products to the tune of Rs. 30 billion annually. All right, there may have been mismanagement; we may not have invested sufficiently, resulting in this state of affairs - a tiny island with such rich fisheries resources around, yet we pay a huge import bill. Now, if there was a desire to change this trend, you would see annually an increase in the investment in the fisheries sector, so that we will have greater returns; so that we will spend less on imports of fisheries products. But, that is not to be. Only Rs. 6 million investment has been proposed in the fisheries sector. We have a Rs. 30 billion import bill - a country that is an island - and you propose to spend only Rs. 6 million in - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, can I explain that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, please. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is because, as you rightly said, there is a nascent local industry. They are producing tins of fish here. Now they cannot compete with the imported product pricewise. So, what has happened is, we had the option of either destroying that industry completely or giving them a subsidy. This Rs. 6 million is really going to Sathosa so that they can take in the local product and market it in a competitive way, Hon. Member. It is not a subsidy given or an investment to raise the whole fishing industry. It is really a subsidy that is given to the local canning industry

931 932

so that they can compete with the imported product. And I fully agree with you that we cannot afford to spend so much of money, so many billions of rupees, for the imported product. But, on the other hand, we have to safeguard the existing people who have set up these factories. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, your explanation only makes it worse. What you are saying is, even this small amount of Rs. 6 million is going towards subsidy. It is not an investment to uplift the sector. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Private sector has invested already. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Very well. Private sector may have invested. But where is the Government policy of raising the standard of fishing so that we can compete? I am suggesting - you can have different views on this - that something as obvious as the fisheries sector, the Government ought to be investing in much more in order that at least over the years you come to a stage of being able to compete. It is not something that is impossible. It ought to be possible for us far more than it is for several other countries. That is one industry.

Take paper and cardboard import - it is huge. Paper and cardboard import is huge, when our paper factories are idling. The Valaichchenai Paper Factory has not functioned. We have been asking that you revive it. There may be issues with that. The other day I was in the East, in Palamunai, attending the Annual Convention of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. There, on both sides of the road, we saw paddy fields being burnt - the Hon. (Mrs.) Anoma Gamage was also there - and we asked them why they are burning these fields and the reply we got was, Earlier we could supply this straw to make paper to the paper factories. Now, nobody buys our hay. So, it is being burnt on the field itself." We have so much of straw. I mean, we are an agricultural economy. We have so much of raw material and that is going waste.

So, the point I am making is, - I am coming to some other issues - that you have a crisis. That crisis is being identified and presented to the country solely as something that has carved out because the previous Government hid some of the debt repayments that are due. I am saying, well, there may be some truth in it, although you could not have been totally unaware of that. But I am raising another issue of Government policy. How long can we continue in this fashion when even the

resources that we do possess, even the resources that we own, are not put to use because there is no sufficient investment by the Government as a matter of policy to use it, so that we can get returns subsequently? I am not saying again, I am conceding, you cannot do that overnight. Maybe it will take five years, 10 years, 20 years. But unless we start somewhere, what is going to be the state of our economy? The gap between domestic and foreign expenditure, for instance, highways and ports, are all indicative of the anomaly that I am highlighting.

At this particular moment, I want to take one example to demonstrate this and, I have chosen the occasion here in Parliament to deal with this example. This is an example that illustrates what I am saying about the large picture and that example itself is an important one. I am saying it here because I want to be certain that what I say goes down on record. I say it carefully so that there is no misunderstanding as to what I am going to say. This concerns the 65,000 Housing Project for the North or for the North and the East.

It is estimated that 137,000 houses are necessary to meet the housing needs of the North and the East after the war devastation. This has to be met somehow. It was much more - 250,000 houses - at some particular point in time, five years ago. We repeatedly kept appealing to the Government about the Governments commitment to build houses. I remember, the Hon. Minister of Special Assignment, even during the last regime, answered several times at Budget Debates when we raised this and when we asked, If the Indian Government can give us 50,000 houses where is the commitment of the Sri Lankan Government to build houses? There was none.

Now we have a strange situation here. The Indian Government gave us 50,000 houses which was a huge gift, but your Government is now offering to build 65,000 houses - far more. I mean, India could give us 50,000 houses and you are now offering to build 65,000 houses - except there are several issues that have arisen with regard to this particular Project.

Under the Indian Housing Project each house cost Rs. 550,000. There were various issues with regard to that that money was not enough. Nevertheless, it was estimated that you could complete a house for Rs. 700,000 or Rs. 800,000. Under the 65,000 Housing Project, each house is estimated to cost Rs. 2.1 million, which is three times the value of a house under the Indian Project. When the housing need is 130,000 odd, you are offering 65,000 - half of that number - for each house three times the value of the house that was built through the Indian Housing Project. Even if it is not three times, even if it is twice the amount, you require Rs. 1 million to build a house comfortably - still you can build two stone houses for the price of one. When I say a "stone house", a stone house lasts two or three generations. Our people build houses so that they can

933 934

give that as dowry to their daughter and then it passes on. It is, as they say, set in stone - it is permanent. So, when you can build a permanent stone house for Rs. 1 million, very comfortably, a prefabricated steel house is being offered for twice that amount of money.

Yesterday I went to Jaffna to inspect that house. There is a model house that has been built. I wanted to see it for myself before I speak in Parliament, today. I have read reviews by experienced civil engineers and those are not very good. So, I am not merely basing it on what I have seen with my own eyes - with a non-expert laymans eye - but with a background of knowledge from qualified persons. I have taken photographs. Already that model house is coming apart. The walls are moving apart. It is prefabricated. They have brought in the steel and they have fixed it. Already a gap has come. I want to table this photograph of the gap that has already come in this model house. It is beginning to move apart. I table* this photograph. The gauge is very small. There is some material which has been put in between two tin sheets, probably not to pass heat. But if you shake it, it shakes. A stone house does not shake. I was scared to shake it harder because it might have made the wall collapse. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Plantation Industries) Hon. Member, write a formal letter from your political Party to the Hon. Prime Minister objecting to the material they are using. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Minister. That is why I said, I want to do this carefully. I just want to place it on record, because I do not want to be misunderstood. Our people need houses. I do not want it to be said that we have opposed the giving of houses. That is not my intention at all. We are very grateful. We are very grateful, let me repeat it. The Government is willing to offer 65,000 houses for free for our people when they need houses so desperately. But, that does not mean that we should close our eyes to something that is so blatantly obvious to us. That is why I am saying this. It shakes. I asked the occupant about the house. She is very glad. I must put that on record as well. She is very glad that she has got a house. She showed me the photograph of the hut she was living in before and said, Who would have given me a house like this? It has furniture - beds, tables, chairs, kitchenette, two fans, a solar panel, water supply and all

of that - a package. But you cannot do anything to it. You cannot get that material here. If it breaks, that is it. I do not know whether there is a warranty period.

Thus 50,000 houses plus several other housing projects were given to the people at the time when beneficiaries were chosen on the basis of most needy. So, let us say, 75,000 houses have been given to the most needy. Now when you choose the beneficiaries, it is the next section, not the most needy. So they are being given those houses that are two or three times the value of an earlier house. But really we do not know whether it is of that value. It will cause a huge social imbalance. We asked these people, Do you think it will last? They said, We do not know whether it will last. Some engineers told us that it will not last ten years. To my lay knowledge, I do not think it would last five years.

But that is not all. The Government is willing to spend US Dollars 1 billion on this Project - 65,000 houses into Rs. 2.1 million. Now, it is true that you are getting them on concessionary terms. But if you build 65,000 houses for half the amount, your cost would be US Dollars 500 million, not US Dollars 1 billion and if it is a stone house that will last for generations.

We have looked through the facility. You also have a grace period; you do not start paying now; you start paying one year later. All that is true. But, eventually, you have to pay. That is why I said this is also demonstrative of the larger picture. Borrow now at better rates; all that is true. But, you have to pay eventually. You have a ten-year period to repay the whole thing. We want the Government to take a re-look at this. We want the houses. Our people need the houses. But, we want it done in a way that will be acceptable not just for the recipient who will be thankful anyway but also for the society.

Now, when you do a project like this, it also generates employment. When the other houses were built it gave employment to people. I have done a working on how much people can earn off this. If you build it for over a year, it can give employment to quite a number of people. It can actually give employment to 13,000 workers for five years and we have that workforce locally itself of masons, carpenters, et cetera as we have just done for all of these other houses. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The workers were - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) They are locals. They employed labour. It was owner-driven. That had its own faults; but we can learn from those faults. Some of these houses are being given - and

935 936

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

it should be - to female-headed houses. So, owner-built model may not really suit. But, you do not have to do that way. You can give it to contractors. They will employ workmen and build the houses. So, if you can give employment for 13,000 people for a period of five years and spend half of the amount that you will spend, why on earth would you want to spend so much more that benefits so many less?

The tender procedure itself has serious flaws. I was told in August last year as to who was going to build the houses. I was told the name of the eventual builder. I have said this in public before. I will tell you where I was told; I was told on stage when His Excellency the President came to hand over the land in Sampur in late August last year. And, in September, a tender was called for and there were just 12 days time to bid on this 65,000 housing project. All this is very specific and tailor-made for this. There are serious flaws and I do not want to place all of them on record here. That is known and eventually this is happening.-[Interruption] This is steel. There are many steel manufacturers who are looking for dumping grounds because the price of steel had fallen or about to fall. Do we want to give them the dumping ground? What are they getting in return for that and who else is getting what in between, is a very serious question that has to be asked. So, the initial estimate of US Dollars 1 billion is a big amount. In the overall picture, it may be a small cog, but, this demonstrates the policy - the flaw.

It shows the insensitivity to the real local need and the long-term benefit. My house in Jaffna - I only had to do a little bit of repairs - was built by my great grandfather. It is a stone house built more than a hundred years ago. It still stands. I go and live there today. Will this last that long and you are paying double or treble the amount of money that a stone house costs. - [Interruption.] This house was built by my great grandfather and I am still able to live in it. It was built at a time when house building technology was in the primitive stages. It is a stone house. So, why do we do this? I would say, even if a stone house costs more - [Interruption.]You will have to look at the future and invest in that. -[Interruption.] Exactly!

When you ask these people specifically, "What do you prefer, a stone house or a tin house?" They do not want to say it. This is another thing. Forms are published in the newspapers to apply. After this issue has been raised, there is a new clause in the form now. People have to say, "I accept this unconditionally without any change whatsoever ..." and all that and sign. Somebody who does not have a roof over his head will take it. It looks like a caravan. That does not accord with how our people are used to live. Of course, I must be fair, when you have a solar panel and when you have some furniture, all that adds value. There is no question on that. But that is not

the dire need. The dire need is a house. If you can build a house for Rs. 800,000, then with another Rs. 200,000, you can give some more and within Rs. 1 million, you can provide so much more.

So, something that is so blatantly obvious - there seems to be some obduracy to see the obvious, to refuse to see what stares in your face. Therefore, I would urge the Government to kindly reconsider this. I will take the Hon. Minister's suggestion. We have already made our representations without wanting to embarrass the Government. But, since this seems to be going ahead, to avert further disaster, I thought, I will raise it and also for our own people to understand why we have taken up this position. It is not because we do not want houses. We desperately want them. But, it must also be done in a manner that is acceptable and that makes even financial sense.

This illustrates in a way what I have been saying about whole of economy and the approach and the policies that are being pursued. Maybe, it was a shock for the Government, for the Hon. Prime Minister to come into the House and say, "This is really our debt commitment, we have to raise additional revenue and we are changing our proposals." But, along with that, I would urge the Government to take a re-look at the long-term policies and somehow make those changes even gradually so that our debt burden does not keep growing and we become accustomed; I am afraid we have already become accustomed to it. But, we have to look for ways to reduce it and that can only happen by being bold in changing our fundamental economic policies.
