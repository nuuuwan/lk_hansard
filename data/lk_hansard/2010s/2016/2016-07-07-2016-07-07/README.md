( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , ... .

. . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. M.H.M. Salman) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Question I pose to the Hon. Prime Minister is: Sri Lanka acceded to the First Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ICCPR - in October, 1997 and became a State Party to the Protocol. In the same year the President of Sri Lanka made a declaration to the effect that the Government of Sri Lanka recognizes the competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive and consider communications from Sri Lankan citizens.

However, at present it appears that the Government of Sri Lanka is neither responding to the communications brought to its attention by the Human Rights Committee nor taking any action in response to views expressed by it.

In my view, assurances of good governance must include at a minimum responding to communications that are brought to the attention of Sri Lanka by the Human Rights Committee in terms of the Optional Protocol and also taking necessary action which the Government of Sri Lanka deems appropriate upon a consideration of views expressed by the Human Rights Committee.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sri Lanka has been a Party to the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ICCPR - since 1997. The Government led by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena took immediate measures, following the Presidential Election in January 2015, to give effect to all the pledges that we had given to the people of Sri Lanka during the Presidential Election. Good governance, rule of law and human rights, transparency and accountability remain the cornerstones of the National Unity Governments policy and vision. In our view, this is, first and foremost, the duty that the Government owes to our people.

In keeping with this policy and vision, the Government advised the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in January 2016, of continued participation in the communications procedure of the UN Human Rights Committee.

It is our firm belief that engaging with all human rights mechanisms including the UN Human Rights Committee established under the ICCPR constitutes the correct approach.

In view of the Government, the basis for Sri Lankas participation in the communications procedure of the UN Human Rights Committee continues to remain and accordingly, the Government has the political will and the ability to consider the opinions of the UN Human Rights Committee and convey its observations and/or responses to the Committee, in terms of our policy of openness and constructive cooperation with UN Human Rights mechanisms.

The Government intends to devise a timeline and an appropriate approach for responding to the pending communications from the Human Rights Committee since we do not see any bar to doing so as a voluntary State party to that Treaty.

At the executive and administrative level, the Government is solely responsible for implementing plans and programmes that it has pledged to take forward in the advancement of welfare of the people of Sri Lanka. In the policy vision of the Government, the conception of "welfare" includes the protection and promotion of the rights and freedoms of all Sri Lankans and it is our view, therefore, that implementing the obligations assumed by Sri Lanka in the human rights and other arenas strengthens the rights and freedoms of the people, thereby creating a conducive atmosphere for pursuit of economic development and prosperity. The Executive, both the President and Cabinet is answerable to Parliament. The Cabinet is also collectively responsible to Parliament.

Unlike the USA, there is no strict separation of the Executive and Parliament in our Constitution. This is a hybrid Constitution which retains Parliamentary power of control over the Executive under Article 4 of the Constitution.

I hold the firm view that responding to communications from the Human Rights Committee also flows from the fundamentals of our international engagement; that is projecting Sri Lanka as a responsible nation in the international arena and pursuing action towards achieving the said goal is accordingly in order.

The Government, therefore, reconfirms the continued validity and applicability of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for Sri Lanka and is firmly committed to implement its provisions.

With regard to the Singarasa case, the Supreme Court had agreed that the Government of Sri Lanka had set out the correct legal position when it stated in its response to the HRC as follows: "The Constitution of Sri Lanka and

187 188

the prevailing legal regime do not provide for release or retrial of a convicted person after his conviction is confirmed by the highest appellate court, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Therefore, the State does not have the legal authority to execute the decision of the Human Rights Committee to release the convict or grant a retrial. The Government of Sri Lanka cannot be expected to act in any manner which is contrary to the Constitution of Sri Lanka."

If that was indeed the correct legal position, the application to the Supreme Court could have been dismissed on that ground alone. Instead, the Court went on to consider the constitutionality of the accession to the Optional Protocol.

The Court stated that the non-self-executory nature of the ICCPR rights in Sri Lanka and the unavailability of the pleaded relief under existing law of Sri Lanka sufficiently disposed of the case for the pioneer. However, the Chief Justice, with the other judges concurring, proceeded to make pronouncements denying the constitutional competence of the President of the Republic to accede to the Optional Protocol of the ICCPR. These pronouncements are obiter dicta - being unnecessary for the Determination of the Singarasas application - and do not serve as binding authority on the relevant questions.

Then with regard to the ICCPR, the Parliament of Sri Lanka acceded to the ICCPR in 1980 under the Government of President J.R. Jayewardene. I was a Member of that Cabinet. The negotiation began when I was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

It is correct to state that Sri Lanka has been a party to the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since 1997. This was entered into by the President and agreed by me as the Leader of the Opposition. There was Parliamentary unanimity that the First Optional Protocol should be entered into.

At the very outset, however, I wish to point out that it is a fallacy to assume that this Protocol vests the United Nations Human Rights Committee with any kind of judicial power. All that the Committee can do is to inquire into any complaint it has received and express its views thereon. It is left to the host country to decide on the course of action thereafter.

In Sri Lanka, it is a decision that has to be taken by the Cabinet of Ministers - a Cabinet which is ultimately responsible to Parliament in terms of the Article 42 of the Constitution. Parliament in turn, it should be remembered, is the ultimate repository of the legislative power of the people by Article 4(a) and the judicial power of the people in terms of Article 4(c) of the Constitution.

Such action by the Cabinet, in which the President is the Head, can in no way be seen as a usurpation of Parliaments powers as some have sought to make out, since as mentioned above, Parliament controls the Executive.

The pronouncement of the Supreme Court in what has popularly come to be known as the "Singarasa case" that accession to the Optional Protocol of the ICCPR needs a two-thirds majority of Parliament and also approval at a Referendum is nothing but a perverted interpretation of the Constitution.

In my view, it is nothing but an attempt by the judiciary to usurp the powers of both Legislature and the Executive.

The obiter dicta of the Supreme Court violates Articles 3, 4 and 27(2)(a) of the Constitution.

Article 3 states, I quote:

In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights...

Fundamental Rights come under Article 3. It can be taken away only through a Constitutional Amendment and a Referendum.

Article 4(c) states, I quote:

the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament....

Then, Article 4(d) states, I quote:

the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognized shall be respected, secured and advanced by all the organs of government and shall not be abridged, restricted or denied, save in the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided;...

Then, Article 27 (2) (a) states, I quote:

the full realization of the fundamental rights and freedoms of all persons;

So, Article 3 read together with Article 4 (d) and Article 27 (2) (a) can only be varied or restricted by a Constitutional amendment referred to and then approved by people at a Referendum. It cannot be done through a judicial decision. The Court does not even have to exercise the judicial power of the people. The Parliament has it and the Court does it on its behalf.

Therefore, the Supreme Court does not have the power to violate the basic tenets of the Constitution; which the Supreme Court has been unfortunately doing in the last decade. It is very unfortunate that it was trying to override the powers of Parliament and to lock up

189 190

[ ]

2016 07

Members of Parliament and so on. That was an unfortunate period of Sri Lankas political history.

The judicial power of the people is not exercised by the Supreme Court, but by Parliament through the Courts and directly by Parliament, and a decision of this nature can only become law if passed in Parliament by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of the House and moved by a Referendum. The court that has followed the obiter dicta has violated the Constitution. It is a judicial coup against Parliament and the sovereignty of the people.

Instead of confining itself to the matters before it, the Court has meandered into a totally irrelevant area and made pronouncements on the Constitutional competence of the President to accede to the Optional Protocol. This, I believe, is something that should be left to the Hon. Speaker of Parliament in this instance. I would ask the Hon. Speaker, after necessary consultation, to give his Ruling on this matter raised by the Hon. Member and the Statement made by me. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, would you like to ask Supplementary Questions? . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. M.H.M. Salman) I would like to thank the Hon. Prime Minister for the very detailed Answer. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You can ask three Supplementary Questions. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Let the Hon. Member finish his Questions. He is on his feet. . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. M.H.M. Salman) I must first thank the Hon. Prime Minister for the detailed Answer and also for correctly setting out the Constitutional provisions covering this subject matter.

Sir, I have one Supplementary Question to raise. In relation to the Answer given by the Hon. Prime Minister, I want to ask whether the Government considers taking action in response to the views expressed by the Human

Rights Committee and in respect of communications made by the Human Rights Committee before and after the Singarasa case, which was reported in Sri Lanka Law Reports. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Certainly, we shall do so. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) As the Hon. Prime Minister has today given a view or an opinion and requested the Chair to make a Ruling on a very important judgment in relation to the Constitution of Sri Lanka which had been delivered by the Supreme Court, we would like to have a Debate on what the Hon. Prime Minister replied to the House. I hope that the Hon. Prime Minister agrees to this because this is a very serious issue on which- ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You can take it up at the Party Leaders Meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I hope that the Hon. Prime Minister agrees with it. I can take it up at the Party Leaders Meeting. But, I hope that the Hon. Prime Minister agrees to have a Debate on what he has stated in the House before the Hon. Speaker gives a Ruling. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have laid down the procedure. The Speaker should give the Ruling after necessary consultation and that necessary consultation can be the expression of views by the Members of the House and the Speaker can, then, give the Ruling. It need not be a Debate. It is a Session where we have Sittings separately on this issue. I am all for it. Finally, I am happy that the Hon. Member agreed with me that the jurisdiction for this rests with the Parliament and not with the Supreme Court. So, all I am trying to do is to take away the Supreme

191 192

Court acting as a dictator and to bring it into Parliament.

Mine is a very fundamental issue. How can Article 3, Article 4 (d) and Article 27 (2) (a) be run off by an obiter dicta of the Supreme Court? We are all being made prisoners and our rights are taken away. I think it will be very interesting to have that Debate because we have to reverse this trend. We know what happened; we know how the Members were taken away from this House. -[Interruption.] Yes, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, as the Speaker, has given a Ruling. So once it was given as a Ruling, you cannot have the Supreme Court trying to get around the Hon. Anura Bandaranaikes Ruling in other ways. It may be that they are in breach of privilege of the House. If the Speaker rules that the House is supreme, then we will have to decide as to what should be done for those who are in breach of privilege.

Look at the number of jobs that were lost because of this. If we had had this by now, we would have had far more jobs in the country. Look at Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In 2005, we were exporting to the value of US Dollars 3 billion and they were exporting to the value of US Dollars 5 billion. Today, they are exporting to the value of US Dollars 25 billion. Where are we? We should have had at least exports worth US Dollars 15 billion. , . . , ? . . [ ] ? [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , - [ ]

- [Interruption.] This is very important. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, you raised a point of Order and made an appeal. The Hon. Prime Minister said that he has no problem with that. Now, the matter is before the Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We will decide the date and the time.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Prime Minister is proposing that we get the Hon. Speaker to give a Ruling and thereafter to have a Debate. What we are requesting from you is not that. Now, you come to Parliament and make a new opinion on a judgment delivered 20 years ago. That is a procedure which has never been followed by any Prime Minister. So I am only asking you to give us a Debate before the Hon. Speaker gives a Ruling. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the procedure is, the Hon. Speaker will listen to the opinion of the House before he gives the Ruling and that opinion of the House can be in a public Sitting of the House on a date agreed. If you want, you can have half-a-day; a full day; one hour or two days. I never said to have a Ruling and go for a Debate. The actual word for this is not Debate. You get the opinion of the House where Members express their views and then the Hon. Speaker gives the Ruling. It is not a question of vote. That is all that I have asked for and I have not said this after 20 years, - .- and that was confirmed at the last Presidential Election. The powers of Parliament cannot be taken away by the Supreme Court as and when they like it. That is all I am saying. There are some judges in the lower court who still think that that is happening.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is my unenviable but obligatory duty to provide this House with an adequate and accurate explanation regarding the sudden

interruption of water supply to many densely populated parts of Colombo and Greater Colombo. It affected and inconvenienced residents of Wellawatte, Ratmalana, Mount Lavinia, Dehiwala, Bambalapitiya, some parts of Kollupitiya, Kohilawatta, Ambatale, Mulleriyawa, Jayanthipura, Pelawatta, Pamankada, Thimbirigasyaya, Havelock Town and such areas on Monday the 05th and Tuesday the 06th of July.

The immediate cause of it was a severe rupture of the main arterial pipeline that carries water from the purification plant at Ambatale to the distribution centre at Dehiwala. The rupture of the pipeline, which affected nearly 10 feet of the supply line, occurred at the Thalangama Depot near the Hyundai service station. This massive pipeline is about 60 years old and conveys 5.4 million litres of water per day. The imperativeness of attending to the necessary repairs was obvious in the light of the threat of flooding a huge residential area in the immediate environs of the pipe burst. Hence, urgent repair work was undertaken immediately.

Attending to repairs of the subterranean pipeline naturally involved complex excavation work. The affected portion of the pipe had to be replaced. The work had to be carried out after reinforcing the walls on either side of the site to prevent a collapse, which would have been an added impediment. The replaced pipe weighed about three tonnes and 36 slangue joints had to be replaced in the operation.

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board and my Ministry deployed all required resources, which included more than 50 workmen and varied heavy equipment. The replacement of the part of the pipe and the attendant adjustments were executed in the minimum time, given its complexity. The pumping of water at Ambatale recommenced at 5.30 in the evening yesterday.

A similar breakdown had occurred about 40 years earlier in 1982 at Battaramulla and the restoration work took four days. We managed to attend to the most recent episode in less than 24 hours and that is an achievement that testifies to the progress we have made in the provision of the vital utility and the technical prowess we have since acquired.

Parallel to the repair work, we used 25 army bowsers to carry 8,000 litres of water every five minutes continuously to Dehiwala, Bambalapitiya and Kollupitiya areas. Water was supplied to Ratmalana from Moratuwa while Kollupitiya and Bambalapitiya areas were provided with water from Fort and other areas.

The Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board were physically on location at the repair site throughout the day. The Resident Engineer, the General Manager, three Deputy General Managers and an Additional General Manager together with a crew of about 50 workmen offered their

251 252

tireless support during the operation despite an intervening holiday. I would be seriously remiss if I do not take this opportunity to express my deepest appreciation and gratitude to each one of them.

I offer my humblest apology to the general public inconvenienced by an accidental occurrence that was totally beyond the control of those responsible for the supply of water to the premier metropolis.

It occurred on a day that the Muslims were celebrating Eid was an added unhappy coincidence.

I deeply regret the insinuations made in statements attributed to by some politicians who rushed to condemn me for my supposedly scant knowledge of the subject. Those malicious utterances were intended to fish in troubled waters. The pun is intended. No doubt, the people would have treated the utterances of bankrupt politicians with the contempt they deserve.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, are you suggesting a solution as well? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no. It was repaired immediately. But, in the future- ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) But, you may need new pipelines so that we will have a long-term solution. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the fact is that when such an accident occurs, the difficulty is that we have only two-and-a-half hours of supply in stock. Therefore, we have to take some immediate steps to at least carry 12 hours of supply in stock. For that, we have to create sumps and new towers. That is something that we have to concentrate on. I will soon be taking action towards that. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Eventhough it is not your personal matter, taking the responsibility is a great thing. People will respect you for that.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you. : 2016 24 "", "" "" : 2016 24 '', '' '' PRIVILEGE : "DIVAINA", "RIVIRA" AND "MAWBIMA" REPORTS OF 24TH JUNE 2016 ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.

, . , .. , . , . [5.26p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am glad to participate in this Debate in which we are incorporating the National Research Council of Sri Lanka which was founded in 1999 and formally established in 2007.

I want to congratulate the Minister, Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha, for actually presenting this Bill in Parliament which should have been presented a long time ago.

We know that it is very difficult to draw public attention to this subject and also to get resources. I remember the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, in the last Parliament tried many times to get resources from the Ministry of Finance and Planning for science and technology and for research and development and those efforts often failed. Though we were in the Opposition, we were very supportive of his ideas in trying to attract investment into science and technology and research and

333 334

2016 07

development. So, I want to congratulate the present Minister, Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha, for being able to actually bring this Bill before Parliament.

As we all know, the objective of this Bill is, I quote:

(a) to assist the Government to facilitate research relating to science and technology in order to build a vibrant scientific and technological community in the country;

I think this is a very laudable objective. It is not talking about building an institution but it is talking about the institution being an instrument to build a scientific and technological community.

Just last week, I had the privilege of going to Orion City IT Park. When we think about Orion City, we remember one of the most celebrated industrialists in our country, Mr. A.Y.S. Gnanam, who started his career by collecting scrap iron material. Then, he graduated into light industrial production and if you want you can call it hardware. When you think about the Orion City which is now the brainchild of the grandson of Mr. A.Y.S. Gnanam, they are now into software. Last week, I had the privilege of opening basically just a space where software engineers, technicians coupled with the British Council bringing in literature and also inviting Coffee Bean- just a restaurant- together for creating an environment. What was it about? It was about creating an environment so that people could gather, share their ideas and thoughts and basically come up with some innovations.

Often we hear, in this Assembly, that Sri Lanka has to create a knowledge economy. A knowledge economy cannot be created unless we actually invest in knowledge, particularly in science and technology. It is actually appalling to see the facts relating to research and development. In 1996, Sri Lanka invested only 0.18 per cent of its GDP and in 2010, it went down to 0.16 per cent and I think, even the latest figures will not be very different. Singapore, in 1996, invested 1.32 per cent of its GDP and it went up to more than 2 per cent in 2010, 14 years later. Malaysia was 0.22 per cent in 1996 when Sri Lanka was 0.18 per cent and we remained at 0.16 per cent going down slightly while Malaysia increased it by nearly five-fold to over 1 per cent of its GDP.

Today, South Korea is 3.47 per cent ; Japan is 3.25 per cent and even India is 0.8 per cent, which is merely six times more than Sri Lanka. So, we have really underinvested in science and technology. If we look at research and development and investments that are made by global companies, we see that among the first 12 companies globally, there are two Asian companies and virtually all the other companies are US companies. One of the two Asian companies is Samsung, which in 2015 invested US Dollars 14.1 billion in research and development and the other is Toyota, the automaker, which invested US Dollars 9.2 billion. All the other

companies are well-known companies like Apple, Google Amazon, 3MG, Microsoft and IBM, which are US companies. So, we have over a long period of time underinvested in science and technology and in research.

Time has come. What this National Research Council of Sri Lanka Bill doing is, it is giving a clear signal that science and technology is important. We know the world over that it is now talked about Science, Technology, Education and Management as the areas to invest in or the STEM subjects. In Sri Lanka, our universities receive very little in terms of investment. Therefore, when those few rupees are given, it is distributed on an equity basis so that every university has something and then it could probably get the basic equipment required for research and development. The National Research Council of Sri Lanka is different. It works on a different basis. It works on a basis of not institution-building, but it works on a basis of actually building a science and technology community working through present institutions.

Another objective of the Bill is that it is not confined to the State sector. The Bill provides for encouraging research and development in science and technology basically through encouraging the private sector too. It is encouraging high calibre research. Some of its research is multi-disciplinary and some of it is targeted to national needs. For example, presently, we see that there is research going on in improving the dairy industry to achieve self-sufficiency; there is some research going on in developing polyvalent anti-venom for snake-bite; there is also another research project to integrate vector management for control of Dengue, which has become a national problem; then, there is also an integrated study for kidney disease because of the uncertainty of how actually this happens and what should the response be and then, there is a very interesting research going on into climate resistant agriculture. As you know, Sri Lanka often faces lots of natural disasters and therefore, we need resilient crops as food security is an important part of our Governments policy.

These projects that I identified are already ongoing, funded by the national Budget and those are our development priorities. Presently, as I speak, there are more than 50 applications that are being evaluated to select projects for funding under this programme.

Another important feature of the National Research Council is that it encourages public-private partnerships in science and technology and research and development. Therefore, the Government, through the NRC, is committed to match-funding those private sector companies which come up with potential projects for research and development. There are many, but in the interest of saving time, I would not mention some of the projects that are already ongoing. But, this is a very important step forward because we are interested in having higher-income jobs, which will only come

335 336

through higher use of technology and science, and that is where the country should migrate to in terms of creating value-added jobs.

The National Research Council also looks at investor-driven research programmes. This is not necessarily what the Government thinks is a priority. But, it is where anyone who can identify a priority could actually put a project forward. So, there are two ways of looking at this. One is, you identify a problem and you put forward a research proposal as I said - a target-oriented, multi-disciplinary programme. The other is to create a need in society, where you take up science and research and you commercialize it for the benefit of the national economy. That does not originate with the Government; that originates with the people who have ideas and the Government is the catalyst in helping those people.

I must also mention that the National Research Council, even though it has not yet been incorporated through Parliament, it has already, to its credit, encouraged many scientists to publish their findings. Therefore, there has been recognition of scientific merit based on their publication in reputed index journals. In recent years, from 1999, we found that the number of publications globally by Sri Lankan scientists has increased by manyfold.

In addition to that, we also see a direction in which new ideas are being patented. I must say a word here about patenting. When a scientist is involved in research and finds something new, an idea, that idea belongs to the scientist. So, the patent will often recognize, not only the institution, but also the scientist, so that the benefits could accrue to those who are working in these particular fields. We are really working for a better Sri Lanka. We want a better environment for our scientists and our technologists; a better future for our children.

If I were to close on a personal note, I also speak as a parent of two children, one of whom is a daughter who has a scientific background and who, until yesterday, worked at the SLINTEC and now, somewhat reluctantly, is moving away for other opportunities. I speak on behalf of the next generation, because Sri Lankas economic future is dependent on how much we invest in science and technology as that is where value-addition will come in, where new incomes and new jobs will come up.

I would also like to make an invitation, as we vote today on the National Research Council of Sri Lanka Bill, to the Sri Lankan scientists across the world: "You are indeed important. You have a contribution to make and even through this small step we are taking, you will see an opportunity to contribute to your motherland".

Thank you, very much.
