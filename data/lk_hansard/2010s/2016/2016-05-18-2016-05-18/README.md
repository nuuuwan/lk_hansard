Hon. Deputy Speaker, we have been discussing the situation of the SriLankan Airlines the whole of today and yesterday. The issue of an exit strategy for the Government in the parlous economic situation concerning this State-owned enterprise has been a matter of debate for many long years. During the 37 years of the existence of the SriLankan Airlines, except for the eight-year period during which the Emirates Airline had a strategic investment and management contract with the SriLankan Airlines, the rest of the years have been loss-making years; particularly the recent years and that too unfortunately after having brought the longstanding conflict to an end. It is very unfortunate that we were unable to turnaround our national carrier and it had run into very exorbitant debt and has come to a position where there is no option, but to once again the Government to take over the debt and to restructure the company.

There are several methodologies that we can adopt. But I must say very clearly here that we should not in the meantime forget the need for a national carrier for the country. It is not for us to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We should also realize that the SriLankan Airlines, during the 30-year long period of the conflict, had been of immense service to the country. Firstly, it played a pivotal role in keeping the tourism industry alive in this country. The SriLankan Airlines has played a very important role in that regard. It also provided the necessary air movement for our expatriate workers in the Middle Eastern areas. That was another aspect which we should not forget. Then, it also facilitated the Sri Lankan exports at a time when foreign carriers withdrew from Sri Lanka due to the conflict situation in the country. Therefore, having had a national carrier, we should not forget that it served the purpose, though we have run into difficulties in financially managing the airline to a satisfactory level.

We must also realize that airline industry all over the world is faced with problems. The entire world situation is, when it comes to the airline industry, it is not a profitable business to enter into, except for a few airlines, which once again are owned by very rich countries - the oil rich countries like the United Arab Emirates. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) And subsidized poorly. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, but in the meantime, most of them have been subsidized heavily by their own governments. I must say that we have had some very high degree of politicization; there has been a certain degree of cronyism, which has been rampant in the management of the SriLankan

249 250

Airlines. I do not want to go into these sordid details that have already been spoken about, but look at proactively what we can do to restructure the management and to retain the national carrier with at least some of its pride intact.

We all know that there is a brand value for SriLankan Airlines. Everybody appreciates all over the world the service standards of the SriLankan Airlines. Comparably with the other airlines, they still consider the SriLankan inflight service to be of a very high and better standard. We have several times won many international awards.

Therefore, I am sure in finding a strategic partner, we must look at and leverage the advantages we have with an airline which has a certain amount of goodwill that is still there which would be an attraction for us to negotiate with possible parties. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) It is interesting the way you are speaking. But, you are running out of time. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

I will just wind up with one particular aspect. At the request of the Prime Minister, I went to discuss with the Turkish Airlines and persuade them to come and look at a strategic partnership with the SriLankan Airlines. There had been discussions by others, and they have been looking at a possibility of doing some review. But, what is important for all these carriers - the main attraction - is our national carrier's inventory to India, because of the free Sri Lankan traffic rights and access to India due to its Open Skies Agreements with us. We have that access and that is an attraction that any prospective airline would find in negotiating. Then, also, the other bigger airlines have a negotiating capacity because of their buying capacity with the airbus industry, since we are now saddled with the A350 airliners to be delivered in September. We have already cancelled four of them. But, then, the rest of the four are in order to negotiate - some of these airliners have a better leverage because of their capacity with the airbus industry. I am sure, with those issues, we would be able to find a good strategic partner for us to retain the brand name SriLankan and to resuscitate the failing airline and to continue with it in the future. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. You have 14 minutes.

[.. 5.21] ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) , , . , , . , . . , . , . , . .

Sir, I would like to quote from an article which appeared in the "DailyFT" newspaper of 27th January, 2016 under the caption "SriLanka's Rebirth" where Mr. Joseph E. Stiglitz made his views on the PPP - public-private partnership. Joseph E. Stiglitz Nobel Prize winner . Having come to Sri Lanka, he very candidly said the following about the issue of PPP. He stated, among other things, I quote:

Markets on their own wont solve this problem. Sri Lanka will need balanced affirmative action -

"Affirmative action", means to intervene in the markets, not lend yourself to the markets.

:

Likewise, another frequently proposed strategy, public-private partnerships, may not be as beneficial as advertised.

It is because the world is in a fairly weak economic outlook. There is a stagnation in some countries and in others the purported growth is not an actual growth. In these circumstances, investments are difficult and everybody is looking for investments which can give the best returns. . , , "Public-private partnerships are not beneficial as advertised" . He further goes on to say, I quote:

"Such partnerships usually entail the government bearing the risk, while the private sector takes the profits."

.

So, these will serve you as an advisory. You got him down and this is what he had to say about PPP. Then, what does he further say? I quote:

Typically, the implicit cost of capital obtained in this way is very high. And while the private sector can, and frequently does, renege on its contractual obligations (through bankruptcy) -

251 252

[ ]

2016 18

Private sector often does that. They renege on their contractual obligations through bankruptcy, their method is "bankruptcy".

-or force a renegotiation under the threat of reneging - the government cannot, especially when an international investment agreement is in place.

So, he advises against public-private partnerships which are not as rosy as they are advertised.
