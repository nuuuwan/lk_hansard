(ii) due to the landslide which followed the recent torrential rains, this house is on the verge of collapse?

(b) Will he state whether -

(i) steps will be taken to renovate that house which is highly vulnerable to disaster; and

(ii) appropriate steps will be taken to minimize the damages being caused to other houses in the vicinity, with further landslides occurring in those mountains?

(c) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of Disaster Management, I table* the Answer for Question No. 06. * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) Situated on a mountain slope (200 - 300.)

(ii) There has been no landslide consequent to the recent heavy rains. The layer of filled soil in front of this house has been washed away by the rain water and has subsided and no damage has been caused to this house so far. If no remedy is taken to prevent the filled soil from being washed away, the house will face the risk of being damaged.

(b) (i) There is no need for repairing the house. However, if the fill slope continues to be washed away, the house will possibly be damaged and therefore, some remedy has to be taken to prevent it. There is no possibility of allocating provisions from public funds to construct retention walls in order to protect houses from damages that could be caused by such improper human activities. Action can only be taken to raise awareness.

(ii) A comprehensive geological examination was carried

out at this site by the National Building Research Organization and according to the findings of that examination, it was observed that the instability has been caused by human activities (improper constructions, very high vertical cut slopes, and improper rainwater management) and remedies such as introducing retention methods for cut slopes and constructing a surface drainage system to facilitate rainwater flow should be taken and in future, plans should be developed in such a way that they are appropriate for the geographical position. This recommendation of the National Building Research Organization should be taken into consideration.

(b) Will she also inform this House -

(i) whether differentiating between the rights of women according to different religions and races will have some impact on the common law of the country;

(ii) if so, of the impact it will have?

(iii) whether such an impact will cause discrimination towards women representing different races and religions; and

(iv) if so, whether steps will be taken to formulate laws to subject all women living in Sri Lanka to a single body of laws?

(c) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of Women and Child Affairs, I table* the Answer for Question No. 13. * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) Yes.

(ii) Our Ministry has taken action in various fields to eradicate discrimination that women face due to being women.

1. Introduction of new legal provisions

Eg: To eradicate discrimination against women that occurred in obtaining land ownership for women under the Land Development Ordinance, taking action in collaboration with the Ministry of Land Reforms to introduce amendments to the said law.

Taking measures to get a Bill passed for the appointment of a National Womens Commission empowered with the authority and capacity to provide services for women actively and more effectively to ensure the rights of women who are subjected to discrimination.

Prevention of Domestic Violence Act enforced in 2005 is being amended at present.

2. Taking new policy measures

A National Policy on Widows that emphasizes fair treatment for the widows in this country is being drafted.

Advocating the adoption of a gender perspective in formulating every policy of the Government.

Informing the line Ministries, Provincial Councils and Districts to allocate 25 per cent out of government funds allocated for rural development affairs for projects to empower women as per the Cabinet Decision in that regard and assisting the implementation of the same.

3 Taking measures to eradicate violence against women

One main consequence of discrimination against women is women becoming victims of violence. A dominant task of our Ministry is the implementation of rural and national level policy, programmes and measures to eradicate that. Introduction of

new laws and regulations for that purpose as well as initiating the introduction of amendments to laws.

(Eg: Amendment of law related to abortion/assisting the preparation of the background required to recognize marital rape as an offence.)

At the same time, Cabinet approval has already been obtained to formulate and implement a National Action Plan to eradicate violence against women in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme.

Further, a Women Help hotline (1938) and a complaint centre to refer problems of women victims of various types of discrimination and violence is already in operation attached to the National Womens Committee of our Ministry. Provision of legal and counseling services to the victim is done through that.

Several island wide awareness and empowerment programmes on various topics are also implemented.

In addition to that, implementation of gender sensitization programmes for law enforcement institutions (Eg. The Judiciary, the Police) and officers at decision making level of this country.

(b) (i) There is no impact on the primary law. The Constitution is the primary law of this country. As per Article 12(2) of the Constitution, no citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or anyone of such grounds. But Article 12(4) allows making special provision by law or subordinate legislation for the advancement of women and children. Even though there is the possibility of enforcing laws specifically for different communities according to their religions and opinions there are instances when personal laws are in conflict with the common law of this country.

(ii) As a result of the inclusion of contradicting provisions in the common law and the personal laws of this country (Muslim law and Thesawalamai law) there are instances when certain injustices are done to women within the family and the society.

Eg. Property ownership and division, marriage and divorce.

(iii) There are instances when certain conflicting laws, in particular in the Muslim law, Thesawalamai law, Kandyan law and the common law in this country affect specially women.

Accordingly, discrimination against women who are subjected to the said laws may be witnessed. As one obvious example, anyone could argue that women who come under the Muslim law are subjected to injustice as Muslim law allows marriage for a girl of even 12 years of age though the marriageable age under the common law is 18 years. It should be stated that this situation is a controversial one.

(iv) Yes.

(c) Converting various systems of law that had prevailed in this country for a long time into a single system of law could cause a huge upheaval. As we are bound by the Constitution itself to ensure equality while strongly rejecting racism and religious fanaticism in this country where people of different ethnic groups live, it is better to bring all citizens under a common law

829 830

without causing problems. Anyway, my Ministry which represents women is laying the ground work at present to build up a dialogue with all relevant parties to amend laws that discriminate against women and provide equal protection of law for all women. - : - : RAKWANA-MADAMPE ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: COMPENSATION 679/16 15.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Minister, why is it that the Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project getting delayed without any reason? I am not talking about the main line to Jaffna which was a planned project that was approved, but about the Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project. It was almost 80 per cent through. For the last 18 months, you have not been able to do it. Why is that? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) There is a problem. -[Interruption.] Definitely, I do agree. In this regard, I have made several statements in the House. Questions have been posed to me by the Hon. Members. I went to the Kilinochchi District Secretariat and held a meeting with all the Northern Province political representatives. The issues are well known to all the political representatives in the House. Almost all the elected political representatives both in Parliament and Provincial Councils are opposing the Iranamadu tank water to be used for the Jaffna Peninsula. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That is a separate issue. I am talking about the Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project.

839 840

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Ah, you are talking about the Kilinochchi Project. That is being done. The Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project is on. By 2018, it is to be completed.-[Interruption.] It is correct. I have replied here. That Project is now on and will be completed by 2018. Hon. Devananda asked about the Pooneryn area. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, please reply without making it a debate. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I have answered. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon.

, , . . , . . , . The Embassy of Sri Lanka at 3025, Whitehaven Street Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia 20008, United States . It states, I quote:

The Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms is calling for submissions from diaspora organisations on the design of structures, processes and measures for truth, accountability, reparations and non-recurrence, i.e. an Office on Missing Persons, an Office on Reparations; a Judicial Mechanism with a Special Counsel; a Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-Recurrence Commission; and any other mechanisms, processes or measures for advancing reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

Submissions can be made to the Task Force by diaspora organisations/ individuals until July 28, 2016.

This has been issued on the 20th of July, 2016 by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Washington to the international community. But, the Parliament of Sri Lanka is unaware of this. I do not know whether the President is aware of what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is doing. These actions have to be accountable.
