important Ministry. There are a number of matters to be noted and, I think, this particular Ministry is very important to go ahead with the reconciliation programme. The war-affected community in the North and the East must be properly empowered. They should not have any psychological impact in their minds that they are still under pressure and they do not have any means of livelihood et cetera.

Sir, the donor community and the Government must cease to develop interventions and programmes sitting in chairs in Colombo. They need to visit the affected areas, consult people, collect statistics, have their input and then decide what is required for social empowerment.

Social empowerment must start from knowing what the problems are, defining clearly who we are trying to protect and discussing with them how to develop programmes. It is not just carrying out run-of-the-mill programmes that were implemented in some other country in another context. In the recent past, enormous amounts of money has been spent on fashionable projects presided over in a lot of cases by social elites and we do not even know the success or otherwise of such large expenditure.

Some people come in cars worth of millions of rupees, with a driver costing more than a senior public servant and spend a few thousand rupees on the affected women. Such humanitarian and development industry actors have retained the monopoly for interpretation of the sufferings and solutions.

Sir, social empowerment is asking the affected persons what they want, how they feel and how it should be done. We need to hear more and empower the affected. Social empowerment must start at the village level and not by allocating budgets to top-down projects done by ministries, departments and to projects carried out by well-connected national organizations. We must encourage social cohesion, mechanisms for people at the grass-roots level to express their views and be heard.

Currently there is a "free for all environment" in the North and the East. Interventions are developed at various individual offices and most of these are top-down driven that end up being handouts socially disempowering and encouraging dependency.

We want the Government, in the first instance, to define and publish the effects on the people in the war-affected areas to help develop a framework that could form as a baseline for diverse actors to provide solutions. That will be social empowerment.

On psycho-social issues and collective trauma, the Senior Professor of Psychiatry in the Northern Province, Daya Somasundaram, states that understanding the destruction of social capital by long-term civil conflict is crucial for describing collective trauma. He further states that the University of Jaffna Community Medicine Research study of medical faculty students from Vanni found that in 2010, 82 per cent had been directly exposed to the war situation, 67 per cent had barely escaped death,

63 per cent had lost family or friend, 43 per cent had witnessed killing, 27 per cent had been imprisoned, 23 per cent kidnapped or abducted, and 18 per cent had been tortured or beaten. This is the very sample of the tragedy that Vanni people underwent during the war and immediately after the war. Such collective trauma will have enormous impact on the societys capacity to participate in productive ventures and particularly, a tailored approach is needed to remedy this situation.

This crucial information that must be at the core of interventions and solutions in the North and the East is however conveniently ignored and allowed to fester. The symptoms of such collective trauma express itself over time in social discontent and destructive behaviours and we act totally surprised. Social empowerment is, people having a voice and their voices being heard and actions being taken. Views of the people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces must be heard but for that we do not even have forums or capacity to create institutions to express such views.

Social empowerment needs to be at the core for any kind of reconciliation, development or prosperity of our country and we value this opportunity to start addressing these problems and we will provide all the support to find answers collectively. We are currently being inundated with a lot of good proposals for social advancements announced by the Government. Sir, the following was outlined in the Budget for 2017 by the Hon. Minister, Ravi Karunanayake. I quote:

Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion forms the broader theme of the 2017, National Budget.

We will continue to progress in the noble endeavor to strengthen democracy, fundamental rights, reconciliation and development for lasting peace, freedom and national integration. Fundamentally, the country is guided by a new vision of lasting peace, built on mutual respect and dialogue. To cement this process, we have formulated an ambitious reforms agenda encompassing all major spheres including social, political, and economic and international relations.

I wish to lay emphasis on the fact that the government is committed to eliminate existing socio-economic gap between North and East with the rest of the country by 2020.

Sri Lanka does not have a good track record in following up and fulfilling the promises made to the minorities in the past and we do not want these to end up in that list. On our part we will engage in, support and guide any actions of the Government that genuinely attempts social and economic advancement of the war-affected people to get back on their feet.

We hope that the Government will embrace this opportunity to take firm and fruitful steps in the direction of reconciliation with commitment and diligence. The complex challenges of the post-war recovery and bridging the gap of social and economic empowerment by 2020 will not happen on its own; it requires a road map and an action plan. Otherwise, these will become another lofty words to mesmerize the international community.

Our livelihood, education, health, culture, properties, social well-being, infrastructure, knowledge base, places

1795 1796

of worship, social norms, economic capacities, community resilience and fragmentation and disempowerment of communities are what we suffered over the past 30 years due to war.

However, such deterioration started well before that 30 years due to systematic, orchestrated and State-sponsored social disempowerments of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. We need data, systems, framework, mechanism and institutions and the recognition that the war-affected provinces and communities have problems that are distinctively different to the other provinces. There must be flexible policy setting and structural empowerment to achieve social empowerment. Continuing the same State structure that was the underlying cause of the problem of the past several decades and expect the answers to be different is not a sensible move.

Sir, now we are talking of social empowerment. Here I want to point out a very serious discrimination which was created by the Government against the women in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. I will not say it is sponsored by the forces. I will tell you the whole story. Please understand this and find a solution, if you want to give equal status to the women or anyone in the country.

Education is a fundamental human right, which is essential for the exercise of all other human rights and it promotes individual freedom and empowerment. The United Nations has laid down international legal obligations for the right to education and promote the right of every person to enjoy access to education of good quality, without discrimination or exclusion. It is the Governments responsibility to provide education of good quality and to implement effective education strategies which are also needed for the social empowerment.

I want to say that under the present President, we helped to elect this Government. And now under this Government which claims good governance, security forces are asked to teach in preschools and run our preschools.

Preschool teachers' salary has been fixed as Rs. 3,000 by the Eastern Provincial Council and as Rs. 4,000 by the Northern Provincial Council. The security forces are paying Rs. 30,000 to their preschool teachers in the Vanni area and they have nearly 550 preschool teachers who wear the uniform specified by the army and they are punished Rs. 50 per day if they fail to wear them.

Nowhere in the world security services conduct preschools; nowhere in the world army cadres teach in preschools and nowhere in the world the preschool students and teachers are asked to wear uniforms provided by the Army.

What are the other Provinces that these things are happening in Sri Lanka? No Sri Lankan could be proud of these actions which is happening today. Just think of a

child whose parents have experienced some of the evilest war experience being asked to wear an Army-provided uniform and confronts Army Intelligence Officers. The most disturbing part is the preschool students themselves are asked to wear uniforms provided by the Army that has printed the letters CSD prominently. This clearly expresses the attitude and the mentality of such decision-makers and their respect for the minority community in Sri Lanka.

The people of the Vanni have suffered multiple displacements and continuous run for life which made them split and scatter, and this resulted in scattered communities. Strategies are still used by the security forces to deliberately destroy our society and to control us. This is an extension of war and this is continuing.

Education must be carried out exclusively by educational authorities and educational institutions, not by any other, and certainly, not by the Army; especially, to preschoolers. Because of such action the International norms are violated, human rights are violated and this is a disgrace for the hurt and sufferings of our war-affected communities. Year 2017 has been declared as Year of Social Inclusion by Sri Lanka. Let us not make that just another lofty set of words. Is there any limit to such so called civil society defence actions? What will this do to the rest of the preschool teachers? What will this do to the students? What will this do to our communities?

We have well-qualified preschool teachers who are prepared to work, and for whom the civil authorities are paying. So, why do we need army teachers?

Budget has been allocating money annually to carry out such projects and the Government cannot plead for ignorance. We have to assume that the Government is fully condoning such activities and actions, and they do not speak for the measures for reconciliation and peace. I think everyone should understand that this is total discrimination, and apart from that how can the forces get involved in civil activities. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) , 2 . , 5 . .
