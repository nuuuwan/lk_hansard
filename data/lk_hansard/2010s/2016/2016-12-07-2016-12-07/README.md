Senathirajah) , . , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Hon. Minister of Power and Renewable Energy and also the Deputy Minister. You visited Jaffna two months back and announced about the free supply of electricity to the re-settlers. After the war, they are now in settlements. The Government has taken steps to supply electricity at a lower price to the farmers. Thank you very much again for that.

Now, I take this opportunity to express my condolences on behalf of the ITAK and the TNA on the passing away of Mr. Adaikalam Amirthanathan of Vidathaltheevu, Mannar and father of the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan, the Deputy Chairman of Committees. The cremation will take place today. We join to condole with the family of late Mr.Amirthanathan.

Mr. Adaikalam Amirthanathan was an ayurvedic medical practitioner. He was a very good supporter of our Party, the ITAK and the TNA. He also supported his son, the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan, the Leader of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization. He involved himself in the agitations and political activities of the Tamil cause and supported the liberation struggle of the Tamil people for a political resolution.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) I also would like to join you to condole with the family of the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan on the demise of their father.

The next speaker is, the Hon. Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera. [.. 11.37] . ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera - Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy) , . , . . , , . , .

[3.06p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Presiding Member, the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade was established to implement new global economic strategy for Sri Lanka, which requires a decisive shift from inward-oriented economic policies to outward-oriented economic policies, moving away from trade protectionism and interference in FDI Regulations that prevailed in the country for a long time.

The non-favourable domestic business climate and ineffective regulations prevailing in the country discouraged foreign investors and traders to effectively contribute to the growth of the country, providing more space to gain peace dividends as anticipated. Sir, although the country's unemployment problem was highly comparative, there was a significant level of underemployment and youth unemployment. Around 60 per cent of the labour force is accounted for informal sector workers and our Government had to fulfil the obligation to provide them with sustainable and productive jobs with higher wages.

Hon. Presiding Member, a clear mandate was given to our Government to address fundamental and structural issues through a concerted and focused approach, implementing crucial reforms that would result in a better life for the majority of our people.

The Government is framing outward-looking trade and investment policies which aim to revitalize Sri Lanka's export competitiveness and integrate the country more closely with the region and the rest of the world. We are also in the process of implementing a series of reforms to uplift the country's trade and investment performance. The Government has taken a number of positive measures to improve investor confidence, strengthen the business environment and improve the ease of doing business index and make Sri Lanka an attractive destination for FDI. Of course, the year 2016 has been a transforming year for Sri Lanka due to an array of reasons and the challenges faced by the country due to the global economic situation.

In the midst of these, attracting the right investments and investment facilitation is challenging. The much-needed structural changes had to be made to fast-track investment. The BOI approval process is being re-structured to make sure to grant approval within 14 days through the establishment of an Investment Single-window Committee and to facilitate obtaining various approvals and an Investment Approval Facilitation Committee has been established. All the unresolved issues will be addressed speedily through the Cabinet Economic Committee on Economic Management.

Then, I would like to bring to the notice of the House an interesting book that has been published by Shivshankar Menon, the former Foreign Secretary of India. - [Interruption.] Please, listen. It reveals enough about the LTTE and their activities. On one occasion, at the tail end, he says, the Tamil leaders in India, all of them, wanted the Sri Lankan Government to defeat the LTTE. So, this was the consensus of even the Indian leaders and the Indian political parties. He also says how India fully supported the Sri Lankan Army and other forces to defeat the LTTE, because it was an impossible force led by Prabhakaran. I do not want to read the name that he uses here to describe Prabhakaran.

, ? . . In page 143 of his book titled "Choices", Mr. Menon writes, I quote:

.by 2009 the murder of Rajiv Gandhi had made a more realistic Indian policy possible. While other states had the luxury of urging diplomacy and first principles of good conduct, in this case, India did not.

. former Foreign Secretary , , . ? -[ ] Please, let me speak. You have time to speak, so, speak during your time. Even my time has been robbed today. So, please allow me to speak. - [Interruption.] Yes. .

? . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights openly appealed to the American voters not to vote for Trump. This is the so-called "independent, impartial High Commissioner for Human Rights". He is partial. It is very clear that he is partial because he wanted to participate in the American Presidential Election. A UN officer is not supposed to open his mouth. That is the UN policy. This is the officer who advocated, promoted and made all the statements against our armed forces. This is the reality. Our armed forces can be protected only by disengaging ourselves from this betrayal that has happened in Geneva. We, the Opposition, will canvass continuously to condemned the betrayal that happened in Geneva. We will canvass against it, as I stated. With all the facts in this book - I hope they read it.

, OMP Bill . OMP Bill . , OMP Bill . .

This is what Stephen J. Rapp, former US Ambassador on War Crimes says on the OMP Bill. I quote "Daily FT" of 23rd November, 2016:

"Rapp hailed a decision by the Sri Lankan Government to remove a 'firewall' of information initially contained in the draft legislation of the Office of Missing Persons that would have prevented information gathered during the search for the disappeared being used for prosecutions in the future.

'Removing that blockade was important because it is from truth-seeking that justice processes begin. The clamour for criminal justice springs from a truth-seeking process. It's important for Sri lanka to move from truth-seeking to delivering justice.' Ambassador Rapp told DailyFT"

What he says is that all the evidence that will be given before OMP can be used internationally. - [Interruption.] Yes, that could be used internationally. This is the danger that we have got caught in by forcing the Bill without the consent of the Members of Parliament. I would like to make an appeal to the Hon. President to make the changes in the OMP Bill, so that our security forces would be protected. In addition, I would also like to make an open appeal to the President. You have the right to pardon all our officers who were involved and who were serving in the war. Please pardon all our officers who were serving in the war. That has been done by all the Heads of States all over the world. We hope that His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena also will pardon all, starting from the soldier right up. Some soldiers have lost their lives; some have been disabled. So these soldiers should be protected.

Now, I come to another point before I conclude. The website of Sri Lanka Guardian of 19th November, 2016 states, I quote:

.According to the paper, the State Departments total assets equaled $ 93.8 billion

It further states, I quote:

Of this amount, $ 585 million was spent by the State Department under the article Democracy, human rights and governance - $ 70 million down on the 2015 figure.

The report didnt specify the projects funded by the agency abroad, but Secretary of State John Kerry wrote in the preface that we have supported important democratic gains in Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Burma.

What have you all done with this fund? This is the biggest question that has not been answered. Millions of US Dollars were pumped into, perhaps, to topple the Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa who defeated the LTTE. This is the truth that has been placed before the US Senate. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . . ", " . -

A Commission has been appointed. What has happened to the Commission? The report has not been published. The report has not been placed before Parliament. Whom are you trying to mislead? The value of property that was damaged in the army camp is still unknown. I would like to ask the Government whether you would place - as promised by the Hon. Prime Minister - this report before Parliament, at least today.

That is why India is worried about our maritime lanes.

, , . . [4.45p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all I must say that I did not understand the reason why the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena made such a speech. We all are asked to go forward with positive thinking in order to bring the country back to the normal situation. But, unfortunately, the speeches made by the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila and the Hon. Dinesh Gunawradena show that it will take many more years to bring in reconciliation. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Member, he talks so only inside, not outside. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I never expected that he would come out with such a remark.

Sir, the allocation made for the Ministry of Defence shows no sign of acknowledgment of the end of the war or intention for peace and reconciliation. The amount of expenditure is not too far below that of the peak of the war period and it does not convey the message of peace and reconciliation as envisaged.

Social inclusion is the catchword this year and some of the actions taken by the Ministry of Defence do not, in any way, indicate that. The armed forces are engaged in commercial activities such as, operating hotels, engaging in construction work. Unilateral and forceful decisions to take over strategic economic assets of the Provinces are being justified as in the interest of national security and vesting such assets with the armed forces is certainly not social inclusion.

The Trincomalee District Development Programme, Siri Sara Pivisuma initiated by His Excellency the President involving the Tri Forces, Civil Defence Force and other stakeholders directly deny participation of local community in any economic or social activities in their own areas.

Active measures taken to colonize the Northern and the Eastern Provinces whilst a new Constitution is being

3327 3328

drafted also do not speak well of any goodwill or any sincere commitment for peace and reconciliation.

Now, I would like to read out an extract of a post in the website, www.jdslanka.org by Indika Gamage on 23rd March, 2016.

Military families are settled in newly constructed villages in Tamil speaking areas in the North.

The State plans to establish a village named, Sanhindiyawe Sathvirugama (Sathvirugama village of reconciliation). The military and the Mahaweli Authority are spearheading moves to change the demography of the region. Already, over four thousand families from outside have been settled in the North.

Ministry of Defence, on Wednesday unveiled plans to hand over 51 houses built in Kokeliya village in the Vavuniya District to military families on the 3rd of April.

Secretary Defence, Karunasena Hettiarachchi told journalists in Colombo that the project would help heal the wounded hearts of Tamil populace to some extent.

However, according to what the Sri Lanka Army Sinhala website has stated, this village will be dedicated to military families. It further states, "The new housing project was initiated at the beginning of last year to express gratitude towards war heroes and heroic families of those killed in the war." The report reveals that the families of soldiers belonging to twenty one regiments and units will be benefited from the project.

Meanwhile, the State-owned Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in its Sinhala website has also confirmed this report, stating that the project cost will be covered by the Api Wenuwen Api housing fund. According to its official website, this Fund is in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to build 50,000 houses for the serving Tri Service personnel.

A Sri Lankan environment watchdog had earlier released photographic evidence of the military and Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka clearing 16,500 acres of forest land in the North and East to establish settlements.

In Vavunia alone, the Army, Civil Defence Force and the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka had cleared 5,000 acres of forest land, said the Environment Conservation Trust -ECT- last November. Meanwhile, the Minister in charge of resettlement says that 11,000 internally displaced people in the North are yet to be resettled.

If you want to heal the hearts of the Tamil populace you must stop teaching in our preschools and operating our preschools. Preschool teachers salary has been fixed as Rs. 3,000 by the Eastern Provincial Council and as Rs. 4,000 by the Northern Provincial Council. The security forces are paying Rs. 30,000 to their preschool teachers in

Vanni area and they have nearly 550 preschool teachers who wear uniforms specified by the army and fine Rs. 50 per day if they fail to wear them. Nowhere in the world security services personnel conduct preschools; nowhere in the world army cadres teach at preschools; nowhere in the world preschool students and teachers are asked to wear uniforms provided by the army.

This is certainly not a measure to carry out reconciliation. Education is a fundamental human right and it is essential for the exercise of all other human rights to promote individual freedom and empowerment. So, education is certainly not one for the military to carry out on the war-affected minorities. The most disturbing part is, the preschool students are asked to wear uniforms provided by the army that has printed the letters CSD prominently.

We, the Representatives of the people, are saying that you are causing more harm than good. Please allow the national plan for peace and reconciliation to function properly, and not one that is carried out by the Ministry of Defence.

There are so many new ways adopted for the so-called army-initiated reconciliations carried out by indulging in all forms of social lives of the war-affected people by positioning themselves in the very core of the society as a serving defence personnel. This is a way of social dominance, with a well-developed plan, to marginalize and disempower the minority, socially and ensure their gracefulness are felt always.

When the peace, justice, equality, social inclusion and reconciliation are supposed to be the dominant slogans of the political leaders, the website of the Civil Military Coordination in Jaffna outlines the following as their services:

1. Reconstruction of houses for exodus Tamil people.

2. Fostering programmes for orphan children and displaced children.

3. Integration of cultural, religious and spiritual activities.

4. Development of sports in Jaffna Peninsula by organizing coaching camps, sport festivals with the support of multinational organizations and sports exchange programmes.

5. Educational assistance for children.

6. Strengthening Public Library - Jaffna.

7. Humanitarian demining/mine awareness programme

These are the sociocultural services provided on the minority who have been devastated by the military war. Then, it says, on economic sector too.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to know what the Government policy is on all these? In the absence of a clearly articulated policy of the Government, it is free for

all. We find that explanations are given to various target audience to suit the situation and there is no scrutiny for any of the activities of the defence forces. If we are serious about reconciliation, then we want to know what the policies are, and if the elected representatives of the people will have any say in such intrusions into our social, cultural and economic lives of our people.

We are really committed to reconciliation. But, unfortunately, a little while ago, I listened to the speech made by the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila and I was surprised. I think he is an educated person. While I was listening to him, I felt that we should have at least 10 Gammanpilas. Then, the work will be easier for us. The work will be easier for the international community to understand their ideas and intentions as to how they are going to treat the minority Tamil-speaking people. So, I take this opportunity to appreciate what the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila has said.

The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella is also here. He said that the TNA is trying to achieve through paper what was demanded by the LTTE. You can imagine that the LTTE is an armed organization and they had some demands, and now that subject is over. It is good that they repeatedly speak about the LTTE and remind us. Sometimes, we may forget. So, it is good and we need people like them. They are helping us. How can you say a paper work belongs to any undemocratic achievement? You can think so, if it is with arms.

Sir, I have to bring to the notice of the House an incident that took place in Batticaloa this morning. The police are very friendly with Viharadhipathi Ampitiye Sumanarathana Thero. So, they have gone and made a false complaint before the courts. I think, they wanted to make a complaint against our Parliamentarian, the Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran. The complaint made was that they were going to stage some protest disturbing the present peaceful situation there. But it is a false complaint, because the Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran was here. He had gone for a funeral and there were no such incident. There were no such plans. Why should the police get involved in making a false complaint like this? I want the Hon. Minister of Law and Order to take notice of this. The police should be impartial. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please, wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, please give me one more minute. Here, they are talking of the police powers which is a subject under devolution. But, what I understand is, they are not worried about not devolving powers to the Northern Province. They are worried about the other Provinces because -

[5.44 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Mr. Chairman, I am honoured to be given the opportunity to speak a few words at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence.

As you know, there is a very close nexus between the subjects of defence and international relations. During the previous regime, we distanced ourselves from the international community and that resulted in many issues internally and externally. His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, consequent to assuming the office, has externally and internally united Sri Lanka.

With regard to disabled soldiers, certain quarters tried to instigate demonstrations. The request, with regard to benefits for disabled soldiers, was made in 2008. There was a rule that unless you serve twelve years you cannot get your pension and that you can get only 65 to 85 per cent of your salary as pension. His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena has always looked into the welfare of the soldiers because we are obliged to do justice by them. Therefore, His Excellency the President has taken steps to give 100 per cent of their salary as pension consequent to reaching 55 years of age.

The ones who instigated this protest have forgotten that the request was made in 2008. They are suffering from amnesia. So, it is high time that we remind those who suffer from amnesia that though they instigated this, the request was made in 2008 and a Cabinet Paper was put in 2014, but that Cabinet Paper also was not followed. So, we have to thank His Excellency the President with regard to the decision made -[Interruption.] No, it was -[Interruption.] I did not disturb you. The soldiers were not given their full pension after 55 years of age, until President Maithripala Sirisena took a decision. And also, they have to serve 12 years to get that pension. That decision was changed for the welfare of the soldiers. Some of you all thought it fit to instigate demonstration. But, unfortunately you all forgot to realize that the request was made in 2008 - [Interruption.] You are pointing a finger at me - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, you go ahead. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Chairman, therefore, this Government, with regard to the welfare of the soldiers - [Interruption.] Yes, including me. We have rectified what you have not done during the previous regime. So, we must be thankful to His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena for what has been done for the soldiers of this country. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Dilum Amunugama. . [.. 5.49] ( ) (The Hon. Dilum Amunugama) , . .
