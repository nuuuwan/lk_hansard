"That the Bill be now read a Second time".- [The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake]

Question again proposed.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. M.A Sumanthiran to open the Debate from the Opposition, on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill, 2017.

[10.43] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to open the Debate on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill, 2017.

The Hon. Minister of Finance, in a very long speech, which is becoming customary for him, detailed various measures over three hours and yet, could not read all of those that were printed in his speech. Various detailed measures were spelt out under a Budget that is titled, Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion.

One has to study the Budget Proposals and compare it with the title that is given to it - it is a good title - envisages growth, not just envisages growth but wants to accelerate growth and does not want to leave anyone behind in that growth; wants social inclusion.

However, I am rather sad, as we begin the Debate on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill, 2017, to say that in the detailed Proposals that were made yesterday and the Budget Estimates printed and given to us, there does not seem to be an indicator towards accelerating growth, not just accelerating growth, there is no indicator towards growth. And, certainly, if these Proposals are the way forward for the Government, then, I am afraid, this will increase inequalities and social exclusion rather than achieving social inclusion.

649 650

The reasons why I say this are many. First and foremost, I want to highlight the fact that after several years, the figure for expenditure for 2017 is lower than the figure for expenditure for 2016. This has happened in recent times, only in 2002 when there was a serious hit on the economy following the bombing of the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake and we have come to a position similar to that and the decrease this time is even more. We all know that the Recurrent Expenditure has to be reserved, it is difficult to do away with that. All of that has to be spent. So, when you reduce expenditure, it is on Capital Expenditure that the reduction is made and that is very sad because when the Hon. Minister of Finance says that this Budget is for accelerated growth, how do you achieve growth by cutting down on Capital Expenditure, reducing Capital Expenditure? I drew a graph to see and it really shocked me to find that it actually will result in a negative growth.

The reasons maybe many. One of which is the fact that the revenue collection is not efficient, and in this context, I want to highlight something that the Hon. Minister said last year when he made his Budget Proposals. He made a very good suggestion, which was welcome by most of us, and that is to decentralize the revenue collection and he even mentioned that that task would be handed over to the Divisional Secretaries. We know the Divisional Secretaries who were previously called Assistant Government Agents - before that they were actually titled as District Revenue Officers - are the ones who actually have all the information. Particularly, after President Premadasas Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act sometimes the Divisional Secretaries are more powerful than even the District Secretaries, and in terms of information, in terms of data that they have with regard to every household, every small business venture, every economic activity in the division, you cannot rival that. So, we welcome that suggestion that you decentralize the revenue collection to the Divisional Secretary level, so that the revenue collection will be made drastically more efficient than what it is today. Unfortunately, that important proposal made last year has not been implemented. Not only has it not been implemented but there is not a word about that in this years Budget Proposals. That seems to have been totally abandoned because when the Minister talks about revenue collection now, he has changed direction and he is talking about greater capacity of the officers of the Inland Revenue Department and so on. There may have been some resistance from the revenue collection agencies, particularly from the officers of the Inland Revenue Department, but that is no reason why that forward-looking proposal should have been abandoned. If we actually broad-base our revenue collection and bring into the net more people, that is the only sure way of ensuring that we have adequate resources to employ towards growth, to employ towards proper expenditure and with the monies that we collect from within the country rather than resorting to foreign borrowings, which is again naturally has to remain a high figure - the foreign debt service is a very high figure - and we need to meet that. If we have borrowed money, we have to repay, and

if our countrys credit rating or repayment history has to remain intact, then that has to be given priority. But, that will result in money not being available for utilization in various capital ventures in areas that will actually empower our people and resurrect our economy to move forward. That is a sad deviation this time of having dropped that idea of decentralizing revenue collections.

Several proposals for privatizing State-owned enterprises is again alarming, because it might bring in immediately some capital. In the short-term, as you privatize a State entity, you will recover, you will gain some relief. But in the long-term, that will have a very negative impact on our economy. Also, we cannot forget how the State-owned enterprises had been privatized in the past. It is a record that we cannot be proud of. There can be several examples given: Waters Edge, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, Lanka Marine Services - but the last two were reversed to some extent because of corruption. Several entities were sold for a song and that keeps happening. The moment a particular State-owned enterprise is to be privatized, there is severe corruption and whichever Government has been in office, has not been able to deal with that. So, we lose assets of the people worth billions to private entities, private personalities, and sometimes to companies that are registered abroad to recover some monies, but in the overall analysis it becomes a huge loss. So, the accent of the Government in trying to gain some money by privatizing State-owned enterprises, I say with respect, is going in the wrong direction. For efficiency and for greater productivity, to deal with lethargy and so on, you must look for other remedies - not selling off State assets in this way.

Then there is focus on exports, the Hon. Minister said. But there is a world trend that has to be taken note of. The World Trade Organization data clearly shows us that there is a drop in global trade. There is a demand to export which is greater in the world market, which means the moment we liberalize the accounts, it is imports that will increase and not our exports. So, liberalizing trade accounts will only lead to a flood of imports and that will have an opposite effect to what we have desired which means that we will be paying out our foreign currency and not gaining foreign currency. So, this is something I think, the Government needs to take into account - the present trend in world trade and the impact that will have the moment we liberalize trade accounts. This may not be the right time to do it. I am not saying that you should not liberalize trade, but the world trend needs to be looked at very carefully before embarking on measures such as that.

There is also the issue of allocations. The Hon. Minister himself conceded that allocation for education is lower than last year and several other sectors which ought to have had more allocation have decreased. There was so much said about small and medium enterprises. But, if you look at the figures, priority has been given to large trade organizations attracting foreign investment giving them tax holidays, et cetera rather than actually empowering small and medium enterprises within the country to revitalize their economy and start moving.

651 652

[ . . ]

2016 11

One may create 200 - 300 jobs by attracting a large enterprise. But, if you can empower 200 - 300 small or medium enterprises, that will result in ten times more jobs and also self-sufficiency and will deal in some ways with regard to the problem that we have on foreign debt servicing.

I will now deal with the issue of indirect taxes and direct taxes. The ratio of indirect taxes to direct taxes has been increasing. It is acknowledged now the ratio of indirect taxes to direct taxes is 80:20. That obviously then means that the poor is being taxed. Indirect taxes affect everybody across the board. The Hon. Prime Minister, in his economic statement, said that the target is to make it 60:40, which was echoed by the Hon. Minister of Finance yesterday. That is a good target to work towards. But unfortunately, there is nothing in this Budget that gives the indication that direct taxes will increase and indirect taxes will decrease. There is nothing worked into the Budget Proposals that show that you can achieve that target, which is a significant milestone, if you can do that making 80:20 to 60:40. But, there is nothing at all in the Proposals to achieve that target.

Broad-basing the tax payers is a way to go. Also, in the context of what the Hon. Minister said yesterday with regard to digitized economy, in an e-environment, it becomes easier to actually bring into the tax net more people several times more than we have today and in that context you can reduce the tax liability and yet earn much more through direct taxes. The inequality that prevails in any society will prevail, it will be the task of any government, particularly, when they address the economy of the country to take steps to reduce the gap between the poor and the rich. So, that is why I said - if the Hon. Minister said, this is a Budget for accelerated growth with social inclusion - a Budget that actually does not address the issue of inequality, does not have clear-cut concrete proposals to increase the ratio of direct taxes to that of indirect taxes, cannot achieve that target of reducing social inequalities. If that is not reduced, then, you do not achieve social inclusion, you achieve the opposite - you achieve social exclusion which then will result in various other issues and various other manifestations. This country has gone through several of those and we cannot afford another upheaval on the grounds of social exclusion. Handling the economy of the country is a vital issue in ensuring that the citizenry live contented lives. They may struggle to make ends meet. But, if they know that this struggle is shared with all the people of the country and that there are no exclusive few who have it easy all the time, then, they will make an honest effort and it will not lead to social exclusion. But unfortunately, overall when you look at the Proposals that have been made, it will inevitably lead to social exclusion and that is something, as the Opposition, we are duty-bound to warn the Government.

There are no concrete Proposals for creating employment or boosting local production, rural economy or industries. Sectors such as agriculture and fisheries have received some allocations but not sufficient. The amounts are so low that they do not propose any major plans for development of the sectors of agriculture and fisheries.

The priorities lie elsewhere. Just to highlight some of those: digitizing the economy gets Rs.15 billion; the EXIM Bank gets Rs.10 billion; Free Trade Zones get Rs. 1 billion, export and marketing campaigns for FDI get Rs.1 billion and as opposed to that, agriculture sector gets Rs.450 million. So, the accent is elsewhere; the priorities are elsewhere. It is not towards empowering the rural poor to develop themselves. The Hon. Minister said that ours is an agriculture-based economy but the figures do not bear that out, the figures do not support his claim.

Allocation for education, as I said earlier, reflects again the Government's inclination to privatize education. Loan schemes for students to enter non-State universities is an example of that. I am not opposed to privatizing education, but I am raising the issue of policy. Is there a definite policy shift? It seems so from the figures of the Budget Proposals. Has the matter been discussed at policy level before monies are allocated to follow policy rather than allocation of monies determining our policy?

I will now turn to the allocation for the North and the East, which again is wholly insufficient for this year. Last year, there was an allocation of Rs.14 billion given to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and there was an apology at that time saying, "We know that this is inadequate but we will have a donor conference in 2016 at which we will invite countries to come in and boost the economy of the war-ravaged areas." That was never done. No donor conference was held. So this year we were left with a small allocation and then came the proposal by the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs for building 65,000 houses in the North. We opposed that proposal not because we did not want houses. Our people want houses and the housing needs in the North and the East were 137,000 houses. So, 65,000 houses were significant - almost half - of the entire housing needs. We opposed it for the reason that those houses were prefabricated metal houses. Two model houses have been built. I, myself have visited those houses personally. Several experts have gone there and looked at those houses and three engineers from the University of Moratuwa visited and gave a report. Each of those houses was going to cost Rs. 2.1 million. When houses had been built in the North and East through the Indian Housing Project, the maximum cost was Rs. 700,000 a house. So, when you could build a brick and mortar house for Rs. 700,000, why do you want to spend Rs.2.1 million for a prefabricated house? At the same time, the Hon. Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs was pushing this proposal for building 65,000 houses. Each house was to cost three times more than a brick and mortar house which would have lasted three, four generations. When you lean on those model houses, they move; they shake. There is no proper foundation for it.

( ( - ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe - State Minister of International Trade) Can we have a copy of that document?

653 654

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, I am going to table that document today.

As a Party that represents broadly the people in the North and the East, we objected to this and we said, Our people want houses. We did not want anyone to misunderstand this. Therefore, we worked constructively on this; we worked with a group of civil society- people, who expended a lot of energy and time - and brought in five local banks, which made a detailed concept for an alternative proposal for building 65,000 houses in the North and the East. Now I have it here with me and I would like to table that document.

In this proposal, they estimate the cost of a house for Rs. 800,000 and if other facilities like community halls, parks and other common facilities are to be provided in those villages, the cost of each housing unit would be Rs. 999,905, which is about Rs. 1 million. So, for less than half the cost of what the Hon. Minister had proposed, we did make - I am not saying we did it; we facilitated and others did it - a counter proposal funded by local banks. We did not even have to expend foreign currency for it. It was funded by local banks which would have cost the Government almost only half of what it would cost. - [Interruption.] It is the same amount and details are here in the proposal. So, I do not want to take more time on that.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Can you table that document? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I now table* this document and I can give you a copy as well, Hon. Minister.

For the same amount of money that the Government was willing to put down for 65,000 houses, this proposal said 102,000 houses can be built. Now, I am saying this for a particular reason. With regard to housing, the Hon. Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech, said yesterday that 50,000 houses are going to be constructed and to expedite the construction of 50,000 houses in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, Rs. 5 billion has been allocated. If it is Rs. 5 billion for 50,000 houses, it works out to Rs. 1 million per house. This is a proposal that will meet with that - Rs. 1 million per house. So, I would urge the Government to please take note of this.

The Hon. Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs has been doing something else. He has been calling up our Members of Parliament from the North and the East and asking them,

Do you want houses; how many houses do you want? We all want houses. But we do not want those prefabricated houses, for which you can fix wheels and drag it around; on which somebody is making a killing. It does not even have a proper foundation. You cannot give it to your children. I mean, our people have been displaced time and again, but, you do not have to give them houses that can be displaced like this. We want a Veedu, not a Koodu. We do not want those steal cages. This is not something that we are blocking. When people have made proposals to do that for half the cost, why is it that the Hon. Minister is intent on implementing that questionable proposal of his? None of our Members have asked for those houses. The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan is here. He has been given a letter asking for houses. But, he does not say that he wants those houses. We do not want prefabricated houses. We want brick and mortar house - that will be permanent houses -that we can give to our children and our grandchildren and that will stand the test of time.

These people who have made this proposal have made a public statement dated 20th October, 2016, captioned, A Statement on the 65,000 Houses Project in the North and East. Ten persons have signed this document. They have published it saying, We have made this, we have forwarded it, but we do not have a response from the Government to date. When the Hon. Minister of Finance made the Proposal yesterday saying, 50,000 houses for Rs. 5 billion, - it is Rs. 1 million per house - and I take it that it is this proposal that he referred to and not the prefabricated housing project that is being promoted by the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs.

I also table* the statement made by the members of the civil society, dated 20th October, 2016.

Apart from that, there is an allocation of Rs. 180 million, which is grossly inadequate. It says that it is for reconciliation work. It does not outline what it is. I met the Minister of Finance and made certain proposals with regard to the North and the East; with regard to sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry, because those three together would account for about 85 per cent of our peoples livelihood and urged him to make specific allocations. After the devastation of the war, people have to get back on their feet. Housing is one thing. But livelihood is as important. I made detailed proposals to the Hon. Minister and I am sad that none of that has been included or considered in these Proposals.

There is a proposal to construct a vertical building for mixed development which will include office space, recreational facilities and entertainment facilities and an allocation of Rs. 1 billion has been made for this. I wonder why he says, "a vertical building" as opposed to a

horizontal building. Who wants a vertical building for all of these? Why does he allocate Rs. 1 billion for one building? He says, Construct a vertical building for Rs.1 billion in the North. We did not ask for it; our people have not asked for it. They want to get back on their feet; they want to do their farming, fishing and their animal husbandry and get on with their lives. Give them something to boost their economy without putting up vertical buildings for Rs. 1 billion. Rs. 1 billion for one building. Who asked for this? Why does the Hon. Minister of Finance not consult the Representatives of the people from those areas? - [Interruption.] Yes, obviously it is not for the people. He must consult us. I even visited him and gave him some of the priorities. I can understand the difficulty in making the allocations that we want, but, at least, you can consider some of those. Surely, we represent the people; we will prioritize what our people want. If the Government is serious about actually rebuilding the areas that were ravaged by the war, then you must address some of these priorities we have pointed out. The previous Government was wrong in concentrating so much on infrastructure development alone. Not that that is not important; that is important and this Government is also continuing with that, which is welcome. But, that alone will not rebuild the lives of the people. So, I urge the Government to move away from all of these fancy ideas of putting up towers that is not useful for the people living there, but obviously for some others and to consult with us and make allocations that will be meaningful so that our people can actually benefit by it.

There are some other allocations for integrated township development in Samanthurai and Kalmunai amounting to Rs. 200 million. We need to see what those are and how that is going to be implemented. We have a particular situation with regard to the Kalmunai Town, something sensitive that needs to be resolved. If money is being allocated for township development in Kalmunai, we will have to look at that very carefully so that the two communities which live side by side in that important town do not come into any kind of confrontation, that both are consulted properly. So, merely allocating money is not sufficient.

Then, there is Rs. 1 billion for upgrading infrastructure facility in Trincomalee. I will leave it to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to deal with development of Trincomalee. We are not against development, but in the guise of development, there are certain activities that are now taking place and this maybe the appropriate time to sound the first warning bell to the Government. What happened through irrigation schemes in the past seems to be happening through developmental projects now and this is not good; this is not good at all, if the Government is serious about reconciliation. Some of the root causes for alienation of our people from national life were due to such projects. If this Government is also proceeding in those lines or being unmindful of serious impact this can cause to relations between communities, then it is our duty to bring it to your notice, and we hope you will take that into account seriously.

Thank you very much.
