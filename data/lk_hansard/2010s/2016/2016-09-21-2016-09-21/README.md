asked the Minister of Home Affairs: (a) A housing project funded by a non-governmental

organization in Saudi Arabia for the Tsunami affected people in the Ampara District constructed at the Norochcholai village in Akkaraipattu was suspended on a Court Order bearing Number 178/2008 delivered by the Supreme Court prior to houses being distributed amongst beneficiaries and though more than six years have lapsed since the delivery of the above judgment on 02.12.2009, the houses have not been distributed in accordance with the said court order resulting in the entire property becoming uninhabitable and therefore will he inform this House whether he instructs the Ampara District Secretary/Akkarapattu Divisional Secretary to act in accordance with the said court order?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, the Committee on Public Finance considered this yesterday. We made one observation. Some of the commissions have slightly different functions. I appreciate that with regard to the Election Commission; from the date of the declaration, you have made a specific proposal. But, with regard to a commission like the Human Rights Commission, they might need to travel much more than the other commission members. So, would the Government consider slightly different formula for travel allowance and so on?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We could do that, but I think we will have to pass this and bring in some amendments. We can certainly go into the matter. We can ask the Hon. Speaker to take up whatever that has been decided. Thereafter, we can make suitable amendments for those commissions.

As the President of the Republic, she had signed a Deed of Grant for 8 acres of land within the Port of Colombo and sold for Rs.1,200 million to Lanka Marine Services Limited after it had been taken over by John Keells Holdings Limited. It is stated on the Deed under her signature - I have a photocopy of it - that this money has been received by the Treasury. Receipt of this Rs.1,200 million has been denied by the Treasury in the course of investigations by the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises. Here, too, the Supreme Court had directed the respondent, Chairman of the Bribery Commission, to conduct investigations and prosecutions. The Bribery Commission had subsequently reported to the Supreme Court that they are proceeding with the investigations. They filed the Interim Report with the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court trusted that the proceedings would continue. But, up to date we have heard nothing.

While debating on the revision of salary and allowances of the Director-General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and emoluments and other allowances being paid to the Chairmen and Members of Independent Commissions, including that and with special mention to the Police Commission, I would like to bring the attention of this House on a very important matter.

In the light of the recent tragic events ongoing around the country, I wish to highlight one such event that took place in my home town, Eravur. In the eve of the Haji festival, in the early morning hours of September 11th, five alleged assailants broke into a home in which two innocent women were sleeping in. The mother, a 56-year old widow and her daughter, a 32-year old married woman, whose husband was employed overseas, were due to wake up in a few hours to commence a voluntary fast in lieu of the forthcoming festival. It is alleged that these five assailants molested both women and then clubbed them to death.

Sir, this heinous crime is possibly the most brutal breach of law to occur in the Batticaloa District since the end of war. In the immediate aftermath of this occurrence,

the community and the populace of Eravur - young and old - came together. The usual festive celebrations of Id-Ul-Alha this year were a solemn, somber affair. There was an air of agitation amongst women, afraid for their safety and well-being while they sleep in their homes at night, and amongst men, a fear of safeguarding their wives, mothers and daughters. This could have happened to anybody.

However, as savage and inhuman was this crime, I wish to take this opportunity to commend the efficiency and the high competence displayed by the Sri Lanka Police, specifically in upholding the rule of law and investigating this crime with foolproof precision. In a mere matter of days - the investigation was so thorough and was effectively carried out - the alleged suspects, all members of the same community, were taken into custody. With the investigation ongoing, I do not wish to comment further, but would like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of my people to the Sri Lanka Police and bring to the attention of this House, particularly to the attention of the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, their admirable conduct, especially its leadership in the Batticaloa District and in the Eastern Province and their steadfast determination in bringing a closure to the suffering of the families of the affected and for bringing about a sense of peace and security among the community.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Finally, Sir, let me conclude with this. In these difficult times, when the rule of law is challenged, breached or debated, it is important to take note of and express gratitude to those who enforce it, without question, just as a mere sense of duty. I pray to the Almighty to grant the Highest Heaven to those who have left us through such unthinkable crimes and to keep our children and families, the community and the country safe.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . [.. 5.46] ( ,) (The Hon. Jayantha Samaraweera) , .
