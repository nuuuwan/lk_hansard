Major Sterile Insect Technique operations have been conducted in Mexico, Argentina and Northern Chile against the Medfly - Mediterranean fruit fly - and in 1981, this was declared a complete success in Mexico. During 1994 -1995, eradication was achieved in two fruit-growing areas of Argentina and 95 per cent success in another, as well as in Chile.

A very successful Sterile Insect Technique campaign was screwworm eradication in Southern USA, Mexico and nearby. By 1991, the screwworm eradication had yielded some US Dollars 3 billion in economic benefits due to healthier livestock. The Mexican plants and equipment were then applied to infestations in Libya, Jamaica and Central America, providing 20 million sterile pupae per week.

Sterile Insect Technique has been effective on the Medfly in southern Africa and is now being applied to Codling Moths which damage citrus crops. The IAEA and FAO are assessing the potential of using SIT against Sugarcane Borers on sugarcane, as well as consolidating Codling Moth management to support the apple and pear export industries.

There are a number of areas where these new technologies have been used in developed countries as well as in developing countries and they have gained good results.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I congratulate the Minister, Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, for bringing in a very pertinent Bill to Parliament and hopefully we will be able to get through it with the help of the Opposition.

[7. 24 p. m] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, sports in this country received a great fillip, a shot in the arm after His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa came into power and the timely appointment of our good, energetic and able Minister, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage. It is no secret, Sir, that never in the history of this country has sports reached such heights, internally and internationally.

Sir, I must pay my tribute today to Anil Prasanna Jayalath, who was able to win the first Gold Medal for Sri Lanka in 200 metres - T42 - at the 13th Asian Para Games held at Asiad Main Stadium, Incheon, Korea yesterday. There are so many who have won Silver and Bronze Medals too. So, it is up and up and up that we are moving in sports .

It was only the other day, when we visited Jaffna with His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, that he declared at the Vaddukoddai Madya Maha Vidyalaya, that he will make sports a compulsory subject in all schools. It was received with a thunderous applause by boys and girls. Particularly, Vaddukodai is a place that we cannot forget because that is where the Federal Party assembled and passed a Resolution to divide the country. Now, we have taken sports there so that they can play cricket, volleyball and football with the students of the other areas, particularly Colombo. Jaffna boys are coming to Colombo and Colombo boys are going to Jaffna.

Sir, there is a another very good news. "The Island Sport" supplement of 22nd October, 2014 reported, I quote:

"Mahanama becomes fourth match referee to achieve 200-ODI landmark"

"Former Sri Lanka captain and World Cup winning team member Roshan Mahanama became the latest member of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees to reach the 200-mark in One-Day Internationals (ODIs) when he took the field to officiate in the first ODI between New Zealand and South Africa in Mount Maunganui on Tuesday.

A member of the team that won the ICC Cricket World Cup 1996, Mahanama represented Sri Lanka in 52 Tests and 213 ODIs between 1986 and 1999, in which he scored 2,576 and 5,162 runs, respectively."

He was also the proud partner with the Hon. Sanath Jayasuriya, Deputy Minister and Chairman of the Cricket Selection Committee, in scoring the highest test total in a cricket match. So, those are great achievements.

Sir, I have in my hand a book titled, One Distinguished Family of Moor Street Jaffna. That family promote a sport. Alhaj Jameel has taken a lot of pain to produce these books under Dr. A.M.A. Azeez Foundation. This book was written by Marina Ismail and Ali Azeez, the worthy daughter and son of our great man, Dr. A.M.A. Azeez.

Then, there is also another book titled"

... ".

... . , . .

I also urge the able Minister, who sees the bright side of life, the bright side of students and the bright side of sports, to have a birds-eye view on billiards and snooker as well and promote those, because billiards is one sport that we can never forget as it is the sport that gave us the first international champion, M.J.M. Lafir of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home.

Then, we should also develop sports such as volleyball, the poor mans sport, football, elle, kabaddi, and carrom, the well-known game played in our homes, et cetera. Through sports, His Excellency the President said, we could build up a united and peaceful nation in this country. Sir, when the students of Jaffna come to schools like Ananda, Nalanda and Zahira, they cannot speak in Sinhala. Similarly, when the students of Ananda and Nalanda Colleges go to Jaffna, they cannot speak in Tamil. But, see how they interact through sports. So, sports promote that type of unity and understanding so that there can be a healthy nation, where all can live together and make this country the Wonder of Asia.

I am once again thankful to the Hon. Minister of Sports for doing everything possible to promote sports. He is taking sports not only to Nawalapitiya, but also to the other rural areas. He has even put up a magnificent stadium for those in rural areas. So, thank you very much, Hon. Minister, for all what you have done for sports in this country.

Thank you. [.. 7.30]
