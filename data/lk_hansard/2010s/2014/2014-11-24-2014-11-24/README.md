"Public finance is one of those subjects which lie on the border line between economics and politics. It is concerned with the income and expenditure of public authorities, and with the adjustment of the one to the other; adjustment not necessarily to equality, but to whatever arithmetical relationship, in given conditions, is best".

. . . . . Hugh Dalton was the Chancellor of the Exchequer and tutor to Dr. N. M. Perera. . I quote:

Every writer, who aims at organising a general discussion of public finance, must be conscious of a conflict between two personalities,..."

Not your personality, two distinct personalities.

Summary 1. Economy

- The Sri Lankan economy grew by 7.3 per cent, satisfactorily above the annual average growth of 7 per cent recorded over the past 10 years, while inflation remained at single digit levels for the fifth consecutive year. Meanwhile, per capita GDP in US dollar terms increased as well to US Dollars 3,280 in 2013, keeping on track to reach the per capita income target of US Dollars 4,000 by 2016.

- The Agriculture sector recorded a 4.7 per cent in 2013 contributing to a relative share of 10.8% of GDP, mainly due to improved performance in domestic agriculture. The Industry sector recorded a 9.9 per cent growth, contributing to a relative share of 31.1% of GDP during the year with the construction sub sector remaining the highest contributor to growth. The manufacturing sub sector also recorded a higher growth during year supported by the improvement in external demand. The service sector recorded a 6.4 per cent growth, contributing to a relative share of 58.1% of GDP during 2013 with the expansion of sub sectors of transport, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants and the banking, insurance and real estate sub sectors.

- The peaceful environment in the country together with the ongoing strategic investments in the tourism industry, new tourist attractions and mega promotional campaigns attracted a significant number of tourists to Sri Lanka. Earnings from tourism continued to grow considerably in the past few years. Earnings from exports increased by 6.4% in 2013, with the downward movement in commodity prices in the international market and a fragile recovery in the global economy. Furthermore the growth in the export of services (IT/BPO/KPO) over the past decade highlights the scope for service exports to be a key driver of growth going forward.

- Sri Lanka has achieved a considerable success in health indicators such as low infant mortality rate, under five mortality rate, maternal mortality rate and high level of life expectancy due to wide network of free health and free education covering the entire nation and existence of preventive and curative health infrastructure. Accordingly, the maternal mortality rate declined to 0.3 per 1,000 live births and infant mortality rate to 9.7 per 1,000 live births while life expectancy improved to 75.1 years in 2013. Moreover the countrys education attainment levels are high according to the basic indicators such as literacy and access to primary education. The literacy rate of the population is 96% and computer literacy reaching 40 per cent. The primary and secondary school enrolment rose to 99% and 84 per cent respectively.

- Sri Lanka has made a steady progress in reducing poverty during recent times and is well poised to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of halving the incidence of poverty before the target year of 2015. Based on the national poverty lines, the incidence has declined from 26.1 per cent in 1990-1991 to 6.7 per cent in 2013. It is a significant achievement that the current national poverty level is 6.7% which is well below the 13.1% target which was intended to be reached by 2015. Around 1.7 million poor people have moved out of poverty from 2005 to 2013. The sustainable high inclusive economic growth, priority given in public expenditure allocations towards multi-dimensional aspects of poverty reductions, improving basic infrastructure at rural level, rural provincial connectivity initiative had a positive impact on low income households to move above the poverty line.

- Furthermore, Sri Lanka has already achieved the MDG target on safe drinking water. Out of the total number of households in the country, nearly 90 per cent has access to safe drinking water in 2012/13 compared to 68 per cent in 1990. Huge improvement in sanitary conditions have been recorded in all the districts. The access to electricity is raised to 96% of households with progress being made to provide electricity to all by 2015.

- The unemployment rate decreased to 4.4% in 2013 from 5.8% in 2009 and the major contributory factors for this improvement were the broad-based economic growth, growing employment opportunities particularly in industry and services sectors and increase in overseas employment opportunities for Sri Lankans.

- The current account deficit decreased substantially to US Dollars 2,607 million (3.9% of GDP) in 2013 from US Dollars 3,885.6 million (9.5% of GDP) in 2008. This was mainly due to the contraction in the trade deficit and a substantial increase in worker's remittances and enhanced earnings from tourism.

- Reserve asset position of the country improved further to US Dollars 75 billion, reflecting increasing resilience to external shocks. These assets were equivalent to 5 months of import of goods and 4.2 months of imports of goods and services.

- The medium term macro fiscal framework of the government is designed to further decline the budget deficit to a level conductive to achieve broad- based development objectives. Accordingly, the overall budget deficit as a percentage of GDP has been declining from 9.9 per cent in 2009 to 5.9 per cent in 2013, is expected continue further by reducing the deficit to a level below 4 per cent of GDP over the period of 2015-2017 while reflecting the continued efforts towards consolidation of the government fiscal operations.

- On the expenditure side, the government was focused towards rationalization of recurrent expenditure while maintaining public investments at a favorable level to implement huge infrastructure development projects with the view of encouraging private sector participation in economic activities. Accordingly, recurrent expenditure as a percentage of GDP declined significantly to 14.1 per cent in 2013 from 18.2 per cent in 2009 indicating governments commitment towards rationalizing recurrent expenditure.

- On the revenue side, the revenue deficit which has been reduced from 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 0.8 per cent in 2013, is expected to be consolidated further by recording a revenue surplus of around 3 per cent of GDP over the medium term.

- Public investment remained high at 6.9% of GDP due to rationalization of expenditure enabled the government to reduce recurrent expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Public investment in economics services continued to be the main component of the governments investment programme. With this a significant investment was made in the national infrastructure development projects in the areas of roads, ports, power and energy, railways, and water supply and irrigation.

- Furthermore, huge investment was also directed towards for the implementation of several regional and rural infrastructure development projects with government vision to reduce rural-urban disparities. Meanwhile public investment in education was directed towards the improvement of university infrastructure, knowledge enhancement and institutional development and improvement of vocational and technical education. Further, public investment in the health sector directed towards construction

and improvement of hospitals, supply of laboratory equipment and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases.

- In addition identifying the uniqueness of each region, specific regional development initiatives were undertaken in each province. With all these measures the government will ensure fiscal discipline in management of scarce resources and promotion of sustainable development in the country.

- The government debt management strategy has been designed to ensure that the government debt is systematically reduced to proportion of GDP while refinancing government debt suitably and financing fiscal deficit to promote sustained growth with stability. Total government debt decreased as a percentage of GDP to 78.3 per cent in 2013 from 86.1 per cent of GDP in 2009. Further the debt management strategy will be continued to focus on reducing debt servicing costs in the medium term.

- The government of Sri Lanka has taken a number of positive steps to ensure environmental sustainability, by focusing on sustainable management of forest resources for protection of the environmental and biodiversity. Therefore government has initiated several programmes such as tree planting programmes, effective waste management to mitigate the environmental issues and increase forest coverage in the country.

. 2015 , , . , , . , . , .

Today, we have come to the conclusion of discussing the Budget Estimates for the year 2015. This is the 10th Budget presented by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the sixth since the guns had fallen silent in Sri Lanka, ending the armed conflict.

I am confident that the people of this country would endorse and ensure that His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa would continue as President and he would present us with more progressive budget estimates in the coming years too, to secure lasting peace in our soil, uplift the lives of the people of our country through the promotion of inclusive growth and to achieve the goals pronounced by him when he presented this Budget.

The success of the "Mahinda Chintana" vision and His Excellency the Presidents capability to deliver the set goals are well discussed in the World Banks "Sri Lanka Overview", updated on 31st March, 2014, which states, I quote:

"Almost five years after the end of the three-decade civil conflict, Sri Lanka is now focusing on long-term strategic and structural development challenges as it strives to transition to an upper middle income country."

"Economic prosperity has been broadly shared.

Real per capita consumption of the bottom 40 percent grew between 2002 and 2009 by an average of 4.3 percent annually, compared to 2.6 per cent of the top 60 per cent. As a result, inequality in per capita consumption expenditure fell during this period,......"

"The Sri Lankan economy has seen robust annual growth at 6.4 percent over the course of 2003 to 2012, well above its regional peers. Following the end of the civil conflict in May 2009, growth

3261 3262

2014 24

rose initially to 8 per cent, largely reflecting a peace dividend, and underpinned by strong private consumption and investment. While growth was mostly private sector driven, public investment contributed through large infrastructure investment, including post war reconstruction efforts in the North and Eastern provinces."

"Shared prosperity has been associated with dramatic declines in poverty."

"Sri Lanka has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving extreme poverty and is on track to meet most of the other MDGs, outperforming other South Asian countries."

Similarly, the Asian Development Bank too in its Fact Sheet about Sri Lanka dated April, 2014 has stated as follows, I quote:

"Sri Lankas social indicators are among the best in South Asia. The country has achieved near universal literacy, and has a comparatively low poverty level. Economic growth has been steady since the military conflict ended, but slowed in 2012. Growth had, however, picked up strongly again by the third quarter of 2013."

In addition to articulating the vision to achieve the targets set for 2020 and onwards, His Excellency the President, in his Budget Proposals, has provided much relief to all the segments of society. Thus, the Budget Proposals have declared dividends to its stakeholders, the people of this country, who stood with his Government to overcome the man-made and natural disasters and to march towards economic recovery.

I have, time and again, spoken in this House during the current and previous Budget Debates and in the Northern District Development Committee meetings chaired by His Excellency the President about the meticulous planning and miraculous achievement of this Government under the Vadakkin Vasantham Programme on rehabilitation, development, progress and prosperity of the Northern Province since the end of the conflict. I have reiterated, during the course of my speeches, that it was the vision of His Excellency the President and the able leadership of the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa that made the Vadakkin Vasantham Programme, a success. I have substantiated my statement by even giving figures. The total investment by the Government in the Northern Province since 2009 to date was Rs. 290,271 million. The break-up of this huge capital expenditure districtwise is, Jaffna - Rs. 89,031 million; Killinochchi - Rs. 60,529 million; Mannar - Rs. 62,804 million; Mullaitivu - Rs. 38,407 million; and Vavuniya - Rs. 39,500 million.

The TNA has cooked up a story that the Government is not giving any fund to the Northern Provincial Council. By doing a small calculation of dividing the Recurrent Expenditure allocated to each province in the Budget Estimates for 2015 by its population, we can see that the Northern Province has got the highest per capita allocation of Rs. 14.26. Similarly, as regards Capital Expenditure too, the Northern Province has got the highest allocation of Rs.5, 288 million. The details are as follows: Northern Province - 5,288 million;

Sabaragamuwa Province - 4,760 million; Southern Province - 4,382 million; Central Province- 4,379 million; Uva Province - 3,736 million; Western Province - 3,123 million; North Western Province - 2,925 million; Eastern Province - 2,869 million; and North Central Province - 2,605 million.

During the year 2014 also, the Northern Province has got the highest allocation. But, according to the Financial Progress Report of the Northern Provincial Council as on 30th October, 2014, they have spent only 31 per cent of the sum allocated. That is, they have spent only Rs. 1,881 million out of the total allocation of Rs. 5,959 million. The expenses include the purchase of luxury vehicles and other luxuries for the Chief Minister, Ministers and the Chairman of the Northern Provincial Council. The TNA Members in this House had been speaking without any factual evidence and misinforming the House with regard to the Northern Provincial Councils expenditure. If this is the way the TNA Members misinform the House, one could imagine how they mislead the innocent Tamils.

The Chief Minister has been saying that the Government is not providing the allocated funds to the Northern Provincial Council and that they have no control over project expenditure and the Governor and the Chief Secretary have been blocking everything. In the meantime, one of the TNA Parliamentarians and a Provincial Councillor have, in their speeches before the Tamil diaspora gathering in London, recently stated that the Provincial Council since the TNA assumed office, has renovated roads and hospitals to the value of Rs. 810 million : Mandaitivu Base Hospital at a cost of Rs. 50 million; Pannai-Mandaitivu Road renovation at a cost of Rs. 450 million; renovation of Kayts and Delft Base Hospitals at a cost of Rs. 60 million and 250 million respectively. Sir, I table* the CD which contains the speeches of the TNA Parliamentarian and the Provincial Councillor in London.

These persons say things contrary to what the Chief Minister has been saying. They have been claiming that all what the Government had planned and executed in the past and is being executed during the year through the Northern Provincial Council as being their own planning and execution. It was the Chief Minister and the TNA politicians who opened the building with enormous publicity. But, the Mandaitivu Hospital building was constructed with the allocation made in the 2013 Budget, during which period the NPC was not under the control of the TNA.

Similarly, the Pannai-Mandaitivu Road was a part of a long-term Provincial Road Project of the Government, funded partly by the World Bank. The total sum to be

3263 3264

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

invested under this project for the period 2013 - 2016, amounts to Rs. 2,685 million. Out of this, Rs.750 million has been earmarked for the year 2014 for construction of Pannai-Mandaitivu Road. The project was awarded to a contractor previously and since he had not completed it on time, it was awarded during the year to another contractor. They were telling untruths to the Tamil diaspora that what the Government had carried out, or the contracts awarded in the past, were being carried out by the Northern Provincial Council during the year, in order to get the diaspora money into their pockets.

On the initiative of His Excellency, the deep wounds of conflict are getting healed; efforts are afoot to move Sri Lanka towards long-term peace and make it a more inclusive state. The recovery of socio-economic status and reintegration of conflict-affected communities was the priority of the Government. While every endeavour is made by our Government towards its commitment to heal the wounds of the pre-conflict era through the process of rehabilitation, reintegration and reconciliation, the TNA and its allies are sowing the seeds of hostility and estrangement and are trying to isolate the Tamil community for their political survival.

A TNA Parliamentarian swindled millions of rupees from Tamil people in the name of Sabra Finance in the 1980s and started a Tamil daily from the defrauded money. It was done in the same way Sakvithi did in the South. Today, that Tamil daily is in the forefront of misleading the Tamil people. The same Parliamentarian has today connived with the Northern Provincial Councillors and made 59 ice-cream manufacturers to close their factories in order to promote the ice-cream agency he was involved with. Most of those ice-cream manufacturers are small industrialists. About 3,500 people have lost their jobs and hundreds of retailers who sell these ice-creams have lost revenue as a result. This is another plot like Sabra Finance by this Parliamentarian. He is talking about the Jaffna University Council Members and the academic staff in this House. Does he want to put his people as University Council Members and create chaos within the university? They are used to "fish in troubled waters". Is he not aware that the University Vice-Chancellor, the UGC Chairman and the Hon. Minister of Higher Education had contributed greatly to uplift the standard of the Jaffna University, including the opening of the Engineering and the Agriculture Faculties? The Engineering Faculty had been a dream since 1978. Many people tried in the past, but it materialized only during the tenure of office of the present Vice-Chancellor.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, for the whole of today, the Government side has not spoken about the Budget.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What about your people? ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, please do not disturb him. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) They have only spoken about the standard to which they have fallen today. The Hon. Prime Minister spoke for 20 minutes in such agony. It is very unfortunate, but this is the reality. It is good that the Government has realized its position so early in the race, because it is going to be more and more difficult in the future. The people have rallied around the excellent strategy that the UNP, together with your General-Secretary, has put forward.

Anyway, now talking about the Budget, His Excellency the President as the Finance Minister, who presented the Budget spoke about the EPF. He said monies have been invested; that 10 per cent of the funds of the EPF have been invested in profit-making investments and because of that, the EPF is going to pay dividends to its members. He also said that a 10 per cent interest on the EPF deposits of members is guaranteed. But, after the Budget was presented, the Annual Report of the Employees Provident Fund for the year 2012 was presented to this House on the 13th of November. It showed a loss of Rs. 8 billion due to the investments that have been made. So, to say in this Budget that a profit of Rs. 10 billion is going to be realized and that dividends are going to be paid, is like all other promises made in the Budget, a false promise and not something that is achievable.

The workers who are members of the EPF are today very worried that they are going to lose their lifetime savings in the EPF due to the wrong policies of investment undertaken by the Government. This is being done for a few people to enjoy, to become richer by playing the share market. It is very unfortunate that the Government is also becoming a gambler in the share market investing in such a manner that they lose Rs. 8 billion from the investments they have made.

Further, the Government has promised 12 per cent interest to the people who are older, - I mean, they have not told the age - who are elders, and making deposits in State banks. This 12 per cent interest, we still do not understand where it is going to come from. The banks are today paying 6 per cent interest for deposits. The gap of 6 per cent has to be bridged by somebody. We still do not know how this is going to be done. But, why are only

3335 3336

State banks going to be given whatever subsidy you are planning to give? Is it because you are unable to raise deposits in State banks? Pensioners have grave doubts about investing in State banks. However, since you offered this rate of 12 per cent interest for deposits in State banks, some people have gone and inquired from the State banks whether instructions in this regard have been conveyed to them. Unfortunately, the banks have said that though the Government had announced it in the Budget, no such instructions have been given to the three State Banks and they are unable to provide this facility to the pensioners who could deposit monies in those banks. By doing this, are you not going to erode the deposit base of the private banks? This is a serious issue. Already, there are many issues for State banks because their exposure is flawed. In the past, 40 per cent of the advances of the Peoples Bank were from gold loans, 40 per cent to the Government and 20 per cent to industries and businesses. This was flawed and now the Peoples Bank has readjusted its loan portfolio and brought down the loans given on gold. - [Interruption.] Yes, the estate people are the biggest pawners in the Peoples Bank. Now, they have been reduced from people who owned jewellery to people who have lost jewellery. This is what you have done.

The pawning business was encouraged by the Peoples Bank and all banks started competing with each other saying that they give the largest advance. There were finance companies who were offering up to Rs. 55,000 per sovereign. Today, the price of gold has crashed. Then, all these banks shifted to leasing. They said, Herenakota leasing, Payen leasing, and all the banks started going behind leasing. They became competitors to the finance companies. In this Budget, you have reduced prices of cars. All those loans are going to crash. - [Interruption.] Not only for electric cars, the duty on all motor cars have come down after you consolidated the duty rates. Prices of cars have come down from Rs. 300,000 to Rs. 700,000, depending on the value. By that, the loans given or the leasing given on cars have become unrecoverable. You are going to destroy the finance companies. The banks are going to be badly affected. You do not seem to have a policy that will sustain these banks. Your policy is such that the banks are going to lose money and now they will have to, like the gold loans, reduce exposure on leasing.

Further, you are saying that the finance companies normally collect deposits by offering interest rates higher than banks. But, now, the State banks are going to offer 12 per cent to pensioners, whereas the private leasing companies, finance companies can give only 11 per cent interest on deposits. That is again going to affect the leasing companies. The policy of this Government on issues of this nature are definitely very harmful to the economy.

Thank you.
