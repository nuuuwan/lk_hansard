... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

, I have to perform a pleasant task. Our Speaker of this House, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, is today celebrating his birthday at Medamulana. We wish him good luck and offer him Many Happy Returns of the Day. And, to the Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader, Deputy Minister of Environment and Renewable Energy. There is also a good article written by Mr. Lakshman Kumara in the Parliament staff today and it is worth reading by everyone. So, on behalf of the House, we wish our Hon. Speaker good luck! [11.03 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Presiding Member, I am happy to follow my good Friends, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from the UNP and the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, Minister of Health from the Government, both of whom are Members who are held in high respect by all sections of society in this country.

I want to commence my speech, Sir, by conveying our deepest sympathies for the national calamity that occurred at Koslanda where due to an earthslip, a large number of people have perished; a large number of people have died and people have suffered immense devastation and destruction. So, we want to convey to the people of Koslanda that we are with them at this moment of tragedy and that our feelings are with them and that we pray for them. We would urge the Government to take all necessary action to ensure that these people are provided with the necessary relief and also hope that the Government takes appropriate action to ensure that these people who live in such territories do not have to face the danger of such calamities in the future.

Having said that, Sir, if I may commence my submissions on the Budget, President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Planning also, has presented his 10th Budget. In my view, the Budget seeks to ensure that he would present many more Budgets. The Budget seeks to please and placate wide segments of society in an effort to ensure their political support for him at an election to be held very soon. It must not be denied that there are benefits that accrue to the people in the matter of development, in the matter of relief, in the matter of employment and other facilities.

But, the overriding trend and theme of the Budget quite clearly is focused on the forthcoming election. One does not get the impression that these proposals have been prepared after careful study and introspection by different Ministries in charge of different subjects. If that was done, one would have seen a more cohesive, co-ordinated development programme, which could have benefited generally the vast majority of the people. What one sees instead are favours and handouts by the Head of State who happens to be also the Minister of Finance to different segments and sections of society to induce them to extend to him their support to continue to be the Head of State at the forthcoming election. It could be said that this is politics, but when in the guise of politics, democracy is sought to be subverted and values and principles of good governance are sought to be disregarded, that would be traversing a very dangerous trajectory and the country needs to be put on alert.

The Budget, in my view, cannot be viewed in isolation from the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, the enactment of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution and all the consequences that we have thereafter encountered in regard to the higher judiciary, the Election Commission and its impotency, the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Judicial Service Commission, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption becoming virtually lackeys of the Chief Executive, complete lack of trust in the higher judiciary and other crucial officials whose independence and integrity must be beyond reproach and the Chief Executive, who at the time of his election on two occasions was not merely constitutionally debarred from seeking a further term but he is now seeking a third term and also is entitled to seek office even thereafter, despite the public promise and commitment to the country both in 2005 and 2010 that the Executive Presidency would be abolished. The gravity of the totality of this situation is, in my view, a serious challenge to democracy and can be disregarded by the country only at its own grave peril.

Such developments must inevitably lead to authoritarianism and I consider it my duty to state this explicitly on the Floor of this House at the commencement of my speech. What the eventual effect of all these proposals will be remains to be seen. Similar proposals have come up in previous years. Are the people in this country today contented from the point of view of their basic needs? Sir, there seems to be a misconception that development is the be-all and end-all of everything and that if development is taking place, the Governments performance is creditable.

There can be no question about it, particularly infrastructure development has taken place and is taking place.

Let us look at the allocations to some Ministries in regard to Capital Expenditure. Defence and Urban Development gets Rs. 60 billion; Economic Development gets 75 billion. This, I do think is an important Ministry though I do also think that most functions performed by this Ministry can be performed more expeditiously and efficiently and in keeping with democratic norms if they are entrusted to the provincial level. There seems to be a misconception that development must take place only through this Ministry and that too only through one person. Highways, Ports and Shipping gets Capital Expenditure of Rs. 200 billion; Education gets Rs. 17.1 billion; Higher Education gets Rs. 18.1 billion totalling to Rs. 35.2 billion for Education and Higher education; Defence and Urban Development gets Rs. 60 billion, Rs. 25 billion more than for Education and Higher Education; Highways, Ports and Shipping gets Rs. 200 billion, more than five times, almost six times the amount allocated for Education and Higher Education. Resource allocation for Education has been considered to be inadequate over a long period of time. There is a serious incongruity, a serious lack of appreciation of the importance of education to our younger generation, and a misplaced importance attached to some other activities and Ministries, which also must have been motivated by certain considerations which unfortunately are not transparent. Agriculture has been given Rs. 3.2 billion; Fisheries has been given Rs. 4.5 billion. We are an island surrounded by the sea. A substantial section of our population is dependent on agriculture and fisheries. The Government does not have a planned-out programme to promote the opportunities of our people in the fields of agriculture and fisheries which constitute the bedrock of our rural economy.

The North and the East was devastated and destroyed by a vicious war. From the point of view of infrastructure, due to the efforts of various countries in regard to the North, particularly India and other countries and other organizations, very much has been done but very much more needs to be done. While the Government has pompously participated in the inauguration of projects undertaken and accomplished at the expense of other countries and organizations, the Government's own contribution has been negligible. After the conclusion of the war my fellow Parliamentarians from the TNA and I visited over 30 villages in the Vanni, met with the people, prepared a report in regard to their needs and we met with the President and several Ministers at a meeting which had been arranged for that purpose. I first told the President that 80 per cent of the houses had been destroyed in the Vanni and that the people should be given houses. The President very frankly told me that the Government had no money to provide houses. I asked that each family be given a bicycle which could help in addressing several needs of the family but not a single bicycle was given to anybody. India came forward to provide 50,000 houses to the people in need.

The biggest problem faced by our people is their inability to get back to their lands, which are yet occupied or have been newly taken over by the armed forces or others. Both in the North and the East, housing and livelihood are the main problems. They need to be addressed early.

I looked at the allocations made to the Ministries manned by my compatriots from the North and the East. My compatriot from the East, who is the Deputy Minister of Resettlement - a very wide and important subject - gets Rs. 186 million, around one-fifth of a billion. My compatriot from the North, who is the Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development gets Rs. 514 million, around half a billion, whereas the Ministry of Economic Development gets Rs. 75 billion; the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development gets Rs. 60 billion and the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping gets Rs. 200 billion. Of these two honourable Gentlemen who claim to represent the East and the North, one Gentleman gets just one-fifth of a billion and the other Gentleman gets just half a billion. These are the Gentlemen who claim that by co-operating with the Government, they are serving the people of the North and the East, and that the Tamil National Alliance by advocating the need for an acceptable and reasonable political solution to the national question, a basic demand of the Tamil people, which had been democratically endorsed at every election held in this country at every level, is engaging in confrontational politics. I wish to ask these Gentlemen whether in the context of the manner in which the Government is treating them, as clearly demonstrated by the allocations made for the Ministries which they are in charge of and despite their hanging onto the coattails of the Government, whether they should not be withdrawing from the political scene and cease to be a hindrance to the Tamil National Alliance working out with the Government, a peaceful, honourable and an acceptable resolution of the conflict pertaining to the national question.

Given the destruction and devastation the North-East has gone through over a long period, recognition of that reality and implementation of appropriate programmes, also involving the provincial administration would have greatly helped to bring about national reconciliation. The people in the North-East directly affected by the war, yet need to be put on their feet. They need to stand on their legs. The Governments insensitivity caused either by the lack of political will or its narrow political agenda is disappointing. Continuing dependence on their present friends can only further alienate the people of the North and the East from the Government.

Sir, one must realize that the North and the East has suffered immense damage. The entire area has been devastated.

But the Government does not seem to be conscious of that. The Government does not seem to realize that the

953 954

North-East has got to be dealt with on the basis of an area which needs to be reconstructed, rebuilt by virtue of the calamity that has occurred in that area, which should not have occurred, if there was a reasonable resolution to the national question earlier. There would have been no need for a war. Our people are not a violent people, and our people would have been extremely supportive of any peaceful resolution of this conflict, in which event all this devastation and destruction would not have taken place. The Government is largely responsible for that situation of an armed conflict commencing in this country. It is not that I support an armed conflict, but the fact of the matter was that an armed conflict became inevitable in the context of the Government not performing its duty and the Government should therefore realize that there is responsibility on the part of the Government not merely to evolve an acceptable political solution, but also to take steps to ensure that the North-East is rebuilt and reconstructed, and that the people who occupied the North-East are able to live in those area as equal citizens.

During his speech, Sir, His Excellency the President has also referred to political issues. I refer to points 2.6 and 2.7 in his speech. He has talked about the need for a political solution. He has insinuated that the Tamil National Alliance is not cooperating with the Government in regard to a political solution. He has also alleged that the Tamil National Alliance is responsible for the present stalemate regarding a suitable political solution. I do not think, Sir, that these statements of the President are in accordance with the true position. I do not intend to engage in a confrontation, but I do think when the President has made a statement of this nature, the truth needs to be put on record, and that, we need to respond. We are committed to the evolution of a political solution within the framework of a united and undivided Sri Lanka. It is true that there was a demand for the restoration of sovereignty of the Tamil people consequent to the enactment of the 1972 Constitution, which denied them everything and made them second class citizens. The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, ever since its inception, the date of Agreement is 29th July 1987 - the first commitment in the agreement is that the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka must be preserved. Ever since then, Sir, the demand for separation has not been pursued. It is the expectation of the vast majority of Tamil people that there will be a political solution that would enable them to live as equal citizens within a united and undivided Sri Lanka. They would much prefer and indeed want to be equal Sri Lankans rather than pursue a separatist goal. It is in this background, Sir, that I propose to analyze what the President has said in the course of his Budget Speech and all that has happened, particularly, after President Rajapaksas assumption of office for the first time in 2005.

I propose, Sir, to refer to certain speeches and certain commitments made by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in regard to the contours of a political solution. I would also refer to certain processes that have taken place in this country from the year 2011 which have today reached a deadlock and which have not proceeded, which have not progressed.

I would like to state the reasons for this situation coming into being. I would first refer to the speech that President Mahinda Rajapaksa made to the inaugural Meeting of the All Party Representatives Committee and the Multi-Ethnic Experts' Committee that he appointed. He addressed that grouping under different headings. Under the heading Unity, territorial Integrity and Sovereignty, this is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa had to say on 11th, July 2006. I quote:

The unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country must be preserved. This cannot be open to bargain. Our approach has been widely endorsed by the international community, notably India and the Co-chairs have clearly stated and have clearly ruled out any form of division of this country. Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka. Each party represented here has its own solutions to the national question. We will discuss and synthesize these different approaches and develop our own Sri Lankan model. We must explore past attempts from the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact onwards. We must draw appropriate lessons from the experience of other countries. I will not impose a solution on the country. But, you will through your developments, through your deliberations provide a solution to the national question.

Then, again, Sir, continuing under the heading Devolution for the People by the People, this is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, I quote:

People in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time. In addition, it is axiomatic that devolution also needs to address issues relating to identity as well as security and socio-economic advancement without over-reliance on the Centre. In this regard, it is also important to address the question of regional minorities.

Any solution needs to as a matter of urgency, devolve power for the people to take charge of their own destiny. This has been tried out successfully in many parts of the world. There are many examples from around the world that we may study as we evolve a truly Sri Lankan constitutional framework including our neighbour, India.

Then, Sir, continuing further, under the heading Some Concluding Thoughts, this is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, I quote:

Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution without sacrificing the sovereignty of the country. Given the ground situation, given the background to the conflict,..

Therefore, Sir, that was the Presidents position in regard to the nature of the political solution that he had in

955 956

[ . ]

2014 30

mind when he addressed the inaugural Meeting of the APRC and the Multi-Ethnic Experts' Committee who were appointed by him.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa addressed Parliament on 19th of May, 2009, on the day the war came to end. In the course of his address to Parliament, this is what he said: Mr. Speaker, it is necessary that we give to these people" - that means the Tamil People - the democratic freedom that is the right of people in all parts of our country". Similarly, it is necessary that the political solutions they need should be brought closer to them faster than any country or government in the world would bring. He goes on to say, Sir: Therefore, it is necessary that we find a solution that is our very own, of our own nation. It should be a solution acceptable to all sections of the people.

The President further states: "I believe that the solution that we who respect the value and qualities of Mettha (loving kindness) Karuna (Compassion) Muditha (Rejoicing in others joy) and Upeksha (Equanimity) based on the philosophy of Buddhism can present, can bring both relief and an example to the world. Similarly, I seek the support of all political parties for that solution.

He not merely talked about a political solution, but a political solution that will be guided by the tenets of Buddhism. The people of this country are substantially Buddhists. Therefore, I do not think anyone would be in disagreement with me if I say that Lord Buddha would have certainly wanted a just solution to this conflict in such a manner that all people who live in this country, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion would be able to live with self-respect and dignity fulfilling their legitimate aspirations.

That was the second important Statement made by the President, Sir, when he addressed Parliament on the 19th of May 2009.

Now, I want to refer to the third Statement that the President made which also defined the contours of his thinking in regard to a political solution. That was the Joint Statement, Sir, made by the President after the visit of Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the UN to this country on the 23rd of May, 2009. In that Joint Statement signed by both the President and the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, this is what he stated:

The Joint Statement released by the Government of Sri Lanka and the UN Secretary-General states that President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General agreed that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socio-economic development. The Secretary-General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his Statement made in Parliament on 19th May 2009 that

a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved. President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties, in the new circumstances to further enhance this process and bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

Anyway, the situation being, Sir, that the LTTE had been decimated and if there was an impediment from the Tamil side in regard to a political solution, that impediment was no longer there. These were the three fundamental important statements made by the President and without confronting the President in any way, may I say to him with the utmost respect that I am prepared to negotiate with him a political solution within the framework of these three statements that he has made without going in any way beyond these three statements.

The President appointed a Panel of Experts. The Panel of Experts have come up with a Report. We are prepared to discuss the political solution based upon the Report of the Panel of Experts appointed by him. There were 17 persons on that Panel of Experts. Twelve of them were Sinhalese, 4 of them were Tamils. There was one Muslim. Eleven of them including six Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslim have come up with a Majority Report. This is a home-grown solution recommended by the multi-ethnic Panel of Experts appointed by the President. So, what is your difficulty in adopting that Report in framing a solution? Two Experts who were Sinhalese did not indicate their position.

Therefore, the position is that it would not be quite correct to say that the TNA is not cooperating in the matter of a political settlement because the TNA is quite prepared to extend to the President the fullest cooperation to ensure that a solution is arrived at on the basis of statements that he has hitherto made.

All these processes that I have referred to were domestic processes largely on the initiative of the President indicating the nature of his commitment and the nature of his desire regarding a political solution.

Bilateral talks recommenced between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil National Alliance in January 2011. The President had been re-elected in January 2010. TNA had been re-elected substantially to represent the Tamil people in the North-East in April 2010.

We tabled a Position Paper in January 2011 setting out our position. I table* that Position Paper and kindly request that it be included at the end of my speech.

957 958

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

The Position Paper defined the position of the TNA in regard to a political solution at the bilateral talks that took place between the Government and the Tamil National Alliance. The Government delegation agreed to respond to enable the commencement of a meaningful discussion. They kept on postponing. I wish to explain in some detail what happened when the Government did not come up with their position at the bilateral talks.

I must refer to the fact that bilateral talks took place between the Government of Sri Lanka and the TNA which commenced in January 2011 and went on till January 2012. No talks have taken place thereafter. The Government has also talked about a Parliamentary Select Committee. There has been a Resolution adopted in Parliament in regard to the Parliamentary Select Committee. We have not yet submitted our names to the Parliamentary Select Committee, but we very earnestly took part in the discussions at the bilateral talks.

Sir, I need to make the position clear in regard to what our stand is in respect of the bilateral talks and the Parliamentary Select Committee.

At the conclusion of the General Election in April 2010, the TNA made a public request that the Government should engage with the TNA in respect of two matters. The first was the evolution of a political solution to the national question and the second was the immediate and urgent concerns of the Tamil people in the aftermath of the war. Although the President agreed with the Leader of the TNA in early November 2010 to set up two separate Committees for same and despite names being forwarded for that purpose, only one Committee was appointed on 5th January, 2011 consisting of representatives of the Government and the TNA for a long-term reconciliation.

Bilateral talks between the Government and the TNA commenced on 10th January 2011. The TNA tabled this document at the first meeting itself indicating its position on a political solution which was in line with the Presidents own Speech at the Inaugural Meeting of the APRC and the Experts Committee in July 2006. At the second meeting held on 3rd February 2011, TNA submitted an outline of its proposed solution and at the third meeting held on 18th March 2011, at the invitation of the Government Delegation, the TNA placed on the table a comprehensive set of proposals. The Government delegation requested time to respond to the TNA's proposals and at every meeting thereafter apologized for not being able to respond and asked for further time. This went on for five months, during which time seven meetings were held. Apart from making suggestions with regard to the Senate and strengthening the Local Government bodies, no response was made to the TNA

proposals which was mainly on devolution of power to the provinces. In this background, at the meeting held on 4th August 2011, the TNA refused to set a date for the next meeting until the Government fulfills its obligation to respond to the TNAs proposals. Thereafter, the President invited the TNA Leader for a meeting on the 2nd of September 2011 and the following agreements were reached at that meeting. In view of the inability of the Government to respond to TNAs proposals it was agreed to bring to the table the previous proposals and the Presidents Speech at the Inaugural Meeting of the APRC and the Experts Committee. Bilateral Talks will recommence and continue on the basis of these documents.

Two, once a measure of consensus is reached on substantive issues at the Bilateral Talks, that agreement will be taken before the Parliamentary Select Committee either as a Government proposal or as a Government-TNA agreement, the TNA would join the Parliamentary Select Committee at that point of time.

The five documents referred to are these. Since the Thirteenth Amendment was considered inadequate, Presidents after the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment had taken various steps to improve on the Thirteenth Amendment. There was the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee during the time of President Premadasa, there were three other Constitutional Proposals of 1995, 1997 and 2000 during the time of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, there was a Speech made by the President at the inaugural meeting of the APRC and the Experts Committee and there was the Majority of Experts Committee Report, a Committee appointed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself. These were the documents that we wanted brought into the process in view of the failure on the part of the Government to deliver its response.

Bilateral talks commenced on 16th September, 2011 and the above agreement was minuted and later confirmed at a subsequent meeting on 20th October, 2011. The TNA also engaged in the constitutional framework including the formulation of the Terms and Reference for the PSC and the Motion for the same appears in the Order Book of Parliament of 4th October 2011. The Committee also identified the substantive issues that needed discussion, prepared a timetable for the same and met on three dates in December 2011 at which devolution of land powers to the provinces were discussed. Thereafter, three dates, 17th, 18th and 19th of January, 2012 were fixed to continue with the dialogue. The Government delegation failed to turn up for talks on 17th, 18th and 19th of January 2012 insisting that the TNA must first nominate its Members to the PSC contrary to the agreements previously reached. With this, the bilateral talks came to an end. That is how the bilateral talks came to an end.

959 960

Thereafter, two attempts were made to break the conflict. The first was the discussion held on the 27th January, 2012 between the Leader of the TNA and three Members of the Government delegation at which it was agreed that the TNA would nominate names to the PSC simultaneously with the commencement of bilateral talks but that the PSC would be convened only after a consensus is reached at the bilateral talks. This agreement was reduced to writing and apparently given to the President for approval, which did not materialize.

Thereafter another attempt was made by the Leader of the Opposition in May, 2012. After several rounds of discussions with the Government as well as the TNA, an agreed text was prepared as the Agenda for the PSC and placed in Parliament by the Leader of the Opposition on 24th May, 2012. Although the Government was supposed to endorse the said Agenda, the response of the Leader of the House did not address any one of the fundamental issues suggested by the Leader of the Opposition in his Agenda. I make this statement, Sir, because I want to make it perfectly clear that as far as we are concerned, we are committed to evolving a final solution to this question through negotiations.

We are committed to finding a political solution within the framework of a united, undivided Sri Lanka. But, it must be an honourable solution; it must be a reasonable solution; it must be a workable solution; it must be a durable solution. I regret to state that despite our having made our position very clear at the Bilateral Talks and in Parliament and outside, the Government had thus far not responded in any responsible way to what we have proposed. We have never said that we will not partake in the PSC. We have only said that the PSC - Parliamentary Select Committee - must play a purposeful and meaningful role. It must be structured in such a way that it will achieve the desired objectives. We cannot have the PSC merely to delay this process and to prolong this process nor can we have the PSC to enable some parties who will come before the PSC to scuttle the entire process. This we cannot cooperate with and we will not do that. This is our position in regard to the matter and this is why we have not been able to partake in the PSC.

Now, Sir, having said these things, I am also tabling* the Minutes of the Bilateral Meeting on 16th September, 2011 and I would like that to be included at the end of my speech.

There are two paragraphs in the Minute which are important, the statement made by me when we recommended the bilateral talks. The meeting was attended by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Chairman, The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva

Wijesinha and the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena on behalf of the Government. There was a delegation led by me on behalf of the TNA. I stated at that meeting:

This meeting happens consequent to a meeting I had with HE. He explained the difficulty in presenting a proposal of the government in that it maybe leaked and then it will become difficult to make adjustments. I said that I appreciated this but that there are other earlier documents on the basis of which we could talk. Those are Mangala Moonesinghe PSC proposals, Government's proposal for constitutional reforms 1995, 1977 and August 2000, HEs speech to APRC and Committee of Experts inaugural meeting and Report A of the committee of experts. HE agreed to proceed on that basis and so there would be no necessity for the government to give their response to our paper.

That is the basis on which we recommenced the bilateral talks. It is further recorded in the Minutes, Sir, I quote:

Thereafter Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva stated the TNA must agree to join the PSC so that the agreement reached here can be placed before the PSC as the joint TNA-SLFP proposal. Hon. Sampanthan stated that the terms of reference of the PSC that appears on the Order Paper was not acceptable and an alternative draft was given and the government delegation said they would try and get concurrence to it from other parties.

Prof. Rajiva suggested that we say one Sri Lankan nation. This was agreed to by the TNA delegation. The TNA also agreed that if the TOR was amended in this way, once an agreement was reached with the government delegation at these talks, which can be placed before the PSC as suggested, they would join the PSC process.

So, our position in regard to these matters has been quite frank. We have not been dubious. I am also tabling, Sir, the Agreement that was arrived between the Government delegation comprising of the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources, The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, and myself in regard to the basis of which talks should commence. It contains, Sir, very important positions - I am tabling* that, Sir, and request, that be included at the end of my speech.

Then, there is a statement made by Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe to Parliament on the 24th of May, 2012 where Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe underlined the basis on which talks could commence. He had discussed this matter with the President and the President had agreed with his agenda and Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe made a statement in Parliament on the basis of his agreement with the President in the hope that there will be a favourable response from the Government, and once that response of the Government was available, talks would commence. I would just read one paragraph in his statement, Sir. It states, I quote:

961 962

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

"The UNP has called on the Government to create an appropriate environment for the Opposition Parties to take part in the PSC. Such an environment is possible on an agenda based on the implementation of recommendation of the LLRC Report including a devolution package, implementing the 13th Amendment and further building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution, taking into account the bilateral discussions between the 3-Member Committee of the Government Parliamentary Group and the TNA based on the discussion papers and the documents referred to therein.

In fact, he had discussed the matter with the President and the President had agreed, that is contained in another page in his speech. He further said that, I am quoting from his statement:

The government has not objected to what we proposed in the agenda in order to create a suitable environment for the PSC. Thus at this juncture, I would also like to assure the TNA that the UNP will support all decisions arrived at during the bilateral talks between the representatives of the Government and those of the TNA. Therefore, I would like to urge the Leader of the House to endorse this agenda, enabling us also to participate in this dialogue.

Unfortunately, Sir, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva made a statement. I got that statement with me and prefer to table* that statement for you to kindly direct that it be included in Hansard.

It is a very important document, Sir. In his statement, he did not say anything positive on the basis of the statement made by Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe and consequently, the same situation continued. And, we were not able to resume the dialogue because Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghes statement was made on the basis of the discussion he had with the President with the endorsement of the President. But, when the Leader of the House responded in the House, he did not state that was acceptable, that they would conform to that agenda, and because he did not say so, talks could not continue. Meanwhile, Sir, various important persons in the Government were making statements in regard to the PSC and things like that which made it very difficult for the TNA to take part in the PSC. President Mahinda Rajapaksa asserted that all Ministers in the SLFP should stick to one position on the Provincial Council issue. He further asserted that two Provincial Councils should never be permitted to merge on their own and that the PCs - Provincial Councils - should not be granted police or land powers.

This was stated in his interview to the Lakbima newspaper on the 27th of June. Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said that there will be havoc if police and land powers are given to the

Provincial Councils and pointed out that the national police would be divided into nine, if done so. He further said that the Police force would become politicized which would lead to various administrative issues. Furthermore, Sir, the Minister, Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, in the course of a statement explained the dire consequences that would arise from vesting land and police powers with PCs. He further said, Our position is that the Thirteenth Amendment should be repealed entirely. That was the position of the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka. The Minister, Hon. Wimal Weerawansa who was also on the Parliamentary Select Committee, in the course of a statement at that time said, We would have been happy, if the Thirteenth Amendment was removed altogether, but some people in the Government are not keen on doing that. Therefore, we are asking the Government to remove the police and land powers in the Thirteenth Amendment. In addition, the opportunity to pass a resolution to merge the Northern and the Eastern Province should also be removed."

These are statements made by the Hon. Gentlemen through the press at different times and I quote from those reports that appeared in the media. Furthermore, Sir, the Minister, Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella went on to say this in the course of a statement that he made.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am finishing up, Sir, since I started at five past eleven.

He said very clearly - I think I must place that on record - "If the TNA is coming for discussions on land and police powers, it is a waste of time. There is no use in proceeding with talks, if they want to discuss those issues". That was the position. There are provisions in the Constitution pertaining to land and police powers; there are provisions in the Constitution pertaining to the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. But, here these Gentlemen are saying that these things must be removed and that cannot be allowed. How can the TNA go to the Parliamentary Select Committee in this situation? This is why we did not go to the Parliamentary Select Committee. In fact, the Cabinet took a decision that they would remove some of these provisions in the Thirteenth Amendment, that they would amend the Thirteenth Amendment. Consequently, I had to get in touch with Delhi and I had a meeting with the Indian Prime Minister on the 18th of June, 2013. At the end of that meeting that I had with the Indian Prime Minister with my delegation, there was a statement made by the Ministry of External Affairs of India and this is what they said in that statement. I quote:

963 964

It was noted that the proposed changes raised doubts about the commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government to India and the international community, including the United Nations, on a political settlement in Sri Lanka that would go beyond the 13th Amendment.

The changes would also be incompatible with the recommendation of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), set up by the Government of Sri Lanka, calling for a political settlement based on the devolution of power to the provinces,

It was further stated by the Ministry of External Affairs that Dr. Singh stressed on the expectations that the Sri Lankan Tamil Community should lead a life of dignity as equal citizens and reiterated that India would make every effort to ensure the achievement of a future for the community marked by equality, justice and self-respect. It was after this statement and after the special National Security Adviser of India visited Sri Lanka and met with the President that these proposals were abandoned that this was given up. Sir, I want to make it perfectly clear that we are certainly not responsible for the stalemate.

Before I conclude, sir, I would also like to refer to what the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission were in regard to a political solution. This is what the Para 9.184 of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission stated, I quote:

The Commission takes the view that the root cause of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka lies in the failure of successive Governments to address the genuine grievances of the Tamil people.

This is what the LLRC said. They went on further, Sir, with their recommendations and I will read very quickly two other paragraphs.

Paragraph 9.236 states, I quote:

The Commission wishes to underline the critical importance of making visible progress on the devolution issue, in order to ensure the success of any process of lasting and sustainable reconciliation. The Commission therefore recommends that the present opportunity be utilized to launch a good-faith effort to develop a consensus on devolution, building on what exists - both, for maximum possible devolution to the periphery especially at the grass roots level, as well as power sharing at the centre. This consensus should be one that will enable peoples participation in governance decisions affecting them and avoid costly and unnecessary duplication of political, bureaucratic and other institutional structures that hamper efficient, cost-effective and transparent governance.

Paragraph 9.237 states, I quote:

To this end, the Government must take the initiative to have a serious and structured dialogue with all political parties, and those representing the minorities in particular, based on a proposal containing the Governments own thinking on the form and content of the dialogue process envisaged. That dialogue must take place at a high political level and with adequate technical back-stopping.

Sir, where is the Governments proposal? The LLRC Report came out in November, 2011. Next month it will

be completing three years. Where is the Governments proposal? Is the Government yet prepared to come up with the proposal? Does the Government have a proposal?

Therefore, Sir, the collapse of the bilateral talks was entirely due to the Governments actions. The Government did not attend the bilateral talks on the 17th, 18th and 19th of January, 2012. We made two efforts thereafter to recommence the talks. That failed. You tried to amend the Thirteenth Amendment. You tried to remove important provisions in the Thirteenth Amendment. That is part of this countrys Constitution. You cannot do that. We are having all this trouble in this country today, because the Soulbury Constitution of 1947 was repealed by the 1972 Constitution. All the safeguards given were removed and you did what you wanted.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to the point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Mr. Presiding Member, Hon. Sampanthan made a reference to my name and said that there was an agreement between the TNA and the Government delegation. To my knowledge -

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sampanthan, please wind up your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) We have worked with the Government to arrive at a solution to our problems. We are prepared to do that. But the Government is playing foul; the Government is not being genuine. I am not confronting the Government. I respect many people in the Government. I respect President Rajapaksa. I am prepared to talk to him and resolve this question. I am not a stooge of the Government. I am also not a person who will confront the Government. I am a person who would like to work with the Government. My Party would like to work with the Government. We are prepared to negotiate an honourable solution, a reasonable solution, an acceptable solution, a durable solution that will be acceptable to all the people in this country.

Thank you.

I understand that about 75 children who were in the school at that time have been left orphaned and about 192 persons are missing or presumed to be dead. The entire nation is in a state of shock. I pray to God Almighty for His mercy and protection of our country and people from such disasters and calamities in the future.

Sir, I am now coming to the Budget and I congratulate His Excellency the President for presenting a historic Budget that has made the people jubilant over the unprecedented welfare measures proposed for all sectors of society. It is clearly proved that the economy has grown to be strong, that the dividends can be now distributed to the deserved to attend to their welfare and fulfil their needs and aspirations.

It is the beginning of a new era in the life of the people of Sri Lanka who suffered 30 years of ruthless terrorism, and for five years they had to wait patiently for relief until the economy was built up. Slowly and gradually the economy of the country has become sound and the people should be thanked for patiently waiting and co-operating till this day to receive the benefits of the ending of terrorist war.

Sir, it is more than a Budget and actually speaking, it is another stage of "Mahinda Chintana" which is the Governments National Development Framework.

I have noted the allegations made by certain Members of the Opposition that the welfare measures spelt out in the Budget are meant to be given as bribes for the much-speculated Presidential Election. However, it is not true. They say so because of their fear of being defeated. This Budget relief has been in the programme of Mahinda Chintana.

The "Mahinda Chintana" has been full of concern for upgrading the living conditions of people. It was only a question of time until the economy is built up to be sound enough to overcome challenges posed by local and international forces. Ending the war of indiscriminate mass killings by terrorists alone is sufficient for the President to get more than the necessary votes to be victorious. In any case, President Mahinda Rajapaksa is sure to emerge victorious and there is no necessity of bribing the people. People have still not forgotten the terrifying suicide bombers killing people in the streets and in public places. Even I had the terrifying experience of a narrow escape from the bombing incident at Akuressa. Thanks to Allah.

Each proposal contains an element of well-planned national development, for example, beginning to build a knowledge-based society, the proposals to strengthen the education at preschool level by offering a monthly allowance of Rs. 2,500 for teachers and Rs. 10,000 as incidental expenses. At its next phase, the amount of Rs. 500 given to Grade V Scholarlship students is to be increased up to Rs. 1,500. Further, 50,000 teaching assistants are to be recruited to rural schools and they will be paid a monthly allowance of Rs. 9,500. This will solve the teacher-shortage in rural schools.

Special attention has been given in the Budget for preschool childhood development and particularly their

nutrition needs and creative abilities. Necessary apparatus and preschool materials are to be given to preschools. Encouragement will be given to set up preschools in areas where no preschool facilities are available.

Programmes for socioeconomic empowerment of the fishing community is a very welcome measure. In view of the need to improve the quality of life, especially of women and children, the President has proposed to implement a dedicated three-year programme for preschool children, primary school children, livelihood opportunities for women and the elderly, skills development of youth and improvement of housing and sanitation conditions of the fishing community.

Another major development programme is to improve the rural transport and the national transport system. Arrangements have already been made to deploy 400 small buses to expand the rural transport services. In order to strengthen the fleet of the Sri Lanka Transport Board, a further 2,000 buses are to be added. This will ease the transport difficulties of the people particularly the rural masses.

Considering the difficulties people have undergone in paying high rates for electricity, petrol, diesel, kerosene oil and gas, already a considerable reduction has been announced. In the Budget, a 10 per cent reduction in the bill for water consumed up to 25 units has also been announced. This is an additional relief on the high cost of living.

Encouraging a rural-centric economy, the President has given high priority for agricultural development. Aimed at food security and higher income for rural people, the Government has already decided to give paddy seeds to small farmers, free of charge, for the Maha season. While continuing with the fertilizer subsidy which provides all varieties of fertilizer at Rs. 350 per 50 kilogram bag for paddy cultivation, the President has proposed to increase the guaranteed price of paddy from Rs. 34 to Rs. 40 per kilogram.

Attention has also been given to people suffering from kidney diseases and efforts have been taken to provide healthcare facilities. Preventive care against kidney disease has been taken through the provision of water purification plants in affected areas. The President has also proposed to grant a monthly living allowance of Rs. 3,000 for those adversely affected by the disease. An allocation of Rs. 750 million has been provided in the Budget to expand facilities at the Kidney Hospital in Maligawatta, to be able to cater to an increased number of patients and to expand the facilities of Anuradhapura and Hambantota Kidney Hospitals, which is a very important need at this time.

The entire Public Sector employees had a pleasant surprise when the President announced a record-breaking pay hike that is to be implemented with a new salary structure from January, 2015. The President has also

1001 1002

granted the long-standing requests of Public Sector Trade Unions to add the allowances to the basic salary.

The Government has not forgotten the retired pensioners and in order to promote their social development activities, action has been taken to set up a revolving fund with the Budget allocation of Rs. 1,000 million. This will provide loans up to Rs. 100,000 to pensioners' societies and senior citizens' clubs. They may obtain small loans at a low rate of interest.

Bringing in a new dimension to the gem and jewellery industry, the President has proposed to set up a Gem and Jewellery processing zone and a Gem Trading Centre in Ratnapura as a global attraction to Magampura-Ruhuna development. Considering the inadequate income sources available to many pradeshiya sabhas to provide basic community facilities such as sanitation, waste management and maintenance of drainage system, increased allocations have been provided while an additional sum of Rs. 600 million has been allocated to recruit 15,000 field level employees to engage in such work.

The humanitarian aspect of the Budget is being made evident by the increase of the allowance to July strikers up to Rs. 6,000, and making their surviving spouses eligible to receive the same allowance.

The concluding message of the President in his Budget Speech is a historic landmark. He said, I quote:

...having restored security and peace during the first five years and having got important infrastructure and economic activities in place during the last nine years to satisfy basic needs of the people, our next phase will be to double our efforts towards strengthening education, skills and human resource development so that our economic progress will be driven by knowledge and skills. For all these, it is essential to further consolidate hard-won peace and national security. That is the prime responsibility of all of us.

Let us make Sri Lanka the emerging "Wonder of Asia".

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

The next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. You have 19 minutes. [3.14 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I first wish to convey my deep sorrow and sympathies to the people who have been affected in the Meeriyabedda Estate in Koslanda, where 70 housing units have been washed away; 70 line blocks are totally destroyed, over 300 persons have been affected and over 180 persons are believed to be dead. So, this is a very sad state of affairs. I do not know whether we should blame anybody but definitely if you had taken action appropriately when the NBRO gave the warnings in 2005 and again in 2011 to relocate these people in new housing, then this tragedy could have been avoided. Why is it that this was neglected? This Government has no real action plan for the plantation people.

In 2005, there were so many pledges given in the Mahinda Chintana, for the plantation people but none of them have been implemented. The "Mahinda Chintana" states, I quote:

2004 .

But, what has this Government done? In 2006, the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake was appointed Minister of Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development. He was given an allocation of Rs. 2,500 million for this purpose. Maybe I also should be blamed for this. The CWC joined this Government and it was removed from the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake and the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam was appointed the Deputy Minister. From there, little by little this Ministry got destroyed and today we do not have an Estate Infrastructure Ministry at all. Maybe, if the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake had continued as the Minister, his allocation may have been increased to Rs. 5,000 million in the subsequent years and we would have had something better to boast or talk about today. But, I am sorry that my former Colleague destroyed the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development. Today, what do they do? They go to the Presidents House as the first invitee and pledge unconditional support for the next Presidential Election. - [Interruption.] No, I got fed up of this support that they were giving unconditionally to President Mahinda Rajapaksa and that is the reason why I left the CWC; there was no other reason. I have no personal problems with anybody in the CWC. - [Interruption.] But, I believe that they gave up the issues of the people and because of that, today they pledge unconditional support. I have worked with the late Hon. Savumiamoorthy Thondaman. Today is the 15th death anniversary of the late Hon. Savumiamoorthy

1007 1008

Thondaman. On this day, I am sad that unconditional support is pledged to the President. I can remember, from 1993 - [Interruption.] There was no condition. People today, if they can get the cars they want, if their hotel bills are paid, if whatever they do in these institutions is not looked into or queried, then they are willing to pledge their unconditional support because they are looked after and they do not care about the people who have to be looked after.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is blaming himself. Rs. 3,000 million has been given to the estates for the good of the people.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you may continue.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I spoke about the housing units because in the Mahinda Chintana the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa pledged: . 50,000

. So he promised. [Interruption.] Yes, if he had been there, it could have happened because he started building 4,600 houses in 2006 but, since then, not a single new house has been built in the plantation areas.

So, this same 50,000 promise has been repeated today in the Budget for 2015, and it was said in the Budget 2014 that 50,000 flat-type houses will be built in the plantation areas. We have not seen a single house built in 2014. So, if these houses had been built, I am sure, that the housing need in Miriyabedda would have been looked into and we would not have had to face a situation like this.

The Mahinda Chintana also states, I quote:

, .

It is another promise made. The first Estate Housing Ministry was created by the Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The Hon. P. Chandrasekaran was appointed as the Deputy Minister. Seven perches of land was allocated for building houses. Those people were given loans by the NHDA and also a grant. It was similar to the "Gam Udawa" Programme in the village. When a house is built in the village and when you finish paying the loan, the NHDA issues you a deed. This was promised to the estate worker also. The beneficiaries of the houses that were given in 1995 paid back the loan by 2010. Now, it is four years but they have not been issued deeds.

I raised this issue at the Consultative Committee on Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities. The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa agreed to call for a meeting of all officials to discuss and settle this issue. The Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development interferes and stops that meeting and up to now, - since August two months have passed - nothing has been done. So, obstructionists are the representatives of the people of the plantations in your Government and that has definitely hampered the progress of these people.

The Indian Government pledged 50,000 houses for the people in Sri Lanka. Out of that, 4,000 houses were pledged for the plantation areas. Today, the Government is allocating Rs. 2,000 million for housing in the next year. The Indian Government pledged Rs. 5,000 million for 4,000 houses to be built in the plantation areas in 2010. It is four years but it has not been implemented. When the High Commissioner of India was discussing this issue, I made submissions to him to create a criteria for the allocation of these 4,000 houses. I said it should not be arbitrary because some Minister will say, I will give you a list of 4,000 people. Give these houses to those 4,000 persons. I said it should be based on criteria. According to the criteria I suggested, priority should be given on the basis of greater need. I have given five points in that regard. First, those displaced by natural or accidental disasters such as landslides, floods or fires presently in temporary accommodation. Second, those identified for resettlement on the basis that their present homes being vulnerable to landslides or other natural risks and declared unsafe for living. Under this category, if the Indian housing programme was allowed to function, these houses in Miriyabedda would have been relocated and we would not have faced this disaster. Third, those living in temporary shelters on the land they occupy or newly-allotted seven perches of land. Fourth, those living in linerooms that have been identified as unfit for habitation; and fifth, those living in linerooms where more than one family is sharing a room. This is based on need. But, instead of that, when somebody wants to give houses to members of his or her own union, everything gets disturbed. That is the reason why the Indian Housing Scheme could not be implemented in the

1009 1010

plantation areas, and today we have faced a very serious disaster.

Again, like the "Mahinda Chintana I", this Budget which you may call "Mahinda Chintana III", is also a bundle of promises, which we cannot expect to be implemented. As I said, the promises made to the plantation people in 2005 have not been implemented up to date. Similarly, these 50,000 houses which were promised in 2014 and again in 2015 are never going to be implemented and you are just taking these people for a ride.

The Government has spoken about the private sector salaries for the first time. In the UNP days, whenever salary increases were given to the Public Sector, similar salary increases were recommended by the Ministry of Labour, through the Wages Boards. In 1992, at the time of privatization of plantations, there was an agreement between the then President Ranasinghe Premadasa and the then leader of the CWC, Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, that all salary increases given to the Public Sector through Budgets should also be given to the plantation workers because they were workers in State-owned plantation companies. But, this principle was thrown away in 1994.

Today, this Government says they are bringing in a minimum wage of Rs. 10,000 to the private sector. This Rs. 10,000 for plantation workers who work 25 days a month, works out to Rs. 400 per day. Today, the plantation worker's basic salary is Rs. 450. If you add the price share supplement of Rs. 30 and the incentive of Rs. 140, it is Rs. 620. The Government is bringing in a minimum wage of Rs. 400. This Government should have studied the wage structure in the private sector in the different industries. If you did look at the plantation industry, you would have realized that each worker now receives Rs. 620, and if a minimum is to be fixed, it should be higher, not lower than the present one. Now, you have fixed a minimum wage of Rs. 400 a day. Are you saying that the private sector plantation companies should reduce the wage to Rs. 400? If you make suggestions, make it positive. If you do not understand the industry, ask those who are with you, who are supposed to be trade unionists representing these workers. If they do not advise, at least ask us. We are willing to help you to understand the plantation industry and the workers of that industry.

The day before yesterday I saw on TV, His Excellency who visited Trincomalee, making a promise to the Muslim people. He said that it is the desire of every Muslim to go on a Haj pilgrimage to Mecca and that the Government will help those who do not have the means to go to Mecca, with Government funds. It is a false promise. We all know that only two thousand - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) . , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Sir, it is a falsehood. The President never said that it will be done with Government funds. He said that all the poor Muslims who have not gone to Mecca at least once in their lifetime will be sent.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Yogarajan, you may continue.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This is a false promise. Hon. Azwer knows that very well. The Hon. Fowzie is here. The Government of Saudi Arabia gives a quota of 2,800 persons to go to Mecca. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two minutes to conclude.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Only 2,800 people can go.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What you are saying is wrong.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sit down.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please be seated; let the Hon Member speak. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Only 2,800 people can go. Out of this, even now I understand that the Department of Muslim Affairs gives first priority to those who have not gone at all. There are charitable institutions which are supporting the poor Muslims to go. Today, for the Government to make a promise as if every Muslim can go, is misleading. You are trying to take advantage. If you really care for the Muslim people, you ask the Hon. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) There are millions of Muslims in this country. They can go not once, but over and over again.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Yogarajan, you may continue.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If your Government really cares for the Muslim people, give them a sense of security in this country to follow their religion. Protect the Muslim people from the extremist elements in this country so that they would feel secure and their mosques are protected.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are neither a Jaffna Tamil nor an upcountry Tamil.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Do not talk like that. I am a Sri Lankan. I have the right to speak about the Sinhala people, the Muslim people, the Tamil people or anybody who lives in this country. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon Azwer, please be seated. Hon. Yogarajan, please wind up now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Do not just get up and shout. Mr. Azwer must be sent home. If you really care, bring policies to address the issues of the Muslims without making false promises to them.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are neither a Jaffna man or an upcountry man. Whom are you representing?

So, the inquiry is very much transparent; nothing will be swept under the carpet. I can assure that to my Friend. I must also remind my Friend, who is a lawyer, that until an accused is proven guilty, he can claim innocence. That is the cardinal principle in the Penal Code. That is dispensing natural justice, and Madam, you being a lawyer, know this very well . So, I think we have to have an inquiry; that is all right. They say that there cannot be smoke without fire. But, people can create smoke without fire these days. That is what is happening everywhere, even in the universities and other places. Now, a committee has been appointed. It is a well-represented Committee. The Chief Executive of Sri Lanka Cricket, Mohan De Silva, the Secretary, Nishantha Ranatunga, the

Assistant Secretary, Hirantha Perera and the Chief National Selector, Sanath Jayasuriya have been appointed to this Committee to investigate into the allegations.

Madam Chairperson, it is very appropriate to mention in this House that women cricketers of Sri Lanka are equal to any women cricketers in the world. They have proved their mettle while playing here and even abroad. Our womens cricket team has travelled to India, Pakistan, West Indies, New Zealand, England and to several other countries had taken part in several international matches where they won many awards. I have the "Virakesari" newspaper of 25th October, 2014,

The Sri Lanka Womens Cricket Team has defeated the South African Team by seven wickets at the match that was played at the NCC last week. So, they are a clever team. My good Friend, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera wanted to play cricket with the Lady Members of Parliament. He wanted to build up a strong Lady Members Cricket Team. Annually, we play a cricket match at the Sports Ministry Grounds, Torrington Square under the guidance of the Hon. Speaker.

Our Hon. Speaker is celebrating his birthday today. So, I wish him good luck and Many Happy Returns of the Day once again, in this House.

The other day, the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake told at the IPU Committee meeting that if we are sending MPs on delegation abroad, we must send two lady MPs also. The Hon. Speaker quipped adding in a sense of humour, Oh, if there are two ladies going, two Speakers must also go. Then, I said, No, problem, Sir. I am there, so that problem will not arise.

( ) (An Hon. Member) You can send the Hon. Earl Gunasekara also. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, not at all. The Hon. Earl Gunasekara should not join such a team. Anyway, I am safe, I am innocent, because I have never been proved guilty in my life as what my good Friend, Earl Gunasekara is thinking of.

I think we have to build up the morale of these players. A cricket team, whether it is a male or a female team, they are representing Sri Lanka, motherland. We have a culture of our own. Our team is composed of members of all communities. Shashikala Siriwardena, Chamari Athapattu and others form one of the best Women Cricket Teams in the world today.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) How about having a mixed team? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is a novel idea. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, who is from the downs of the Kelani Valley is suggesting that there should be a mixed team. That is a lovely suggestion. I would like to bring to the notice of the ICC what my honourable Friend has just suggested to this House. We will tell the ICC, Our Chief Government Whip wishes to have a mixed team and therefore ICC, you must consider it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , , ,- [ ] . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . . , lawyer. I know that he will carefully play the game and I will carefully monitor; also follow suit.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) - [Interruption.] I will only give the commentaries. You will be satisfied when I give the correct commentary as far as that mixed team is concerned. Anyway, this is a novel idea and I think the ICC should consider seriously the suggestion made by our Chief Government Whip and take necessary action. There are mixed doubles in many games, in badminton, tennis, table tennis, carrom et cetera. Therefore, why do we not have a mixed cricket team of males and females? I can see our affable Deputy Secretary-General of Parliament, Mr. Neil Iddawala, nodding in favour of our suggestion.

After His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa became the President of this country, he has taken the cricket to a great height. We know, of course, our Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga brought us the World Cup.

Now, cricket is very seriously played even in the North. The first-ever Turf Wicket in the North and the East was opened yesterday. The Postal Services Deputy Minister, the Hon. Sanath Jayasuriya - he is called the Matara Mauler in cricket parlance, - Brigadier Thirunavakarasu, the Jaffna Bishop, Right Reverend (Dr.) Thomas Savundaranayagam, Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary, Nishantha Ranatunga and the Rector of St. Patrick's College, Reverend Fr. Jero Selvanayagam were seen at the newly built Turf Wicket at St Patrick's College, Jaffna, reports the "Daily News".

You know, Sir, the Sampur Village in the Trincomalee District, which was controlled by the Tigers for 30 years. We went there with the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. Some girls came and said, Sir, we see on TV girls playing cricket. Why do you not introduced that here? Cricket has developed to such a level that the North has already started started a Turf Wicket. But, I want to ask one question: "How can you play cricket in Jaffna when you hear news like this?"

The Northern Provincial Councillor, M.K. Shivajingam has said that they have bombed "Yal Devi".
