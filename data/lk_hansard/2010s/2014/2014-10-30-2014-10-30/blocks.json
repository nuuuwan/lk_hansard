If that was done, one would have seen a more cohesive, co-ordinated development programme, which could have benefited generally the vast majority of the people. What one sees instead are favours and handouts by the Head of State who happens to be also the Minister of Finance to different segments and sections of society to induce them to extend to him their support to continue to be the Head of State at the forthcoming election. It could be said that this is politics, but when in the guise of politics, democracy is sought to be subverted and values and principles of good governance are sought to be disregarded, that would be traversing a very dangerous trajectory and the country needs to be put on alert.",

This, I do think is an important Ministry though I do also think that most functions performed by this Ministry can be performed more expeditiously and efficiently and in keeping with democratic norms if they are entrusted to the provincial level. There seems to be a misconception that development must take place only through this Ministry and that too only through one person. Highways, Ports and Shipping gets Capital Expenditure of Rs. 200 billion; Education gets Rs. 17.1 billion; Higher Education gets Rs. 18.1 billion totalling to Rs. 35.2 billion for Education and Higher education; Defence and Urban Development gets Rs. 60 billion, Rs. 25 billion more than for Education and Higher Education; Highways, Ports and Shipping gets Rs. 200 billion, more than five times, almost six times the amount allocated for Education and Higher Education. Resource allocation for Education has been considered to be inadequate over a long period of time. There is a serious incongruity, a serious lack of appreciation of the importance of education to our younger generation, and a misplaced importance attached to some other activities and Ministries, which also must have been motivated by certain considerations which unfortunately are not transparent. Agriculture has been given Rs. 3.2 billion; Fisheries has been given Rs. 4.5 billion. We are an island surrounded by the sea. A substantial section of our population is dependent on agriculture and fisheries. The Government does not have a planned-out programme to promote the opportunities of our people in the fields of agriculture and fisheries which constitute the bedrock of our rural economy.",

From the point of view of infrastructure, due to the efforts of various countries in regard to the North, particularly India and other countries and other organizations, very much has been done but very much more needs to be done. While the Government has pompously participated in the inauguration of projects undertaken and accomplished at the expense of other countries and organizations, the Government's own contribution has been negligible. After the conclusion of the war my fellow Parliamentarians from the TNA and I visited over 30 villages in the Vanni, met with the people, prepared a report in regard to their needs and we met with the President and several Ministers at a meeting which had been arranged for that purpose. I first told the President that 80 per cent of the houses had been destroyed in the Vanni and that the people should be given houses. The President very frankly told me that the Government had no money to provide houses. I asked that each family be given a bicycle which could help in addressing several needs of the family but not a single bicycle was given to anybody. India came forward to provide 50,000 houses to the people in need.",

These are the Gentlemen who claim that by co-operating with the Government, they are serving the people of the North and the East, and that the Tamil National Alliance by advocating the need for an acceptable and reasonable political solution to the national question, a basic demand of the Tamil people, which had been democratically endorsed at every election held in this country at every level, is engaging in confrontational politics. I wish to ask these Gentlemen whether in the context of the manner in which the Government is treating them, as clearly demonstrated by the allocations made for the Ministries which they are in charge of and despite their hanging onto the coattails of the Government, whether they should not be withdrawing from the political scene and cease to be a hindrance to the Tamil National Alliance working out with the Government, a peaceful, honourable and an acceptable resolution of the conflict pertaining to the national question.",

Our people are not a violent people, and our people would have been extremely supportive of any peaceful resolution of this conflict, in which event all this devastation and destruction would not have taken place.

He has talked about the need for a political solution. He has insinuated that the Tamil National Alliance is not cooperating with the Government in regard to a political solution. He has also alleged that the Tamil National Alliance is responsible for the present stalemate regarding a suitable political solution. I do not think, Sir, that these statements of the President are in accordance with the true position. I do not intend to engage in a confrontation, but I do think when the President has made a statement of this nature, the truth needs to be put on record, and that, we need to respond. We are committed to the evolution of a political solution within the framework of a united and undivided Sri Lanka. It is true that there was a demand for the restoration of sovereignty of the Tamil people consequent to the enactment of the 1972 Constitution, which denied them everything and made them second class citizens. The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, ever since its inception, the date of Agreement is 29th July 1987 - the first commitment in the agreement is that the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka must be preserved. Ever since then, Sir, the demand for separation has not been pursued. It is the expectation of the vast majority of Tamil people that there will be a political solution that would enable them to live as equal citizens within a united and undivided Sri Lanka. They would much prefer and indeed want to be equal Sri Lankans rather than pursue a separatist goal. It is in this background, Sir, that I propose to analyze what the President has said in the course of his Budget Speech and all that has happened, particularly, after President Rajapaksas assumption of office for the first time in 2005.",

The Government did not attend the bilateral talks on the 17th, 18th and 19th of January, 2012. We made two efforts thereafter to recommence the talks. That failed. You tried to amend the Thirteenth Amendment. You tried to remove important provisions in the Thirteenth Amendment. That is part of this countrys Constitution. You cannot do that. We are having all this trouble in this country today, because the Soulbury Constitution of 1947 was repealed by the 1972 Constitution. All the safeguards given were removed and you did what you wanted.",

So, this is a very sad state of affairs.

When the High Commissioner of India was discussing this issue, I made submissions to him to create a criteria for the allocation of these 4,000 houses. I said it should not be arbitrary because some Minister will say, I will give you a list of 4,000 people. Give these houses to those 4,000 persons. I said it should be based on criteria. According to the criteria I suggested, priority should be given on the basis of greater need. I have given five points in that regard. First, those displaced by natural or accidental disasters such as landslides, floods or fires presently in temporary accommodation. Second, those identified for resettlement on the basis that their present homes being vulnerable to landslides or other natural risks and declared unsafe for living. Under this category, if the Indian housing programme was allowed to function, these houses in Miriyabedda would have been relocated and we would not have faced this disaster. Third, those living in temporary shelters on the land they occupy or newly-allotted seven perches of land. Fourth, those living in linerooms that have been identified as unfit for habitation; and fifth, those living in linerooms where more than one family is sharing a room. This is based on need. But, instead of that, when somebody wants to give houses to members of his or her own union, everything gets disturbed.

If you did look at the plantation industry, you would have realized that each worker now receives Rs. 620, and if a minimum is to be fixed, it should be higher, not lower than the present one. Now, you have fixed a minimum wage of Rs. 400 a day. Are you saying that the private sector plantation companies should reduce the wage to Rs. 400? If you make suggestions, make it positive.
