... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) I think I should reply the Hon. Member now, because I might not be able to do so later during the course of my speech.

You referred to some Public servants who had not reported for duty and had faced some difficulties. It is true that the Hon. Member brought these matters to our notice several times. I am thankful to him. On the basis of representations that were made by the Hon. Member, we made certain provisions for those people to report back for work. If there is any lethargic attitude from the officials of my Ministry in implementing these provisions, the Hon. Member could bring to my notice any specific instance of such lethargic attitude. I will definitely take steps to rectify that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Then, with regard to the graduates who have sent their applications before 30th April, 2012 but not been given

appointments, we will go through that and consider giving them appointments. The only thing is, they should have applied before 30th April, 2012, because our Gazette notification and the press notification mentions the date before which they should submit their applications. If the applications have been submitted before 30th April, 2012 they will be considered for appointments.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Thank you, Sir. They have applied before that date. That is, 30th April, 2012. According to the instructions given by the Ministry, all the Government Agents have collected these applications and sent them to the Ministry. If you could expedite this matter, I will be very thankful to you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) I will look into it. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera. [.. 3.17] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera - Minister of Disaster Management) , .

Madam Chairperson, there is a saying, "If you have nothing to do, do not do it here. This is exactly what my young Friend, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, is endeavouring to do today. He has nothing to do; therefore he is trying to do something. What he is actually doing is, after the horses have escaped from the stable victoriously, he is trying to mount the horses. What you are asking for today, the Government has already done. The Hon. (Dr) Amunugama explained that in a very vivid and clear form if you can understand his Sinhala.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Azwer, go into the internet and see. They have put two photographs - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please listen. They have put a photograph of the man who threw eggs at us when we went to visit the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port. - [Interruption.] The same man is in the front row of the Bodu Bala Sena meeting at Aluthgama. - [Interruption.] It is a mafia from Hambantota that is coming and spreading this all over because leadership is given by somebody from Hambantota to the Bodu Bala Sena.

You are aware that there was a meeting on Tuesday at the Kalutara Kachcheri. The Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma,

and a number of Ministers including the two Ministers from the Kalutara District were there. This Galabodaaththe Gnanasara Thero came there and said, "If you release all those who were arrested last night, I will go back and see that matters are settled". The Ministers agreed to release all of them. But, yesterday, when the President came from Bolivia, he went there and said, "I will see that everybody is arrested". What is this double talk? - [Interruption.]You are beating your chest and shouting here as a proud Muslim. I am glad you are a proud Muslim, but you did not behave like a proud Muslim when you voted for the Casino bill. - [Interruption.] So, I will stop there. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees - [Interruption.]

in this country. I must say that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Yogarajan, you may carry on.

This is not a commercial organization, Hon. Minister. Why do you make it a commercialized organization? Is it because you do not have money and you have to borrow from banks to pay gratuity to the Public servants? This is the question we are asking.

The whole question of not paying gratuity directly by the Government is because of the financial mismanagement of this country. In 2002, the UNP Government suggested that a fund be created to pay pensions. At that time, everybody said that we are trying to privatize pensions, or that we are trying to make it like EPF, where it is to be contributed by the public servants. We did not mean that. In addition to the salary, a certain amount was to be set aside as a fund, so that when you have financial crisis due to your mismanagement like today, there will be a fund from which they could draw money and pay pensions, pay gratuities. But then, it was laughed at and in 2004, it was abandoned. If we had a reserve fund today under the Department of Pensions, you would not have the difficulty of going to the so-called Treasury Secretary, who is called by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa as the ' '.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Hon. Member, I think you are wrong. In the case of having a fund, you wanted to have a contributory pension. That was suggested by the Hon. K.N. Choksy.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Not a contributory pension. It was to be contributed by the State, not by the employees.- [Interruption.] Please do not mislead. It was not to be deducted from the Public servants; it was to be contributed by the Government itself. - [Interruption.]

It was to be given by the Government itself. Hon. Minister, this is not the first time this issue has come up here. When it came up last time, and we said that you are trying to give the pension gratuity to the Public servant through the bank as a loan, you, yourself as the Minister said, What is wrong with that? You are getting the same amount of money and we are paying the interest. But, you did not disclose to this House that day, that only a certain percentage of the pension gratuity is deducted for ten years at present, but under the new scheme the whole amount will be deducted because it would be taken as a loan. This is the reason why the workers in this country, the Public servants in this country, the trade unions in this country got wound up and were planning to hold a protest to reverse this scheme.

1079 1080

Fortunately, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa and the UNP decided to bring in an Adjournment Motion today. We are thankful that you have reacted to it today and issued a new circular dated 19th June, 2014 to withdraw this scheme. So, today that issue is settled, at least, by a circular. But, when this Rs. 9 billion that is required to pay the 17,000 pensioners who are waiting for gratuity is going to be released by the Treasury that blocked it then, is the question. So, until funds are released from the Treasury and the Department of Pensions is able to release these funds to the pensioners who are awaiting their gratuity, we are not sure whether it will merely be a piece of paper or whether it will become a reality.

You may not understand, Hon. Minister, the difficulty a Public servant faces when he retires. He may have had quarters; he may have resided outside his hometown or village; he might have to relocate now; he might need to get a new house, all these issues are there. So, this is a very important matter. They want to have the money as soon as they retire. If you are going to drag it for months, it will be very unfair to these people.

There is another issue we have raised in the same Adjournment Motion. It is about the amendment to the EPF Act that was brought in 2011, which has still not been implemented. Any law passed in this country - if there is no date fixed for implementation of that law - becomes law as soon as it is signed by the Hon. Speaker. This law did not have a date for it to become effective. So, the law is in place. But, the rights that are conferred on the workers through that law are not being enjoyed by them today, because again the Treasury is standing between the Department of Labour and the worker and not allowing the funds to be released. This law stated that every worker who has membership of the EPF for more than ten years could withdraw 30 per cent of the balance remaining in his account for two purposes: one for critical illness care and the other for housing. Today, there is no Ministry of Estate Infrastructure. The Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga created the Ministry of Estate Housing, Infrastructure and Community Development, but that does not exist today. The NHDA does not bother to build new houses. They only believe in painting old houses and nothing more. - [Interruption.] No, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa is the Minister of Housing; he is only painting houses.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) As far as the houses in the estates are concerned - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) There is no such Ministry today. There is no Ministry of Estate Infrastructure anymore, Hon. Minister.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) But the Trust is there - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Trust has no funds. It had funds only for ten years given by the Government of Holland and Norway. That does not exist anymore. So, there is no way to build houses. The estate managements are saying, If you have the money, you can build a house. So, we were very keen about this law at that time thinking that when the land is given, if the worker in the estate has funds from the EPF, he could start building a house. But, today, these funds are not being released by the Treasury and the Hon. Minister of Labour and Labour Relations says that his hands are tied, and the worker is suffering. Housing for the plantation worker is kept pending.

There are 200,000 plantation workers who are still living in line rooms built 150 years or more ago by the British. The British built line rooms just to accommodate people on a temporary basis. These workers came here thinking that they would be here for two or four years and go back like our people going to the Middle-East. But, they remained here and they have become citizens of this country. So, the Government has a responsibility to provide them housing. But, you cannot provide them housing; we know that. Under the Mahinda Chintana, you said that you would build 50,000 houses in three years but only 4,000 houses have been built so far in eight years. So, it is 500 houses per year. That means, for 200,000 houses, it will take another 400 years. So, we have no faith that this Government is going to build any houses for us. We are willing to build houses ourselves with our own money in the EPF, but you are standing in the way. What is the reason? That is because you have mismanaged the economy. You have enough money to invest in the share market where you have lost Rs. 11 billion in 2013, but you are not willing to release funds for the worker to draw his own money in advance to build a house. So, this is very unfair. This Government has a responsibility to pay the monies of the workers who have contributed to the EPF. Why was the EPF brought under the Central Bank and not under the Government? That was done because it was believed that the Central Bank is an independent body and it has funds that could be secured and available to the worker at any time. But, today, that confidence has been lost and there are laws in the books which are not implemented. Today, we can go and ask the Court of Appeal to issue a writ that the law be honoured by this Government, but that will not help because the Minister of Finance and Planning, who is the President himself, is not going to release funds for the benefit of the estate workers. Today, he has no interest in them as he believes that the Tamil people will not vote for him.

Thank you, Sir.
