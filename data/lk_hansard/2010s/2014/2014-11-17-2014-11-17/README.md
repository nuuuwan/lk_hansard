REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THE HEADS OF EXPENDITURE OF MINISTRIES SELECTED FROM THE BUDGET ESTIMATES OF 2015 ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) , 2015 .

Hon. Speaker, I present the Report of the Select Committee to Discuss the Heads of Expenditure of Ministries Selected from the Budget Estimates of 2015, which was appointed by you on 23rd October, 2014.

Your Committee discussed the Heads of Expenditure relating to the 22 Ministries and the Secretariat for Special Purposes from 4th to 12th November, 2014 from 10.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.

Secretaries and officials of the above Ministries and officials of the institutions coming under these Ministries, and also the officials of the General Treasury, the Department of National Budget, the Department of National Planning and the Department of State Accounts, had been summoned for these meetings.

The practice of discussing the Annual Estimates of selected Ministries continued for the fifth time this year, after the previous occasions in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.

Your Committee wishes to reiterate that this procedure of discussing Annual Estimates at a Select Committee before the Committee Stage has proved very successful and productive as many serious and outstanding matters have been discussed at length with the relevant Ministers, key officials of the relevant Ministries, and the officials of the General Treasury and clarifications obtained and resolved at these meetings.

Your Committee appreciates the services of the Hon. Ministers to whom the subjects and functions of the above-mentioned Ministries were assigned, for their presence and contribution made during the presentation of their Ministries' progress and future plans in explaining matters to the Hon. Members and answering the issues raised.

Your Committee also wishes to place on record its appreciation for the participation and contribution made by the Members of the Committee, both from the Government and the Opposition, as well as all the Hon. Members who were present at the meetings of the Committee in discussing various matters relating to the Ministries and Institutions under the purview of each Ministry.

Your Committee also noted that, when certain Ministries were examined, key officials like Chairmen of certain Corporations, Boards and other Statutory Institutions were not present at the meetings of the Committee and their absence created disadvantages to the discussions of the Committee. Your Committee, therefore, recommends to all Secretaries that instructions be issued to all key officials like Chairmen and General Managers of all Corporations, Boards and other Statutory Institutions to be present at the meetings of the Committee when the Heads of Expenditure of their Ministries would be taken up for consideration in future.

Your Committee appreciates the contribution made by the Secretaries to the Ministries and other key officials, who were present at the meetings and thank them for making exhaustive and very informative presentations when the Heads of Expenditure of their Ministries were discussed.

Your Committee is also thankful to the officials of the General Treasury, who were present at all the meetings to

2207 2208

assist the Committee and provided the Committee and other Members with all necessary data and information. Your Committee is very much pleased to note the extremely-efficient services rendered by the Parliament Secretariat in this endeavour during this short period of time.

Your Committee states that all the deliberations that took place with the officials of the Ministries and the other Institutions were very useful, cordial and friendly and many outstanding issues could be rectified through discussions and clarifications.

Your Committee wishes to recommend to Parliament that this procedure be improved and continued in future, and it is suggested that it would be more productive if the Estimates of all Heads of Expenditure are considered by a Select Committee before the Committee Stage Discussion every year. This will provide a good forum for the Hon. Members to have matters clarified with the officials, which facility is not available in Parliament during the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget. It will also pave the way to place before the Hon. Members the progress made during the current year and the development plans for the ensuing year.

Therefore, with a view to improving this procedure, your Committee recommends that a permanent Standing Committee be appointed for this purpose, which can continue its deliberations throughout the year.

Thank you, Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, whilst thanking the Hon. Leader of the House for Chairing this Committee, I also thank all the officials and Secretaries of all Ministries.

Sir, I would like to mention that this was the brainchild of the Leader of the Opposition. He originated this process, and today, it is deemed to be a successful process in evaluating the Estimates of the respective Ministries.

Sir, firstly, I agree with the Hon. Leader of the House that there should be a continuity; that there should be a continuous Standing Committee where performances can be reviewed of what we have already done. Also, the Estimates of all the Ministries should be gone into by a Select Committee and then placed before Parliament so that there could be a meaningful debate in the House providing an opportunity for all Members of Parliament.

Secondly, I realized that the attendance of Members of Parliament to this Committee was not quite satisfactory. Let us be frank about it. There were only some Members who attended; the reason being that there was no media coverage for the Committee Meetings. So, that is important. I think we have to amend the Standing Orders

and make provision to see that the media is being brought in to report what takes place in the Committee.

Thirdly, I think the Committee should be chaired by a Member of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That is very important. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It is nothing but correct that the Opposition should chair this Committee. We have been agitating -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) But you also chaired. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I know. In your absence, I had to do it. But, that is not what I am saying. It is a question of having it permanently chaired by the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That is correct. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, let us see tomorrow because tomorrow we will be debating the Report that has been tabled.

I would like to thank the Parliament Secretariat for very efficiently putting forward the verbatim proceedings and the Report enabling Members to debate the subjects that were referred to the Committee.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ?

The sex scandal had rocked Sri Lankan cricket after recent media reports claimed that women cricketers allegedly complained of demands from certain selectors to be 'satisfied' if they wanted a spot in the team.

Reported by: Press Trust of India

Last updated on Monday, 03 November, 2014

Colombo: Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage on Monday asked Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) board to appoint an investigative committee, led by a retired female judge, to probe into allegations that officials in women's cricket administration demanded sexual bribes to give places in the national team.

In a statement issued today, Aluthgamage has ordered SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga to appoint a committee and conduct an immediate investigation into the allegations. Aluthgamage said that the allegations are derogatory and damaging the international image of the country, in addition to the damage it causes to the well-being of women's cricket in Sri Lanka.

, .. , , , , ! . . [2.51 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I rise to commend His Excellency the President on his commitment to higher education enunciated in this Budget. In principle, the Government is on the right track. New faculties are in the offing: an Engineering and Technology Faculty in the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, an Information Technology Centre in the University of Kelaniya, Advanced Medical Faculty in the University of Peradeniya and an Electronics, Petroleum and Aeronautical Engineering Faculty at the University of Moratuwa. A programme to construct hostels for 25,000 students will be embarked on an accelerated basis. The Mahapola Scholarship monthly allowance will be increased to Rs. 4,000 per student from January, thereby making higher education a reality for poor children. Incentive payments for academic and non-academic staff

will be initiated. The Minister, Hon. S.B. Dissanayake has in The Sunday Times of 28th September, 2014, stated that university intake will be increased from this years 25,000 students to Rs. 35,000 next year.

I am happy and congratulate this Government for the commitment to higher education because as experts have said, unless 8 per cent of the 18-22 year age cohort of the population is actively engaged in higher education programmes of study, there is no chance of a country reaching its development goals. In this perspective, successful economies like in Malaysia have reached this goal, while we are said to hover around 2 per cent, far behind of the 8 per cent target expressed in the UGCs Five-Year Plan. This is why I do not see the expansion of the higher education sector as progressive. If we need the support of the private sector to reach this 8 per cent target, we must all welcome that.

According to summary allocations under Head 171 pertaining to Higher Education, recurrent expenditure is going up from Rs. 19,562 billion in 2014 to Rs. 23,000 billion in 2015, which is an increase of a mere 4.9 per cent. It is insufficient to meet the new salary outlays that has to match the increased intake that the Hon. Minister has promised.

The Capital Expenditure similarly goes up from Rs. 13.244 billion in 2014 to 16.356 billion in 2015. It reflects an increase of a more commendable 23.5 per cent. But, even this increase is of a misplaced and insignificant priority for such an important subject compared to defence.

As for the allocations made for Capital Expenditure, I state that buildings do not make a university but it is people who do. I come from Jaffna where dedicated teachers in cadjan schools produced doctors and engineers before the war destroyed us through death, migration and exile. The first university in Asia was Batticotta Seminary in Vaddukoddai. It was established by American missionaries with hardly any buildings but dedicated staff. They produced what has been described by the Colonial Secretary, Sir James Emerson Tennent in his book after his visit to the Seminary in the 1850s. I quote him:

The knowledge exhibited by the pupils was astonishing and it is no exaggeration to say that in the course of instruction and in the success of the system for communicating it, the collegiate institution of Batticotta is entitled to rank with many an European University.

Sir, I, therefore, say that the initial focus of university expansion should be on the Recurrent Expenditure of our Budget. We need good lecturers who speak English and who can communicate their subject knowledge in English. It is indeed difficult for all of us, who love our own languages, to concede the greater importance of English in the context of higher education. But, without

2313 2314

2014 17

fluency in a modern language like English, we can neither read textbooks nor write scientific articles to communicate our research findings.

Therefore, while I endorse increased emoluments for our academic staff - I do not advocate simply throwing increased salaries at them - I rather advocate a well-managed programme of university governance with salary and other incentives to attract and retain truly qualified academics who will nurture our coming generations.

Sir, the key phrase is well-managed. Until we get this right, nothing will be right. Indeed, it is within our ability to get this right. A well-managed university must have a good Council and a good Vice-Chancellor. They will not give routine promotions to reward their friends but will seek truly qualified persons to join their staff. The Jaffna University Science Teachers' Association has issued a carefully thought-through document to the press to show how unqualified persons are recruited to the university and good applicants are ignored. I respectfully table* that report which appeared in the press.

This gives the entire details.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, the UGC Chairperson stated in "The Island" newspaper that an inquiry would be held if the matter is brought to their notice. The Jaffna University Science Teachers' Association then did so in writing. So far, nothing has happened. Patronage reigns supreme and the UGC has become an expert in covering up the mess. I am sure that the Vicar General of the Catholic Church, who is on the Council of the University of Jaffna will not lie. He is indeed a man of God. If asked, he surely will testify to most of the allegations made by the Jaffna University Science Teachers' Association.

I certainly blame this Government for appointing unqualified persons to Councils and appointing Associate Professors as Vice-Chancellors and Members of the University Grants Commission. In the University of Jaffna, we have trained teachers as Council Members appointed by a Tamil Minister. The lawyer, Rengan Devarajan, from EPDP is a wastrel. Being regularly in drunken stupor, he had missed several court appearances in the UK and as a result, his clients deported him. Contrary to the ethics of the profession, he had also borrowed large sums of money from his clients. These are yet to be returned. Facing disciplinary action from the British Bar Association and unable to face angry clients, he fled the UK and has now become the EPDP's Chief Legal Strategist and a Notary appointed by this Government. He had been appointed to the University of Jaffna on his return. He had missed three consecutive

meetings in a state of drunkenness, and was deemed to have vacated the post. But, that was no problem for this Government. The Tamil Minister and the UGC simply reappointed him violating the spirit of the Universities Act. Despite this record, the UGC has again dutifully issued a new appointment recently after the term of the last Council expired and since then, he has again missed meetings.

Sir, I told about the appointments to the UGC Chairperson. I had several discussions with her but all my attempts were futile. I am sure she is listening from the Officials Box now. I think, in a university which is considered the highest institution, one has to work sincerely, especially when they are in higher positions. They should not bow down to any political interference. The country as a whole will not have trust in you if this is continued, and you have been continuing with this.

There is another lawyer, Sherien Xavier, who has dinners with the Governor of the Northern Province while her family is settled in Canada. She has employed in her NGO a LTTE cadre, who has switched loyalties to this Government. She too has been reappointed to the Council of the Jaffna University. She has also been absent at the last two meetings of the Council and would be deemed to have resigned if she misses the next. Is it a sign that the Tamil Minister has run out of stooges for his Council list and is just stuffing names to keep out the many able men and women available to serve and contribute to the University of Jaffna?

Moreover, in Jaffna, we have pre-council meetings as testified by the Jaffna University Science Teachers' Association - JUSTA - where Council Members are dedicated as to how they should vote on every issue. They are even told how to vote as to who the Vice-Chancellor should be. The Vicar General of the Jaffna Diocese has been at such meetings and will not deny it as a man of God.

The UGC has a circular, the notorious Circular No. 876, which demands that recruitment to lower positions should be from the Higher Education Ministry's list. That is, even to be a peon in a university, one must be a Government supporter; all citizens cannot apply as equals. So, it is no wonder that those peons refuse to sweep the floors and keep our universities clean. Their patrons would not let them to be reprimanded. And, because the security guards from the party list would not do their work, the defence-related security firms are given lucrative contracts. State universities are hamstrung by political appointments and there is patronage from the very top to the bottom.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

2315 2316

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! A point of Order is being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. What is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Member is my good Friend. But, his reference to a personal matter of a Council Member is not fair by that person as an individual. Therefore, Hon. Member, I think it is better that you avoid making references of that nature because they are creating a great revolution in the higher education field.

Thank you. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) But, Hon. Azwer, they are not up to standard. That is why I brought this to the knowledge of the Chairman of the UGC and I mentioned the circumstances under which they live and their habits. The Chairman of the UGC and Parliament should know whether there are mistakes and it is up to Parliament to inquire into those.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) But, you were referring to some individuals. One is an owner of a press. It is not fair by them because they are unable to come here and reply to you. Therefore, it is better, I tell you, to keep up your standard. You are making a good speech, but keep up your standard.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I have told the Chairman of the UGC about these problems several times. - [Interruption.]

Sir, then the academics are blamed as if the problems can be solved only by private universities. It is demoralizing to dedicated academics, who would naturally want to leave. When our universities are used to serve political goals, how dare we speak of high principles in university education?

Sir, this Budget has rightly increased expenditures on capital outlays. But, we must, first, put right the projects we have started before we embark on new ones. The concept of affiliated university colleges of the late 1980s and early 1990s envisaged the starting and nurturing of new universities. It has seen some success. The Universities of Peradeniya, Sri Jayewardenepura and Kelaniya have grown their affiliated university colleges into full universities. But, the two notable failures of the concept are the Trincomalee Affiliated University

College, which was made the Trincomalee Campus of the Eastern University, and the Northern Province Affiliated University College, now the Vavuniya Campus of the University of Jaffna. These failures, I attribute to the authorities at the parent campuses. They use these campuses for sinecures for their senior academics. There also, it is the same patronage management. The Trincomalee Campus once had its students protesting at the UGC because the Rector was away most of each week in Colombo, getting qualified as a lawyer. The Vavuniya Campus has seen Rectors who are always from Jaffna and who do not even move residence upon appointment. They leave their families where their heart is - in Jaffna.

The staff vacancies in the Vavuniya University are always filled by graduates of the University of Jaffna and rarely by graduates of the Vavuniya University from outside Jaffna. I remember students of the Vavuniya University had been using rented houses in the town as classrooms for 18 years. They had to go behind trees in the surrounding area to relieve themselves for lack of toilets. Special allocations were made in 2005 for shifting the classes out of those houses to new buildings in Pambaimadu after stringent criticism of the Rector and Vice-Chancellor by the COPE. Today, in 2014, some progress has been made. But, the shift is still not complete. Perhaps, commissions might explain the reluctance to move out of those houses. The present Rector, without a PhD and being unable to make himself even an Associate Professor at the Jaffna University, has been sent to build up the Vavuniya Campus.

A part of the problem is that there is no separate line item in the Budget for the Vavuniya Campus. When the expenditures of the Campus are lumped under one line item, the University of Jaffna, the money is spent for Jaffna. The Hon. Minister and the UGC would not interfere because the Vice-Chancellor is their stooge, who looks after their interests.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is unfair statement. Do not call the Vice-Chancellor a stooge.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I see a pattern in this, Sir. The Government appoints weak Vice-Chancellors.

.... ( ) ( .... - ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah - Deputy Minister of Economic Development) In which university?

2317 2318

2014 17

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) The Vice-Chancellors all over the country, I think.

( ) (Hon. Members) No.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) They are beholden to the Government.

For example, consider the Vice-Chancellor of the Jaffna University, Prof. Vasanthy Arasaratnam, whose purchase of computers for the University of Jaffna, when she was Dean of the Faculty of Medicine must be described as crooked. In his letter dated 8th June, 2004, the Auditor-General queries the then Vice-Chancellor of the Jaffna University, Associate Prof. S. Mohanadas, on that. Sir, I table* that letter carrying the audit query.

Associate Professor S. Mohanadas is now in the UGC. The UGC untruthfully lists him on its website as having been a full Professor of Chemistry. However, he has never been even an Associate Professor of Chemistry, but of the less prestigious field of Agricultural Chemistry. It is a brazen attempt by this Government, through falsified websites, to hide the fact that it routinely appoints unqualified people from Jaffna to make them their dutiful servants.

The Auditor-Generals query to Associate Professor Mohanadas is about Unauthorized payment for the procurement of Computer Network Facilities to the Medical Faculty, University of Jaffna by Prof. Vasanthy Arasaratnam. The letter carrying reference number NE/JF/A/JU/2004/ 03 signed by the Assistant Auditor-General, S. Sivaguru, for the Auditor-General, states, I quote:

(a) The Dean of the Faculty of Medicine.............."

That is, Prof. Arasaratnan.

"..... has deviated from the procurement procedure and ordered ............at a total cost of Rs. 3,000,000 whereas the amount/value of procurement had been limited to a Dean of a Faculty to Rs. 100,000 only. When the availability of grants was Rs. 963,000 order was placed for Rs. 3,000,000.

b) No tender/quotation had been called .... "

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Prof. Mohanadas is a good Tamil. Are you mounting a scathing attack on a Tamil? Do you not like to have even a Tamil there? He is a Tamil gentleman. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I am telling the truth about what is happening. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) That is the truth. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, it further states, I quote:

"....the price quoted by the above company ......" That is the Delven Computer (Pvt.) Limited.

"......had been reduced to half of the original prices after negotiation made subsequently. It shows that the price had been quoted arbitrarily."

"All equipment purchased were not installed."

"Therefore the entire expenditure incurred ...............could be considered as irregular, unauthorized and fruitless.

I request the UGC Chairperson to immediately inquire into the matter and prove that Vasanthy Arasaratnams hands are clean. It is your duty.

Then, what happens? Only unaccomplished men and women are appointed as Heads of Department by the crooked and grateful appointee. This buys the gratitude of the Department Heads. It is these choices of the Vice- Chancellor for headship who are eligible to be elected Deans under the Universities Act. That also explains a man of little ability as Rector of Vavuniya. These Deans and the Rector are ex-officio members of the Council. Their appointments are done under the Universities Act by the subservient UGC through external council members. This UGC itself, as we have seen, has low-qualified members ever beholden to the Government. They pretend to have been full professors although some have never been so. They rubber-stamp for the Council the list of stooges.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who wrote that for you?

2319 2320

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) These are the trained teachers and drunkards and the occasional Vicar General, all from the list of the Minister from Jaffna through the Minister of Higher Education. This bunch then runs the university as the Council. Thus, we have a university run by stooges who will do anything to keep their posts and are safeguarded from prosecution and reappointed even when they absent themselves from meetings because of their drunkenness.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, it is very unfair to call these great academic scholars drunkards, stooges and crooks. They will call you also a crook. What is the reply? Do not speak of them like that. They are respectable academics. If there is anything, report the matter and an inquiry will be held into that. It is very, very unfair to speak of them like that. They are unable to come here and defend themselves.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Do not talk like that. They are well-experienced, respectable people.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Saravanapavan, you continue.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, in this context of patronage, I wish to raise the issue of large Sinhalese contingent of students at the University of Jaffna and its new Engineering Faculty. Even administrative appointments are beginning to be of Sinhalese. Normally such a multicultural experience would be welcomed by us as a necessary part of good education. Indeed, it is like Tamils enjoying similar experiences in the South without taking away the Sinhalese dominance in predominantly Sinhala areas. This is why we welcome cross-cultural exchanges. But, we fear that Tamil predominance in the Tamil areas will be taken away by the trend of the army poking itself in all matters including education. This is why we need independent officials and Vice-Chancellors who will

identify our aspirations and regulate our exchanges. But, when a corrupt VC is always playing the stooge for the Tamil Minister in Jaffna, the Universitys interests are badly neglected. We fear for our future.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Are you asking to close down the universities? . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) We, of the TNA, have been elected to seek greater devolution for the North and the East. We fear that even in the two provinces where we can speak our language, we are being relegated into a minority position. We need independent VCs and administrators who can wisely regulate exchanges with the other communities in Sri Lanka. We do not want VCs and administrators who will simply obey the Government to keep their positions and to get protected from due prosecution.

I, therefore, respectfully urge everyone who plays a role in managing our universities, from His Excellency the President who appoints Vice-Chancellors to the Hon. Minister of Higher Education and the UGC authorities who appoint Councils and regulate administration, to depoliticize the system and give our universities a free hand to manage their own affairsm and to first focus on getting the right people to run our universities before going for glamorous facilities. Until then, however much we may allocate for higher education, it will be money down the drain. We must have budgetary needs informed by qualified academics at the grassroots, not by patronage management.

I want the Hon. Azwer to know this. I think you are not aware of the composition of the Council. If you know the real situation, you yourself, will feel sympathy towards the Jaffna University Council. Can you imagine that there are four principals? They are just trained principals. There is one person named Mr. K. Rushanthan. He contested the Northern Provincial Council, he has no qualifications either. Then, there is Mr. Saranga Bhani, he is also a Local Government candidate. There is also Mr. Sripathi, he contested the General Election and lost; they all lost the Elections. Then, there is Mr. D. Rangan, whom I have already spoken about and Mr. Devendran, a mayoral candidate, they are all from the EPDP. One party cannot appoint them. I told that to the UGC Chairperson. You have to look around for people from various fields. It is very clearly stated in the Universities Act. Section 44 (1) (vii) of the Universities Act states, I quote:

..such number of members as is equal to the total number of members under paragraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above, increased by one. All such members shall be appointed by the Commission from among persons who have rendered distinguished service in educational, professional, commercial, industrial, scientific or administrative spheres.

Hon. Azwer, I am delivering the best for the betterment of the people of the North and the East. You must come and live there for about two to three months. Then, you will understand what is happening there. I have been in touch with the University Grants Commission, not today or yesterday, I have been there several times. But, they do not seem to listen to us. I never gave a single name to the UGC. You ask the Chairperson whether I gave names. No. But, all what I want is to appoint the right person to run the institution. That is the highest institution in Jaffna. We do not have proper Vice-Chancellors there.

You can see that the Vavuniya Campus is still a campus. It is not a university yet. They were given the opportunity to upgrade it to a university. - [Interruption.] No, it is not. You do not know the inner side of it. Hon. Azwer, you do not know. I will give you this paper. You kindly go through this paper. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) See the qualifications of the appointees. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) You ask about the qualifications of the appointees. You ask from the UGC Chairperson as to how she has appointed them and what qualifications they bear. Please ask her and compare it with the qualifications of the people of the University of Colombo, University of Jayewardenepura, University of Peradeniya and other universities in Sri Lanka. Do a study. Since you have opened this, it is better for you to do a study. - [Interruption.] He is just shouting. I am not talking anything wrong. - [Interruption.] We have not appointed them. It is their duty to identify and get the right people appointed. Just imagine, a person who had not been for three Meetings - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) T N A , ? Shall I put it to you in English? Why are you not talking about them?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I do not want to be a stooge of any TNA Member. - [Interruption.] Look here, you read this paper first and after that, you speak to me.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I have all the papers about Jaffna. Do not worry.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, there is another point to make. What I have examined is only 5.4 per cent of the total Budget allocated for education, whereas 16 per cent is allocated for defence. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) I think only 1.7 per cent is allocated for education. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) No. A total of 5.4 per cent is allocated for all three sectors: Education, Education Services and Higher Education.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) But, there are other ways of allocating money for education.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) For defence alone, 16 per cent is allocated. I am not talking of the money allocated for the UDA. - [Interruption.] No, altogether 5.4 per cent, I said.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Hon. Member, you are referring to only three Ministries. There are several other Ministries, through which funds are allocated to develop education and higher education.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Those are given under three Heads; there is no other Head.

2323 2324

( ) (An Hon. Member) What are the other Ministries?

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Yes, please name the Ministries.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development, the Ministry of Scientific Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Development et cetera. Through all those Ministries, money is given.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) And also the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, there are more matters to be explained to the Government, but due to the time factor, I wind up at this point.

[3.41 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this very important Ministry of Higher Education.

His Excellency the President has said that by the year 2020, the Government will increase the university intake to 100,000. This seems to be just a promise because over 100,000 qualify to enter universities. He wants to give hope to every student who passes the GCE (A/L) Examination and qualifies to go to the university, that he also can enter university. This is like the promise he made in Trincomalee where he said that the Government will support all those who wish to go on Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. He knows very well that only 2,800 people can go each year; that is the quota for Sri Lanka. But, just as giving a hope that any Muslim who desires can go to Mecca, he is giving the hope to every student who sits for the GCE (A/L) Examination, that he could go to university.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is totally fabricating the truth. He cannot refer to the conduct of His Excellency. That is one matter. What the President said was that all the people who have money will be sent because some people are going over and over again.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Yogarajan, you carry on with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) He gave hope to every Muslim that he can go to Mecca, which is all false because Sri Lanka is given a quota of only 2,800 persons per year. Now, you are trying to say that all 100,000 students who qualify, can go to university. But, what is happening? What is the allocation for this Ministry? It has gone up only by Rs. 2 million this year. How are you going to expand the university education to 100,000 students in six years

time? These are false promises and nothing more than a false promise. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake) , -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake) , . , , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) ? ? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake) - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Budget . . . Today, there are so many institutions in this country which are offering degrees. Of those, all are not approved by the UGC. There are some universities who come and set up what you call here. Their motive is to make money; not to give higher education to our children. But, somehow people in the middle-class, whose children cannot get into State universities, spend their own money to enroll their children in these institutions to get some type of a degree. And, because they study in English, they are ahead of the others. They get jobs. They do not come and ask you for Government jobs at the end of the period. That is good. I am not against it.

The UNP, in principle, is for private educational institutions for higher education. At the same time, do not claim that you are going to increase the number of students getting into universities to 100,000. You give the impression that the State higher educational institutes are going to give opportunities for 100,000 students to enter universities. Hon. Minister, thank you for calling the bluff of His Excellency, by saying that including the private institutions that teach up to degrees you will be creating opportunities for 100,000 students, and not only

2329 2330

2014 17

in Government universities. Thank you for clarifying that, Hon. Minister.

Now, we are talking about increasing the allocation of money for education and higher education. The university teachers went on strike for about two or three months saying that the allocation for education should be increased to 6 per cent of GDP. Today, it is 1.7 per cent for education and higher education, but even that money the Ministry of Higher Education has not utilized fully. Recently, the Auditor-General presented a Report to the Committee on Public Accounts with regard to allocation of money for higher education. It states that in 2010, Rs. 4.7 billion had been allocated; but the actual expenditure was Rs. 3.7 billion. Rs. 985 million has been saved and that is 21 per cent of the allocation. In 2011, Rs. 2.89 billion had been allocated but the utilization was only Rs. 1.04 billion. Rs. 1.845 billion had been saved. That is, 64 per cent of the money allocated to your Ministry has not been utilized in 2011. In 2012, Rs. 2.425 billion had been allocated, but the utilization was only Rs. 1.21 billion. Again, there is a saving of Rs. 1.212 billion, which is 50 per cent of the money allocated for higher education. Then, in 2013, again Rs. 3.9 billion had been allocated, but the utilization was only Rs. 2.78 billion. So, the saving is Rs. 1.11 billion, which is 29 per cent underutilization. Again, you check 2014; there is 24 per cent underutilization, so far.

So, this is how the Ministry of Higher Education is spending money, but it is promising 100,000 admissions to universities in six years time. These are all just promises to the people to mislead them into believing that you are doing a good job.

Further, at the Public Accounts Committee, another issue came up. We are receiving a large number of scholarships from friendly countries. The utilization of those scholarships is administered by the UGC. But, the number of rejects or the number of scholarships that we do not utilize is in the region of 20 per cent, which is very unfortunate. We have a lot of opportunities to go to universities here; we get a few scholarships from abroad and that is also administratively misdirected and thus students are unable to go to those institutions. As the Hon. Minister said, at least, increase the number of institutions that can provide higher education to our students.

We can see that a scheme of affiliated colleges relating to universities can be a better way to increase the number of students who can do degrees in this country. This has to be looked into by your Ministry as a policy because today, you are allowing foreign universities to come and set up small institutes. Wherever you find an upstair building today, you have a so-called "campus" of a university. This is not the university system that we have in this country. In a university system, all issues connected with thinking power of the student are enhanced. But, you have institutes, which provide some sort of training. Then, they sit for the examination held

from abroad and those examinations cost hundreds of thousands of rupees. It would be Pounds Sterling 3,000 or 4,000 or US Dollars 5,000 or 6,000 and each child has to spend about Rs. 600,000 only for registering in that university and sitting for that examination. In addition, they have to pay for the tuition in this country. You can regulate these; you can set standards.

The Hon. Minister was planning to bring in a university from Singapore, the Raffles University. That is the type of university that you must bring in, to this country and not this mushroom institutes or that are coming up as higher educational institutions. You wanted to have a proper campus in Kandy. The workers in an estate there initially objected. I thought expanding higher education is good development and I came in and spoke to them. I persuaded them to give their lands. Then, the survey was done, but the university never came up.

Hon. Minister, there is today a very deep anxiety among the people of Indian origin or you may call them up-country people. They are asking for a university in the upcountry. We have universities in almost every province. There is more than one university in some provinces. The people in the up-country think that they are a separate, distinct, racial group with a different culture, different background, different ambitions and aspirations. So, they feel that there should be a university for them. A university being established in the up-country, I am sure - you are also a former Member of Parliament from Nuwara Eliya, presently a Member of Parliament from the Kandy District and your Deputy being a Member of Parliament from the Matale District - you would not grudge this.

Give us a university in the up-country but at the same time, do not create a university that will leave the students in the up-country outside that university, to stand on the side and look at outsiders getting into that university. To avoid that, take the principle that was established long ago in the case of the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre in Hatton and the Sripada National College of Education in Patana. These two institutions were created by the CWC Leader, the late Hon. Saumyamoorthy Thondaman. He created those institutions to ensure that the children of the up-country benefited from these two institutions. The Thondaman Vocational Training Centre - TVTC - is only for the children of the plantation areas.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan. Your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will conclude with these few words, Hon. Deputy Chairman.

2331 2332

Similarly, the Sripada National College of Education admits only those who come from plantations. It is strictly for Tamil and Sinhala students, but children of plantation workers. So, whatever university you create for the upcountry people, give them priority because though the Tamil population of Indian origin in this country is in the region of 7 per cent, only 0.2 per cent enter university. That means, out of the 25,000 seats available, only 200 seats are available to the children of the up-country. So, to ensure more admission for these children, restrict admission of others to the up-country university like in the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre and the Sripada National College of Education. Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Thank you. You have taken one minute extra. The next speaker is the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan. [.. 3.55] .. ( ) ( .. - , )

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman, for giving me an opportunity to speak. As you all are aware, education is a treasure that has an inestimable value. The foundation for the future life of our younger generation is reckoned upon what sort of education they get now. If education is denied to a person, there is no future for him. So, it is our responsibility and profound duty to lay a good foundation for the endeavours of the younger generation of our country in technical, vocational and academic fields and to glimpse that they are moving towards an appreciable future.

Today, I wish to touch upon the general education policy before I go on to the subject of Higher Education because that is what is fundamental as far as education is concerned. Therefore, at this juncture, it is very important to evaluate the prevailing situation in the field of education of our country and to see the sort of importance given to education in the Budget for 2015. All the citizens living in this country are entitled to get free educational facilities; that is a fundamental right. We, who have flourished through the free education system introduced by the Mr. C.W.W. Kannangara, have the right to speak about the present plight of education.

The troubles and the difficulties that parents undergo to give the treasure of education to their children are not small or diminutive. Nowadays, we hear and read news of tragedies that mothers face and the plight of some, facing sexual bribes to get their children admitted to schools. There are certain circumstances, where some parents are even driven to commit suicide because they are unable to get admissions to schools. So, we must think over this as to why this sort of abnormal incidents take place.

Not only that, when we peruse how far school education has deteriorated, we find that many issues in respect of admission of students to schools have been referred to court. Also, we are aware as to what sort of problems cropped up in relation to question papers at examinations. What is the basic cause for all these problems? The main reason for all these problems is nothing else, but because the Government has no creative educational policy. When we draw our attention to the collapse of school education, we could see that even terms tests could not be properly held by the authorities.

2335 2336

We can go on with a number of such occurrences, the foul plays in preparing question papers for exams and incidents of leaking question papers prior to the date of examination. When the Government is inept even to conduct the school term tests appropriately, how could it take forward the national policy on education? The scarcity of teachers in schools prolongs and there is a shortage of more than 1,500 Maths teachers all over the country.

There are also situations where untrained teachers teach Mathematics in schools. So, under these circumstances, how could one expect the standard of education to be raised to a higher level? When there are qualified teachers with an eligibility to be promoted to the post of principal, teachers who move with politicians are allowed to be principals in most of the schools. As a consequence of such activities, so many schools had to be closed down. So, we are in an environment where education is totally politicized.

Today, all the Opposition parties, intellectuals and scholars, in the same way, demand that the allocation for Education be raised to 6 per cent of the national turnover. But, it is deplorable that this time too, the said demands were set aside and a sufficient allocation has not been provided for Education. In 2006, out of the total national turnover, only 2.6 per cent was allocated for education. In 2012, it was reduced to 1.86 per cent, in 2013, to 1.49 per cent and in 2014, it has been reduced further to 1.13 per cent. So, in an environment where the allocation for Education is reduced in such a way, how can we expect education to prosper?

The people of our country thought that after the war was brought to an end, the money that was spent on it would be allocated for Education. But, on the contrary, it goes the other way. Sir, in a state where education is vulnerably affected, the allocation from this Budget for Education, including Higher Education, is only Rs. 89 billion. But, even after five years have lapsed since the end of the war and when the Government proclaims that there are no threats of terrorism in this country, an amount of Rs. 285 billion has been allocated through this Budget to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development.

On the idea of the International Monetary Fund that the expenditures of the country have to be curtailed, there have been attempts to curtail the expenditures on free education and free health services. But, the income of the public does not go up or the cost of living does not come down. There is a saying that the husband is deserted having trust in the rulers. Ultimately, neither the husband nor the rulers are there for protection.

There is a trend where money is spent when admitting a child to school and on everything. There are direct and

indirect methods of recovering money for education. The admission fee for external graduate students has been increased from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 120,000. The university students have taken to the roads to struggle for their rights. On such occasions, they are even attacked with batons. Now, we are living in such an era. We never had this during the earlier regimes. Though there is an amendment to the Budget to increase the expenditures by an amount of Rs. 35.6 billion, there has not been sufficient funds allocated for Education. This is the deplorable plight. Also, the struggle continues between the Ministry of Education and the teachers as well as lecturers.

The universities of Sri Lanka have been ranked quite low in the world university rankings. The University of Colombo is ranked at 2,251, the University of Kelaniya at 4,417, the University of Ruhuna at 3,092, the Open University at 6,097 and the Eastern University at 11,930. There are no appropriate long-standing plans put forward to solve these problems, but there is temporary relief provided, aiming elections.

There had been so many benefits provided in the field of school education and standard placements in the administration for education due to the radical educational reforms introduced by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, our Leader, by 1980. Particularly, the endeavours made by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, drawing his attention to teaching English, technical studies and computer education still prevails in force in this country. The reputation as the best Minister of Education goes to him. During that period of time, the youth and the younger generation of our country were provided with encouragement through the constructive plans and performances, and energetic and competent products came forward through the National Youth Services Council.

Presently, there are large gaps between the National Schools and non-National Schools. Taking this matter into consideration, all the schools have to be brought up to a national level.

All the children start their education at the age of five and when they reach Grade 11, the percentage of school-going children decreases to 40 per cent. Thereafter, only a small number of students continue their higher education. What are the reasons for this? The main reasons for the decrease in the number of school-going children and the increase in the number of school leavers in between are that the parents have to spend a large amount of money for the higher education of their children. If we want to evade the said deterioration in the field of education, unqualified persons should not be appointed to higher positions. This cannot be followed by this Government because these days, the field of education is totally politicized. Alternatively, there must be some changes introduced to the system. That is, for

2337 2338

[ .. ]

2014 17

professional jobs, only passes in the examinations should not be made sufficient, and when the students leave schools they must be equipped with some training to enter into a profession. This is the correct students' education. Contribution of the younger generation towards the development of this country must be obtained. Then only this country would progress.

Sir, then, there are problems with regard to the salary structure and promotions of the teachers. It is known that an additional sum of Rs. 6 billion is required for solving the salary anomalies of teachers. There is no sufficient allocation made to solve this problem. In the last Year Five Scholarship Examination, in the Educational Zone of Wellawaya, out of 32 schools, not a single student of the 15 schools could pass the examination. Who has to take the responsibility for such plights in those schools? Those days, unqualified and inefficient persons who were appointed under political influence as principals were removed from their posts, and eligible and qualified persons were appointed to fill those vacancies. That is not done now. This is one reason why most of the village schools are in such a pathetic plight today. At present, there are more than 9,300 schools in our country. From the reports we could see that 40 per cent of schools have no infrastructure facilities such as water, electricity, or bathroom facilities. The Hon. Minister of Education himself has accepted that in the past, 327 schools had been closed. But, when we take the above shortages into consideration, that number will go up.

I like to place another matter before this Assembly. There must be efforts taken to encourage the rural school students in sport activities, and there must be appropriate programmes planned and sufficient funds allocated for same. The situation of the rural schools is such that they have become places of generating mental patients. But, the remedial actions are at a snail's pace. This shows that the Government has no proper plans for school activities.

When we look at the Ministry of Sports, it has become a field for corruption and frauds. I place this matter with proper proof. Recently, there was an accusation made that sexual bribe was expected from a female cricketer to join the National Cricket Team by the officers in the Ministry of Sports. When such matters are taken up for inquiry, the female players will have to face problems and undergo mental anguish. These are matters which insult and defame the female players. What is the cause for these occurrences? Are these matters suppressed? Who are responsible for these misdoings?

Hon. Deputy Chairman, today, the sports sector is fully politicized. In the past, there were news published about frauds and corruptions that took place in the Ministry of Sports. In the morning, the Votes of the Ministry of Sports were taken up. So, I just want to touch upon that at this stage. It is divulged that the relatives of persons who have the influence of politicians are taken in for filling the vacancies and bribes are expected from

them. Now, the Ministry of Sports has become a branch of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. It does not function as a Ministry serving the pubic. It is said that one of the executive officers in this Ministry, who is a lady, is exercising powers that are not vested in her.

If you take the present situation of our cricket, we have lost badly and as some Member said, we have just been whitewashed. What is the reason? We were not planned to play with India but the Ministry of Sports wanted it because they wanted to collect funds for Sri Lanka Cricket. That is the cause of it. Can we run Sri Lanka Cricket like this? We have really anguished the players and decreased their morale.

Recently, the artificial track that had been constructed expending a sum of Rs. 133 lakhs at the Sugathadasa Stadium was removed. This is how public money is wasted.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this Hon. Member is completely out of track. We are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Higher Education, not the Ministry of Sports.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) This is purposely done with the intention of getting commissions. Not only that, the Volleyball Court that had been constructed with a sum of Rs. 13 lakhs was removed within a few months. Who is there to take responsibility for all these misdoings?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) We can go on listing such mischievous activities, but as time is limited I will not deal with each and every

2339 2340

matter, I will place only a few more matters at this juncture.

There is an accusation that the persons who have influence of the supporters of the politicians and relatives of politicians are taken in for national sports. The efficient athletes who come from villages are denied of opportunities to take part in sports. Today, all the institutions affiliated to the Ministry of Sports give appointments only to the relatives of politicians and to persons who have political influences.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, please give me one more minute.

On the 14th of November, at a meeting held in the President's House, His Excellency the President had said, Attention must be focused on obtaining victories continuously in the series of sports. Is that happening today? I would like to ask from this Assembly that when we are in an era where the sports sector is fully politicized, how we can expect victories in the series?

Therefore, if we want to create a good future for the youth of our country, we have to redeem and liberate the sports and the education from politicization and afford a proper place for suitable and efficient athletes and pave theway for free and liberal education.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah. You have 12 minutes. - [Pause]. Not here. The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. - [Pause]. Not here. Then, the Hon. Mohamed Aslam. [.. 4.20]

Sir, the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka was established in 1995 at the request of Marhoom Hon. (Dr.) M.H.M. Ashraff and has grown tremendously over the last 20 years. Today, there are five faculties and around 3,500 students from all ethnic communities are studying in harmony at the university. His Excellency the President has paid direct attention to the development of this university and extends his fullest cooperation. The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education, is also very keen in developing this university as a seat of quality in higher education in Sri Lanka. The recently-established Faculty of Engineering is progressing as one of the model Engineering Faculties in the country with courses required for the job market.

Sir, the ranking of this university in the World University Rankings has progressed from 16,000 to 8,000 last year. This exemplifies the successful growth of this university and its significance locally as well as internationally. Today, many foreign students are following their courses in different streams at this university. With all this growth and achievements, the South Eastern University can establish a medical faculty so that it could become a fully-fledged university in this region. Presently, the Government is taking measures to develop the North and the East. Under that scheme, a faculty of medicine can be established at this university, so that students from all ethnic communities will be able to learn in this faculty.

Sir, the academic staff required for this medical faculty are already available in that part of the country. There are several consultants and medical officers with postgraduate qualifications. There is a Teaching Hospital in Ampara and well-established national hospitals are also found in Akkaraipattu and Kalmunai under the Central Government. A medical faculty at the South Eastern University can attract foreign students too.

Therefore, Sir, I would like to request the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education, to consider establishing a medical faculty at the South Eastern University, so that we could address the need for a higher intake of students to universities nationally, while contributing to the development of this region tremendously.

, , , . ! [5.18 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Sir, I am happy to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Higher Education and also to make some comments on the Ministry of Sports, which was discussed this morning because both, in their different ways, are very important for the development of the country. I will, for obvious reasons, concentrate on the work of the Ministry of Higher Education, but I would like to congratulate both Ministers for their imaginative approach to the subjects coming under them. With regard to Sports, the efforts of the Minister to have it incorporated formally in the school curriculum are laudable, and I can only hope he succeeds.

This was a decision of the Consultative Committee on Education, and it is a pity that those decisions have not as yet been translated into action. But, while all the reforms that are contemplated are worthy, it does make sense to proceed with what is possible, given that vested interests seem to be delaying the full fruition of Parliamentary recommendations. I hope, therefore, that with His Excellency the President also committed to making sports compulsory, the Minister will soon succeed.

This is more important because the qualities that develop through sports in particular, and also other extra-curricular activities, are essential for productive employment. Team work, leadership and other aspects of socialization are vital, and at present, opportunities to develop these are confined to children in the more popular schools. I have been shocked at the lack of extra-curricular activities in many rural schools I looked at during reconciliation meetings in Divisional Secretariats in the North and the East, and I am sure, this is true all over the island. Given that for most jobs what employers look for is not just academic attainments, but evidence of other skills, it is vital that the proposal of the Minister has an impact soon in rural areas too.

This bears on the main point I wish to make with regard to Higher Education where urgent reform is needed. The Minister and the Secretary did their best, and though the draft they prepared could have been improved, it is a great pity that the Legal Draftsmans Department ignored that draft and spent ages producing something

2359 2360

not substantially different. I suspect, Sir, that the damage done to development by the Legal Draftsmans Department, by its delays, will loom large in the future, and amongst its worst shortcomings was the delay with regard to higher education.

Significantly, the need to have thought more carefully about this came up over 50 years ago, when the whole concept of free education was popularized. Though what C.W.W. Kannangara did with his Central Schools was invaluable in extending opportunities nationwide, when the idea of Free Education was thrust upon the State Council Committee at the very end of its deliberations, there was more stress on the word Free and not enough on Education.

Characteristically, D.S. Senanayake pointed this out, in his speech to the State Council towards the end of its days. What he said then is well worth quoting at length. I quote :

Industry in this country has yet to be developed. Today Government Service is still regarded as offering the most attractive jobs. The Civil Service is today looked up to as the most attractive branch of the Government Service. But I feel that if our country is to prosper, we must recognize the fact that it is the industrialist who can prove to be of great service to the country while at the same time benefiting himself. The industrialist can be of far greater service to the country than the Civil Servant.

What we have seen recently in the absurd scheme to recruit so many graduates - who should have found employment themselves - is ample testimony to what D.S. Senanayake said long years ago.

He further stated, I quote:

We realize that 80 per cent of the people of the country, according to the estimate of the Special Committee on Education, must take to industry and agriculture. I feel therefore that any scheme of educational reform that takes no account of these factors tends to ignore the usefulness of our student population to the community in the future.

When the age-limit is revised to sixteen, what happens? We carry on with the same kind of education up to the age of sixteen, whether it is bad Sinhalese, bad Tamil or English. We would not get that bias that is required, that was expected to be given to students from eleven to sixteen. They would not get that training; and if we get any students at all, they will be students over sixteen who have been rejected everywhere. They will not have the necessary bias and will have to start all over again.

One problem he diagnosed was the failure of adequate consultation. He put that down to the unusual system that obtained under the State Council, where there was no question of Cabinet responsibility.

He further goes on to state, I quote:

The duty of making the actual proposals is entrusted to the Executive Committee concernedBut I have one little complaint to make in this regard. Although an Executive Committee does or omits to do something, the only body that is blamed for it is the

Board of Ministers. In these circumstances, one feels that it would be well if the Ministers as a body were given an opportunity of considering a report as a whole and were allowed to put forward their own proposals So far as my Ministry and I were concerned, we would have been only too happy to be associated with my good friends in evolving a scheme or discussing a scheme for discharging our duty to the large number of students who were to be placed under our care.

Unfortunately, though we have a Cabinet Government now, the norms of a Cabinet Government do not apply, and there is insufficient coordination. Thus, the need to diversify, to provide more and better vocational and technical training, and also provide degrees and opportunities for advancement in skills suitable to higher level employment, is not taken seriously.

With the cooperation also of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development, I have been able to look into the situation more closely, not only as regards the North and the East. Though there is great goodwill on all sides, we do not have systems in place to ensure swift action, and also to empower more and better service providers. Unfortunately, the efforts of the Minister of Higher Education proved abortive, while our efforts at COPE to introduce a greater sense of accountability in those now responsible for education at the universities has not been properly understood. Setting in place mechanisms to all institutions to fulfil their responsibilities to the students as well as to the country, at large, would be easy, but it requires great will and commitment.

I am grateful to the Minister and the Secretary who decided earlier this year to appoint me to an advisory position. Better late than never, I thought at the time, given my long experience of the system and education, in general. However, having now put forward a constitutional amendment to prevent Members of Parliament having any formal involvement with any Ministry, which seems important if the Doctrine of the Separation of Powers is to be upheld as best possible under this strange hybrid Constitution we have, I felt I should resign.

Besides, though my suggestions were well received, the system moves so slowly that we need more effective mechanisms, if we are to develop a system suited to the modern age and the varied talents of our students. I hope then that the Hon. Minister will try, in what time remains, to move swiftly on the excellent ideas with which he began his tenure of office.

These include the promotion of Pubic-Private Partnerships in providing educational services. This is essential if we are to increase the range of courses on offer, as well as provide better education to more people. Unfortunately, there was insufficient consultation and explanation to begin with, which allowed opponents including those within the Government who are still stuck in unthinking dogma, to claim that the plan was to do

2361 2362

away with free education. Nothing could have been further from the truth but rather what was sought was to provide education to those who now have no access to free education, and who often have to spend exorbitant amounts to obtain degrees in other countries, degrees as to which we have no monitoring capacity.

The failure to regularize the availability of paid courses within Sri Lanka put paid to our being able to encourage courses that would benefit the nation. It also prevented us from developing a scholarship scheme, which would have allowed bright students access to different forms of delivery and we were deprived of developing healthy competition that might have made the more traditional of our universities realize they had to make changes in their programmes.

I remember, Sir, when this Government seemed full of innovation and committed to pluralism, the enthusiasm of university administrators in Australia, who wished to set up courses within this country, were experts in nursing and teaching who would have done much to enhance the skills of our students. But, nothing was done to help them and we are now struggling to satisfy the need for developing expertise in these fields. Unfortunately, when we bring up the subject of pedagogical skills in the Consultative Committee, we find resistance despite the efforts of the Hon. Minister and the Secretary to get things moving.

I should note however, that there are signs of improvement, with more attention to English and soft skills, though perhaps these should be spelled out more carefully, with greater attention to training of trainers in these areas. We should also look at good practices in the past, as with the courses in thinking and self-expression developed by Oranee Jansz when she was the Co-Coordinator of the General English Language Training Programme until that was swallowed up by the universities, who then deployed the funds for capital expenditure for the most part. Indeed, they have only themselves to blame if a similar course had to be started by the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, which at least knows how to develop initiative and pride in work. The pity is that the universities are not prepared in general to learn from the best practice, their own or that of others, which is why we must hope the innovations the Hon. Minister is trying to introduce, will take root.

There is much to do in these fields, Sir, and we cannot afford to move slowly. I hope therefore, that this Ministry is not stinted of funds but that better systems of accountability will be introduced - including as I have long suggested sharing the accounts with the students who will be our best safeguards against corruption - and more effective monitoring as we have suggested in COPE to make sure that the learning process is constantly upgraded and that its products are able to serve the nation imaginatively and with a range of skills as D.S. Senanayake wanted over half a century ago. Thank you.

Sir, the article which appeared on 23rd September, 2014 on the News Line Website states, I quote:

Another 3985 motorbikes given to Govt. officers

.

Another stage of the programme of providing motorbikes as proposed in the Mahinda Chintana to increase productivity in the public service and improve the service standard of field officers has been launched, under the patronage of Economic Development

Minister Basil Rajapaksa.

Sir, the other day we went to Kilinochchi, Jaffna and Mullaitivu with His Excellency the President, and motorbikes were given to the Government Servants there too.

, . , , . . .

There are people who attend to the work of Members of Parliament including Research Officers of the Members of Parliament. They have to run from place to place. All the Research Officers of the Members of Parliament are not in Colombo. They are in various places. Some of our Members of Parliament are residing in the Madiwela Members Quarters. They have to go to their electorates and come back. In the meanwhile, these Research Officers have to go round. They may have to go to the Department of National Archives or to the Colombo Public Library. They may have to go to certain other places to do their research and help the Members of Parliament. That is the idea behind appointing Research Officers. So, they also must be provided with these motorcycles. There is another matter. You can expand this scheme, as the Hon. Member said, to the staff working here. They are also doing a good job of work.

With the aging demographic profile, Sri Lankas labour force has to be employed more efficiently to drive higher growth. Despite a progressive decline in agriculture's share of GDP to 10.8 per cent by 2013, it still continues to absorb nearly 30 per cent of the labour force. Those who have moved out of agriculture have tended to be absorbed into services accounting for over 44 per cent of the labour force in 2013.
