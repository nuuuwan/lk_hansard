The form that is going to be distributed requires various details. That data required, strictly speaking, is not essential at all. The Hon. Prime Minister or the other two speakers who spoke on this matter never explained for what reasons they want this extra information or personal data other than for an identity card. There maybe some political motivation for that or it can definitely lead to an army rule in future. Everyone must be cautious about that because we have experienced this in the North and the East. By registering ourselves at police stations,

we face a lot of agony and inconvenience. In the case of Europe, there are a number of countries where this has failed. Therefore, that is an example; you must look into this matter.

Asking for family details is an infringement of one's rights. An individual willingly giving his details is different from someone demanding details of a family. If you want to curb the underworld, devise a new system. Why do you want to treat everyone like a criminal? Really, taking fingerprints is meant for criminals. In other words, in future, the entire Sri Lankans will be declared as criminals in the eyes of the world.

Today, about two hours back, an incident has taken place in Jaffna. Some students of the Jaffna University who were trying to produce a short film - it is for an awareness programme on suicide - sponsored by me, have not only been prevented from shooting the incident, by some persons without any identity being shown, but they have been taken in for further interrogation as well. I inquired about it; I spoke to SP Asanka Karavita, the Director of the TID. Of course, naturally, he has to find out whether the persons who have taken in those students are from the TID because then only he can interfere. I spoke to DIG Rohan Dias and he told me that he will look into the matter. Sir, after my speech, I will have to go out and speak to them to find out what has happened to the students, as to what their fate is. I am told that the university lecturers are going there to speak to the students. But, how can an intelligence arm interfere in all our matters? In future, I think, when we go out to answer a call of nature in the morning, we will have to ask for permission from the intelligence agencies of this country. That is how it is in Jaffna.

No reconciliation can take place in this country with this attitude of the defence authorities. It is the work of the defence authorities and it is they who have to look into this now, into the interference of all our rights. We are deprived of our rights and now, with this electronic identity card, you are interfering with our families' rights.

Those university boys have got all the rights like any other university boys in this country. Why are they looking at those particular students from a different angle? The more you do this to them - you are painting them as Tigers or terrorists - the more trouble you ask for in future. First, cultivate yourself. I am asking the Government, the defence authorities, the Ministers, the Members of Parliament and everybody to find a proper solution; they must find out how to reconcile with the Tamil community, the Tamil-speaking people. Instead, you have people to oppose everything. Fortunately, today, nobody is here to oppose me. That is why I am speaking out my own thoughts.

Sir, how many minutes more do I have?

, . , , . , . [4.53 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am quite encouraged by the last statement made by the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala. He stated here that this project will not be implemented before the laws are amended in such a way that the Registration of Persons Act, No. 32 of 1968 - hopefully after the amendment - will allow the Government to get the biometrics required for this new electronic identity card. The question then is, why is the Government already attempting, having conducted classes for thousands upon thousands of Government employees to collect this data, without first amending the legislation? First of all, one should bring in this amendment to Parliament, get the law amended, obtain the authority from this august Assembly, and thereafter start the practical work of engaging persons to collect the information. Therefore, there is a genuine doubt created in the minds of not just the Opposition MPs, but the country at large. Obviously, there is something that the Regime is trying to hide.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Ha ha! () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) People in positions may laugh, but the fact of the matter is that the Government is attempting to collect information of the people of this country without proper authorization. That is the fact. -[Interruption]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, - [Interruption] ( ) (An Hon. Member) . . .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, you carry on.

927 928

2014 21

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Member, will you please sit down so that I can speak. The Hon. Arundika Fernando earlier mentioned that there is no compulsion that the information of other members of your family, other than the person who is being registered, need be collected. He produced a single-page photocopied document, saying that it is only voluntary. But, Sir, I will table the actual Registration Form, which not only requires the information of your family, your parents - [Interruption.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, what the Hon. Member is tabling is a sample of the form before the Act is amended. So, to say that this an actual form is incorrect because first, there have to be amendments to the Act.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, that is not a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, it is a point of Order because the Hon. Member is placing an incorrect document before this House. So, I am entitled to correct that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, you carry on. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, the form I am tabling* right now is the form that is being distributed by the Grama Seva Niladharis in the villages, in towns and in cities to collect information. So,

that is why I spoke about putting the cart before the horse.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You put the cart before the horse. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No, this is putting the cart before the horse. Who is putting the cart before the horse?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) This is the horse. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) This is the cart. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) No, this is the horse. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) This is the cart. Workshops are being held and the persons who are supposed to collect the information are being trained based on this document. So, my point is that an Hon. Member who spoke earlier was trying to say that provision of information about the family members other than the person being registered is voluntary. Not only is it not voluntary, Sir, but this very clearly shows that if a person has more than eight siblings, he needs to use another form; they have to use another form to provide information of the other siblings. So, if it is voluntary, you do not need to do that. Therefore, let me be very clear with you, certain Members are trying to mislead this House by stating incorrect information.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You have already been misled. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The other thing is, currently - ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You do not know what you are saying.

929 930

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I know what I am saying. I am giving what is in the document. The document very clearly states - let me read again - Details of Children, Name in Full, Date of Birth/ Identity Card Number. There are eight slots to fill in the information of eight children. Thereafter it states, If the number of children exceeds 8, please fill page 6-I of additional form. So, it never states that it is voluntary. If it is voluntary, the form should say, This information need not be provided if the person so desires. But, there is no such thing. Therefore, I state with absolute responsibility that not only is it not voluntary, but if a person or a family has more than eight siblings, they have to attach another form.

The issue is, who is handling this project? This is done by a company called Lanka Logistics & Technologies Limited. Apparently, it is a private company owned by the Government of Sri Lanka. I logged into the website of that company to find out who the directors are at the moment. Sir, I would like to table* some printouts of that website. Under "About Us", it states, I quote:

Lanka Logistics & Technologies Ltd. (LLTL) is an entity, fully owned by the Government of Sri Lanka, established to facilitate procurement of military hardware and services for the institutions coming under the purview of the Ministry of Defence.

The Company is also engaged in assisting in the development of the indigenous defence industry, and also facilitates projects with national security implications.

So, this has nothing to do with collecting information of citizens of this country; this company has been set up to procure defence equipment. Therefore, what is its connection? Certainly, there must be a State organization that can do this work. This is an entity, the directors of which are not officially provided in its own website. But, on a subsequent search, I found, as of 1st June, 2012, that there are three Directors by the names of Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, with one share; Dr. P.B. Jayasundera, Secretary to the Treasury, with one share and Mr. Mohan Peiris, PC, Attorney-General, Legal Adviser to the President, with one share. Then, by position, there are three other directors: the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force and the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy. Then, there is another person by the name of Mr. Jayantha Wickramasinghe, who is the CEO. So, the first three Directors I mentioned are there by name and only three people have been appointed as ex officio members.

My point is, a private company owned by the Government - I do not know who has jurisdiction over this or whether it is answerable to Parliament - has been authorized to collect information of 20.5 million people of this country, bar those who are below the age of 15. I think this is completely not in keeping with the governance that we need to maintain in this post-conflict society.

There are questions being asked as to why this information is required. I will also table*, Sir, a document which gives the state-of-the-art system used with respect to issuing electronic IDs, particularly in terms of privacy features.

I know you may not like this because it relates to the European Union. I am not asking you to follow this. What I am saying is, in the European Union, there are many countries which have implemented an electronic ID card system. But, all those countries have taken precautions not to allow the private information collected of citizens to be pried into or removed from databases without authority for various reasons, maybe, private or political or even for defence-related activities.

So, I am not saying here that an electronic ID card system is not necessary; I am not saying that. I think with modern technology, we can do more things when you have a certain amount of data available and various agencies can be linked. But, the issue is about the privacy of that data collected and the party who collects the data. I do not think the Lanka Logistics & Technologies Limited should be given the authority to collect these data. If it is answerable to Parliament, that is another matter, but this apparently is a company owned by the Government. We should ensure that this kind of information has absolute, watertight security.

Sir, I will also table** a document which gives the required documents and the procedure followed in issuing identity cards in Singapore.

We know that Singapore has had electronic ID cards for a long period of time and they have a very efficient system. Even in Singapore, the requirements are very simple. They do not ask for information about your spouse, your children, your parents and grandparents, their jobs, what they do and their ID card numbers. Those are not required.

So, the primary objective of this entire project - I will tell you and I will finish my speech with this - is not providing an ID card, but creating a database of every Sri Lankan. - - , " ". The second objective is only " ".

So, it is very clear. This has nothing to do with the efficiency of Government services provided to the citizens of this country. It is about the Government wanting information on the 20 million people who live in this country, their networks, collections and their relatives.

First of all, the Government should bring in before this House a legislation concerning the right to information so that the citizens of this country can get information on what they want from the Government. If that right to information is provided to the citizens, then the Government has, perhaps, a right to ask information from the citizens, but that also on a limited basis. Thank you.

[5.08 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am privileged to speak after the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva on this Adjournment Motion relating to electronic identity cards. Firstly, I would like to state that this Adjournment Motion is like putting the cart before the horse. One is aware that registration of persons is governed by Act, No. 32 of 1968, as amended. That Act sets out the methodology in which an identity card is obtained and Section 9 deals with the particulars which have to be given in obtaining an identity card. This Adjournment Motion, I say, is a mud-slinging exercise on the Government because it states that this process seeks to interfere with the right of privacy and it amounts to militarization.

Firstly, I would like to deal with the allegation that it violates ones privacy. As you know, there is a Statute in Parliament with regard to registration of persons and there are specific particulars that it requires. Nobody in this House is alleging that in obtaining an identity card, except the information that is required in terms of the application, that one has been asked to give additional information. So, this House is in consensus with regard to obtaining an identity card. At present, there is no requirement, as per the allegations made, for you to give additional information other than the information required in the application.

There is also another issue, that is, there is militarization. As you know, this Department falls within the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. We are fully aware that the Urban Development Authority and other institutions that come under this Ministry, under the able leadership of Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, are efficient and totally transparent. So, the country is moving towards the right direction.

Then, there was an allegation made that it violates ones privacy. My good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva showed us an application form. That application form is not a requirement to obtain an identity card now. So, I see no rationale in tabling a specimen application form before this House. One should not sling mud without having a rationale and a legal basis. I am surprised, in the first place, to see one bringing in an Adjournment Motion of this nature, because when the Government introduces electronic identity cards, there will be a need to amend Section 9 of this Act. When Section 9 is amended, all these allegations which are made can be debated because only at that time the question would arise as to whether one's privacy has been violated or not.

So, all these allegations which are thrown against the Government are baseless. I would say with a sense of responsibility that today if you want to obtain an identity card, you need not give the particulars which the Hon. Members of the Opposition pointed out.

. . , , . . , , . . . , . . . .

The Ministry of Defence and Urban Development has created a new change in this country. They have created efficiency. Today, you can obtain an identity card within 24 hours. You can obtain a passport within 24 hours. There is transparency, there is no fraud, there is no bribery and there is no corruption. We have to be thankful to the system. So, as this falls under the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, the Opposition has nothing to say or there is very little they can say about this Government. So, they try to use Adjournment

933 934

Motions of this nature to sling mud at the Government. This mud-slinging is baseless.

Also, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva said that there are certain standards which are operative in the EU. We will take whatever is good from whatever country. We will not discard good practices. We will take the good practices from any country, but we will not enter into agreements where we write a part of the country to the LTTE terrorists. The practices we adopt will protect the sovereignty of this country. We love this country; we will not succumb to foreign pressures. President Mahinda Rajapaksa successfully defeated LTTE terrorism. Certain others did not have the backbone to defeat terrorism. They gave way to foreign pressures. We are fully aware that if there had been another President at the time of the final phase of the war, we would not have won the war. He would have bent to foreign pressures and given up fighting these ruthless terrorists.

Today, in this House we have freedom, outside this House we have freedom; thanks to the defeat of terrorism. To safeguard this country from terrorism, we all know that we need an identification process, which is foolproof. I am happy that the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva admitted that we need electronic identity cards. So, he supports the Government with regard to that. The only allegation he made is that we are trying to collect information, which is against privacy. I must state to this House that when we bring in an amendment, that amendment could be debated and at that point of time, you could air your views with regard to that. The Opposition, at this point of time, is making baseless allegations saying that this Government is trying to take away the right of privacy. In addition, I would like to state with responsibility that the allegation made in this Adjournment Motion that there is militarization in this country is baseless because as we all know -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Can I ask you a question, Hon. Deputy Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Yes, you can. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Deputy Minister, I would like to ascertain your views in obtaining the services of a private company to collect this data. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) At this point of time, there is nothing to that effect; there is no information being collected. There is a requirement for the Act to be amended if the identity card requires such certain information. As always, you have been misled my dear Friend, Hon. Harsha De Silva. Also, you were referring to Lanka Logistics & Technologies Limtied. Do you know the contribution made by Lanka Logistics & Technologies Limited towards the war? Are you trying to say that Lanka Logistics & Technologies Limited has been retained to collect information? I would like you to read the Act. Section 9 of the Act specifies the form. Unless that form is amended, you cannot have an electronic identity card. Therefore, I would like to tell the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva that he should know his facts before he places them before the House. Unfortunately, - [Interruption.] You cannot; I am speaking. You have been totally misled with regard to the material you have placed before the House. I would like you to restrict yourself to the economic expertise which you possess.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Can I ask you a question? ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Yes, please. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Then, would you be so kind as to ask the people who are distributing these forms to immediately stop distributing them and also immediately stop training these people on how to collect information? If this is violating the current law of the country, you must not be engaged in violating the law.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Can I tell you, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, that there has been a workshop but forms have not been distributed.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You are violating the law. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) No, we have never violated the law. Hon. Member, there has been a workshop.- [Interruption.] No, I would like to enlighten you because other than economics, you

935 936

2014 21

do not seem to know anything else. Data collection is a very specific area. I admit that there was a workshop with regard to data collection where these aspects were discussed. However, with regard to the identity card, Section 9 of the Registration of Persons Act specifies the form. If there is a change in introducing an electronic identity card, we will have to bring in an amendment.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Yes, that is true. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Therefore, as always, the cart is before the horse. So, once we bring in the amendment we will give you a longer period of time to debate whether there is a breach of privacy or whether this has other repercussions.
