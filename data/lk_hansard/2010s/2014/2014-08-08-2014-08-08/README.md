The Householders Lists have been given out for this year. Now, some of the householders, especially the minorities, are worried whether this is officially done by the Government or someone else is doing it, because it has not got the official seal. I would like to bring this to the notice of the Chief Government Whip so that the Government could clarify it and make a media statement because some of these people are frightened as to whether this is a genuine Householders List or whether someone is attempting to get details from them for other purposes.

PRIVATE MEMBERS' MOTIONS

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) 1 , . I " " " " CREATION OF A POSITION NAMED SPECIAL PROSECUTOR [. . 2.25] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move,

That this Parliament resolves that in order to ensure the Government Service is free from political interferences, a position

named Special Prosecutor that directly reporting to this Parliament be created to institute prosecutions as soon as Independent Commissions, Committee on Public Accounts and Committee on Public Enterprises report the cases of misuse, corruption or inefficiency, affecting the efficiency of the Institutions.

Sir, I utilize the time provided for me under "Private Members Motions" to propose to this House that we have the creation of a position called Special Prosecutor in order to carry out certain functions which would be of use to the public of this country. I am happy that the Minister of Justice is here, a Minister of Justice whose justice has been deprived by his own Colleagues in the Cabinet. I am only trying to assist him in the process - [Interruption.] This is from the outside perspective of what you are facing internally.

The reason why I brought in this Motion is that over the last couple of years, there has been severe inroad into the efficacy of the judicial process. The countrys judicial structure is composed of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the District Court, the Magistrates Court and the Primary Court. Then, you also have the Courts Martial which seem to have come in as a new fashion. If you want to subvert the judicial process, to find a shortcut or a political prosecution process, there are these Courts Martial springing up like mushrooms all over and we find that that has also got embedded into the judicial system.

With the burying of the Seventeenth Amendment, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we find that erosion of the judicial process is taking place; the sense of independence that was there, which was enshrined through the incorporation of the Seventeenth Amendment, has evaporated now. Up to 2005, during the short span that the Constitutional Council had, the Government servants were able to reawaken their sense of consciousness and they were doing a duty, on behalf of the citizens of this country, with a sense of independence. But, since the burial of the Seventeenth Amendment, the first victim of that was the former Chief Justice, Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake, who herself approved it, and must be now regretting for permitting it to go forward.

You could see today that the judicial process is subjected to a lot of undue political pressure. I am not a lawyer and I do not say that I possess that knowledge as much as my Colleagues and you, Hon. Minister, but certainly from the outside perspective, there have been a lot of professionals who have come forward, and being an accountant myself, I thought it my bounden duty to bring this to the notice of Parliament and solicit the assistance of the free-thinking Members here to bring in a Special Prosecutor into the system.

I was educated just a little while ago by my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, that there was a Director of Public Prosecutions, which was in vogue then. That post was basically abolished with the changes that took place

419 420

in the early '70s. Then, you could see the interferences that came into the judiciary.

The Public Prosecutor-Generals Departments work extremely well. Hong Kong is a supreme example. In the United Kingdom, you do not need to speak about how well it works. Even in a little country like the Maldives, you could see the thriving independence of the judiciary. That is why I think that in a country like ours with a multireligious, multiracial society where political parties which come into power think "the winner takes it all", that there is a necessity to bring about a sense of discipline into the judicial system. In that process, it is generally expected of the Attorney-General to act as a trustee of public interests. But, unfortunately, today, the Attorney-General is just a paid servant of the Government; he is just a lawyer of the Government, forgetting his prime responsibilities and duties, which are far more superior to what is being carried out. So, how are we going to rectify this situation? The little step forward is, I think, by appointing a Special Prosecutor who will have a sense of independence. I am informed that the Attorney-General today is the prosecutor for both civil and criminal activities. But, if we have a Special Prosecutor, he could handle the criminal activities while the civil activities could be handled by the Attorney-General, so that there will be a sense of equilibrium. For example, if you look at the Rathupaswala situation -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You are responsible.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are responsible. - [Interruption.] Well, you can put all the sins on the UNP and you live with the open world concept. You all have the two-thirds majority, so bury it. If there is the conscience and the conviction -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Right, right. "We were responsible but you are responsible now" ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, together we have made the system a misery for our people. Let us take it that way. So, it is incumbent on us; it behoves us - do not wait for tomorrow - to make the correction, let us do it today. If everybody is at fault, then everybody should get together and provide the necessary salutary functions of being able to correct that.

, . . , . . The Attorney-General is supposed to look after the interests of the public but he himself buries the rights of the public. So, where is the recourse? Where is the redress?

, ; , , , , . . . , , . .. , , , , . The right of prescription has been endorsed twice over. Whimsically, it had been taken off at the behest of a couple of political powers.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Do you mean that these people have no titles?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The title has been forcefully taken. Prescriptive rights ensure that you are able to live on that land after 20 years and you have the right to own the land. Today, even though they have deeds, they have been bodily thrown off. The houses are broken with the UDAs machinery onslaught on the peoples, ably supported by the police and the STF, and silently burying their rights and the Attorney-General not allowing them to go forward for public prosecution.

Let us get together and ensure that we give the people what they expect of us. There is severe erosion in the political will of the country today, which is subject to test. People feel that politicians forget the innocent people who help them get elected into power until they have elections again. They keep the same ball rolling on, singing different tunes, but the act is the same.

At this particular moment, I suggest that we appoint a Special Prosecutor to help the country where there is corruption from top to bottom, not bottom to top. The billions of rupees are at the top and the cents are at the bottom. The sharks are let free and the innocent sprats get caught. Let us ensure that a sense of justice is brought into this country which it is eroded. Today, people are unable to live with a sense of decency and without fear. They live with extreme fear because there is no way they can go to the police. It is Sri Lanka Freedom Partys security office. You go to the courts, you do not know what way the Attorney-General will respond and you do not know how the judicial system will function. So, let us bring in a Special Prosecutor to institute prosecutions in cases of misuse, corruption or inefficiency reported by the Independent Commissions, Committee on Public Accounts and Committee on Public Enterprises.

Therefore, I call upon all Members across the Divide to get together and ensure that this Private Members Motion is passed so that the Minister of Justice can take it to the Cabinet and the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara can ably support to get it enshrined in the Constitution.

Thank you very much. [.. 2.41]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) According to the Seventeenth Amendment, the power of nomination did not lie with the President. This was a problem with the Seventeenth Amendment because it confused two Constitutional traditions and allowed the power of nomination to be with the so-called Council and the President was reduced to a rubber stamp. This is why that Seventeenth Amendment was not known in any political dispensation in the world. The Hon. Member is correct in suggesting that on a Presidential system it is appropriate, when the President makes a nomination, to have a system of either advice or advice and consent. The Eighteenth Amendment makes that provision for advice to be given but because of the carelessness with which the Opposition treats its responsibilities in not attending the Parliamentary Council, no advice was given.

[3.20 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committes for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Motion.

Let me first take the opportunity to congratulate the Member who spoke just before me. It was a very polished speech and I hope his efforts to promote cooperation will work. I should add that I regret the absence of his Predecessor, who resigned a few days ago. He, as a Member of the Young Parliamentary Leaders' Forum, together with several Colleagues on both sides of the House, had to intervene in favour of pluralism and in particular, the statement they issued after the incidents at Alutgama is a lesson to all of us older people. I am sorry that their efforts to set up a Youth Forum of Parliamentarians has been shot down by those who do not have the same enthusiasm and commitment to pluralism. But, I hope very much that our Minister of National Languages and Social Integration, will take the lead in encouraging these young people to work actively together to promote a culture of pluralism. I am also particularly pleased to state, while regretting the absence of the former Member, that the new Member who represents the Indian Tamil Community, requires a lot more active intervention in order to promote equity.

I would also like to congratulate the speaker who spoke before him on the rigour he brought to bear on the responsibilities that officials should exercise. He is correct, as he pointed out, that the President can nominate persons to particular individual positions and that under the Seventeenth Amendment, these had to be approved by the Constitutional Council. But, the biggest problem with the Constitutional Council was that it also had provision for that Council to make nominations with the President left in the position of being a rubber stamp. As we know it happened with the Elections Commission, when the President refused to be a rubber stamp, we were left without an Elections Commission. That particular provision, I think, was a mistake because it confused two Constitutional dispensations. It was one of the major flaws in the Seventeenth Amendment which is why that Amendment had to be changed.

The Eighteenth Amendment was not ideal but it did introduce the principle which had not existed from 1978 onwards until 2001 of limiting the absolute power of the President to make appointments. I think we are all in agreement on both sides of the House that that absolute power is a mistake and it needs modification, but in different dispensations you either have a provision for advice, or for advice and consent. Even though it would be better to have consent, it is regrettable that the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment asking for

observations have not been followed. It is extremely regrettable and I wish the Hon. Member had applied the same rigour to the antics of Members of his own party that the provision under the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution has been breached. I quote from Article 41A (1) of the Constitution, it states:

"In making such appointments, the President shall seek the observations of a Parliamentary Council.....

Unfortunately, that Parliamentary Council does not function because the Opposition boycotts it. The Hon. Member pointed out that perhaps had there been a veto opportunity, the present Chief Justice might not have been appointed; the same would have gone to the previous Chief Justice because the Opposition came out with sharp criticism of her after she was appointed but had failed to make those observations at the Parliamentary Council.

I regret very much that the National List Member from the TNA refused nomination to the Parliamentary Council on the grounds that he thought it did not have veto power. Unfortunately, the Members of the Opposition accepted the appointment and then did not fulfil their duties. I think the Opposition should actually bring them to book for this failure to perform their responsibilities. I also regret that the amendments to the Standing Orders that I have proposed have not been supported by the Opposition because many of the provisions would resolve some of the lack of power at the moment in Parliament which the Opposition bewails, but has done nothing whatsoever to correct.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, may I suggest that instead of moving Private Members' Motions which everyone knows are put forward on a Friday to an empty House - I think we have only about six Members or even fewer here and I think it is perhaps a blessing that no one thinks of getting up to ask for a Quorum - it would be much more useful if Members applied the powers Parliament has and moved more rigorously for amendments in the form of bills and also amendments to the Standing Orders. I think the Parliamentary Select Committee has had some very good ideas put before it. I am very sorry that they have not issued an interim report because such an interim report might have encouraged the Members of the Opposition to join in the deliberations of that Committee. But, I am very glad that at least one of those ideas is now before the House in the form of a Motion and I hope it comes before the House very quickly because measures such as reducing the size of the Cabinet and instituting electoral reform are measures that the whole country would agree with and it is high time the Opposition supported such measures instead of simply complaining without doing their duty as well.

Thank you, Sir.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was stating in reply to the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, what is important for us to realize is that the actual essence of this Motion relates to an appointment of a Special Prosecutor to attend to matters which call for institution of prosecution arising from findings of several Committees of this House.

441 442

[ . ]

2014 08

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, in his haste to take some pot shots at people like us - now I have become a very favourite punching bag for the Opposition and since they have no other punching bags available in the House today - ridiculed me regarding the functions of my Ministry and the issue relating to independence of the Judiciary in the country.

To be more relevant to the subject, I would say that I welcome this particular Motion and the appointment of a Special Prosecutor since this is something that we have always been talking about. As a matter of fact, I have twice been the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in this House. I must say that both oversight Committees, the Public Accounts Committee and the Committee on Public Enterprises, which are the most important Committees of the House, have produced voluminous reports which have not been pursued satisfactorily. Once a Report by the Chairman of a Committee is submitted to the House, it becomes the property of this House and it is incumbent upon the Hon. Speaker to pursue action thereon. This is a matter that we must, as Members on both sides of the divide, be aware of and should try and impress upon the Hon. Speaker that he must pro bono take upon himself this task of initiating action on findings of the reports that have been submitted to him, particularly, reports submitted by the Public Accounts Committee and the Committee on Public Enterprises.

In some instances, matters are followed up. When I was the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I had the difficult task of investigating the biggest fraud in the Public Sector in this country. That was in the Inland Revenue Department. The amount that was supposed to have been siphoned off was about Rs. 4,000 million, but in my assumption, it could have been even higher, but we could not find documents to substantiate the rest of the amounts. Yet, we were able to produce a very thick report on the largest Public Sector fraud that took place in the country.

As a consequence of that, the Criminal Investigation Department and the Attorney Generals Department were able to file indictment against the accused. Some of them have fled the country. Recently, the High Court had convicted the main accused to prison and convictions have been entered. There, I must say that the former Auditor-General, Mr. Mayadunne, assisted the Committee in order for us to produce that voluminous report and the present Secretary to the Cabinet, Mr. Sumith Abeysinghe, was also attending several meetings of the Committee on Public Accounts in order to assist the investigation or the probe that we undertook.

Similarly, I find my Cabinet Colleague, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara, is grabbing headlines everyday in the newspapers with his incisive reports, but of course, the credit must go to all Members of the Committee on Public Enterprises. The probity of the Members is such that

finally a very worthwhile report regarding the functionings of the public enterprises in this country is exposed and through which, what I am trying to say is that, for it to be more meaningful, it would be helpful if such an office is created. Of course, we all agree that the only member who spoke with some relevance to the topic was the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, another Member who makes very worthwhile contributions. He, in fact, spoke at least relevant to the topic to a certain extent where this matter was pointed out. Surely the Attorney-General, being the Chief Legal Officer of the State, is bound to take notice of these reports and upon the reports being referred to him for action. I am sure the Hon. Speaker can initiate that action and he could take upon himself or we could even consider assigning a senior official for the Attorney-Generals Department to exclusively work with Parliament on matters pertaining to prosecutions that may arise out of the reports that are submitted to the House, because it becomes a property of the House and it is incumbent upon the Hon. Speaker to initiate action thereon. This is from the little bit of parliamentary experience I have. I felt that this would be a better way to pursue provided there is agreement and the Hon. Speaker takes upon himself this task of initiating action.

Sir, I do not want to speak at length on this issue though several other comments were made which were extraneous to the subject, which did not deal with the subject. Dealing with the Seventeenth Amendment, my Colleague the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha spoke about that from his own perspective.

The reintroduction of the Seventeenth Amendment is something that is now a matter of Public debate and it is being spoken about very much in the Public domain. So, this is something that we could always discuss and the House can take cognizance of it, perhaps, look at ways and means of reintroducing some of the good features of the Seventeenth Amendment so that we can strengthen good governance in this country. That is a personal remark from me because several allegations were made that we were also complicit in abolishing the Seventeenth Amendment and by introducing the Eighteenth Amendment, matters pertaining to good governance and erosion of principles of good governance was focused upon by the Opposition Members. But, beyond that, I do not want to say anything else except that the Motion itself has some resonance that it is important for us to look at ways and means of initiating action based on exposures that are brought out pertaining to Public sector mismanagement, corruption and similar matters, which would require some penal sanction to be visited on those who are responsible to be managing public finance. After all, Parliament is the main watchdog over public finance and therefore, this is a matter that should receive the attention of the Speaker and the House. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, with those comments, I conclude my response.

Thank you.

443 444

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, do you want to say anything? I can give you five minutes.

[3.52 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for giving me this opportunity. I appreciate the comments made by the Hon Minister of Justice. I also thank the Members for contributing their best in order to get this moving forward. Sir, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem has become the punching bag owing to his own actions. I mean, when he gets punched, he should know as to why he is getting punched. He was with us fighting against this terrific Presidential system with Mahinda Rajapaksa saying that it is one of the brutal elements in the system and then he departed us and joined them. Now, he defends them. I do not understand the logic in this and the sense of justice that prevails in it.

( ) (An Hon. Member) A man for all seasons! ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) A man for all seasons! It does not matter. Before too long, we will be back together but there is a duty that behoves us on the people. We, in this Parliament, being here for 20 years, have gone through many matters in the COPE and the Public Accounts Committee and wasting public money. At the end of the day, we found that promotions were given to people whom we, in the COPE, found to be corrupt.

Look at Mihin Lanka. Five years ago, we basically said that that was an institution which was redundant. I am happy that the present Chairman of the COPE, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara has said that it should be amalgamated with the SriLankan Airlines. When we basically said that it should not have been incorporated, in 24 hours the company was brought into existence; the COPE gave the report. What happened? Instead of indicting the person responsible, he came into Parliament. What more can you have? We mentioned these. The SriLankan Airlines is losing in billions. We basically said what needs to be done, but nothing happened with that; only more money was given. After the COPE Report said that this needs to be corrected, Hon. Minister of Justice, your Cabinet allocated money to the SriLankan Airlines, a bottomless pit. When the COPE asks you to do some rectifications, you ignore that. That is why there is a necessity to create the position that I addressed. Otherwise, we will be just wasting our time doing these.

Look at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Our present Speaker made a valiant effort in trying to clean it up. At the end of the day, the COPE gave a damning report. He was removed from his portfolio and was made the Speaker in the House. Sir, we need to have a sense of fair play to go on.

This morning, I was at the Consultative Committee on External Affairs. There, we talked about the LLRC Report, which recommends bringing back the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and which was also one of the reasons why the EU told Sri Lanka, If you want the Labour GSP to go on, please ensure that you bring back the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution as opposed to what you have done with the Eighteenth Amendment". The officials of the Ministry of External Affairs had the audacity to say that there was no necessity for the Labour GSP because the Government does not need money. They lost US Dollars 1.6 billion in the year 2012. They will lose US Dollars 2 billion in 2014. If a Government servant believes that US Dollars 2 billion could be just lost out by having the Eighteenth Amendment instead of the Seventeenth Amendment, the country has to pay a price for that. So, these are matters that go on. I do not want to labour on the same points that were mentioned. There are no political points to be scored by one Member against another. But, at the end of the day, we need to ensure that matters are put into place.

I would like to talk about the justice system with regard to one case. About 12 years ago, O.V. Samantha was killed in the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. It was found to be a politically-conspired murder. Now, the Attorney-Generals Department is coming back to the deceaseds family and asking, Is it possible for you to ensure that the death penalty is taken away and to ask to be compensated for that? His brother came crying to my house and told me that. I am quoting Case No. 3748

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

in the High Court. This is what the Attorney-Generals Department is trying to do; instead of providing justice, they are trying to commercialize that. At whose behest? So, Hon. Minister, what has gone is gone, but let us ensure that we get matters moving forward positively.

We have found many corruptions going on, which are intolerable and cannot be condoned. You mentioned that I looked light-hearted today. All I want to do is to ensure that -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, my point of Order is, the Hon. Member referred to a particular case. I do not know the nature of the case or what the case was. But, pending cases to be mentioned in the House is against the Standing Orders. Therefore, I request that it be expunged.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) O.V. Samantha's brother came to my house and said, This is what is being done; this is what is being told in order to compound the case. You cannot kill a person and say, Come and take some financial benefit for that. This is what is happening in the Colombo District, even in our Electorate, in Colombo North, not to mention Colombo East.

All I want to do is to ensure that we get together and create this position of "Special Prosecutor". You are in the Cabinet, Hon. Minister. So, please ensure that a Cabinet decision is taken on that and you go forward with it. As Members of the Opposition, we have limits in doing certain things. If we can ensure that this is incorporated into the legal system, yes we will do it. But, we cannot do that. Before too long, we will definitely do that. So, please ensure that you take this matter up. I am sure the House will endorse it. So, get together, get approval from the Cabinet and put it back to the House, saying, Here it is. Then, we will be able to move forward.

So, I thank all the Members for making this a very interesting Private Members ' Motion. I hope this will come to a conclusion by getting the Cabinet endorsement and then bringing into place a Special Prosecutor, who will be able to take necessary action on matters reported by Parliament. Thank you.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

[..4.31] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) , . , . , . . , . .

Sir, I am pleased to respond to this Motion on the need to have some proper laws and regulations to ensure the welfare of pets and animals in the country, which are reared domestically and also which are considered to be stray animals, to give some type of protection by legislating on their behalf. This is something that we, Members of Parliament, may consider as a very trivial matter. Extending care towards animals is something that has been enunciated in all great religions of the world. This is a country which has a majority of Buddhists.

455 456

Buddhism is a philosophy which talks about the need to extend kindness to animals. Therefore, as a nation, we have to focus on the need to strengthen our existing legal framework to give protection to the animals in this country.

One particular legislation that comes to my mind is the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance, which had been enacted way back in 1907. That, perhaps, is the most prominent legislation that addresses certain aspects of animal welfare. Though there were some discussions in order to amend this legislation, efforts had not been pursued. Several representations had also been made from different sectors. I am also aware that the Law Commission too had embarked on some revision of this Ordinance which was prepared during the colonial period way back in 1907. So, it has to be looked at from a modern perspective and certain amendments are needed to be introduced.

Then, there are several animal welfare groups in the country which have been agitating and highlighting the need to bring in new legislation to address issues in relation to the welfare of animals. If we take the private sector, the owner of the ODEL department store, Otara Gunewardene, is a champion of stray dogs. She has set up an organization known as Embark. I have seen T-shirts being sold at the ODEL department store and the proceeds or the income of all those are being directed towards welfare of stray dogs. I see her appearing very often in newspapers promoting the welfare of stray dogs.

Here, certain important suggestions have been made by the Hon. Buddika Pathirana and I am sure that we need to look at those suggestions and try and do what best we could in order to uplift the care of pet animals that have been referred to. Then, he also made a very interesting suggestion. , . . .

We have an Ordinance that has been enacted way back in the colonial period called the Vagrants Ordinance. The Vagrants Ordinance has sometimes been abused in its application because that has been used most of the time to arrest prostitutes and other socially undesirable elements who occupy the common space in the country, in our roads. So, this Vagrants Ordinance too, in fact, has been looked at very carefully and there have been certain representations made, particularly the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha who has been a champion of this cause wanted us to revisit the Vagrants Ordinance and have it abolished because that has been applied in the breach totally against the very purpose for which it was enacted. That was his contention and subsequent to his appeals, in fact, we had asked even the Law Commission to revisit the Ordinance

and to our surprise we found that the Police Department has been quite keen to have this Vagrants Ordinance strengthened further so that it will help them in law enforcement and to maintain law and order in the country. So, that is an interesting perspective that we had when we discussed the need to have the Vagrants Ordinance in our statute book.

Having said that, I must say that there are certain other issues. In addition to the provisions that we would introduce for the welfare of pets and animals, there need to be more care and a practical approach to provisions relating to the transport of animals. Sometimes the conditions in which animals are transported are so inhumane, - I mean, it would rather be wrong to use the word "inhumane" but then, when it applies to the animals - that it has become a common practice today for our Police Department to arrest people who transport animals in excess of the number which is normally permitted to be carried in a particular vehicle. Then, the use of live animals for experimental and teaching purposes is another area where we need to focus to see that there should be some regulations regarding that.

Then, the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana also talked about the regulations for the sale of animals as pets and that is what the Private Members' Motion today has focused upon. I would rather say that there must be a procedure adopted to keep pet shops because I do not think that these pet shops have a proper licensing arrangement. A licensing arrangement has to be put in place through legislation, so that the pet shops which have sprung up in different parts of the country could be regulated and the welfare of pets, birds and other live animals, could be attended to and the danger of certain types of diseases spreading among animals that you rear can also be prevented to some extent. We have had several instances of poultry diseases spreading and therefore that too has to be focused upon.

Then, when you mean an animal, when you look at the definition of an animal, you can have a domestic animal, a farm animal, an animal in captivity, a wild animal, a companion animal which is most of the time, a dog, a cat or a stray animal.

Then, there is also a category called "food animal". The "food animal" is defined as an animal whose flesh is consumed as food by humans. Then, there is the issue of abattoirs. Abattoirs are set up by local authorities. The hygienic condition with the necessary freezing capacity in the abattoirs is something that has to be regulated properly in the country. Of course, the Ministry of Environment also needs to look at issues pertaining to tanneries and the by-products of animal slaughter. The slaughter houses need to be environmentally sustainable when you set up them and it is another issue that has to be focused upon when you look at the wider aspect of animal welfare and protecting live animals.

457 458

2014 08

So, I would say that the Motion presented by the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana is something very novel and unique, since most of us, the Members, hardly focus on such issues concerning those animals who have no way of bringing their grievances to be focused in an esteemed House of this nature. Therefore, this issue should receive some attention. Sir, sometime back when the Hon. Thondaman was Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development, he attempted to bring in an bill relating to animal welfare and it has now fallen by the wayside. These are issues need to be addressed in its totality so that the particular focus on pet animals which the Hon. Member referred to would also be brought into the ambit of these legislations.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committee, I move,

"That this Parliament resolves that the traditional industries which have been dwindling in the Ampara District such as handloom, pottery, palmyrah and reed products i.e. boxes, plates and mats, coir products and cane products be developed and thereby the livelihood opportunities of the people be created in order to have their income increased".

Sir, I table* the Sinhala and the Tamil versions of this Motion to be included in Hansard as part of my speech.

Sir, today, under the enlightened leadership of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, a large stride is being made in order to uplift the traditional industries all around the country. Although I have particularly mentioned about the Ampara District in the Eastern Province, I think I should expand it to cover all the traditional industries in the entire island.

Sir, from the time of the Britishers, the salt industry was run by the Government. There was a special Ordinance in this regard. No private party was allowed to involve in this. When I was a Minister and also in charge of the Puttalam electorate, I moved a Motion in the Government group as to how this works. At that time President R. Premadasa was there and I tod him, "Sir, the people there are unable to get an income out of the salt that is produced in their own soil". He asked, "Why?" I said, "Sir, because there is a British Gazette Ordinance which states that private parties cannot handle this." At that time the was the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. He said it is not possible to do that because of this particular Gazette Notification and the British Ordinance. The President then said, Damn with it! Azwer, go before media and tell that I have given an order that from today onwards the private people can engage in the salt trade." That is how this problem was solved and the production and sale of salt was given to private people. Our President today is also taking such advanced steps in order to give a good livelihood to the people in rural areas.

Sir, I must place on record the appreciation of the House for the Hon. Douglas Devananda. He is the guardian of, I should say, .

I also want to mention that towards the development of handicrafts and giving a proper livelihood for the rural folk, there was a great man who worked. He was Dr. Ananda P. Guruge. Today, he is no more, Sir. On a flight to the States, he had breathed his last and on Sunday his body will be interred at Westminster in London. He was the translator of the Mahawamsa into English. He was a former ambassador, a great scholar and an accredited academist of the Sri Lankan community. I remember very well that he used to visit our Principal when we were studying at Zahira College. He had regular interactions with the late A.M.A. Azeez - like Vipulananda Adigal. We express our condolences on the passing away of Dr. Guruge.

Dr. A.M. A. Azeez was born in Jaffna. As I said yesterday in this House, he was one of the greatest scholars and a Senator. Dr. A.M.A. Azeez wrote "The West Re-appraised" and its second edition was republished on 4th October, 2011 by the Azeez Foundation. It was well-edited by S.H.M. Jameel and Ali Azeez. Sir, incidentally, the first edition - note this - was dedicated to the memory of the Hon. (Dr.) W.A. de Silva. Dr. A.M.A. Azeez was such a broad-minded personality. He was a man of all communities. He was national-minded and dedicated the book to that great patriot, Hon. (Dr.) W.A. de Silva.

Sir, I also have a magazine in my hand, "Thingal".

'' , . . . . .

Sir, pottery in Sri Lanka has also got to be developed. The art of woodcarving is also very important. Handicraft and woodcarving in Sri Lanka has a long history. The

tradition of woodcarving in Sri Lanka is manifested at Lankatilaka Temple and Embekke Devalaya in Kandy.

. . .

Then, Sir, metalwork in Sri Lanka; in Mahara Electorate, people are engaged in this metal industry and that is their livelihood.

Then, brass castings, metal cutwork, lacquerwork and batik - as I have already told you- handloom textile, mat weaving, reed and rush industry in Sri Lanka. We must help them to develop these industries.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will finish, Sir. When Queen Elizabeth visited India - She came to South India - there was a great leader called "Quaide-e-Millat" Muhammed Ismail Sahib, President of the All India Muslim League. There is a village in the Tinnelvelly District called Pettai. I have visited this village with my good friend and classmate, M.S.M. Nizar. He is from Campbellabad. Today, they are making certain mats which are very fine and soft. The Queen was able to fold it and carry it in her hand.

. . , , . . . ; . . [5.39 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Hon. Deputy Speaker, since I happen to be the only Minister in the House, the responsibility has fallen on my shoulders to reply to the Motion that was moved by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

. , . .

, . . . . , . . , . , .

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the whole issue of promoting local industries depends on some protective tariff barriers. All the developed countries have developed their own local industries through protectionism, but unfortunately, with the advent of the open economy, we have gradually moved away from protecting our industries. Though we have on and off introduced certain protective levies and Customs' duties in order to protect local industries, that has been so sporadic, it has never been consistent. Different governments have adopted different policies at different times and ultimately local industries had to face total extinction when it came to developing their expertise or developing their produce to

473 474

[ . ]

2014 08

compete not only in the local market, but even with the international market.

I have one particular experience. When I was the Minister of Ports Development, Shipping, Eastern Development and Muslim Religious Affairs in a former regime of the party which is led by the Hon. Ajith P. Pereras Leader, I had the opportunity of inspecting the handloom industry in the Eastern Province and I found that certain villagers had been specializing in this handloom industry which had been their cottage industry. When we looked at ways to develop the cottage industry, we found that it was already a devolved subject and the Provincial Council itself was not operational at that time. Of course, now we have the Eastern Provincial Council and in fact the subject Minister, Mr. Nazeer Ahamed, belongs to my party.

Since, the Provincial Council was not in operation at that time, we were able to get the Department of Rural Industries Development to focus on improving this particular rural industry, which is the handloom industry. There, one important shortcoming that we noticed was that to develop new designs, we had to look for master weavers. Now, this "master weavers" category has become an extinct category in this country. But, of course, our great neighbour, India, has enough expertise in this. They have developed it to such a level that master weavers are available in that country. In fact, I made a request to the Indian High Commissioner to assist us with some master weavers, so that we can improve the handloom industry here because what is necessary for us is to develop designs.

. . .

. , .

, , . . , . . . .

There are difficulties in obtaining copper for this purpose. In fact, there have been several discussions even in the Cabinet to ban the export of copper wire from the country because there are various dealers who deal with

scrap iron, who buy copper-based raw materials, which are found in various wires and various other equipment and then they try and sell it as scrap metal abroad. That has been banned by a Cabinet decision purely to support the local copper industry to develop. Therefore, there are several measures that we have to take. What is more important is to have sufficient tariff barriers created to prevent any harm to the local industries. In this regard, that has been one feature which has not been addressed and which has affected some of the local industries in the past in signing free trade agreements. We had been a little too generous and not been looking at protecting our local industries because of which some of our local industries got affected. But, subsequently, that issue was addressed at joint commission meetings with different countries. The Ministry of Co-operatives and Internal Trade and Commerce has taken up these issues and they have tried to incorporate the necessary tariff in order to support the local industries to grow.

Therefore, there are several measures that have got to be taken. Since the Ministry of Economic Development is concentrating on some of these issues, some new measures have been taken, but yet, more could be done. I am sure the purpose of the Motion moved by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer would be better served if we can have a separate banking network established to support the local industries alone, because there are so many different development banks being set up. Then, the necessary seed capital which is not required in large amounts as for bigger industries, could be given. These are local cottage industries for which a small seed capital of even Rs. 50,000 or Rs. 100,000 is needed but it goes a long way in assisting the households which have got the expertise to develop these industries and it is time that we focus on this matter. Therefore, I welcome the Hon. Azwers Motion and say that it would receive all the necessary attention from the Government.

Thank you. [5.50 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

I thank the Hon. (Ms.) Kamala Ranathunga, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, and the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Minister of Justice very much for giving me encouragement in bringing this Motion and also for advocating the policy of developing cottage industries. Sir, there is a person called Mawanelle Somapala in Mederigama, Mawanella. He is making the country proud by making necklaces out of natural coconut fibre. I think the Kapruka published by the Lake House is a very important magazine in all three languages. It is very interesting to note. "Kapruka" of 08th August, 2014 states,

475 476

I quote:

Among the decorative artistic ornaments created from the coconut palm, coconut fiber creations take the pride of place. You may have not heard of ladies ornaments made out of coconut fiber before, there is a huge demand in the world market for them.

Nobody knew this earlier. It further states, I quote:

Because of that, at present, there is a massive demand for rings, necklaces, ear rings, waist chains, hair ornaments and buttons for womens garments. But, the ladies ornaments in the market are not 100% created from coconut fiber.

Sir, there are the hidden talents in the community all over. The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara, Minister of Coconut Development will encourage this type of cottage industries.

Then, there is also another rural industry in Radawadunna, the cane manufacturing industry. Cane is naturally grown in Sri Lanka and cane work is practised in Sri Lanka since ancient times in Radawadunna, near Pasyala. The Kandy road is famous for that.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, you have got only one more minute. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Can I have another five more minutes? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, there is another Motion to be taken up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay. I would like to say that the industry of batik and musical instruments is also very important and they must be allowed to develop in this country.

Sir, lace making was first introduced to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese in the 16th century. Practised by the Dutch ladies during the Dutch colonial era, Sinhalese ladies caught on lace making and established a handicraft in south western coastal belt of Sri Lanka. The lace making handicraft now has a range of products like blouses, table linen, curtains, bed spreads and pillows.

When I was small and in school, there was a famous lady, a neighbour of ours called, Nonnakka, in Pamunuwa, Maharagama. . , . wife Serina, , .

There is a niece of mine, Sheraza Deen in Welwyn Garden City, London, the daughter of Dr. Haris Deen - my cousin - who is known to the Hon. Rauff Hakeem as well. So, I took a beeralu kottayak from Busurdeen and presented it to my niece. All the people over there wanted to know about that craft.

Then, Sir, about music, I also want to mention this. The other day, there was a musical show performed by Visharada Palinda Udawela Arachchi - who graduated in Bhatkand University at the Indian Cultural Centre. It was a classical Indian music programme conducted in the presence of Esha Srivastava, First Secretary, Press and information of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka. I was invited by his sister, Surani, who is in the service of the Governors Office in the Western Province. The tablas, sarpinas, violins, guitars and other musical instruments must be developed as cottage industry.

Thank you very much. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

Sir, all of us know that summary procedure is used in many circumstances in our civil courts to initiate action in liquid claims in terms of Section 703 of the Civil Procedure Code and to initiate action to summarily deal with offences under contempt of court in terms of Section 792 of the Civil Procedure Code. These are procedures that have already been discussed in the past. What is normally happening is, as explained by the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, based on the conviction given by the respective magistrates, an aggrieved party has to obtain redress in the District Court for compensation. Generally, this methodology takes a long time resulting in inordinate delay in obtaining compensation. Sometimes, when compensation is about to be awarded, even the affected party maybe dead and gone. This has happened several times. Sometimes, cases are withdrawn since the plaintiff is dead by the time it is taken up for trial. This has happened several times and this is why the Hon. Member feels that we must try and bring in the application of summary procedure to address the issue of damages and compensation for accident victims.

He also claimed ownership for a novel concept that has been introduced. That is, to have a specialist medical commission which can go into the issue of assessing the nature of injury and disability and its impact on the earning capacity of the plaintiff who has come before court, which will certainly help court to try and award or compute the damages or compensation that needs to be paid to the affected party.

The Hon. Member also raised a very pertinent issue regarding the conduct of the insurance industry in this country. This is a matter, I must say, that we must pay some serious attention because we already have created an office called "Insurance Ombudsman". I do not think the public are aware of an existence of the office of Insurance Ombudsman. I am sure those who are aggrieved by the business practices of insurance companies which try and use various devious methods to avoid payment of compensation, is a matter that should be agitated through the Ombudsman, so that he can be the interlocutor between the aggrieved party and the insurance companies concerned.

Then, we also have a Regulatory Commission regarding the insurance industry and even the telecommunication industry has a Regulatory

483 484

Commission now. But, unfortunately, the TRC - Telecommunications Regulatory Commission - is focusing more on distributing different licences. But then, focusing on the conduct of regulating the industry itself, particularly when it comes to the insurance industry, how far effectively that is functioning, is a matter that needs to be focused upon, particularly when it comes to avoidance strategies that insurance companies maybe adopting to avoid payment of compensation and damages. In that regard, I must say, that the Insurance Regulatory Commission and even the Ombudsman must look at the so-called allegation of excessive income that the insurance companies are earning through the third party insurance compulsion that is there already in the statute books. So, that is the way in which they are making or rather amassing a lot of funds. But, when it comes to disbursements of payments, they find various devious methods to avoid it. This needs to be focused upon and the Insurance Regulatory Commission should address this issue and see that there is some type of proper monitoring of the functioning of the insurance industry when it comes to this particular issue.

Then, of course, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera mentioned about the AJL - Administration of Justice Law - that had the similar procedures which unfortunately has been discontinued. As a matter of fact, now that we are introducing amendments to the Civil Procedure Code, we are now going back to the provisions of the AJL as it existed during 1973-1978 period which, in fact, to a very great extent contributed to the downfall of the then United Front regime. The UF regime became very unpopular because most among the legal fraternity looked at the introduction of the AJL as a very inauspicious or unhelpful thing particularly when it came to issues of the earning capacity of the legal profession perhaps. But, then we have now come a full circle and thought that some provisions of the Administration of Justice Law, which was introduced by the late Hon. Felix Dias Bandaranaike, are to be reintroduced through the new Civil Procedure Code amendments. It is a good thing for us to look at issuing of an order nisi where you will shift the burden of proof on to the defendant insurance company, so that you can give some redress, at least, when it comes to disposal of cases in an expedited manner to the affected parties, those who are claiming compensation. Of course, we know, the law relating to the deliction based on the English common law here, but then, there have been various different dilatory tactics that are being adopted by our own legal fraternity when it comes to the delay in our courts of law.

So, we have looked at various such issues and have now introduced these new reforms where we will be able to have a new system of pre-trial judges, a new category of judges, who will handle the pre-trial issues so that the trial judges would be free to get through the work that keeps on piling in courts of law. Hopefully, this new

suggestion that would bring some relief to accident victims is indeed good, but it needs some close scrutiny so that we can avoid controversy that might arise. Particularly, the Hon. Member should urge the Bar Association to cooperate with the Ministry in order to introduce some of these reforms but whenever the we try to introduce these reforms we find that the Bar Association is taking all types of exceptions to the good intentions of the Ministry. As a matter of fact, I would like to mention what a former Chief Justice of Malaysia told me when I inquired about the way in which he introduced reforms in the Civil Procedure Code in Malaysia. He said that the courts of law there were able to dispose a case within a period of a maximum of 12 months. This was very surprising to us, because in countries like Singapore, it does not take even eight months to dispose a case. One advice he gave me was, When you come to introduce reforms, please ignore what the legal fraternity tells you. If you try to ask them, you will never be able to introduce reforms. Nevertheless, it is our bounden duty to consult our friends, the Bar Association and I am sure they will cooperate with us to introduce some of these reforms, which are timely and which have already been on the back burner for quite some time. Hopefully, I would be able to bring those reforms to this House at least before the introduction of the Budget this year and towards which we are working very hard. I have asked my Colleague, the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha, who is also a lawyer, and heading the Cabinet Subcommittee to have a special subcommittee summoned very soon so that we will be able to pass the amendments made to the Civil Procedure Code and then, send them back to Cabinet for approval. With those comments, I rest my case.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Kumara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order, Hon. Ajith Kumara?
