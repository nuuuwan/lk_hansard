[3.29 p.m.] ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa - Deputy Minister of Water Supply and Drainage) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am privileged to speak on behalf of the people of Hambantota on the 10th Budget presented by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

It is a Budget that transcends barriers and seeks to grant relief, concessions and facilities to all sections of the society. It is a farmer-friendly, business-friendly and a development-oriented Budget based on Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future. Whenever a budget is in the offing, people expect new taxes to be introduced or existing taxes to be increased. But, President Rajapaksa has introduced Budget Proposals reducing the burden of entire cross-sections of the population, be it a farmer, an industrialist, an agriculturalist, a self-employed person or a public servant. This Budget focuses on accelerating development and provides many concessions mainly targeting the welfare of the rural masses. It has opened doors for people to participate in the development of the country. It creates self-reliance and independence. You would recall that this country was in a state of disarray politically, economically and socially due to the ill-conceived policies and programmes adopted by the previous regime. There were only a few openings for government participation in economic activities. But, when our President took the reins in 2010 he promised people peace and development.

So, this Budget proves that he has ushered the political stability along with economic development both at micro and macro levels. This is a participatory Budget. It has been prepared after extensive consultation by His Excellency the President with people and business organizations, trade unions, employer organizations, professional associations, farmer organizations, commerce chambers, NGOs, the Central Bank, Ministries, Departments and individuals. Therefore, it reflects the diverse views and conceptions of the entire spectrum of the Sri Lankan society. Hence it is accepted and admired for its progressive proposals.

Any democratic country which aspires to growth should establish good governance and build democratic institutions. In this respect, the UPFA Government spearheaded by President Mahinda Rajapaksa ensured that elections were held for the Northern Provincial Council and that people exercised and enjoyed their democratic rights as citizens. Today, the people in the North are able to move freely and there is greater understanding and dialogue between the Northerners and the Southerners.

I must also mention here that creation of the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration shows the Governments intention to bridge the gap in the implementation of the official languages -Sinhala and Tamil - with the support of major communities. Another important achievement towards restoration of unity and ethnic harmony is His Excellencys reintroduction of the "Yal Devi" train from Colombo to Kankesanthurai, which has won the applause of all communities.

We now have a developing economy. The political, economical and social progress made between 2005 and 2014 is tremendous. The lifestyle of Sri Lankans, from the average toiling farmers to the elite businessmen, has changed. There is a sense of dignity and confidence in the minds of the people because of the multi-development activities of the Government. Peoples political aspirations for devolution of power were fulfilled by having free and fair elections in three provincial councils this year. The policy adopted by the Government has been to accelerate development projects of which the benefits will seep down to the rural farmers and villages. With regard to irrigation schemes, the farmers of the Northern Province, North Western Province and the Southern Province will benefit from the diversions of Moragahakanda, Uma-Oya, Deduru-Oya and Yan-Oya by 2016. The major and minor irrigation schemes totalling 678 have been restored at a cost of Rs. 3,000 million. Water for cultivation was a major requirement which the Government is now able to provide.

Having brought the country out of the shackles of war, the Government has implemented development programmes for roads, highways, overhead bridges, education, agriculture, fisheries, housing, plantation development, livestock and animal husbandry and social welfare. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has announced that the next step is to provide clean drinking water to all people.

I am happy to state as the Deputy Minister of Water Supply and Drainage that the Government has completed water distribution systems in Galle, Colombo, Polonnaruwa, and Trincomalee. The present water schemes in the districts of Hambantota, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Matale, Anuradhapura, Kandy, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna and Kilinochchi have been accelerated. There is also a recently-created Community Water Supply Department which is now developing water supply schemes in small towns and rural areas. The allocation for this is Rs. 546 million in 2015.

A review of the economy in the last 10 years shows that the efforts of the UPFA Government headed by our President has led to a tremendous development in all sectors, especially education, health, housing, agriculture, plantation and industrial development including small and medium enterprises. Six thousand five hundred secondary schools are being upgraded facilitating the

863 864

2014 29

accommodation of 350,000 children entering schools every year. One thousand Mahindodaya labs which will provide facilities for children to study English, Mathematics, IT and Science have been completed. The Government intends to recruit 50,000 Teacher Assistants next year.

The health sector witnessed a high growth in infrastructure development and the provision of health services. The specialists, medical personnel, nurses and paramedical staff that have been required have been recruited. Ambulances and medical equipment have been provided to ensure quality health services both in urban and rural areas.

Our youth is our future. They need to be cared for, guided and provided with opportunities to obtain decent employment. The Government has revived vocational education to enable those youth who are unable to or do not want to pursue their education in a conventional manner and who want to switch to skills development courses in technical schools and institutions. The new School of Business Management, the Institute of Technology at Malabe and the Teacher Training College followed by the Advanced Technology Institute in Mullaitivu and several advanced university colleges will impart technical education.

The Gama Neguma infrastructure development programme and Divi Neguma livelihood programme have increased the income of the population. Major housing schemes spread all over the country have provided shelter to thousands of people including the Ranaviru brethren. We are heading for a per capita income of US Dollars 4000 in 2015. Our economic growth rate is near 8 per cent which is remarkable.

The Budget Proposals for 2015 have granted relief to every sector of the community; farmers, businessmen, professionals, public servants and private sector employees. The extension of pension scheme to all smallholder farmers is laudable. The fishing community in our country will benefit by the proposals made to implement a guaranteed price scheme and also by the setting up of dry fish processing zones. The socio-economic quality of life through a dedicated three-year programme with the allocation of Rs. 750 million each year for three years is exemplary. The proposals of a pension scheme for garment workers and three-wheeler owners is a welcome measure. Infants and children must be provided with nourishing food. The proposal to increase the guaranteed price of liquid milk to Rs. 60 per litre and to reduce price of the locally-made milk powder by Rs. 100 per kilogram and yoghurt by Rs. 5 will be welcomed by both livestock farmers and consumers alike. An allocation of Rs. 500 million has also been proposed for the provision of nutritious food for children and all lactating and pregnant mothers.

A significant proposal has also been made to expand facilities at the Kidney Hospital at Maligawatte to treat an increased number of patients and the same will be extended to Anuradhapura and Hambantota Kidney Hospitals.

An allocation of Rs. 1,500 million has also been made for sanitation and other facilities in rural schools.

The Women Enterprise Credit Scheme which is already in operation will be extended to a further 25 entrepreneurs each year for the next three years.

The Public servants who implement projects and take action on them play a vital role in the community. Recognizing their contribution, the President has proposed a minimum salary and many other concessions.

The Budget Proposals also have recognized contributions made by our Ranaviru brethren and increased the allowance by Rs. 1,000 per month to each of their parents.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in conclusion, let me applaud His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for presenting a Budget for the development of the economy and for granting concessions and relief to the entire population of Sri Lanka.

Thank you. [.. 3.40] ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Mannapperuma) , , . . , . , . . ; . , . , . .

[4.33 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan)

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the practice of presenting budgets in the world had commenced with the presentation of the government budget by Sir Robert Walpole. In the year 1721, there was a financial crisis caused by the South Sea Bubble. After chaos unleashed by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in 1720, 13 years later, Walpole announced his fiscal plan to bring in an excise tax on a variety of goods such as wine, tobacco.

The government budgets are of three types. In the Balanced Budget, the government's revenue and expenditure are equal. In the Surplus Budget, anticipated revenue exceed expenditure and in the Deficit Budget, anticipated expenditure is greater than the revenue. Probably, today we are facing a deficit Budget.

His Excellency the President, in the capacity of the Minister of Finance, presented the Budget for 2015 on the 24th of October, 2014. The present Budget contains many Proposals such as strengthening State business enterprises, banking and financial institutions, equity and debt market, legal and judiciary reforms, agrarian and plantation, fisheries, education, health and many more.

For the last nine years, the Government had forgotten the people of this country and was only concentrating mostly on the development of roads and other development projects in Hambantota such as the Airport and the Harbour on the borrowed capital from the Chinese Government paying excessive interest rates and burdening the people.

It is customary that the Budget is presented in the end of November, but the present Budget has been presented in the month of October, merely to satisfy the public using this as a weapon for the Presidential Election, which is scheduled to be held in early 2015. The Government has given many promises in this Budget as an election manifesto, but as usual they will not be able to fulfil their promises.

If you take into consideration the Budget Proposals from the year 2005 to 2014, the following promises in the Budgets have not been fulfilled.

2005:

1. Formulation of a National Action Plan to eradicate all forms of child abuses and protect the children. This promise has not been fully implemented.

2. Reduction of infant mortality rate to 8 per 1,000 and maternal mortality rate to 23 per 100,000. According to the survey conducted in 2011, maternal mortality rate was 31.6 per 100,000.

3. Granting of a loan to three-wheeler operators to import three-wheelers at a concessionary rate. This was not implemented.

2006:

1. Distribution of nutritious foods free of charge for pregnant mothers through rural hospitals. This was not fully implemented.

2. Granting of an allowance of Rs. 200 per month for children till they reach five years of age. This was not fully implemented.

3. Developing State seed farms to supply locally produced seeds and plants to farmers. This was not fully implemented. At present, about Rs. 840 million is being spent for importing seeds.

4. Opening bank accounts for children who had been affected by Tsunami and crediting Rs.1,500 per month. This was not implemented.

2007:

1. Reopening of the closed-down factories. A special loan scheme for industrialists would be given through Lankaputhra Development Bank. This was not implemented.

2008:

1. Distribution of essential goods for low-income people at concessionary prices and a rice subsidy for estate workers. This was not implemented.

2. Distribution of nutritious foods for pregnant and lactating mothers free of charge and providing milk food at concessionary rates. This was not implemented.

2009:

1. Enforcing "Mathata Thitha" - eradication of narcotics programme. This was totally unsuccessful.

2010:

1. Distribution of free nutritious food for school children. Initially, a glass of milk was given in selected schools in remote areas. At present, it is not being implemented.

2012:

1. Granting a monthly allowance of Rs. 3,000 to all disabled persons and low-income families. This was not implemented.

883 884

2014 29

2014:

1. Establishment of Agrarian Service Centres to purchase potatoes, onions, chillies and grains at certified prices. This was not implemented.

2. A programme to supply free nutritious foods to pregnant and lactating mothers. This was not successful.

Today, the Government has mentioned that they intend to pay Rs. 2,200 as an allowance to the Public Servants, totalling to about Rs. 1,282,917. It is also promised that a minimum salary of Rs. 15,000 per month for Public Servants. His Excellency the President has stated that he is maintaining a salary ratio of 1:4:25 between minor employees up to Secretaries and this is totally unsuccessful as the computation of this amount is not acceptable. Why does the Government not inform the Government Sector employees the rate of net allowance that they intend giving without any computation in a ratio format?

The United National Party has very clearly laid down that if they come into power, they would give a net salary increase of Rs. 10,000 for Public Sector employees without any conditions laid thereon. I request the Government again to inform what is the net increase of allowance, without the computation of the ratio format, that the Public Servants will receive.

If you look at the factors of cost of living today, the importers will have to pay as tax Rs. 26 per kilogram for dried fish; Rs. 300 per kilogram for maldive fish; Rs. 33 per kilogram for sugar and import duties also have to be paid for dhal, potatoes, bombay onions and gram under the Special Commodity Levy Act. If you analyze this, a basic family of four will have to spend about Rs. 3,750 as taxation towards the Government on these consumer items.

There was a promise that in the year 2010, the Government employees will receive an increase of Rs. 2,500 and this assurance given to the Buddhist clergy has not been fulfilled. Presently, the Budget has also provided a VAT component of 11 per cent to be paid by the business community over and above Rs. 100 million turnover a month. This provision of taxation will burden the citizen and their cost of living index will rise further.

Under the Appropriation Bill, the Government's estimated expenditure is Rs. 1,812,292,718,000 for the service of the period beginning from January 1st and ending 31st of December, 2015. But, as per the Budget, the summary of total expenditure will amount to Rs. 2,210 billion. So, there is a deficit of about Rs. 400 billion.

In the same manner, according to the Appropriation Bill, the borrowings of the Government shall not exceed

Rs. 1,340 billion. In Table V: Summary of the Budget (2009-2015), the Governments Total Revenue and Grants would be Rs. 1,689 billion. Here again, there is a deficit of about Rs. 400 billion. I wish to ask the Government, why this deficit is being found under the expenditure and revenue to be raised by the Government. Therefore, it is the duty of the Government to explain why this deficit has been found both in the Revenue and the Expenditure of the Budget.

The Turnover Tax has also been abolished in the Provincial Councils and there has been a subsequent direct taxation that is levied by the Central Government. The Central Government is levying taxes but that should be exercised by the Provincial Councils. By doing so, the Provincial Council is deprived of the mode of taxation and as such, their revenue is reduced. In Table V: Summary of the Budget (2009-2015), there is a clause, Provincial Councils Tax sharing and Devolved Revenue, which amounts to Rs. 56 billion. I need clarification from the Government as to what this amount tabulated is being utilized for.

Then, Sir, Defence and Urban Development has been categorized under one heading and a sum of Rs. 285 billion has been allocated. The Sri Lanka Army will receive Rs. 140 billion; the Sri Lanka Navy Rs. 50 billion; the Sri Lanka Air Force Rs. 40 billion, and Urban Development will also receive Rs. 40 billion which is an equal allocation as made to the Air Force. Why has the Government placed Defence and Urban Development under one category whereas the defence of the country and the urban development should be placed under two different categories?

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in the present Budget, the Northern and the Eastern Province have not been allocated any funds. Firstly, the resettlement of refugees, secondly, the 85,000 widows living in the Northern Province and thirdly, the 12,000 orphan children who are living in the said areas have not been provided with any funds. They have treated the Northern and the Eastern Province as if they are No mans land. The Central Government is controlling the finances of the Northern Provincial Council. The said Council is unable to carry out duties without the sanction of the Central Government. This is totally unsatisfactory and it is against the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. There are factors that the Tamil-speaking population will have to consider regarding the treatment made by the Government towards the Tamils. The restriction on entry to foreigners to the Jaffna District is totally illegal and the Government has not yet given reasons as to why this restriction has been introduced. The Government should answer the people immediately on this issue, which is against the democratic rights of a citizen. In the same manner, 50,000 houses were to be built for the estate workers but no provision has been made in this Budget as far as the welfare of the estate workers are concerned.

885 886

Further, Sir, the Ministry of Justice has been allocated Rs. 750 million. It is unfortunate that the entire judiciary today is controlled by the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

and the appointment of all Senior Judges to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court are made by the President of this country.

Sir, recently, some Members of Parliament had to attend the Magistrate's Court and had to provide a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 1 million for their release. In the said case, the statements of the allegedly-accused Parliamentarians had not been recorded and investigations were not completed by the police. In any event, the Members of Parliament are Public officers and they are entitled to enter any Government organization during the day to fulfil their duties. The counsel appearing for the Parliamentarians had given assurance to court that on notice they would appear in court. The prosecuting police officers had unreasonably requested the learned judge for provision of a personal bond from the Parliamentarians. This itself clearly shows that there is a miscarriage of justice to the Parliamentarians. The judicial system in this country is failing due to the interference of the Executive.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

You will note that even all important appointments in the Public and banking sector, corporations and in the GAs Office, Colombo are served by ex-senior officers of the Armed Forces appointed by the President. If this situation continues, there will be anarchy and the democratic rights of the people will be unprotected.

The present Budget that has been proposed by His Excellency the President is an election manifesto, which cannot be enforced due to the lack of financial revenue that is expected to be collected to fulfil the provisions in this Budget. The first Budget was enacted by Robert Walpole because of the South Sea Bubble. Today, we have to face the "Sri Lankan Sea Bubble" to face the economic chaos unleashed in this country due to the false promises given to the citizens in this Budget. Thank you.
