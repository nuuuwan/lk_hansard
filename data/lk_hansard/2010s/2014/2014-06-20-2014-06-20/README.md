... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, give me five more minutes. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I will give you only one more minute. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The whole world has accepted that there should be and there must be an alternative airport in a country and that is the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport.

. . The Second Test match is beginning at Headingley today, and we will, Insha Allah, win that test match today and bring glory to the country. Today, all the countries - India, West Indies, New Zealand and Australia - are willing to come to Sri Lanka. Those days they did not come because there were not enough grounds. Now, there is an international ground in Hambantota. The Pallekele International Cricket Stadium has been developed; R. Premadasa Stadium has been developed. That is how we are building up this nation.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) There is one last matter I want to refer to. Sir, today's "Daily News" states, - this is not something that I am saying - I quote:

"Sri Lanka can become another Asian economic success story - ADB President Despite three decades of conflict, Sri Lanka has managed to become one of the most..."

. .

"....successful countries in Asia in terms of social development indicators - especially health and education, the President of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Takehiko Nakao said."

Do you even know his name? It further goes on to state, I quote:

"...since the end of civil war in May 2009, Sri Lanka has been recording solid rates of growth and is on course to surpassing last year's rate of 7.3% in 2014,..."

I must thank the officials of the Ministry, the Minister of Finance, His Excellency the President and the Secretary, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara and also Mr. Ajith Nivard

Cabraal, the Governor of Central Bank, who submitted the Annual Report. Sir, he has gone and addressed, only last week, a very good conference in Singapore and there is a picture in the "Daily News" of 18th June, 2014, depicting the Central Bank Governor greeting M. Zink, Citis ASEAN Head and Citi Country Officer of Singapore. Sir, the "Daily News" further states, I quote:

" Sri Lanka will reach a per capita income in excess of US$ 7500 in six years said Central Bank Governor, Ajith Nivard Cabraal."

Therefore, Sir, in all matters we are developing; we are going ahead and in 2020, Sri Lanka will be the first country to fast develop in the Asian region. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you, Hon. Azwer. The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana to second the Motion. [.. 2.35] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) , 2013 . , .

. "The Nation" newspaper of 7th December, 2008 reported that. It states, I quote:

From the above actions of the CBSL, it would be clear that the Governor and other officials of the CBSL have carried out their duties and responsibilities in a prudent and professional manner, in complete contrast to the allegations and insinuations made."

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) . Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka . :

It rather appears that given the substantial public criticism, Governor Cabraal and the Central Bank were forced to defend their role in relation to the hedging program.

:

The Government acted in bad faith

:

All this is evidence that the Governor acted in bad faith.

? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I am going to wind up.

[.. 3.13] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Public Management Reforms) , . , 14 . . , 161 . . . 161 , 5.13 - - . It is about service of the loans that has been obtained. , 64. . . . [ ]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, I appreciate your responding to it. All what I did was, I showed and tabled the Press Release issued by the Central Bank.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) What I am saying is that the Annual Report of the Central Bank for 2013 has very clearly indicated that the outstanding debt payments are over 60 per cent.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) But, we are debating the Annual Report of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) The issue is on the data. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes, the data is given.

1145 1146

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) So, I am going by the Central Bank Report. We are not, like you said, trying to cover up these facts.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, would you please look at page 225 of the Annual Report of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, which is being debated today?

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I have not got that Report. But, what I am saying is that at the end of the day, we have clearly indicated in the Central Bank Report that the debt service ratio is 64 per cent.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I appreciate that. As an honest Member, - ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) It is in the Central Bank Report. So, I do not have to go beyond that; I do not have to conjure up these facts. These facts are there in the Central Bank Report.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am not saying that you are conjuring it up. I am referring to what is on page 225 of the Report we are debating today. .

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Also, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, I would like to draw your attention to page 160 of the same Central Bank Report.

5.12 . , - - . . .

, " " . So, under those matters come the NSB and all that, the private loans that have been taken from banks. So, I do not want to get into this. What I am saying is that the Central Bank Report indicates the percentage of loans.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) If that is the case, Hon. Minister, why did they issue this statement dated 13th May, 2014?

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I will get a clarification for you. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I have tabled that document. ( ) (The Hon.

, . , . . ? I am going to read an article from the "Daily News" of Tuesday, 10th June, 2014. It is a relatively new article, which is titled, I quote:

TOURISM EARNS US$ 815 M UPTO MAY.

It also states that 625,000 tourists have come in the first five months. So, if you divide US Dollars 815 million by 625,000 tourists and again divide it by 150 days, you get US Dollars 8.6 a day. I was rather startled at that. To be very frank, I do not know whether I have made a mistake because I am quoting this after seeing this article just two hours ago. Hon. Minister, you have a very wide knowledge of the economy and you have people investing in a lot of companies, not you, but at least your beloved daughter who is doing a lot of investments in the hotel sector. Imagine, if you tell this to anybody else, they will laugh at it. I do not know whether I have made a mistake, but I would like you to look at this. US Dollars 815 million divided by 625,000 tourists, as they say, and then, if you divide it by 150 days, you get US Dollars 8.6 a day. What the hell can you do with US Dollars 8.6 a day? , . . I cannot believe this figure. -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Our target is US Dollars 2 billion. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Your target can be US Dollars 2 billion; I am not talking about the target. I am talking about the information given in the "Daily News", your information Bible. I only divided that figure by using normal arithmetic. So, if you divide US Dollars 815 million by 625,000 tourists and again divide it by 150 days, that is the revenue you get per day. So, there is something radically wrong with that.

So, there is a 50 per cent difference. I am sure that the yield here is better than there, but still the competitiveness is not there and you are working on a 10 per cent margin.

Global insurance giant AIG to exit Sri Lanka.

I am sure, Hon. Minister, that you are very well aware that these are giants. Getting them into Sri Lanka is very good, but what they say is, our strategic intent, in which

they do not have confidence, does not help them to be in this small country. So, that is a very bad outward statement of a -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is part of the global recession. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I guess so. But why did AIG come into Sri Lanka? Because they thought that there was potential. When these companies make a strategic intent to come into Sri Lanka, they have the same feeling. So, their moving out means that it is completely way off the mark. . .

He takes the UNP votes and goes to the Government and says that he is ashamed to be part of the Government. This is what you call, "shamelessness". There is enough of talent without these people.
