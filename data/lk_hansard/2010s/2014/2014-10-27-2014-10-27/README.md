ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , '' '' .

. . Question proposed.

" " ""

RESTART OF "YAL DEVI"

[6.00 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

"The journey of the "Yaldevi" that went to Jaffna carrying the message of reconciliation between the North and the South was not an empty handed journey but a journey that was made in order to share the feelings of brotherhood, co-existence and friendship of the South with the people of the North. It is for this purpose that the railway to Jaffna which stopped functioning 24 years ago as a result of the gruesome terrorism that dragged on for thirty years, was commissioned recently by His Excellency the President.

Areas in the North were isolated during the colonial rule due to lack of transportation facilities. Therefore, the imperialists appointed a commission to look into the matter of the Jaffna railway.

Accordingly, the railway was started in 1902 and was later extended all the way to Jaffna. Nevertheless, train journeys beyond Vavuniya had to be stopped after 1983 with the escalation of the terrorist crisis. Further, the Yaldevi train was subjected to a terrorist attack near Kokavil in January 1985.

Again in 1986, the Uththaradevi train was blown up near Paranthan. In the same year, the Yaldevi too was blown up by the LTTE between the Puliyankulama and Vavuniya railway stations.

As a result of this, the public transportation of the people of the North came to a halt. The Northern railway which gradually came under the clutch of terrorists, was completely destroyed by them and all material from the railroad were salvaged by the LTTE to be used in their terrorist activities.

Fulfilling the pledge that was made to end the cruel and cursed war and return to the people of the North everything that they lost except for the lost lives, the Northern railway was recently commissioned by H.E. the President as the head of state.

It is certain that the name of H.E. the President would be written in gold in the history of the country for fulfilling in yet another angle, his promise to unite Sri Lanka as declared through the Mahinda Chinthana policy manifesto.

Therefore, it is moved in this House that the government headed by H.E. the President be appreciated in this regard."

Sir, in order to save time, I table* the Sinhala and Tamil translations of this Adjournment Motion and kindly request them to be included in Hansard as those are very important for the people to know about the transformation and revolution that has been brought about as a result of the restart of the "Yal Devi".

Sir, civilization, we know, was born in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley, on the banks of the Nile in Egypt and of Tigris-Eupharates in Iraq. Now, what is happening to those countries? It is not only their rails and road transport that was destroyed, but every strata of livelihood has been and is being completely destroyed by the so-called "imperialist powers". This is the holocaust that the Muslim world is facing today.

It is a lesson as to what happens when people of responsibility, the Opposition, go to the European Union, meet the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam and other Eelam bodies in Europe, Malaysia and Singapore. We should warn the people of this country of this conspiracy. It was in 1500s that Don Juan Dharmapala betrayed the nation and the Kingdom of Kotte by signing a document himself. When the UNP speaks about a new Kotte Declaration, I am reminded of this historical crime that was committed by Don Juan Dharmapala.

We do not want a Don Juan Dharmapalas in this country anymore. The people will not tolerate them. We do not want in this country anymore Molligodas and Ekneligodas, who betrayed the Kandyan Kingdom.

Sir, today is a day when people have risen up with zeal, with a spirit of patriotism. They are crying aloud to save the nation. Patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, is the call of the day and the cardinal principle that the people have to understand and follow.

In this respect, civilization was reborn when His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa launched the "Yal Devi" and travelled to Jaffna the other day.

Sir, I have here with me a very nice and most appropriate cartoon that appeared in the Daily Mirror of 15th October, 2014. What does it show? It is titled Banana Republic" and shows how it was "Then" and "Now". The upper part of the cartoon shows the situation "Then" with a fence in the middle, dividing the North and the South. That shows that the country was divided at that time. Now, it is one. The dividing fence of Germany was mended; the dividing fence between the Koreas was mended.

Today, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is being hailed not only in Asia, but in the rest of the world also, as the person who removed the fence that divided the North and the South and heralded a new life, a new civilization. The lower portion of the cartoon shows the situation "Now" with a straight railroad and the fence has been removed. So, this is a remarkable achievement of this Government for the people of our country, for our motherland. This trend should continue. Otherwise, we are doomed. For sheer political gains, if anybody would go out of this country and say anything to anyone betraying our nation, he could be called a great betrayer of the nation like Don Juan Dharmapala. I have got details here, but I do not want to table those now. I will do that at the correct moment. , . . . .

Sir, history proudly records the heroic struggle of the Muslims at that time, who waged wars in the Seethawaka Kingdom, the area of which our Chief Government Whip, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, the heroes of the Boralugoda regime or the Boralugoda clan are representing today; I should say, fighting tooth and nail in order to save this nation from local and foreign conspirators. I am very happy, Sir, that the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna - MEP - which came into power in 1956, has once again played that historical role and has extended all assistance and support to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make him the President of this country again. There is no one who can take over that office in the foreseeable future; we cannot see anybody who could do it. Will this country tolerate anybody going outside this country and betraying the cause? If they do, Sir, there is provision in the Constitution to pass a resolution against him because we take an Oath in this House to uphold the unity, territorial integrity and the independence of our country. That is there in the Constitution.

If anybody does that, he would be acting against the Constitution, violating the provisions of the Constitution and he could be tried in a court of law. Time has come for it now.

Sir, I have another article which appeared in The Hindu newspaper - not one of ours, but from India - dated 14th October, 2014 written by Meera Srinivasan. It states, I quote:

Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran stayed away from a ceremony on Monday in which President Mahinda Rajapaksa

re-launched train services to Jaffna.

A little while ago, our dear Friend, the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran stated in this House that she also travelled to Yalpanam by the "Yal Devi". What a great thing!

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay, thank you very much.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I think there is 15 minutes more. There is no one else to speak.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Shantha Bandara has to second the Motion and the Hon. Deputy Minister has to reply.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Shantha Bandara will take only five minutes. I want to read this newspaper article.

I further quote:

When contacted, Mr. Wigneswaran told The Hindu: Our letter to President refers to our keeping away from all functions he is staging in the Northern Province,

We restarted the "Yal Devi", and also gave relief by providing 20,000 land permits to the people of Jaffna. A function was held for this purpose where a large majority of Tamils and Muslims from Vanni, brought by the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, attended. Even the Hon. Rohana Dissanayake, our able Deputy Minister was present at that function. I ask Mr. Wigneswaran what is the service he is giving the people of Jaffna. He is playing a drama in order to satisfy the international diaspora. I would appeal - ! - -

, ! , .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I will only read this portion, Sir. I further quote:

Indian Railways subsidiary IRCON has rebuilt the stretch - damaged during the war - as part of the Indian governments $800 million line of credit to restore select railway lines in the island, predominantly in its Tamil-majority Northern Province.

We are very thankful to the IRCON and the Government of India. We were very pleased that even the High Commissioner of India in Sri Lanka, His Excellency Y.K. Sinha travelled with us in the new "Yal Devi".

Thank you.
