The Government servants in Singapore run the country and the politicians only put the final signature. They "dot the i's and cross the t's". That is all that they do. So, that is the success behind Singapore. It is the same with Hong Kong where with the least interference of politicians, the highest expected growth rates have been achieved.

Italy is a classic example. In Italy, they had 84 Governments during the last 40 years. But, their policies are so good that they are able to compete and be the third best country in the European Union because it is the Government servants who run the country. There, the politicians are treated as jokers because of the way the majority of them are behaving today.

Therefore, I would like to tell the Hon. Minister that it is a timely wake-up call. Just because you have legislations which were there from day dot or before Independence, you carry them out like the Exchange Control Act, the Banking Act and the Finance Act, which are prehistoric and non-implementable.

Today, the Government servants who make suggestions which are carried out by the politicians for their survival, are at the mercy of the Government. So, I call upon the Hon. Minister, let us have a change in our attitudes; let a National Policy be brought in; let there be a Select Committee to look into this and let us come out with the best policy for the betterment of the country. The country requires - [Interruption.] Mr. Deputy Speaker, have I run out of my 15 minutes?

We have one and a half hours. The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera and I are there from our side and I am sure the time will be well within.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have already exceeded 10 minutes. Anyway, you can continue.

Then, I found the next best alternative was Italy and that is why I said that though governments have changed 84 times within 40 years in Italy, still the policies have stood the test of time. So, Hon. Minister, I am sure you will go down in history if you can accept this. Just because we, from the Opposition, bring in this proposal, it does not necessarily mean that this has to be thrown aside. Let us take it upon; let us have a Select Committee and see whether we will be able to have a good policy for the betterment of the country.

ENSURING A POLLUTION FREE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AROUND SRI LANKA [.. 4.26] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . . ,

. .

Sir, I move,

"That this Parliament resolves that action be taken to ensure a pollution free marine environment around Sri Lanka for a sustainable national development and the well-being of its people and the economy by the year 2020.

I table* the Sinhala and Tamil versions of the Motion to be included in Hansard.

* :

* : * Sinhala and Tamil versions of Motion tabled:

" , 2020 ."

"2020 ."

Sir, this, I think, is a very important Motion as far as the environment and human beings living in this world are concerned. There is Marine Environment Protection Authority. Its Vision is very clear. It states:

A pollution free marine environment around Sri Lanka for the sustainable national development and the well being of its people and the economy

It has a Mission too. What is its mission?

Be an agency with required skills, competence, organizational structure and infrastructure framework to prevent, control and manage marine pollution in Sri Lanka waters through effective enforcement of regulations, implementation of concerned International Conventions, coordination and mobilization of stakeholder and other resources, for sustainable management of marine environment for present and future generations.

Therefore, Sir, the regulations are there. We have to fortify them so that they will be effective. About International Conventions, I attended an Environmental Convention in Nagoya in Japan about two years ago when the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa was the Minister of Environment. They passed a Resolution asking members to bring forward resolutions or motions before their respective Parliaments so that it will receive the proper attention of the world community. Sir, that is why I am doing it today. There were Green Party Members of Britain and other places also who attended the Convention.

The Introduction under Chapter 1, Background of the Report states, I quote:

Sri Lanka is located at a strategic position in the Indian Ocean. According to international regulations, Sri Lanka is entitled to harvest the resources of an area in the ocean eight times the size of Sri Lanka land mass.

How big it is!

Through this area of the ocean, navigation paths of ships moving from east to west and west to east are located. Therefore the resources around in the zone of the sea, are under Sri Lankas surveillance but these resources are being degraded due to the impact of navigation and related activities in the ocean and human activity on the land mass.

Then, it further states,

"The Mahinda Chithana envisages the development of Sri Lanka as a naval hub. As a part of this new vision, new harbours are built and old harbours are further improved. In addition, the programs are being formulated to exploit the resources of the ocean. The MEPA as therefore been called upon to prevent any pollution that may occur due to these development programmes and also to ensure their sustainability.

It also states,

The Marine Pollution Prevention Authority was formed under the provisions of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act No. 59 of 1981, to take necessary action to minimize and prevent the pollution of the marine environment. With a view to further strengthen the hands of the Authority to take action on incidence of pollution and to implement international conventions pertaining to the protection of marine environment, the Marine Pollution Prevention Act No. 59 was repealed and then re-named as the Marine Pollution Prevention Act No. 35 of 2008."

Now, this is the crux of the problem. It is in order to draw the attention of House that I move this Motion today in keeping with international requirements.

Sir, Sri Lanka is exposed as the worst polluter of the Indian Ocean. The new maps on human impact on the worlds oceans are now on the website. You can browse through them. Although there had been regular commentary on the need of every government and various authorities to be cognizant of the oceanic health, it is shocking to see the evidence that is now before us. The map of the Indian Ocean shows an ugly halo of pollution and ocean impact that rings the ocean around Sri Lanka.

The irresponsible use of our land: cutting the forests, eroding the soil and drenching it with artificial fertilizers and agro-industrial toxins, finally result in polluting the ocean. First, there was the loss of rock pool corals, then the shore corals, next the fringing shallow reef and finally the deep reef. We saw these degrade and disappear within our lifetime, but the extent of damage to the ocean around us was not even remotely realized until the advent of satellite sensing.

Also, take the air pollution caused by vehicles on the road. Today, the number of vehicles in Sri Lanka has increased. Sir, the economy of the country is advancing

and as a result more people are able to buy cars and other vehicles. Where there was no car, now there is one car; where there was one car in certain houses, there are about two or three cars for the father, the mother and the daughter or the son. So, emission of smoke from vehicles evaporates into the ozone and thereafter it affects the ocean and the environment. There too, Sir, we have to bring in machinery in order to control vehicular emission of smoke.

We are indeed responsible for lot of pollution in our land, but there is another contributing factor to this damage. We know that the major maritime passage runs through our territorial waters, particularly through the Southern Harbour, the Port of Hambantota, which has now been developed. It will be developing fast into one of the best harbours in the world. So, Sir, a lot of ships will be coming to Hambantota in time to come. Oil spilling out of ships due to damages caused, and the sea suffuse all those up its bosom. It is like a mother: all the good and the bad, a mother bears up. Like that, the ocean has to take up all these things - the manmade pollution and the natural pollution.

Sir, we must also pay attention to the capability of enforcing laws to control pollution in our waterways. This aspect was pointed out continually to the authorities concerned since 1995 when the subject was first brought to the attention of the Government in a letter to the Hon. Minister of Environment on 20th October, 1995. This is what it states:

One urgent issue is that of Marine Biodiversity a theme that is scheduled to be discussed at the COP2 due to be held in Jakarta in November this year.

That was in 1995.

Sri Lanka is constantly placed in a position of jeopardy vis--vis our marine biodiversity and fisheries potential by the inherent threat that super tankers laden with oil. It is a fact that these tankers pass through our national waters on an intensive basis. Yet is appears that we have not yet invoked the CBD in protecting ourselves against the imminent danger.

This is what I wanted to project through this House, to the country and the international community. Even the UN has Resolutions to this effect, Sir. They are also very, very vigilant towards protecting the environment.

Now, see the pollution of oceanic environment. The Indian fishermen come and pollute our sea around Mannar and other areas and our fishermen are harassed. They are taken to India; they are tortured; they are imprisoned. The other day, our President was good enough to release several fishermen, who were taken into custody by Sri Lanka, on humanitarian grounds. There must be reciprocal action by the Indian Government also, but not to be so far. The surprising thing is that the people who are representing the fishermen of Jaffna - even the Chief Minister of the Northern Province, Mr. C.V.

Vigneswaran or the TNA Members who are here - do not speak a single word about this. I pointedly asked the Hon. Sampanthan, the Hon. Sumanthiran and the coterie of the TNA Friends in this House about this.

Then, Sir, in terms of national interest, it was argued that the question of accountability was crucial, as we did not have the resources to deal with disaster of large magnitude. Relevant sections of the Convention on Biological Diversity were pointed out, for instance, a relevant Article of the Convention was Article 14 of the CBD which addresses "Impact Assessment and Minimizing Adverse Impacts". This Article is crucial as it requires countries to use biodiversity as a criterion for its proposed projects with a view to avoiding or minimizing negative impact. This Article also requires States to take initiative in reporting to other States of an imminent danger to the biological diversity of that State. Where possible, it encourages joint contingency plans. Further, it was pointed that Article 14.2 on "Liability and Redress" has been downplayed by many developed nations and by

their media as it goes against the commercial interests of those nations. It was suggested that if Sri Lanka, as a nation, were to raise these points and request the COP - Conference of Parties to the CBD - to examine these questions, we could take the initiative in building up a system of accountability that will give our nation some degree of protection from the oncoming environmental crisis. Now, this is the issue that I am trying to spotlight in this Parliament.

As an island nation, we must be ever vigilant of the productivity and condition of our coastal waters. What happened in Koggala in 2006 involving a small commercial vessel has given us warning. A small spill has demonstrated that it can contaminate over three kilometres of beach with a black, tar like, toxic, sludge that is guaranteed to deter tourists and effect fisheries.

See how our fishery, our own wealth will be affected if we do not pay attention to the oceanic pollution. We cannot afford any such losses. What happened at Koggala was a foretaste of things to come. We should apply some clear rational thinking as to how we can protect two of our most valuable resources: fisheries and tourism.

, We must act and he has also told that he will act.

, point . The salient point to remember is that it was fuel that had leaked in the Koggala incident that we could not respond effectively. . If it was crude oil, we would have had no chance. If a small disabled ship fuel oil can create such substantial quality depreciation of the beaches that the nation relies so much upon, what could a tanker or a supertanker do? Now, this is the greatest danger that haunts us. Therefore, we have to act and the Hon. Minister assured the House that he will act on it.

Sir, there is another form of pollution. It is a known fact that sewerage and other waste is not treated and it is directly discharged into the sea by our local authorities. . . Hence it is not a surprise that our coastal waters are polluted. This is one fact. We ourselves do that. That is called man-made pollution, Sir. When I am talking about the protection of ocean and the pollution-free ocean, I am reminded of a Surah, Sir, in the Holy Quran. There is Yoonus Nabi Alaihis Salam.

() . . ' ' .

When you ask, dua or pray, God helps you even from the belly of the fish. There is a special Surah in the Holy Quran itself, which states, I quote:

Surat Al-'Anby' (The Prophets)

And [mention] the man of the fish, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decree [anything] upon him. And he called out within the darknesses, "There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers."[21:87]

Therefore, Sir, I am very happy that all round there have been bouquets for my Motion today though this Motion was given a year ago. I must also remember today that the person who was responsible in motivating me to bring this Motion before the House was Mr. N.M. Mansoor. He was the Chief Security Officer at the Bandaranaike International Airport. He breathed his last, last evening and the janaza took place at the Kuppiyawatte Burial Grounds. He leaves behind his wife, Dr. Hajanjan Mansoor, the able Principal of Muslim Ladies College, Bambalapitiya and his two children in this hour of grief. I wish to condole and make dua for him.

Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to. ( ) (The Presiding Member) 4, . .
