JOINT STATEMENT BY UN SECRETARY-GENERAL,

GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA Following is the joint statement by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations at the conclusion of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moons visit to Sri Lanka on 23 May:

At the invitation of Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of Sri Lanka, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, paid a visit to Sri Lanka. During the course of his visit, he held talks with the President, Foreign Minister as well as other senior leaders of Sri Lanka. During his stay, he also consulted other relevant stakeholders, members of international humanitarian agencies and civil society. The Secretary-General visited the internally displaced persons (IDP) sites at Vavuniya and overflew the conflict area, near Mullaitivu that was the scene of the conflict.

President Rajapaksa welcomed the Secretary-General as the highest dignitary to visit Sri Lanka in the post-conflict phase. This was a reflection of the close cooperation between Sri Lanka and the United Nations as well as Sri Lankas commitment to work with the United Nations in the future.

President Rajapaksa and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon agreed that following the end of operations against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Sri Lanka had entered a new post-conflict beginning. In this context, the Government of Sri Lanka faced many immediate and long-term challenges relating to issues of relief, rehabilitation, resettlement and reconciliation. While addressing these critical issues, it was agreed that the new situation offered opportunities for long-term development of the north and for re-establishing democratic institutions and electoral politics after 2 decades. The Government expressed its commitment to ensure the economic and political empowerment of the people of the north through its programmes.

President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General agreed that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socio-economic development. The Secretary-General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his statement in Parliament on 19 May 2009 that a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved. President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

President Rajapaksa and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon discussed a series of areas in which the United Nations will assist the ongoing efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka in addressing the future challenges and opportunities.

With regard to IDPs, the United Nations will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the IDPs now in Vavuniya and Jaffna. The Government will continue to provide access to humanitarian agencies. The Government will expedite the necessary basic and civil infrastructure as well as means of livelihood necessary for the IDPs to resume their normal lives at the earliest. The Secretary-General welcomed the announcement by the Government expressing its intention to dismantle the welfare villages at the earliest, as outlined in the Plan to resettle the bulk of IDPs and call for its early implementation.

The Government seeks the cooperation of the international community in mine clearing, which is an essential prerequisite to expediting the early return of IDPs.

The Secretary-General called for donor assistance towards the Common Humanitarian Action Plan (CHAP) jointly launched by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations, which supports the relief, shelter and humanitarian needs of those in IDP sites.

President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General recognized the large number of former child soldiers forcibly recruited by the LTTE as an important issue in the post-conflict context. President Rajapaksa reiterated his firm policy of zero tolerance in relation to child recruitment. In cooperation with the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), child-friendly procedures have been established for their release and surrender and rehabilitation in Protective Accommodation Centres. The objective of the rehabilitation process presently underway is to reintegrate former child soldiers into society as productive citizens. The Secretary-General expressed satisfaction on the progress already made by the Government in cooperation with UNICEF and encouraged Sri Lanka to adopt similar policies and procedures relating to former child soldiers in the north.

President Rajapaksa informed the Secretary-General regarding ongoing initiatives relating to rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants. In addition to the ongoing work by the Office of the Commissioner General for Rehabilitation, a National Framework for the Integration of Ex-combatants into Civilian Life is under preparation, with the assistance of the United Nations and other international organizations.

Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lankas international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances.

* 2009 26 "Joint Statement by UN Secretary-General, Government of Sri Lanka" . .

:

President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

This obviously opened the door for a Thirteen plus solution. This promise was not given by anybody else, but you all.

I am only trying to give five or six facts that have led to the investigation that has come up today owing to the breach of the confidence they had in the Government of Sri Lanka under President Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is why I tabled that Joint Statement by the UN Secretary-General and the Government of Sri Lanka.

Then, there is an article written by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha, a person who has credible information. He headed the Peace Secretariat. He had written a lovely article published on the 19th of May, 2014. Sir, with your permission, I table* it.

Sir, let me quote two paragraphs from that article:

I had been summoned there urgently, because some Western nations had been trying to get sufficient signatures to hold a Special Session of the Human Rights Council in an attempt to stop our imminent conquest of the Tigers. By the time I got to Geneva though, the danger was over, and there was much to celebrate. The superb diplomacy of Dayan Jayatilleka, our Representative in Geneva, supported admirably by the international coalition he had built up, had ensured that the West did not get the required number of signatures, and the danger passed."

"But before that I, had been asked up to Kandy, for dinner at Presidents House where Ban Ki-Moon was being entertained.

? . . .

The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha further says in his article, I quote:

When I got there, the great man was deep in discussion with Foreign Ministry officials, and it took some time before they emerged with a joint communiqu, which was duly signed before dinner.

[2.49 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Motion submitted by nine Hon. Members of this Parliament.

They do not want an investigation against Sri Lanka by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to be held. They say that it should not be carried out on the grounds that such a course of action is detrimental to the process of reconciliation and peace and that it erodes the sovereignty, dignity and stature of Sri Lanka.

The Government is worried about reconciliation. Has it even implemented one of the several recommendations made by the LLRC in the Second Volume? The late Mr. C.R. de Silva, Chairman of LLRC, lamented that the Government has not taken steps to implement even the interim recommendations. I want the investigation to be carried out in Sri Lanka. As far as the Tamils are concerned, we have no one to complain to in Sri Lanka except to the very same person who infringes on our fundamental rights.

With regard to resettlement of Tamils, in Valikamam North, about 23 villages are yet to be resettled and about 28,000 persons are involved. In Thaiyiddy, 3,000 persons and in Myliddy, 5,000 persons got displaced from Valikamam North and they have not yet been resettled. Two hundred fifty families who got displaced from Valalai North have not yet been resettled there. I have written several letters in this connection to the GA, Jaffna, in this connection.

The United Nations Special Rapporteur, Dr. Chaloka Beyani, came to Sri Lanka and visited the places where resettlement has not taken place. He has, in his report to the UN, said that people who got displaced from an area must be resettled in that area itself.

In Keppapulavu, nearly 250 families have not yet been resettled. They were brought from Menik Farm as the last batch and put in a jungle. The village that adjoins Keppapulavu is Vattapalai. People have been resettled there but the difficulty that they face is that the agricultural lands belonging to them are situated in Keppapulavu; even their cemetery is in Keppapulavu and they are unable to go there.

About 1,200 families consisting of 6,000 persons were chased away from Sampur, which was declared a high security zone. These 6,000 persons, for the last five years, have been detained in camps. After chasing away these 6,000 persons, the Government declared a 10,000-

857 858

acre land as a high security zone and people cannot go there. As a result of this, people living in four villages are unable to go to their own lands. People from Sampur, Koonithivu, Saralaikuda and Sampukani were chased away and nobody is allowed to go and inspect these lands. When will the Government allow these 6,000 persons who were chased away from Sampur to go and resettle in their own lands? It is a breach of fundamental rights of a person, if he is prevented from going and living in his own land.

Regarding resettlement, we are unable to complain to anyone in Sri Lanka. I am a Member of the Consultative Committee on Defence and Urban Development and at a meeting presided over by President Rajapaksa, I requested him to allow the people from Myliddy to resettle in Myliddy itself and to develop Myliddy Fisheries Harbour as the best Fisheries Harbour in Sri Lanka. Before he could open his mouth the Hon. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who was there got up and said that that cannot be done.

Immediately after the war was over, Ban Ki-moon came to Sri Lanka, visited Vanni, inspected the area, came back and met the President. Both of them issued a Joint Statement where the President accepted accountability. Thereafter, Ban Ki-moon appointed a committee consisting of Darusman and two others to advise him on the condition in Sri Lanka and as to what happened during the war. They, without coming here, gave an up-to-date report to Ban Ki-Moon where they stated that about 40,000 Tamil civilians were brutally killed in the war. Is this not genocide? Further, Pulidevan, Nadesan and his wife - who was a Sinhalese lady - probably after getting the approval of the Government went to the army camp with a white flag. What happened to them? They were shot dead. What happened to Prabhakarans son who was a 14-year old boy? He was given some biscuits and some time later, they shot him. All what I have said have happened to the Sri Lankan Tamils; to whom can they complain? Can they complain to Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa? Preventing persons from going and living in their own lands is a breach of their fundamental rights.

I think the officers who are coming here to investigate are very senior officers handpicked by Navaneethan Pillay. One of them is a lady who was a Supreme Court Judge in New Zealand and she will be heading the Investigation Unit.

As far as the Tamils are concerned, we solely depend on the UNHRC to get the relief that we want. Therefore, we want the Government to allow the Investigation Unit to come to Sri Lanka and investigate.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, please wind up.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, give me one more minute please. If the war was conducted in a reasonable way, then why are they objecting to the Investigating Team coming to Sri Lanka? If nothing has been done by the army and if there is zero-death casualty, the Government need not worry about the investigating team coming to Sri Lanka. Thank you.

[5.10 p.m.] ... ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to speak. I wish to place on record certain matters. At the outset, without any hesitation, I wish to support the Resolution rejecting the UN Commission of Inquiry over the purported human rights violations in Sri Lanka. No citizen of the country can agree to an inquiry that infringes on the sovereignty of the country. Although the President can take a decision, he had decided to consult Parliament on this matter.

Now, Sir, I wish to make a statement with regard to the violent rampage conducted by attackers on the innocent and peaceful Muslim villagers of Alutgama, Dharga Town and Beruwala, causing the death of a number of Muslims and injuring many of them. Today, my heart bleeds as of every Muslim in Sri Lanka, over the planned attack on Muslims who lived peacefully with the Sinhalese all these days.

The first sign of conflict emerged when a private feud between the driver of a Venerable Buddhist monk and a Muslim was exasperated to imply as a conflict between a Buddhist monk and a Muslim individual. After two days of this incident, many Buddhist organizations including the Bodu Bala Sena and the Sinhala Ravaya organized a protest meeting on the 15th of June, 2014, where venom was spewed out in the worst hate speech I have ever heard in my whole life. I am sure everyone would have seen and heard that on YouTube, the Venerable Galaboda Aththe Gnanasara making his disgusting speech to incite the 8,000 audience, which provoked the people at the meeting to turn violent.

It was this speech that caused the attackers to set fire to houses, mosques and properties, which value more than Rs. 2,000 million. The attackers have looted jewellery, electronic equipment as well as other valuable belongings. The responsibility of the attack was clearly accepted by the Secretary of Bodu Bala Sena when, at the media briefing he had held soon after the ending of the attack, he said, we have now ended.

As you are aware, there has been total destruction of lives, livelihood and shelter of hundreds of Muslims. At least two confirmed deaths have been reported even though some media and unconfirmed reports give a much higher figure. Further, more than 50 houses have been attacked and damaged; some totally burnt.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Give me one more minute, Sir.

I am thankful to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa who tried to contain the violence. He spent sleepless nights talking to us and trying to ensure that lives are protected. I wish to thank the Hon. Prime Minister too for convening a meeting in this regard. I am also grateful to the Hon. Kumara Welgama and the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana, the two Ministers who attended to this immediately after this was brought to their notice.

Furthermore, I wish to tell you, Sir, that certain people made remarks that Saudi Arabia has been funding the extremists in Sri Lanka. But, this is all false; the allegation that had been made is totally baseless. I am proud to say that Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, has been helping enormously in Sri Lankas development efforts as well as in the challenges faced by Sri Lanka internationally.

I would also like to request that compensation be paid both to the Sinhalese and the Muslims early in order to reclaim their lives and livelihood.

I thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah. You have two minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha. You have only two minutes.

[5.17 p.m.] ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity.

The last few days have been the darkest days of my life after July 1983. Destruction based on race and religion is the lowest behaviour of mankind. Therefore, I believe that the Government would have a mechanism to hold an inquiry and bring those perpetrators to book and also to compensate all those who suffered as a result of this. I was on the ground during the last two days and therefore I am fully aware of what happened. I wrote to the Inspector-General of Police prior to the demonstration by the BBS and informed him that this demonstration should not take place.

While stating so, I would like to state in this House that whatever problems and differences we may have, we, as Sri Lankans, should stand together; we do not need international intervention. We have been colonized at one time of our history. We are a resilient nation and we are capable of solving our issues on our own. We do not want international forces coming and dictating terms to us. Therefore, I appeal to all Members of this House to support this Motion in the interests of Mother Lanka. Thank you.

[5.18 p.m.] ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have decided to speak in English because I want to get the message across the West. Due to time constraint, please allow me to table* my speech, so that it can go into Hansard and I will give the highlights in the little time that is available to me.

The main point is that terrorism has been committed by the LTTE over a period of 30 years and the people who are pointing the finger at us now were silent at that

time and they condoned in a way what went on. Now, they are pointing the finger at us not because they have concern for the Tamil people or the country; it is mainly because they want to wreak vengeance over the Government, which has an independent foreign policy and did not surrender Prabhakaran to them. The fact is that they have now come out with manufactured evidence to try to support their case. They claim that 40,000 civilians were killed when even the ICRC and the UN agencies here agreed that the number was around 7,000.

There is a classic example of the Channel 4 video. Prof. E.A. Yfantis, a world authority has shown that what was shown in that video as blood is not blood; the direction of fire did not coincide with the way in which the shot individual fell. So, it was all play-acted to give a false impression to the West and to the people of the world. So, this is what is being done in the name of concern for the minorities in our country by the US Empire and those loyal to the US Empire. They want to have a regime change here and to achieve that regime change, they are working to influence world public opinion, so that they can impose sanctions against our people and the Government. By doing that, they will be in a position to alienate the people from the Government and then try to topple this Government. That is the sole purpose, not justice for the Tamil people or justice for the minorities. It is just to get their own agenda across. They are prepared to go counter to the Charter of the United Nations in an attempt to do this because Sri Lanka has an independent foreign policy and it is friendly with those that America considers its enemies. They are directing this whole exercise to discredit and mud-sling, so that they can go ahead with their programme to impose sanctions, which will achieve regime change. In the case of Iran, it succeeded but Iran had a stable unified Islamic society. We have a diverse society and that type of action will lead to chaos and disruption of the whole fabric of our society.

Therefore, Members of the Opposition, we cannot allow this Committee of Inquiry which is really a bogus committee of inquiry to go ahead and sling mud at us and thereby try to create an international climate to bring about this change. Therefore I appeal to everybody, let us unite as one Sri Lankan nation without prejudices based on race, religion or caste and get together to fight this action from abroad. We can solve our problems; let us get together and do that.

Thank you very much. : :: Rest of the speech tabled:

The Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) warns the nation of the grave danger that it faces through the OHCHR Committee of Inquiry into alleged human rights violations in Sri Lanka and calls upon the nation to unite to defeat this manoeuvre. Our failure, after the defeat of

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

2014 18

LTTE terrorism and separatism in 2009, to effectively resolve the national question and properly implement the LLRC recommendations so as to unite as one Sri Lankan nation, has provided the opening for the rulers of the US Empire and its allies to use the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to set in motion a process which has as its main objective the toppling of a regime that is not prepared to conform with its agenda. The avowed purpose of their action is to facilitate the process of reconciliation and unite the nation, with great concern for minority rights, that of the Tamils and Muslims. But is, in reality, intended to achieve the very opposite; to divide and rule Sri Lanka once again through a puppet regime, regardless of whether in the process they have to crush us all, be it Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim. America produces 60% and Europe 20% of global armaments, and what better way to revive their ailing economies than to promote the sale of arms, which is the major industry. More conflicts and localized wars (in this nuclear age world wars are too dangerous for everybody) the better for the USA and allies.

The facts: Despite the warnings of the LSSP and CP leaders of the time, both the UNP and the SLFP stood for "Sinhala only" as the official language, and in 1956 the MEP Government implemented that policy. To correct the injustice done to the Tamil speaking people the leaders of the SLFP (SWRD Bandaranaike) and the UNP (Dudley Senanayake) tried to give a place to them through pacts with FP leader Chelvanayakam. But they caved into pressure from the Sinhala racists. The UNP Government promoted pogroms against the Tamils from 1977, culminating in the Black July of 1983, led to Tamil youth taking to armed struggle for separation. With the Indo-Sri Lanka Pact and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1987, all the Tamil militant groups, other than the LTTE, laid down arms and came into the democratic stream, seeking a political solution. The LTTE carried out a bloody terrorist internal war for separation, and was recognized even by the American CIA as the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world. Their crimes against humanity are beyond comparison. The killing of the President and several ministers, MPs, a former Prime Minister of India (Rajiv Gandhi), priests and thousands of innocent laymen during 26 years of armed conflict beggars description. Those pointing the finger at Sri Lanka today, be they the Governments of the USA and its allies, the UN System, down to the NGOs and human rights activists of today were strangely silent. The fact that more than 50% of Tamils live outside the North, many in and around the capital city of Colombo, and no violence was directed against them despite the atrocities committed by the LTTE, reflects the degree of tolerance and absence of racial hatred.

Care of Tamil Civilians: The political leadership provided by Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his regime, and the dedication and sacrifice of the Sri Lankan armed forces, defeated the LTTE on the battlefield. Till the last stages of the war there were no accusations against the armed forces of any systematic targeting of civilians, leave alone genocide. The Government looked after the Tamil civilians in the LTTE occupied areas of the North and East, providing them all the food, medicines and other services that they required. I was a member of the Polio Eradication Committee that ensured that every child in the North and East got his/her dose of vaccine on the due date. The USA helped the Government in its fight against LTTE terrorism. The problem arose in the last stages (months) of the war when the LTTE took Tamil civilians against their will as hostages, and started firing at the Army from their midst, even after the Government declared certain areas as no fire zones, in agreement with UN agencies. When the civilian casualties were rising the President acceded to the request made by me and Dew Gunasekara, at a meeting with the heads of the Armed forces, to stop the use of long range weaponry and only use short range weapons, even though it would lead to more Army casualties. Which other President would give such a directive. Certainly not US President Obama, who despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize, approves the use of drones that kills so many innocent civilians when targeting terrorists. If the Sri Lankan Army was guilty of genocide would the innocent civilians risk getting shot by the LTTE to escape and reach the Army camps, and the cleared areas.

Bogus casualty figures: Thus the insistence on accountability. When the ICRC and the UN agencies in Sri Lanka agree on a figure of about

7,000 for civilian casualties, and this fits in the generally accepted figure of 4 times as many being wounded in any war, ie. 28,000. The Navanethem Pillay Report, which is based on the Darusman Report, commissioned by UNSG Ban Ki-moon, claims that there were over 40,000 civilian deaths (the figure quoted by LTTE Diaspora sources). This should mean that there were around 160,000 wounded, which is way above the hospitalization figures, and is about half the total number of Tamil people in the area.

False Videos: To justify claims of torture, arbitrary execution of unarmed civilians and sexual abuse by the Army the Channel 4 (British TV) videos are resorted to. But experts such as Prof. E.A. Yfantis, Professor of Computer Science, University of Nevada, USA and consultant to the US Army have clearly stated that several parts of the video are fabrications (e.g. what is shown as blood is not blood, pictures of prisoners being shot and falling do not accord with the direction of fire etc.). There are extensively reported in the LLRC Report and Annexure.

Like in the USA and other western countries an Army Court of Inquiry has been appointed to go into these allegations against Army personnel. Lord Naseby of the British Parliament endorses such a course. But Pillay of the OHCHR is not prepared to accept this.

Rehabilitation: the figure is over 90%, and all child soldiers have been rehabilitated. Resettlement of internally displaced is going ahead but admittedly the question has legal complications which delay the process, and it needs to be speeded up. The process of Reconstruction is going ahead at a good pace, but it would be better effected if it is decentralized and not Colombo based as at present. More effective functioning of the Northern Provincial Council would help. The process of Reconciliation and national integration is making some progress where Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara of the Left is involved, but overall, due to logistic reasons like the lack of translators, and, particularly the political process through the Select Committee of parliament leaves much to be desired.

Vengeance: It is clear that despite the progress made to restore normalcy and the setting up of suitable internal mechanisms to address the accountability issue and problems of resettlement, rehabilitation, and reconstruction, the US Empire is committed to extract vengeance against the democratically elected popular UPFA Government and its leader President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The US Government exercised maximum pressure on the Sri Lankan Government to capture and hand over to it Prabhakaran and the other LTTE leaders. The fact that they were killed and thereby the LTTE and its terrorist action was brought to an end should be appreciated by the USA and the whole world if their genuine desire is to end terrorism. But clearly where Bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda is concerned it is one set of principles and where it is the LTTE it is another. The fact that the LTTE Diaspora is powerful lobby with both financial and political clout in the USA, Canada, Britain and Europe may also be a factor in the equation. The LTTE was a powerful tool in carrying out the US policy of "divide and rule" in Sri Lanka. The question is can it fashion another tool, or install a puppet regime?

The President and the present UPFA Government carries out a non-aligned foreign and trade policy. It is friendly with Cuba, Venezuela and other Left and progressive governments in Latin America. It is friendly with countries that the USA dislikes like Iran, China, Vietnam and North Korea. It is not a puppet regime that is prepared to treat countries that the USA considers enemies as its own enemies. The UPFA Government has strong economic links with China. Its internal policies are for the development of a sustainable national economy in the interest of the people of Sri Lanka, which is not Neo-liberal, that is giving pride of place to market forces and foreign multinational corporations (MNCs).

This is why the US Empire is prepared to counter to the Charter of the United Nations, when there is an ongoing accountability and reconciliation process internally, on its own admission, to institute for the first time an external UN probe against a democratically elected and functioning UN Member country. The fact that a majority of the

905 906

UNHRC members did not support the US resolution at the Geneva meeting, despite all the pressure exerted, has not deterred the US rulers. It is evident that the groundwork for the OHCHR (Pillay) probe was laid soon after the end of the war in 2009, and that the evidence has already been manufactured to discredit Sri Lanka in the eyes of the world and a team of yes men/ women has been put together to polish it up to convince the world. The aim is to justify the imposition of economic sanctions that would so burden the people of Sri Lanka (high cost of living and lost jobs) that they would turn against their own government, through the parliamentary process or outside it. UN sanctions are out because Russia and China, two permanent members of the Security Council have already indicated their opposition to the US attack on Sri Lanka. But the door is open for the USA and its subservient allies to apply economic sanctions against the people of Sri Lanka, as they did against the innocent babies of Iraq who were deprived of milk, and they did against Iran to engineer a regime change.

Iran is after a social revolution and is by and large united under one philosophy as a stable Islamic state and could smoothly achieve the requisite regime change. But Sri Lanka is a deeply divided society on lines of race, religion and caste, as well as class. A forced regime change will be accompanied by deep and highly traumatic and damaging social turmoil on the lines witnessed in so many countries in the Middle East, Africa and even Asia (Thailand). Once sanctions are imposed all the people will suffer, be they Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim.

Let us unite: Therefore let us all unite as one Sri Lankan nation at this grave hour of impending crisis. Let us all vote against this American plot presented in the guise of the OHCHR probe. Let us put our House in order. Have a properly constituted inclusive Select Committee process in Parliament to solve the national question. Optimally implement the LLRC recommendations. Have more effective devolution and support the Northern Provincial Council so as to win over the Tamil people. Let us eliminate racial, religious and caste prejudice and build a Sri Lankan identity and unite as one Sri Lankan nation. This is the best way to defeat these destructive moves. Let us solve our problems ourselves to our liking without outside interference on their agendas.

[5.45 p.m.] .. ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to deliver the winding up speech of the Government, while you are occupying the Chair.

This is basically a Debate in which the Government is setting out its reasons for opposing an international investigation. Sir, it is always necessary to bear in mind, in relation to this supposed international inquiry, what its true purpose is. Nobody must think that this is a fair, impartial inquiry which will look at the facts in a spirit of detachment and come to a just conclusion. It is nothing of the kind. I would like to ask, during the entire period of 30 years when we had a ferocious onslaught on this country by a terrorist organization, how many resolutions were brought before the Human Rights Council with regard to that matter? Not one, Mr. Speaker! Throughout

that period when this country was subject to terrorism of an unmitigated form, there was not one resolution that was brought before the Human Rights Council.

After the end of hostilities when the country is moving forward, there have been as many as three Resolutions in three consecutive years. That is the reality of the matter. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made the astonishing statement that Sri Lanka had resorted to various courses of action under the guise of terrorism - "guise of terrorism"! That is, terrorism was a pretence; there was no terrorism. She actually made that statement. The phrase she used was under the guise of terrorism. The first call for an international investigation was made within one week of the cessation of hostilities, and that call has been repeated at regular intervals. It is, therefore, impossible to expect a fair and just conclusion to be arrived at, at the conclusion of this investigation.

There has been a great deal of distortion with regard to the Joint Statement issued by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations Secretary-General in May 2009. The sentence that was grossly misinterpreted was the final sentence in this Joint Communiqu. The sentence is as follows: The Government will take measures to address those grievances. All it says is that if there are grievances, the Government will take steps to address those grievances, and the phrase used here in the earlier sentence, "in keeping with international human rights standards". So, if there are grievances, they will be inquired into in keeping with international human rights standards. That does not mean at all that we acquiesce in an international inquiry. There will be an inquiry conducted locally in this country in accordance with domestic procedures in keeping with international standards. It does not mean in any manner whatsoever that we are agreeing to an international inquiry. That is a gross misinterpretation of the Joint Statement.

Then, Sir, I would like to say that these are the main reasons why we think that an international investigation is grossly unfair and we cannot accept it. There has been a total lack of balance in recognizing the legitimate and indeed obvious achievements of this country since 2009 with regard to the resettlement of internally-displaced persons, the reintegration into society of ex-combatants, the demining process, the huge infrastructure that has been built up in the Northern Province and the holding of the Northern Provincial Council Elections. There is very little acknowledgement of all these achievements and whatever acknowledgement there has been, is grudging and belated. So, when we consider the magnitude of the challenges that the country was faced with in 2009 and the brevity of the period we had to deal with those challenges, there has not been a balanced assessment of the progress made. There has been no uniformity of the standards applied. Very special standards have been applied to Sri Lanka; standards which have not been applied to any other post-conflict situation in any part of

913 914

the world. It has been a highly selective treatment of our country. We also have a very strong objection that the resolutions on the basis of which this international investigation is to be conducted, are unacceptably intrusive.

The Resolutions purport to deal with such matters as the relationship between the Central Government and the Northern Provincial Council, the role of the Governor, and the role of the Chief Minister. These are all domestic political issues and have nothing to do with the legitimate mandate of the Human Rights Council. Technical assistance is something that a country should request. It is not possible to impose technical assistance on anybody; there cannot be compulsion. If a country spontaneously and freely requests technical assistance, it can be provided but not against the will of the sovereign nation in question.

It is also very clear that the impetus comes from the diaspora. That is perfectly clear. The best example of that is that a sitting Cabinet Minister in a country made a statement to a leading newspaper in that country saying that he was embarrassed by the behaviour of his government in relation to some of these groups. The next thing that happened was that the Minister who made that statement was compelled to withdraw that statement. In another country, the leaders of that country wrote a letter to the diaspora groups expressing gratitude for the support which has been received from those groups at a referendum which was held in that country. In one paragraph, there is an effusive expression of gratitude to those groups and in the next paragraph of the letter, which we have in our possession, the writer of the letter says, in substance, that he is aware of the concerns of the people to whom the letter is addressed, about the situation in Sri Lanka and that empathy and understanding in respect of these issues, are assured.

When some foreign leaders speak of a spotlight to be flashed on Sri Lanka, it would be a good idea to turn the searchlight inwards and to examine some of the issues in those countries. Today, the reality of the situation is that this campaign is being carried on not for the benefit of the people in this country but in order to satisfy the ambitions of influential politicians abroad.

Some of the countries, which did not support the Resolution in Geneva, had a very pertinent point to make. What they said was that a solution has to be sought in this country. It cannot be found elsewhere and any course of action that is adopted must have the objective of enlarging the scope for constructive dialogue in this country. Japan said that very clearly; India said that very clearly. In the case of India, they departed from the course of action which they had adopted during the last two years and, in explaining the change that they made with regard to their attitude, they specifically said, We want to enlarge the space that is available for a constructive dialogue.

I would also like to make the point to this august Assembly that out of the 36 countries which co-sponsored the Resolution, 33 were from Europe and North America. Thirty three out of thirty six countries that co-sponsored the Resolution were from Europe and North America. The Continent of Asia has 13 Members in the Human Rights Council and only one of those countries voted in favour of the US Resolution.

The Continent of Africa also has 13 members in the Human Rights Council and of those 13 African countries, only four supported the Human Rights Council Resolution. Australia and New Zealand declined to co-sponsor. They are not members of the Human Rights Council. They were asked to co-sponsor but they declined to do so. If that is the position, can we really say with any degree of sincerity that this represents world opinion? What is international opinion without China, without Russia, without Japan, without India, without the overwhelming majority of countries in Asia and Africa, without all the Arab countries? Can this be genuinely regarded as international opinion?

I would also like to say, Mr. Speaker, that when we talk of reconciliation, different cultures have different approaches to reconciliation. One of the most interesting discussions I had during the last two days was with the Foreign Minister of Chile, His Excellency Heraldo Munoz, who made a very pertinent comment in the course of my discussion with him. He said that the effective path of reconciliation depends very much on the context, on the history and the traditions of the country, on the background against which a process of reconciliation moves forward. He was making these observations particularly in relation to his own country, and what we find totally unacceptable about the Resolution is that it is an attempt to impose upon us the values and the culture of a different part of the world. It may serve them well, but our culture is different, our ideas of accountability and reconciliation are different. The retributive content of accountability and reconciliation is not the dominant idea in our culture. These are the differences that have to be taken into account in evolving for ourselves a course of action which will deliver on the ground the results which we desire.

So, these are the reasons, Mr. Speaker, why we believe that this is a matter which has to be dealt with above the level of partisan politics. Whatever issues there are in this country, we need to resolve them within the shores of Sri Lanka. What is happening in different parts of the world today makes it amply clear that any attempt at external intervention, without sensitivity to the structures of the society in question - there are many examples - right now, as I speak here, all over the world there are many situations which amply illustrate the reality that that kind of intervention does much more harm than good. That is why we think that, with one voice, we should declare unequivocally that external

intervention in this form is totally unacceptable, and not at all, in keeping with the dignity and the traditions of our country.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, rejecting an international investigation can only be done acceptably if there is a credible local mechanism. Therefore, credible and independent institutions must be restored to address the issue of accountability as a matter of urgency. It is in this context that the United National Party is proposing the following amendment:

I, do hereby move the Resolution bearing No. P.212/14 in Addendum 11(5) of 13.6.2014 standing in the names of Hon. Achala Jagodage, Hon. (Mrs.) Malani Fonseka, Hon. Janaka Bandara, Hon. Udith Lokubandara, Hon. A. H.M. Azwer, Hon. Shantha Bandara, Hon. J.R.P. Suriyapperuma, Hon. Nimal Wijesinghe, Hon. R. Duminda Silva, be amended by addition of the following words at the end of the said Resolution:

This House regrets that the Government failed to consult Parliament prior to -

(a) issuing the Joint Communiqu with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 23rd May 2009. (b) jointly sponsoring a Resolution at the UNHRC,

bearing No. S-11/1 in May 2009 and the matters agreed upon; and

(c) making written submissions to the Darusman Panel; And, the Parliament calls upon the Government to -

(i) bring the relevant Bills before the House

within two months;

(ii) fully implement the totality of the Recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) (iii) revive the provisions of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution; (iv) incorporate Latimer House Principles as an integral part of the Constitution; and (v) make provisions for the Freedom of

Information.
