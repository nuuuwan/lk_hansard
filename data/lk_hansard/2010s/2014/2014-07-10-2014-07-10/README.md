1. Yes. 2. This visit was following a request from the Government of Sri Lanka. During the bilateral meeting that took place between the President of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa and the President of the Republic of South Africa, His Excellency Jacob Zuma, on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting - CHOGM - in November 2013, the President of Sri Lanka expressed interest in ascertaining what lessons, if at all, Sri Lanka could elicit from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission -TRC - Process in South Africa. Thereafter, President Zuma designated Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, Deputy President of South Africa as Special Envoy to Sri Lanka, to share South Africas experience of the TRC process. The visit therefore was undertaken in the capacity of a mutual sharing of views on the TRC in order to explore the possibility of adopting a similar mechanism taking into account social and cultural particularities of the country. For the success of such a domestic reconciliation process the

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are in the month of Holy Ramazan. The Muslims in Sri Lanka and the world over are observing the Ramazan fast as ordained by Allah Subhanahu Wa Tha'ala in the Holy Quran. The world is blessed with this month. The Holy Quran was revealed on the 27th of Ramazan. The word "Islam" denotes peace. So, there should be peace throughout the world and we are very happy today to bring peace to you, to this august Assembly. By observing fast, we also develop in ourselves a spiritual feeling. It is not only a physical exercise, it is a spiritual upliftment of mankind as well.

Sir, today, I stand up to thank the Hon. Speaker for making all arrangements for the Muslim Members and staff to break fast in the restaurant downstairs. That is a very great gesture that the world of Islam must know, that the Muslims in Tamil Nadu must know. Is such a thing happening in the Lok Sabha or in the Rajya Sabha, I ask. It is happening in the "Sri Lankan Sabha", in our Parliament. We are, therefore, thankful to the Directors of Catering and Housekeeping Services, Mr. Suren Perera and Mr. L.J. Kulathunga backed by their efficient staff, all the people working in the restaurant and all our brothers who are assisting us in this Chamber for inviting us to break fast, for the Iftar ceremony.

Sir, after breaking fast - we have to emphasize these facts - we recite dua, a prayer. What do we say: Allahumma inni laka samtu wa bika aamantu wa alayka tawakkaltu wa ala rizq-ika-aftartu, which means, "Oh! Allah, I believe in you, I observed the fast and now I am breaking fast with food that cometh from thee. Therefore accept our fast".

Now, this is the prayer that Muslims are directed to recite. All other incidents are man-made. My Colleague, the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala was talking about the kalu enduma and sudu enduma. It does not matter what colour a Muslim lady is wearing, but she is expected, under the strict Islamic laws, to cover her head. There are people in some parts of the world like Iran where they wear black while in other countries, they wear white. The most important thing is that you have a garb covering your femininity; you do not expose yourselves. That is the culture that the human beings have got to develop and we are expected to do so.

Sir, when I was small, there was an aunt of mine, Marhoom Laila Ummah from Maharagama who used to come. She gets down at the Maradana Railway Station and takes a rickshaw. She carries a tuppatti. You must be aware of it. I used to carry the tuppatti for her and as she gets off the train, she wears that. It is a very beautiful lace-like white cloth. The ladies look very beautiful in that and they visit the houses of their relatives wearing that.

So, what is required is that you have to develop in human beings a culture that would not be equal to the animal culture.

During this Debate the issue of Alutgama was much talked about. Now, what happened? During that most unfortunate incident, atrocities were committed on the Muslims by BBS or whoever, extremists alien to Islam. I have with me the Holy Quran in my hand. I am very happy that our Minister, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake is to wind up this Debate today. He knows what Islam is. He distributed the few packets of dates that he got from the Ministry to all the mosques in his area. Today, Sir, everywhere in Sri Lanka, the Buddhist Monks are invited to the mosques for Iftar. It is not only in Parliament that we are having this Iftar; on the 17th of this month, the Mussalmans are invited together with the Diplomatic Corps to "Temple Trees" by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to break fast, for Iftar.

Sir, I, in this House yesterday condemned most vehemently the atrocity, the mayhem unleashed on the people of Alutgama by whoever it may be, the BBS or any "Sena". I will fight to take up the cause of the Muslims if injustice has been done. That, I have been doing right along inside the House and even outside.

From Bolivia, His Excllency the President came here, rushed immediately to Beruwala and held a meeting of peace with the Moulavis, the Ulemas, the local leaders and also with the Venerable Theros. The Dinamina newspaper dated 19th July, 2014 carried a news item together with photographs to this effect:

" . - . , , ." He has told that without mincing his words.

Then, again there was a workshop for the Government Members at Cinnamon Bay Hotel in Beruwala. In the midst of the meeting, His Excellency the President could not hold back his feelings and he rushed to the Alutgama area. The Dinamina newspaper of 1st July, 2014 carried several photographs to the following effect, and so did the other Sinhala and English newspapers. " - ..."

He has ordered houses to be built.

,

. The BBS is calling for the banning of the Shoora Council. What is "Shoora"? Shoora means consultation. The Holy Quran very clearly describes this. I quote:

"' ' - " - ( 42:38)

So, nobody needs to be frightened.

425 426

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please now wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, originally I was allotted 15 minutes. Can you give me another two more minutes, please?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, you have been allotted only nine minutes. The Hon. Minister has to speak.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir.

Now, even in Saudi Arabia, there is a Consultative Assembly called, Shoora Council", that is the Parliament there. Sir, I will wind up my speech quoting an article which appeared in The Island newspaper of 09th July, 2014 :

When contacted for comment, NSC Deputy President M.M. Zuhair PC

He is one of our distinguished former Colleagues.

..said that National Shoora Council was a forum of all Muslim Associations in Sri Lanka.

We need not fear about it.

" We never asked anyone to ban Bodu Bala Sena as we respect Buddhist revivalism, but the government should have a methodology to stop unnecessary acts by BBS like the Alutgama mayhem, Zuhair said, adding that except NSC all others had called for a ban on the BBS.

The former ambassador said that some statements of the BBS and posters provoked Sinhala people into attacking Muslims in Alutgama, but the NSC saw the need for the Sinhalese and Muslims to co-exist for the well-being of the country.

Zuhair said that they had not been to any embassy to complain about the Alutgama incident and they remained silent even when the embassies asked them about it."

That is real patriotism, Sir. I also owe a debt of gratitude to the police, especially to the IGP N.K. Illangakoon who is one of the best IGPs we have got. He is a man of peace, Sir, for us to remember during the month of Ramazan. Even His Excellency the President told me to ring him up whenever an incident takes place in any part of the country. So, I ring him up and then he takes action.

So is the DIG Anura Senanayake, and all the top brass of the Police. They have done a great service in order to

restore peace. Now, the rehabilitation of minds and the reconstruction of houses and buildings are being carried out under the direction of His Excellency The President himself. He has allocated, firstly, about Rs. 200 million for the reconstruction of those houses.

When I see the face of the Hon. Salinda Dissanayake, I cannot forget how much he is liked by the Muslims of Kurunegala. Over one lakh of Muslims are living in the Kurunegala District. It is so in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and all the other areas. Our protection is assured when living in peace and understanding with the Sinhalese in the Sinhalese areas. Our protection is assured when living in peace and understanding with the Tamils in the Tamil areas. Let us not add piduru to this burning fire. Let us extinguish all fires and pray to Allah Subhanahu Wa Tha'ala during this holy month of Ramazan that there be peace in the land and the world over. Let our law officers - the police - be given the freedom to carry out their duties so that the law and order is maintained in this country.
