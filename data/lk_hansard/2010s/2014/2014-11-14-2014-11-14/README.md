INTERIM REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara - Minister of Human Resources) Mr. Speaker, in keeping with my pledge to this House, I wish to present the Second Interim Report of the

Committee on Public Enterprises for the year 2014, covering the activities for the period 7th May to 26th September, 2014.

Mr. Speaker, hitherto, on behalf of the COPE, I have presented, in all, five reports to this august Assembly. That is, two Final Reports and three Interim Reports during the period of the Seventh Parliament, commencing from June, 2010. In all, we have completed 598 examinations within a period of four years. This is an unprecedented record in the history of our Legislature.

Mr. Speaker, as you know, the need for a separate oversight committee, the COPE, arose with the expansion of the Public sector in our economy. If I take a glance at the history of the COPE since its inception in 1979, the COPE has covered 680 examinations during a period of 31 years up to the end of the Sixth Parliament; whereas, under your leadership and within a period of four years, the COPE has covered nearly 700 examinations.

Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report to this House, through you, that the COPE has accomplished its constitutional task of financial control effectively and expeditiously. The Final Report for the year 2014 is already under preparation, and I propose to table it towards the end of this year or at the beginning of next year.

Mr. Speaker, the Second Interim Report I am tabling today, includes findings and recommendations of the Committee on Public Enterprises in respect of 46 institutions examined during the period May to September 2014. The Report unveils the situations of non-compliance with rules and regulations, inefficiencies and non-transparent transactions. The audit opinion expressed has also been included this time in the current Report. In this connection, Mr. Speaker, there were adverse opinions in respect of two institutions, and we were compelled to recommend even the removal of Chairmen and General Managers, and the Executive has complied with the request of the Legislature. This is also an unprecedented event.

With regard to the financial status of the 16 strategic business enterprises examined during the period, three institutions have incurred losses while the rest have either turned profit-making or increased their profits.

Mr. Speaker, in response to requests made by the Hon. Members at the last Debate on the COPE Report, the Committee took steps to appoint a follow-up Committee chaired by the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera to pursue and report whether our recommendations are being complied with and this innovation has been proved effective.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report to the House that there was a swift response received from the General

1827 1828

Treasury soon after the last Interim Report was presented and the initiative taken by the Secretary to the Treasury himself needs to be appreciated. In response to our repeated requests that the financial regulations should be revised which had been unrevised since 1966, I am happy to report to the House that the Cabinet has just given approval to the new financial regulations and they will be circulated very soon among the public officials.

Mr. Speaker, on a directive given by the Committee, the State-owned companies registered under the Companies Act have now been brought under the scrutiny by the COPE. Even the companies which have a fair percentage of State capital, now come under the COPE.

Mr. Speaker, now that you have called upon the Hon. Members to submit their views for the necessary amendments to the Standing Orders, the COPE will seize this opportunity to present its own recommendations towards strengthening the powers of the COPE.

Mr. Speaker, it is our view that the COPE has been able to contribute appreciably towards the enhancement of good governance insofar as public control of finance is concerned.

I wish to thank the Auditor-General's Department, the Department of Public Enterprises and the Department of National Budget of the General Treasury for their co-operation and also, I would like to make a special mention of the contribution made by Chairmen of the three subcommittees and also the Chairman of the follow-up committee.

Last but not least, I wish to record my deep appreciation of the co-operation extended by the Parliamentary staff attached to the COPE office. They have really contributed to enhance the prestige of the COPE.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

. . rose.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We would like to place on record our appreciation of the work done by the Chairman of the COPE. My only

concern is whether your recommendations are being strictly followed by the respective line Ministries. That is the crux of the matter. You are doing all the work and submitting report after report, but whether the follow-up actions are being implemented by the Cabinet Ministers is the problem. That is the first matter.

The second one is, why do you not amend the Standing Orders in order to bring the press into Committee Sessions? Let the country also know what is happening in your Committee and let the people know the deficiencies reported by the Auditor-General.

( ) (The Chairman) . . [10.25 a.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Chairman, I am happy to speak today opening the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs from the Government side. The United National Party is a great party. The first speaker who spoke for 10 minutes wanted half an hour. If he was given one hour even, he would have spoken without any substance. Then, Sir, the winding-up speech

has been given to an actor. I think all on that side are actors. Damn shame!

Hon. Chairman, being a lawyer, he was talking about a court case. I do not think that he knows what the law at least is. - [Interruption.] Yes, that is right. Sir, the European Union and the western world started going against Sri Lanka only after the war was over. Otherwise, they would have continuously given us all the cooperation and their NGOs operating in Sri Lanka would have been supporting the war to continue. So, now the reason is obvious to you as to why these people are against Sri Lanka and its stability in this region. The President has not only ended the war, but has created stability in the country as well as in the region. But, the United National Party has no substance. They speak in jealousy and talk about antagonizing the western world.

Sir, our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa won several international awards which no President or a Head of State in Sri Lanka has ever won. In Bolivia, the title of the award that he won was, Parliamentary Order Merit Democratic Rep. Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruza. Then, in Bahrain he won the, Khalifa Medal, and in Palestine, he won the Star of Palestine. These are awards given to international leaders for the extraordinary work done during their tenure, which a normal leader cannot perform.

Then, if I am to talk about politicization, I would like to mention that the number of appointments or recruits to the Ministry of External Affairs has increased during the current Presidents time and also the number of Missions. I would like to state that in 1978, the political appointments were at 78.79 per cent. I think you forget the past and dwell in the present because of jealousy and because there is nothing else to say. In 1982, it was at 59.38 per cent. Probably, that was the time when you did not have enough people or people did not want to take up positions because of the 1980-83 riots. So was the number during 1984, being at 61 per cent. In 1991, it was 65.79 per cent. Therefore, we have not politicized the Ministry, but implemented the procedure and the Vision of the President, Mahinda Chintana. These are the Heads of Missions and officers who implement the Presidents opinion and the vision of the country.

The divisions of the Ministry of External Affairs are headed by officers of the Foreign Service, instructing foreign Embassies, Ambassadors and Missions to do what they should do. If you introduce your friends and kith and kin to the Ministry, that is politicization. But, the implementation of the foreign policy and the Mahinda Chintana is obviously done by the Head of State.

Then, I would like to mention a few names who headed Missions from the years 1977 to 1996. The list is led by the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, who was a Head of a Mission.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Where is he now? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Is he the Deputy Leader or the Assistant Leader? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No man's leader. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) What he is going to lead, I do not know.

Then, also in the list are N. Wimalasena, Sirisena Cooray, Edwin Tillekeratne, P.B.G. Kalugalle, S.W. Alawatuwala and C. Rajadurai, ex-Members of Parliament and famous names of the '77 Regime. Mangala Moonesinghe, A.R. Munsoor, U.B. Wijekoon, Rupa Karunatilleke, Ariya B. Rekawa and also the beauty queen, Mrs. World, the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake too worked as Heads of Missions. Now, we have in service, Gamini Rajapakse, who was also serving in the UNP, H.R. Piyasiri, another fomer Member of Parliament, Mr. Pradeep Jayewardene, grandson of a former President and the late Mr. Asitha Perera, another nephew of the Leader of the Opposition, who was married to the Leader's niece.

Then, I have to state that there were visits by several Heads of States during the last few years, a substantial increase compared to number of those who came during the earlier regime. From the beginning of 2014 up to now, seven Heads of States, six Heads of UN Missions, nine Foreign Ministers and five foreign dignitaries have come.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yesterday, the Head of Mauritania came to Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Similarly, in 2013, there had been visits by 12 Heads of States, in 2012, by 15 Heads of States and the list goes on.

Basically, we are fighting the LTTE diaspora, which is controlling the western world, abroad. That is the fight that we have now taken on. The armed struggle in Sri Lanka, we won. There are two foreign lands equipped with all the resources, which they diverted to the war. But now, they have bought over people who make decisions, to make decisions against Sri Lanka and to destabilize not only Sri Lanka, but the whole region.

Sir, then I would like to mention about the Consular Service, which is the only service in the country that starts at 6.30 in the morning, not for any other reason, but to give a service to the people who come from afar. Over 1,000 people come there and we have earned a substantial amount through that, which is the face of the Ministry of External Affairs. It coordinates with all the other relevant Ministries and certifies documents, which has earned over Rs. 100 million this year alone. There are a number of cases which the Consular Division of the Ministry of External Affairs has won for the people working abroad, the expatriate workers. It also helps in bringing down corpses of those workers to the country and, looks into the issues they face in other countries with the coordination and the coorporation of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, headed by the Hon. Dilan Perera.

We have also increased the amount of compensation paid to Sri Lankan workers abroad tenfold, if you compare it with what was paid five years ago. It has gone up by over Rs. 75 million and that is a big saving, which would never have been received by those people, if not for the Ministry of External Affairs and its competent staff. If I take the total number of countries from which we received compensation, from about 12 countries, we got the highest amount of compensation. In 2012, the total amount was Rs. 176 million, in 2013, Rs. 203 million and this year, up to last month, it has been Rs. 270 million.

Finally, Sir, I would like to thank the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, who is doing a great job; then, our Monitoring MP, who is coordinating a lot of work in the Ministry and other Ministries and our able Secretary, Mrs. Kshenuka Senewiratne, as well as the 17 Heads who are leading this Ministry.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Where is Kshenuka Senewiratne?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) She is here. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They all are here. Do you want to see her? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) You can see them in the Officials' Box. I know that you would like to see beautiful ladies.

Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to thank them and I am very happy working with them.

1861 1862

2014 14

Thank you very much, Hon. Chairman, for giving me this time.

( ) (The Chairman) Then, Hon. R. Sampanthan. You have only 30 minutes. [10.36 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I believe I have 30 minutes, Mr. Chairman, but the Hon. John Amaratunga has agreed to grant me five minutes more.

Sir, non-alignment has been the cornerstone of our Foreign Policy. It may be that there were times when we deviated from this policy, but that has been rare and has had its own consequences.

Generally, we have been steadfast in our adherence to the policy of non-alignment. We have maintained an equidistance and I would, in that context, like to pose the question, what has been the policy of the present Government? Has this Government, for narrow parochial domestic considerations, sacrificed this policy of non-alignment with consequences which can be dire for the whole country?

This has happened, Sir, through activities in several areas: trade, economic co-operation to an unprecedented degree with one country, defence co-operation again with the same country and geostrategic co-operation including maritime co-operation with that same country. There are concerns in Sri Lanka.

In fact, over the huge projects being undertaken by China in Sri Lanka, which are somewhat lacking in transparency, and even without being explicitly requested by Sri Lanka on loans with high rates of interest, it is alleged that some projects are very lucrative to some individuals.

I want to read, Sir, certain comments that appeared in "The Sunday Times" newspaper recently. This is what it says. I quote:

Contemporary bilateral ties between the two countries, ...."

that is Sri Lanka and China.

".......however, are neither straightforward nor transparent and key elements of the relationship have caused serious worry across the Palk Strait. New Delhi has always been wary of Chinas geostrategic interests in South Asia. But nothing has raised its hackles more in recent times than Chinas aggressive expansion into Sri Lanka and Colombos unquestioning acceptance of it.

In another paragraph it says, I quote:

The domestic picture is also disquieting. The most alarming aspect of the Sino-Lanka alliance is that citizens are kept deliberately ignorant of what is really going on. This might work for China which operates on the principle that what its people do not know will not hurt them. But it is not what Sri Lanka, once an open and vibrant democracy, needs.

So, Sir, the view is being expressed by a number of people that insofar as the China-Sri Lanka relationship is concerned, many things were happening secretly and without the public knowing about it. By acting in this way, is Sri Lanka preserving its sovereignty? Sri Lanka howls that its sovereignty is being breached by sections of the international community who merely call upon Sri Lanka to observe treaties and conventions to which Sri Lanka has voluntarily subscribed and which Sri Lanka is bound to honour.

It would be relevant, Sir, to look at the role played by China during the regime of President Mahinda Rajapaksa as compared with its role over a long period of time, including periods of Sri Lanka Freedom Party rule under Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the subsequent rule of the SLFP under President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

The total assistance extended by China to Sri Lanka during the period 1971 to 2012, around 41 years, was US Dollars 5,056 billion of which US Dollars 4,761 billion, approximately 94 per cent, was extended between 2005 and 2012, around seven years, that was during the term of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The funding promised by China in the period 2012 to 2014 is said to be around US Dollars 2.18 billion, the majority as a loan; of the total funding in the period 2005 to 2013, only 2 per cent is grant while 98 per cent is loan. In contrast, I would like to look at Indian assistance to Sri Lanka. It is approximately US Dollars 1.3 billion, one-third of that amount is by way of grant.

Is this a clear indication of President Mahinda Rajapaksas insensitivity to the concerns of neighbouring India, recognized as the regional power in South Asia, or is it the pursuit of a deliberate, pre-determined programme to undermine Indian interests and thereby isolate India so as to free itself from obligations and commitments made to India not only in the interests of reconciliation, peace and harmony within Sri Lanka but also in the region? No country has greater links with Sri Lanka politically, economically, socially and culturally than India. Are these actions intended to undermine all these linkages which have their roots in both geography and history?

Sir, I want to pose this question. Is a position sought to be created where India will not be able to play any role in Sri Lanka in keeping with Indias role over the past three decades and consistent with Indias historical, geographical and cultural links with Sri Lanka?

1863 1864

Does President Mahinda Rajapaksa think that China would be supportive of his pursuing a narrow political agenda in Sri Lanka? This is the question that is most worrisome from the point of view of people who are concerned about the future. There is also a great deal of concern that such a course of action would not be in the interests of Sri Lanka, India or the region.

Of course, there is also the possibility of the very large loans that have been given by China to Sri Lanka being converted into equity and it is a matter of grave concern to many Sri Lankans who are concerned` with protecting the countrys independence in every way.

Sri Lanka claims that it will have operational control over many projects executed by China. To what extent this will be possible is questionable. The extent of indebtedness of Sri Lanka to China would result in Sri Lanka being denied the opportunity to exercise any such operational control.

There is defence co-operation between Sri Lanka and China which in recent times has received prominence. There were reports mid this year of the establishment of a Maintenance Facility in Trincomalee by China. This proposal had Cabinet approval. This would have been in contravention of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement.

A Chinese submarine along with a Chinese warship docked in the Colombo Port in September 2014. It docked again in the Colombo Port on its return. Though various assurances are given by Sri Lanka - when things that did not happen earlier happen now, they cause concern and raise the question of whether there is new thinking, whether it is sought to undermine and marginalize India by Chinese dominance - the million-dollar question being with what consequences eventually, both for India and Sri Lanka.

I want to raise, Sir, some other matters of concern, which are strategic in nature. Some of these matters reached some stage of finality when the Chinese President, Xi Jinping undertook a State Visit to Colombo on the 16th and 17th of September 2014. The first would be the Colombo Port and Harbour. As of now 70 per cent of the transshipment business in the Colombo Port is India-related. The South Container Terminal at the Colombo Port has been developed and for a period of 35 years will be operated by a consortium led by China and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. It was here that the Chinese warship and submarine docked recently.

Hambantota Harbour and Port: For Phase I, China provided US 307 million, 85 per cent of the total cost of Phase I. Phase II would reportedly cost US 810 million. During President Xis visit in September 2014, a Supply-Operate-Transfer Agreement was signed, which will be

valid for 35 years, and four out of the seven container berths would be used by a Chinese Company.

Colombo Port City Project: This is a mega project. It will result in the creation of a new city by reclaiming 233 hectares of land from the sea at a cost of US Dollars 1.4 billion. It was inaugurated by President Xi Jinping when he was in Colombo on 17th September 2014. Hundred and twenty five hectares would belong to Sri Lanka. Eighty eight hectares would be leased to China on a 99-year lease. Twenty hectares would be given o China on a freehold basis which means that almost half the land or a little less than half the land would eventually be under Chinas control.

Maritime Cooperation: Sri Lanka supports Chinas plan to build a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. A Joint Committee is being set up on Coastal and Marine Cooperation to cooperate in search for wreckage, ocean observation, marine and coastal zone management. All types of surveys can be carried out. What are the implications of all these steps? The position would result in China acquiring not merely influence, but dominance from the West to the South of Sri Lanka. That would be the real position, not merely in some little place. These facts have established, Sir, the firm grip that China has over Sri Lanka. Is it firstly in Sri Lankan interests or in the interests of the Sri Lankan people, is it in the interests of our neighbour, India, the regional power in South Asia? What would be consequences of these steps? This is the matter, Sir, that I consider my duty to raise in this House. In the context of such activities, can we be said to be genuinely following a policy of non-alignment? And are we not sacrificing our stature and respect on the world scene for narrow parochial domestic considerations. Is this not indicative of a shortsighted and myopic vision of Governance that could have disastrous consequences for the whole country?

Despite several commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government- these commitments have been given in very clear terms to various sections of the international community, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to India- to bring about constitutional arrangements for the country that would enable all the people to live in this country as equal citizens this Government has been dragging its feet in complying with those commitments. There is a view that the Sri Lankan Government is emboldened to do so because China is prepared to be supportive of Sri Lanka in whatever circumstances. This is not fair and not what the Sri Lankans expect from a great power like China. We submit that China should use its goodwill over Sri Lanka in a more reasonable way so as to bring about genuine reconciliation, peace and harmony between all the citizens in Sri Lanka and thereby enable all the citizens in Sri Lanka to live in peace and harmony.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) , . . , , .

I would like to respond to some of the statements made by the Hon. R. Sampanthan in his speech a little while ago. Sir, I think for once we consent in one thing and there is an element of self-realization that has dawned upon the TNA headed by you. Let me quote what you said a little while ago. You stated in this House, I quote:

what its people do not know will not hurt them

That is exactly what the TNA is doing today to the Tamil polity in the North.

Having said that, I am very appreciative of the fact that you have, at least, now understood the reality of the Tamil people in the North. I can see there is a huge aspersion and afraidness in terms of our relationship with China. You particularly mentioned about donor assistance by China vis-a-vis India. Yes, China has given us and more so has India. But, the only difference is that Indian aid is centric to the North. That is the importance that India places on the redevelopment of the North. But, we have to develop the rest of the country as well. That is a responsibility of this Government as a whole. We do not do politics based on ethnicity; we do not do politics based on geographical locations. But, the responsibility of the Government, the responsibility of His Excellency the President, is to ensure that this country is developed at once at the same pace. So, if India is willing to give more aid or loans to Sri Lanka, of course, we welcome that. There is nothing wrong in that. But, China has a policy of helping developing countries to grow and we need to take advantage of that situation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Chairman, I rise on the Floor of this House today to speak a few words on the Ministry of External Affairs. While my Colleagues have spoken aptly on many subjects, I thought it is my duty just to reflect the present position of the Ministry of External Affairs. As you know, the Ministry of External Affairs, plays a pivotal role in Sri Lankas economy. After all, it gives an external dimension to the domestic requirement and this is the most pivotal point that needs to be looked at. But, is this the role being played by the Ministry?

Unfortunately, let me mention at the outset that we have, certainly, an able Minister, but he has been disabled through certain behaviours of the other Cabinet Colleagues and MPs who make his functions much more difficult. Now, the reason is very clear, Hon. Minister. Your job is not to serve as a mouthpiece or to sing hosannas for dinner with the President. It is to reflect the

1887 1888

Sri Lankan requirement overseas and to ensure that that confidence is brought in to buttress the requirement, which is very patently seen in this country.

As you know, we have come out from a very huge militaristic problem, which has been put to an end, but ending of the war is not peace. Where is the social integration that is required among the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays? Our social fabric is comprised of the industriousness of the Tamils, the business acumen of the Muslims and the large-heartedness of the Sinhalese. This put together makes the Sri Lankan society. But, is not the Rajapaksa regime today bringing in this ulterior requirement of fanaticism and destroying the very aspect of the social fabric that has been created from the days of the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake and onwards?

Hon. Minister, let me speak - as many have spoken on issues that are there - of the real requirement of external affairs. Look at the friendly relationship we had with India, which has today, been badly bruised. I am happy to follow the Hon. Dilan Perera who mentioned of the support that had not been extended, apparently at a given moment, by the UNP to the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. Why are you questioning that when Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala was fighting for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations, you went and supported Ban Ki-Moon? And, that very "Moon" is now putting you into a satellite that is non-existent. So, these are areas that basically have various dimensions. Even your own party did not reflect it. We were governing then. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs was part of the Ministry then. Was there any support that was required? No. Such things even went unnoticed, because it was not being marketed in a manner that was required for the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar.

Sir, now look at the problems that is there in the Indian Ocean region. India is the most friendly nation that has come to our rescue at all given moments. But, what have you all been doing? You all have been playing with the Indian-Chinese factor; whether it was mentioned by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella or by the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the reflection is, today, you all are antagonizing a friend in need.

Then, look at the marine factor, the problems in fishing that is there. The Ministry of External Affairs is not assisting the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development in this regard. I know for a fact when speaking to our friends in India, that there is a reluctance to extend their support, when there is a necessity to build a bridge between the two nations.

Hon. Minister, going on further, look at the areas where you are pushing the Chinese Free Trade Agreement. Why are you not pursuing the CEPA with India, which has been progressively developed from then

to date and when there is a lot of import and export going on? Now, look at China from where 99 per cent is imported and the export is only the basic, primary products, and you are trying to bring a free trade agreement between the two. The Chambers are unaware of what is basically being looked at. So, at this moment, the Ministry of External Affairs has a big role to play, to bring in the Chambers in this process and ensure that you do not just go and rubber-stamp a free trade agreement just to say that there is another one that has been signed. Hon. Minister, you were part of us in 2001 and you are very well aware, when I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs ably supported by you, we were about to get the free trade agreement. But, owing to the fact that we were defeated, the free trade agreement got blown through the window. Now, are we anywhere close to that?

External affairs does not mean that you are isolated from trade. Trade is an area that you should be really promoting. Today, the diplomacy is so vital that we should substitute trade for aid and that has to be played by you. Our external policy should be "friends to all, enemies to none". But, you all ensure that you go the other way about: You are enemies to everybody and friends with none. You basically loved to be in the company of Myanmar then, not now, when they have progressively gone forward. You prefer to be in the cocoon of North Korea or you prefer to be with some country that does not want to be integrated like Zimbabwe in Africa. That is the type of comfort zone that you all love to be doing your diplomacy. But, Hon. Minister, these are the areas that non-alignment has been so aligned today that non-alignment has become a non-factor for Sri Lanka.

Look at the areas of the politicization of your Ministry. Today, almost 79 per cent of the diplomats who are appointed overseas are political appointments. There is a requirement to appoint political appointees. The appointees have been good, but they have been removed with such swiftness that once again the question arises as to whether you are part of the process of trying to externalize the element of fanaticism.

Look at Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka who was fighting against the external forces; the threats he faced; his fight in Geneva. But, you recalled him. The same fate did happen to the Ministry Secretary, Karunatilaka Amunugama. The same fate existed with Dr. Chris Nonis who was fighting successfully and what did you do? Your own MP goes and slaps this guy overseas and then comes back. Did you have the courage to stand up for your diplomat? No. You have not made one statement in support of Dr. Nonis for all the services he rendered. Even the other diplomats have spoken at the interviews given on CNN. The least spoken is by the Ministry because you do not want to bring professionalism into the system.

So, Hon. Minister, when you got up to defend the people who gave contracts - not said by you - it was reported by your Cabinet Colleague, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa after speaking with the Ministry of External Affairs, that your Ministry has given this contract to a Tiger. This was revealed by him, and nobody else. You got up to defend Thurairaja, but not Dr. Chris Nonis. I do not want to labour too much on this as it was mentioned before.

So, these are the areas where external affairs today have been so much politicized that you reflect the opinions of what is wanted to be told and not what is wanted to be heard. That is what is got to be done by you. You are a professional who does not need to stoop to low levels. When you are leading the Ministry, it is not some MP behind who should tell you what has got to be done, but unfortunately that is what is happening. You have got to show the vision on behalf of the country. Now look, how many times have you been stealthily telling India certain things about the Thirteenth Amendment? You go and say one thing. The Hon. Prime Minister comes here and says that we will not go one inch beyond the Thirteenth Amendment. But, the promises that you have given in Delhi was Thirteen plus plus. So, Hon. Minister, where is the external affairs professionalism that is required to be discharged to protect Sri Lanka since the end of the war?

The Geneva incident is a clear-cut example as to your miserable failure. You lost two votes which had never happened before. This is during your tenure, when you are leading. Before too long, you would be having the UN Fact-finding Mission. You have shown disrespect by not allowing them to come in. That is the policy of your Government. We, as the Opposition, do not want to mess around. But, all we want to say is, if you have nothing to hide, why worry? Unfortunately, if you want to protect one or two people and sacrifice the good name of Sri Lanka, then you pay the price. Otherwise, what is the problem of any UN Fact-finding Mission coming here because we are definitely sure that our forces have not done anything, our police have not done anything? Then, what is the reason? Is it to protect one or two people that you are not allowing this Fact-finding Mission to come? So, arbitrarily, if they give a unilateral report to defend that - like what you have been doing in the Channel 4 incident where nobody got up and defended, like the proscription that has been lifted - and before too long if you do not give your views, you will find that the monies which have been blocked, will be released. So, who will be the net beneficiary? It will be KP. He is another person that India is wanting and you are not releasing. Finally, is it a nexus between KPs 29 ships, which you said he had, and the billions of rupees? Ensure that this money come in.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have one minute left.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I have 12 minutes. It cannot evaporate just in seven minutes.

( ) (The Chairman) Eleven minutes have evaporated. Only one minute is left.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I cannot believe that, Sir. In any case, it is important because it is even reflected from Habaraduwa. Even what you cannot say, I need to say on your behalf because today the Government is in such a pathetic situation.

( ) (The Chairman) I will look after my electorate. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is so pathetic that there is nobody to stand up for the rights of the people in this country. I do reflect that. What you are saying is that there is a time restriction and I will take maximum two minutes that will be legally allowed for me.

( ) (The Chairman) You can take only one minute. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, Sir, with regard to the LLRC Report, why is it that you are not engaging on that area? At one stage, Mr. Lalilth Weeratunga said that 95 per cent of it has been implemented. The Hon. Mahinda Samarainghe goes to Geneva and said that 50 per cent has been implemented and, Hon. Minister, you get up at various stages and say, "We are in the process of implementing between 75 to 80 per cent". These are the problems. Owing to lack of vision, you are basically selling our Sri Lankan identity for nothing. Ensure that we get together and build a post-war situation where the Tamils, Muslims, Sinhalese, Burghers and the Malays can live together as one with a Sri Lankan identity, without allowing the Rajapaksa Chintanaya that you are pursuing to play one against the other. Today, the Tamils even after the war, cannot live in peace; the Muslims cannot live in harmony and the Sinhalese looking at this are frustrated.

Thank you.

Sri Lankas media muzzled

On July 7 2014, the National Secretariat for NGOs, under the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, issued a circular to all NGOs preventing them from conducting press conferences, workshops, journalism training and dissemination of press releases. The authority claimed such activities are beyond the mandate of NGOs.

To date in 2014, three training workshops for Tamil journalists have had to be abandoned:

Sir, I am very happy to participate in this Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Mass Media and Information, particularly because I consider myself a journalist. I began my career as a journalist at Lake House. Then, I joined the Dawasa N ewspaper Group and worked under the doyens of journalism, D.B. Dhanapala and T.F. Jamion, and went back again to Lake House, where I came under the influence of great editors like Denzil Peiris, Ernest Corea, H.L.D Mahindapala, Manik de Silva and others.

Sir, this Ministry, has gained a very important place in this country today. It has expanded beyond our belief. Much to the contrary views of certain people about this Ministry, it has justifiably fulfilled its functions. It is a Ministry, the influence of which is felt in all the four corners of this country and also across the seas. It is not only from here that you have to monitor the news and views, but you also have to help the Ministry of External Affairs to disseminate the views of our Government, the peace process and the mega development projects that is taking place in this country to all of the embassies abroad.

I am particularly happy, Sir, being a Monitoring MP of this Ministry, to see how ably our Minister, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, is handling this subject. He is a dear friend of the media. He has an amazing way of tackling the media people. Even under difficult situations, you can see how he wins over the hearts of the journalists, who attend the press briefings weekly. So, it is a remarkable achievement by him. That is why, I feel very happy, that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has chosen the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella for this great and praiseworthy position.

Sir, I only asked the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, when he was speaking " ?" . He was highly disturbed. . , . . . , .

I asked him because the "Navamani" newspaper today carries a news item regarding this subject. It states, " ". So, naturally and spontaneously, I asked him about it. He got carried away. He was talking about the freedom of the journalists. He has forgotten how journalists suffered during their time in this country. Has he forgotten the names of Thevis Guruge, the Director-General of Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation; the man who started the ITN, Sagarika Gomes; the famous singer, Premakeerthi De Alwis; the well-known Composer, Richard de Zoysa and others, who were murdered at that time?

It was during the time of UNP. The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya has conveniently forgotten that. He says, "Now, you are on that side. But, when you were on this side you were scolding the other side". Sir, he is a person who was on that side. . . . 17 . . . , . , .

Yes, I will take it up. Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, you talked about DVB-T2. I have the same map. A large number of countries are into DVB-T2. But, we have certain considerations. So, we had discussions and at one point, we agreed on DVB-T2. In fact, it went before the Cabinet and the Cabinet also approved it. But subsequently, there was another offer made by the Japanese Government. ISDB is not an isolated thing. You mentioned that it is used only in Japan; no, it is not used only in Japan. Now, there are 14 other Latin American countries which are using it.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) They are testing it. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, they not testing it. In Brazil, it is being implemented. There are 14 such countries. But, I agree with you on one point. That is, as of now, you have a larger number of countries covering DVB-T2.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Please give me half a minute, Sir.

If you look at the larger picture of it, now ISDB is also moving towards various other parts of the world. Within the next four to five years, you might have almost an equal number of countries using both the systems.

One can argue that there are pluses and minuses of using ISDB. I do agree with you, Hon. Member, that there are pluses and minuses; there are certain advantages of ISDB and also certain disadvantages, as you rightly said. So, those things have been assessed. We went through the whole thing. But, at that point of time, the Japanese system, ISDB, was not in the scene. Then, we brought it up. More than that, I must also say that there is a huge concessionary arrangement, which Sri Lanka can afford. That also had to be taken into consideration.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, give me just 10 seconds.

For the ISDB, there is a ten-year grace period, 20 years for repayment at a 0.025 per cent interest.

I believe that is sufficient for the moment., but if you need more details, I am prepared to give you more details about it. There is no question that it can be debated as to which is better. It is not that one has been completely written off. No, both are being considered.

Thank you, Sir, for giving me an extra minute. 112 01 , . 147,000,000 .
