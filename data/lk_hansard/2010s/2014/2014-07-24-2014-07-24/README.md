Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would rather explain this issue in English for the reason - as a lawyer you, yourself understand - that our civil law is largely governed by the

839 840

2014 24

Roman-Dutch law principles. I have read out the Section 15 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The issue arises since the rights of the State in the context of the above section was interpreted by the Court of Appeal in the case of Attorney-General vs. Wilson and another and the background to the case is as follows:

The Attorney-General filed action against two defendants, who were the owner and the driver of the vehicle for causing damage to a vehicle belonging to the State and to recover damages. Both defendants denied liability and pleaded that the cause of action had prescribed. At the trial the Attorney-General contended that since the second defendant, the driver, pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent driving in the Magistrate's Court, it was now not open to take up the defence of prescription. The argument was that the admission amounted to the accrual of cause of action notwithstanding the lapse of time.

It was the contention of the Attorney-General in the District Court that the provisions of the Prescription Ordinance do not affect the cause of action set out in the plaint. However, the District Judge rejected this submission and held that the claim for damages was prescribed as the action had been instituted after six years of the accident.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, in the Court of Appeal, the Attorney-General argued that the rights of the State are not affected as Section 15 of the Ordinance provides that Nothing herein contained shall in any way affect the rights of the State and that therefore the plea of prescription cannot be taken against the Attorney-General.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you can continue. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Section 3 of the Interpretation Ordinance states that No enactment

shall in any manner affect the right of the Republic unless it is therein expressly stated or unless it appears by necessary implication that the Republic is bound thereby.

The Court in the course of the judgment observed that the whole of the law of limitation is now contained in the Ordinance and they clearly apply to all causes of action. The court observed that rights of the State referred to in Section 15 mean, (a) right to plead prescription in suits against the State or (b) the right to sue on behalf of the State without the plea of prescription being taken against it. That is to say under what circumstances the State may seek the benefit of the law.

However, the Court observed that the Ordinance shields the State in the above two circumstances without specifying what rights of the State are protected or unaffected by Section 15 of the Ordinance. Above categories of rights exist independently of the Ordinance.

Sir, under the Roman-Dutch law, prescription did not, as a general rule, run against the Crown. But, it did run against the Crown where debts were due to it. Therefore, in actions where the State was seeking to enforce contacts or an ordinary obligation, prescription could be pleaded against it. This principle did not apply in regard to a claim by the Crown relating to its inalienable rights; this principle is limited only to rights capable of alienation. After referring to decisions and authoritative text of jurists, the court concluded that the Crown cannot claim immunity from prescription when prescription is claimed against the Crown in actions instituted by it, where its inalienable rights are not involved. Therefore, the State cannot use Section 15 of the Prescription Ordinance to extend or enlarge these rights, which it expressly left unaffected. Finally, the Court held that since the Attorney-General had instituted action after the lapse of six and a half years after the cause of action had arisen, the plea of prescription was validly taken and dismissed the appeal.

Sir, the Attorney-General proposed amendments to Section 15 of the Ordinance, citing the great prejudice that has been caused to Government departments recovering dues from others in delictual matters. Therefore, the proposed amendment seeks to specifically declare that the provisions of the Ordinance shall not in any way affect the alienable or inalienable rights of the State. The State henceforth is entitled to enjoy complete immunity from rules of prescription as contained in the Ordinance by virtue of this particular amendment.

Sir, I thought it is also pertinent for us to refer to another case because this decision which I referred to was challenged by the Attorney-General in a similar case: Attorney-General vs. Adhikari Mudiyanselage Nandana Vijitha Adhikari, which came up in appeal before the High Court of Civil Appeal in Colombo. In the earlier judgment, the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal

841 842

referred to the South African law and held in terms of an amended portion of the South African Prescription Act. Therefore, in this particular case, it was contended by the State that the said South African Prescription Act, No. 18 of 1943 had been repealed by Section 23 of the Prescription Act, No. 68 of 1969, that it has no force and, therefore, the decision based on the repealed Act, No. 18 of 1943 cannot be followed. The Civil Appellate High Court took the view that, as stated in Prof. C.G. Weeramantrys "Law of Contracts Volume I", the period of limitation varied greatly and in the absence of a specific provision, it was taken to be a third of a century or 30 years.

The question arises whether the latter judgment can override the former judgment in the case of Attorney-General vs. Wilson by the Court of Appeal. In terms of Article 154P and the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No. 54 of 2006, the Court of Appeal and the Provincial Civil High Court have concurrent jurisdiction on these issues. When two conflicting decisions are pronounced by two courts of the same status and having parallel jurisdiction, which of the decisions is correct and to be followed is a matter for the Supreme Court to decide. I am told that there is also a leave to appeal that has been granted and the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. In the meantime, it is within the competence of Parliament to correct this anomaly and doubt since there are two conflicting judgments by two courts of law - the Court of Appeal and the Civil Appellate High Court, which have concurrent jurisdiction on the matter - and also to see that the status quo ante vis--vis the delictual claims by the State against individuals who had caused damage to property belonging to the State. Therefore, I thought I would explain it in detail so that the purpose of this Bill would be clarified.

In dealing with this matter, it is also pertinent for us to realize that the Roman-Dutch law is prevalent only in two jurisdictions: one is South Africa and the other is Sri Lanka. It so happened, as we all know, in the past as well that several judgments had dealt with the 1799 Proclamation made by the British, making it possible for the Roman-Dutch law, which was then prevalent in the Maritime Provinces, to be sustained and that Proclamation is referred to extensively by several judges. So, in this case too, the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal had referred to various instances. In fact, he had referred to the famous case of Priyani Soysa vs. Rienzie Arsecularatne, where Justice Dheeraratne is referred to. Justice Dheeraratne says, I think we are not entitled as judges to change the material of the Roman-Dutch law, but are only permitted to iron out its creases whenever the necessity arises. Effecting structural alterations to the common law should be the exclusivey preserve of the Legislature. Such alterations have been done by the Legislature from time to time when the occasion arose in

several fields, like for instance, in landlord and tenant, inheritance and sale of goods". Making deviations or alterations in the Roman-Dutch law, which is the common law of the country, lies in the Legislature and not in the courts, was what Justice Dheeraratne referred to in that famous case of Priyani Soysa vs. Rienzie Arsecularatne. So, a question had arisen in the case of Attorney-General vs. Wilson.

Then, referring to the South African Prescription Act, No. 18 of 1943, which limits the period of prescription in the cases of claim for damages to be three years, it was also held that the prescriptive period for the State to seek remedy is three years. That is why this whole issue pertaining to this amendment had to be brought to court since earlier judges, not only Justice Dheeraratne, whom I referred to, but also Justice H.N.G. Fernando, Justice Gratiaen and a variety of judges, had referred to the need for the courts to exercise caution in amending the principle of the Roman-Dutch law without allowing that matter to be handled by the Legislature. So, that has been a caution that had been expressed even previously by several judges.

Therefore, since this anomaly has arisen as a result of these judgments, I move that this House adopts this Amendment so that we can restore the original status that prevailed vis--vis the claims by the State on matters of delictual interest.

Thank you.
