? You will get a final warning.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) alleged act - .- penalty .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, my second Supplementary Question is this. Almost 95 per cent of the portfolio in the Stock Exchange is held by just 3 to 4 per cent of the stakeholders. This type of action only stymie the operation. The Securities and Exchange Commission is there to protect the small investors. What they are doing is, they allow such activities to take place and ultimately, they will be given a final warning.You said that matters have been resolved by compounding. When you have an investigation into billions of rupees, owing to the fact that there is friendliness between certain people, you will basically get them compounded. But, you will fine a guy who has a case of Rs. 200,000 through the normal prosecuting procedure. I mean, where does this law - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, this is your interpretation regarding the decisions of the relevant authorities. So, I can only say that I do not share your pessimism in this matter.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The third Supplementary Question please. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) At present, you have stockbrokers playing in the market. The commission fees that are being charged by

them are excessive. Is there a way to reduce this and intensify the number of transactions that are taking place? Then, there is buoyancy that is set in the market. On one side, you have a legal problem but on the other, if you have the market trading situation improved, it will help.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am grateful for this lecture but I must respond in the following way. Hon. Deputy Speaker, we have endeavoured as much as possible to broadbase the stock market. We have said so in the Budget and we have taken certain actions to ensure that. In fact, we have requested and given tax breaks for private companies to be quoted companies. We are having publicity campaigns in many places to bring in smaller investors. So, we are very confident, because as the country progresses on a trajectory of 7 to 8 per cent growth, the Stock Exchange also will begin to reflect that. So, we will have no problems. Whatever you say will be investigated. If there are allegations of maleficence, they will be studied and no attempt will be made in any way to condone any type of maleficence done in the Stock Exchange.

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

ASSURANCE GIVEN TO INDIAN LEADERS REGARDING

NATIONAL RECONCILIATION ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, on 26th May, 2014, President Mahinda Rajapaksa attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. The next day, bilateral talks were held between the two sides. The media reported that during the meeting President Rajapaksa had explained the steps taken by the Sri Lankan Government to achieve national reconciliation. Subsequent to the talks, the Secretary to the Ministry of

External Affairs in India, Srimathi Sujatha Singh, in her media briefing stated, "We, on our side have urged upon President Rajapaksa that it is important for the well-being of the Tamils in Sri Lanka, that the Thirteenth Amendment be implemented, and that it is also important for it to go beyond. So, we are hopeful that this request that is coming from the Prime Minister will be listened to and that Sri Lanka will take appropriate action as required".

An earlier Joint Press Statement issued by the two Governments on 17th May, 2011, during the visit of Sri Lanka's Minister of External Affairs to New Delhi to discuss national reconciliation in Sri Lanka, stated, "The External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Government's commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties. A devolution package, building upon the Thirteenth Amendment, would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation".

Sir, will the Hon. Minister of External Affiars inform the House of the Government's response to this issue raised by the Indian side in regard to national reconciliation? What appropriate action will be taken in this regard? What were the assurances given to the then Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh and the then Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the present External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj, in regard to a political solution for national reconciliation, by the President and the Government of Sri Lanka?

Thank you.

() .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am glad that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has raised this issue, because it gives me the opportunity of clarifying some of the matters that are involved in the statement that he has just made.

His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited New Delhi for the purpose of extending his warmest felicitations to Shri Narendra Modi on his assumption of the high office of the Prime Minister of India. As the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe just stated, the swearing-in ceremony took place at Rashtrapati Bhavan on the 26th of May and His Excellency President Rajapaksa was among the Leaders who were present on that occasion.

As the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said, on the very next day - the 27th of May - there were bilateral talks between the Indian side and the Sri Lankan side. Those bilateral talks straddled a wide range of matters. There was discussion about Shri Narendra Modis vision for the

213 214

future of SAARC; that is how the discussion began. There was also some discussion about expanding the economic relations between Sri Lanka and India and reference was naturally made as well, to matters connected with fishermen, an issue which had been under discussion for some time. It was not the case that there was a detailed, in-depth discussion of constitutional issues. That was among the matters that were discussed at a very cordial, friendly, informal discussion between the two Leaders and their delegations.

As far as the constitutional issue raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is concerned, we can give a very simple answer. His Excellency President Rajapaksa explained our position in this regard with great lucidity. The Thirteenth Amendment, as the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is well aware, is nothing new. It has been a part of our law for more than a quarter of a century. During that very long period, there were no fewer than five different governments which ruled this country. Sir, the fact of the matter is, that throughout the whole of that period, none of those five governments of different political complexions felt able fully to implement the provisions that are contained in the Thirteenth Amendment. Nobody felt able to do it. It was not done by any of the governments which ruled this land for a quarter of a century. The reason is clear. In order to implement legislative provisions of this nature, which go to the very heart of the countrys constitutional structure, one of the essential conditions is agreement among the people of this country. There must be agreement; there must be consensus. A minimum threshold of agreement with regard to the core issues involved in this piece of legislation is a condition precedent for orderly and proper implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment. I do not think anybody would seriously contest that proposition and it is that that explains the fact that none of these governments with different aspirations, different priorities and different value systems were able, on the ground, fully to implement the Thirteenth Amendment.

In those circumstances, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Sri Lankan side made it very clear that we must strive to obtain this consensus as the foundation of a trajectory forward. If that is the case, as we explained to the Indian side on the occasion which the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe referred to, the best mechanism, indeed the only viable mechanism for the accomplishment of that objective is a Parliamentary Select Committee. These are matters that involve amendments, where necessary, to the Constitution of the Republic. As you know, Sir, that is essentially within the domain of Parliament. It is not a matter for the Executive. It is, therefore, right and proper that these deliberations must take place within a Parliamentary Select Committee. Such a Committee has been appointed under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Leader of the House, my distinguished Colleague, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, and many of us serve in that

Committee. The Government has made it very clear that this Committee is performing an indispensable function at this time. It enables the articulation of different points of view, all of which must be taken into account in order to arrive at a consensus, which is necessary to carry this exercise forward.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition made reference to the visit to our country, several months ago, by Srimathie Sushma Swaraj, at that time the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and now my counterpart in the Government of India, the Minister of External Affairs. She came here; she had discussions with us. I vividly remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, a very fruitful discussion which we had with her at which the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva was also present. We told Srimathie Sushma Swaraj on that occasion that it would be exceedingly desirable for the Tamil National Alliance to take part in these discussions; it would make the discussions inclusive; their presence is of great importance and that we would like to do everything on our part to prevail upon them to come into these discussions. I remember these discussions which took place during the visit to Sri Lanka by Srimathie Sushma Swaraj.

There is one other matter on which I wish to be very clear. We made it clear to the Indian side at the discussion which took place at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on the 27th of May, that the Government of Sri Lanka has a very definite view with regard to one aspect of this matter, namely, the devolution of police powers. We made it crystal clear that the devolution of police powers is not acceptable. We also said that this has nothing to do with ethnic considerations. This reservation is not linked to any policy that we have with regard to the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the Island. We believe that the attribution of police powers to any Provincial Council, wheresoever it may be situated in Sri Lanka, is undesirable for basic reasons of policy. We do not believe that an orderly, coherent beneficial government is in anyway facilitated by the devolution of police powers to the provinces. That conviction on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka was specifically articulated on that occasion. Subject to that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is the position of the Government of Sri Lanka that this is a matter that must be dealt with above the level of partisan politics, because it impinges crucially upon the destiny of this country. We are, therefore, very eager to ensure, within the Parliamentary Select Committee, the fullest possible consultation with all shades of political opinion in this country.

It is from such a series of deliberations that we can arrive at a solution which will stand the test of time. So, that is the position of the Government of Sri Lanka with regard to the issue that was raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and these are the views which we expressed at Hyderabad House on the occasion which was referred to by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Then, I suppose, we can presume that no assurances were given at any time to Dr. Manmohan Singh or to Srimathie Sushma Swaraj when she was the Leader of the Opposition, because if so, then we would have to go ahead with it.

The second matter which I would like to remind the Hon. Minister is that the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution which dealt with police powers were repealed without a Parliamentary Select Committee. So, then can we go back and have the Seventeenth Amendment in place?

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Exactly. Where was the PSC? () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Deputy Speaker, that was not the issue which came up for discussion on this particular occasion. There is a reference to police powers within the framework of the Thirteenth Amendment. Now, what we are discussing is the way forward with regard to the Thirteenth Amendment. The Thirteenth Amendment consists of a variety of facets, one of which is police powers. Now, we are firmly convinced that to devolve police powers all over the country, to Chief Ministers, to Provincial Councils, will bring about a situation that is detrimental to this country. That was the core of the discussion. I do not think we should play party politics with this. Both sides can play that and that has been going on for too long. But, there really is a need to find a solution to this and we cannot see how a pragmatic, realistic solution can be evolved without the fullest possible consultation, and what better forum for that consultation than the Parliamentary Select Committee, which represents this sovereign Legislative body of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Minister, especially, I am not playing party politics. But, in 2010 when the Resolution was passed, the Thirteenth and the Seventeenth Amendments together dealt with police powers, taking it out of the hands of the Provincial Councils. But, I suppose, I can take it for granted that there have been no assurances that have been given to Dr. Manmohan Singh and you all have put him out of the job then for nothing.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) It is not we who change governments in India, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. That is a sovereign right of the

people of India. There have been continuous discussions between the two governments on this matter. There has been a great deal of discussion. The latest discussion took place on the occasion you referred to and what I have informed this House is the substance of that discussion and what we conceive to be the way forward with regard to this matter.

"DAILY MIRROR" REPORT OF 3RD JUNE, 2014 :

STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF JUSTICE ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to clarify the position that was raised yesterday. In fact, I am reading this as a Ministerial Statement, subject to my right and without prejudice to my right to agitate to raise matters under Standing Order No. 23 (2) after having discussed the matter with the Hon. Speaker as agreed today at the Party Leaders' Meeting. Subject to that, Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There was no agreement with regard to that matter. Whether you have a right to make the statement -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No agreement but I am very sorry that the Opposition is being so harsh on this as far as minor parties are concerned because this is a party which talks about multiparty democracy in the country and the rights of political parties, and they are in the forefront to deny us our right as a political party to raise issues in this House. I cannot see their excitement.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

. . rose.

217 218

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. John Amaratunga. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) According to the Sixteenth Parliament, you are a Member of the UNP. You are a Member of the United National Party.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. John Amaratunga, you try telling that to my party members in the Eastern Province that they are - I mean you will have to prove it in an election. At election times, you want our support and you come to understandings with us but when it comes our right as a Party Leader in this House, it is very unfair to be making such statements.

Having said that, Sir, let me come to my Statement, which is on a very serious issue. I must thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition because he has also been concerned about this particular issue and various other issues concerning places of religious worship.

It is with absolute dismay, Sir, that I read the distressing news item in the front page of the Daily Mirror of 3rd June, 2014 under the title Muslims to Remove Dambulla Prayer Centre. First and foremost, the reference to this site as a mere "prayer centre" is incorrect. It is a mosque that was well established and used as such for many years. The incidents connected with this mosque including attacks on it are in the public domain and of concern to all Muslims. This is an issue that was even raised as one that impeded the religious rights of a minority during the last Geneva Meeting of the UN Human Rights Council. This is an issue that raises questions on our capacity as a nation for tolerance and harmony. The Ministry of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs could have resolved this issue or the parties involved could have followed legal recourse. His Excellency the President had also promised to intervene and had, in fact, assured the Muslim Ministers that it will be settled in accordance with the law after identifying alternate land.

In this context, we are concerned why a particular group has suddenly surfaced to represent the Muslims and to submerge the fundamental question of the right to worship of a minority in total secrecy in a process that is neither transparent nor equitable. On whose direction are they acting? It is highly improper for any unknown group claiming to represent the Muslims to arrive at a settlement that did not involve the Muslim Ministers who were totally immersed in resolving the issue at a national level.

Who gave these groups, purportedly claiming to be the Wakf Board, the Ulema Organization and the Muslim Youth Organization as has been reported yesterday in the Daily Mirror news item, the right to intervene in an issue that disturbed the entire Muslim community in the country?

What does this solution offer to the concerned community of Muslims living in that area? Are they to leave the area? Are they to refrain from practising their faith? Has anybody in authority found an alternate location for the mosque? Why would the Chief Prelate of the Rangiri Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya, Venerable Inamaluwe Sumangala Thero, negotiate with an unknown entity who claim to represent the affected Muslims? Why would he volunteer to lay the foundation stone for a mosque elsewhere when a consensual decision has not been reached with the persons who are directly affected? Sir, I see this as a surreptitious effort to bury a problem unilaterally devoid of any semblance of justice and fairness. I wish to strongly object to the improper manner in which this issue has been dealt with, keeping all Muslim Ministers totally in the dark. I wish to seek clarification from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs as to whether this news item is correct and whether action has been taken to reach consensus on this issue? Thank you

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister who this individual is. Who is this individual you referred to, as we saw in the newspapers, who claims to have represented all of you?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) None of us know who these individuals are. They are claiming to be members of the Wakf Board. When I asked the Director, Muslim Religious Affairs, he denied any decision being taken by the Wakf Board to go and arrive at a solution. In fact, this is a matter that we have always dealt with His Excellency the President. He has given us the assurance that he will meet the Muslim Ministers and arrive at a consensus on this issue. While that was pending, there are these different groups dealing with the Chief Prelate of the Rangiri Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya. That is the problem we have. This should be settled as an issue of national importance with the concerned community and the congregation of the area. That is what we are saying.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Minister, has the President given a date for the Muslim Ministers to meet him?

219 220

2014 04

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is after having discussed with the other authorities in the area because it involves town development as well.
