(iii) the punishments that have been imposed on these offenders?

(b) If not, why? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Mr. Speaker, I answer Question No. 11.

(a) (i) Statistical data incorporating the number of

suspects who were found guilty and who were not found guilty in court proceedings are maintained. However, these statistics make no reference to the category of offences upon which the finding of acquittal or conviction was delivered. Hence, the particulars setting out the number of individuals who were sentenced in connection with child abuse could not be made available.

(ii) Records are not maintained in respect of

the individuals who are involved in politics and who were sentenced by court in connection with child abuses. Hence, statistics could not be furnished.

(iii) Does not arise.

(b) Does not arise. ( () )

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) There is a Special Task Force on Child Abuse cases under my Ministry, which is chaired by my Secretary. Now they are computerizing the court system. Only after the computerization is complete, I can instruct them to see that data of all cases are maintained according to the type of offences that have occurred. So, thereafter only, we will be able to get those details. - [Interruption.] Most of these are now being manually maintained in courthouses, as case records. If it is a civil case, sometimes, by letters we can identify as to which type of cases they are. But, in criminal cases, that possibility is not there. I am sure in future, once computerization is done, we will be able to get those details from the courthouses. The other option is to try and get the details of those convicted people regarding child abuse cases from the Department of Prisons. That could be attempted if you can give us some time.

Sir, I wish to congratulate the Sri Lankan Cricket Team for winning and becoming the T20 Cricket Champions of the world. Today, T20 Cricket is one of the most competitive and immensely followed sport in over 40 countries and in all continents, and globally second only to Soccer.

Last Sunday, we heard the same Lions roar as it was on that most memorable day in 1996, when Sri Lanka won the Cricket World Cup under the legendary captaincy of Arjuna Ranatunga and game-changer Sanath Jayasuriya - both of whom today are honourable Members of this Parliament.

I wish to extend our special congratulations to Dinesh Chandimal for setting an example as an exemplary leader by putting the nation before oneself. Your leadership qualities simply talks about the entire team. Your committed teamwork towards the nations pride and victory more than of any individual achievement, deserves a standing applaud.

I wish to congratulate Lasith Malinga for marshalling the Sri Lankan Lions towards winning this important sports event and putting Sri Lanka high up on the world map. This achievement will most certainly inspire Cricket fans - almost all Sri Lankans - as a rallying point to start believing in themselves to be committed collectively to achieve greater heights for our motherland.

Last but not least, I wish to congratulate and salute Mahela Jayawardena and Kumar Sangakkara, by now two of the greatest legends and icons of the game's history, but more importantly great role models for all Sri Lankans.

Our special congratulations must also go to His Excellency the President for making Sanath Jayasuriya in charge of the operations and the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Minister of Sports for assuring that Sri Lanka Cricket is put back where it rightly deserves, nowhere else but on top of the world. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

. [5.25 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure in saying a few words on the memorable win that the Sri Lankan Cricket Team obtained under Lasith Malinga in the T20 World Cup.

We want to congratulate and remember, particularly Lasith Malinga and everybody in the Team, but it is also time to remember the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, who, many years ago, showed us the way. W.G. Grace, the Father of Cricket, said, I should like to say that good batsmen are born, not made; but my long experience comes up before me, and tells me that it is not so. So, clearly, these cricketers, over a very long period, have actually developed skills, gone through many hardships, misunderstandings and brought great glory to our motherland.

We must remember Dinesh Chandimal for his selflessness. We must also remember Lasith Malinga, who was heavily criticized for playing in the IPL, and only those who know the game would know that his experience in the IPL over the many seasons made it possible for him to direct this team and, particularly his bowlers in restricting formidable batting lineups.

Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, through their knowledge, experience and tactical sense, have actually been the backbone of this team and we salute them even as they come to the end of their T20 career.

1215 1216

Sir, cricket is more than a game. Sir Neville Cardus said, A true batsman should in most of his strokes tell the truth about himself. I also want to salute Sangakkara for the speech he made in Lords about a year ago, where he decided to speak the truth, and it is only the truth that will triumph in the end.

We also want to remember the many people behind this successful team: our expatriate Coach, Marvan Atapattu, Chaminda Vass, Ruwan Kalpage, Michael De Zoysa, the Manager, for his integrity and management of the team, our Selectors, particularly my banking colleague, the Hon. Sanath Jayasuriya and my friend Hashan Tillakaratne for the way in which they have contributed to Sri Lanka to achieve this great victory.

Sir, I will conclude by saying this: Cricket, however, has more in it than mere efficiency. There is something called the spirit of cricket, which cannot be defined, Lord Tennyson said. If we have something to learn from you, that is the spirit of cricket. You need to be qualified to play the game and the qualified person needs to be given a position, if we are to win. You have created a meritocracy. We have triumphed in the cricket world. As politicians, we have a lesson to learn: if we are to triumph internationally, Sri Lanka must become a meritocracy, not an autocracy.

[5.55 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in this congratulatory Motion. I consider it an honour and a privilege to applaud our victorious Cricket Team who has brought us the Asia Cup as well as the World Twenty20 Championship.

At a time when the country needs a rallying point to exemplify and prove that unity in diversity is indeed our strength, this victory by our cricketers has given us that opportunity to rejoice and enjoy as a nation irrespective of our differences.

1223 1224

I must say that I was fortuitous to have the good fortune of being the only one in this Chamber to be there in the stadium at the Finals. Those three hours of excitement and ecstasy, I will perhaps cherish in my entire life. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed the cooperation of all the members and sacrifices that they made together that made this possible.

While saying that, I must also say, as the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga pointed out a while ago, that certain powerful cricketing nations are ganging up together and putting aside the Good Governance Report given to the ICC. Lord Woolf had given a report to set up good governance in the ICC. They have deliberately sidestepped that and are trying to marginalize smaller countries and this is perhaps our dj vu to show them that we are no mean members in the cricketing fraternity.

Having said that, we must also bear in mind that we should not forget the nurseries of cricket - the school circuit - and that we must do much more to develop the school circuit, particularly in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. I would appreciate if the Sri Lanka Cricket does a proper talent search in the school circuit in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to identify potential international cricketers from those areas as well.

I would conclude with a comment made by one of the finest Tamil cricketers that we have seen - who has not perhaps played for the country, but we have seen him in the club circuit - S. Skandakumar, who played for the Tamil Union. Two days ago in an article he said, I will quote from the "Ceylon Today" of 8th April, 2014:

Both Mahela and Sangakkara can look back with immense satisfaction on their unflinching roles here as peers to the younger players and the outcome of the final was crickets own blessing to them for that contribution.

The most moving part of his appreciation is enunciated in this final sentence:

Yes indeed cricket will remain the greatest leveler and our team made me so very proud to be Sri Lankan!

With those comments, I conclude my remarks.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .
