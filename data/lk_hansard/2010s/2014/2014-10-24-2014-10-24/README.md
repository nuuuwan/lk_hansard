ENGLISH TEXT OF THE BUDGET SPEECH - 2015

Introduction

Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to present the 10th consecutive Budget of the United Peoples Freedom Alli-ance (UPFA) Government guided by Mahinda Chintana National Vision for Development, to this august Assem-bly today.

Our Government in 2005 inherited a conflict trapped, tsunami shattered nation with a grim economic outlook. It was a country which was suffering from depleted infra-structure that marginalized the economy in the emerging competitive global environment. Education was not ori-ented towards providing the much-demanded skills neces-sary to build up our new generation. We witnessed brain-drain with professionals migrating overseas seeking better living. A pool of over 50,000 graduates remained unem-ployed for years, looking out for employment opportuni-ties. Public servants were waiting to regain their lost pen-sion rights and better salaries.

Domestic production was not recognized and food supply was externally dependent. Paddy lands were re-claimed. Paddy mills and tea small factories witnessed a natural closure having been trapped with unmanageable debt.

As a result of the privatization policy carried out by successive governments since 1985, a sizable amount of Government entities and valuable Government assets in-cluding plantation industries, lubricant oil, gas, steel, ce-ramics, tyre, cement, telecom, insurance, airline were sold during the time. The once prosperous textile factories were closed down and sugar factories were run down, compelling the country to be solely dependent on foreign supplies. With the forming of several companies in the name of peopolization, the Sri Lanka Transport Board was badly run down. The domestic construction industry did not get any recognition either.

Land laws that restricted sale of land to foreigners, which were in existence since 1963 were repealed by the 2002 2004 United National Front Government, allowing foreigners to own land even without having to pay a proper tax. Weird plant varieties that created adverse im-pact on the natural habitat and the climate had been intro-duced without serious thought on repercussions. The ab-sence of a proper wildlife conservation programme had aggravated the human - elephant conflict. Historical reli-gious and cultural sites had been neglected. Pirivena edu-cation, indigenous medicine and sports did not receive sufficient attention of the Government.

From 1977, the Budget Deficit was on average around 10 per cent of GDP per year, on a successive basis, result-

ing in the buildup of debt in excess of GDP at 102 per cent by 2004. Banks, railways, the Customs Department and the Inland Revenue Department were in fact lined up to be privatized. It was a common feature during those days that the exchange rate depreciated by 10 per cent per year. International reserves at US$ 2 billion by 2005, was not sufficient to meet countrys food, energy and national security requirements. It is no wonder that the LTTE took an upper hand in this weak environment, by consistently violating the Peace Accord hat was signed by the Prime Minister in 2002, which in fact contributed to corner the country even more.

The recruitment freeze that prevailed for over two decades led to a collapse in education, health, agrarian and irrigation and other public services. Rural schools were without teachers and were allowed to remain closed. Hospitals lacked doctors, nurses and other support staff, causing immense suffering to the sick - especially the less privileged. Withdrawals of pension rights of public ser-vants demoralized those in the public service. The closure of the Paddy Marketing Board, CWE, and the Marketing Department had shattered the operations of the logistics management of essential public services.

It is the rural community and low-income households that suffered most from all this. There were no preschools for child development or proper schooling for children. The housing and sanitation needs and a majority of the old housing complexes were in a poor state. Many areas in the Colombo city, Kolonnawa, Bloemendhal, Bellan-wila became garbage-dumping yards. Colombo was sub-ject to frequent flooding. Many villages did not have ac-cess to electricity. Over 50,000 families living in urban shanties and plantation workers did not have good hous-ing. We could sense LTTE terrorism at close proximity. Several people in the North were displaced and living in refugee camps in desperate conditions. Children of such areas became child soldiers. Poverty amongst the planta-tion and rural population was well over 20 per cent and such children suffered high malnutrition.

The desperate conditions that prevailed at the time in our rural society were well articulated by Minister, the Hon. Wijith Wijayamuni de Zoysa at the pre-Budget con-sultations meeting held at Monaragala in June 2014, citing poems written by the well known poet late Sagara Palansuriya;

145 146

Honourable Speaker, I have no doubt that you would appreciate the deep meaning embedded in these poems, having been influenced by the path taken by late D.M. Rajapaksa, followed by our father late D.A. Rajapaksa who firmly supported the rural agrarian society from the days he was in the State Council and further in view of your own conviction on the importance of agri-culture and irrigation. We must value leaders such as late Dr. S. A. Wickremasinghe, late Phillip Gunawardena, late Dr. N. M Perera, late Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, late Sir Waithilingam Duraiswamy, late Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, late T. B Jayah, Late Dr. Badi-uddin Mahmud, as well as late D.S. Senanayake, our first Prime Minister, who pro-moted an agricultural economy to empower the rural soci-ety.

The underlying philosophy of the founder leader of SLFP - Prime Minister late S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was empowerment of the five great forces- namely clergy, teachers, physicians, farmers and workers. The first lady Prime Minister of the world, late Sirimavo Bandaranaike, initiated a massive industrialization process, moved pro-gressive land reforms and represented the voice of Third World Nations, based on non- aligned principles and proved that gender fear is only a western concept. North-ern people at the 1982 Presidential Election supported late Hector Kobbekaduwa endorsing SLFPs policy stance towards strengthening the domestic economy. Building a modern economy for our children based on such values should remain to be our responsibility.

The foremost expectation of the people from our Gov-ernment in 2005 was to defeat terrorism and regain de-mocracy. The second was to get the stage right for devel-opment by putting in place modern infrastructure so as to ensure prosperity to our people. Last but not the least, was to create an advanced economy and develop human resources capable of satisfying the long-term aspirations of our children.

Honourable Speaker, this is Mahinda Chintana - Vision for a new Sri Lanka. It aims at taking urban fa-cilities to the village - while bringing the value system that prevails in the village to the urban life. We have to bear in mind that despite any form of pressure, we need to start from where we can, do boldly what is possible, and be determined to succeed with good intentions then we could never fail.

That was how we managed to defeat successfully, the sinister LTTE terrorism. That is how we managed to get once stalled infrastructure development initiatives to move rapidly. This is how we managed to get our econ-omy moving ahead in the region while expanding liveli-hood development opportunities for our people and creat-ing new hope for our children.

A Review of Progress : 2006 2014

Honourable Speaker, 10 years of our journey is in-deed a journey of progress. The terrorist trapped areas now enjoy functional democracy and freedom with elected Provincial Councils and Local Authorities. Chil-dren go to schools and return home without having to face the risk of falling into the hands of the LTTE and ending up as child soldiers or suicide bombers. Maternal mortality and child mortality in those areas have drasti-cally declined. The mined-lands have become rich green-fields providing income opportunities to the peo-ple. Annual defense expenditure in relation to GDP that was around 5.5 per cent for nearly 30 years is now con-tained at 3 per cent, giving space for spending on devel-opment and public services.

We made this transformation through inclusive devel-opment. Every household now enjoys access to electric-ity, which was then available to urban townships only. Transportation has improved, providing easy access to schools, hospitals, markets and work places. The entire population enjoys telecommunication facilities. Schools and hospitals are upgraded to provide better education and healthcare. Sathi Polas - Weekly Marketplaces - have emerged with a modern outlook, expanding market facili-ties. Pipe-borne water facilities have expanded at an ac-celerated phase, so as to ensure that every household would have access to quality drinking water by 2017. The implementation of Divi Neguma, Gama Neguma and women entrepreneurship development programmes have added value to rural centric development strategies.

Honourable Speaker, this Budget is also presented soon after hosting the Prime Minister of Japan and Presi-dent of the Peoples Republic of China, both of whom made State Visits to our country. Foreign Ministers, Fi-nance Ministers, senior leaders and State officials of sev-eral other nations also visited Sri Lanka during this year. The President of the Asian Development Bank also vis-ited Sri Lanka, strengthening our development partner-ship. In September this year, we hosted a two-day Inter-national Conference of Asian Political Parties. Last year, we hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Summit attended by several global leaders. These events amply demonstrate how well we have elevated our inter-national relations to a high altitude, proving the success of our Governments foreign policy. This helped to con-vince how incorrect and misleading are the perceptions propagated by a handful in the international community against Sri Lanka with the help of an isolated few from within, who are bearing extreme views and ulterior mo-tives, desperately trying to use the Human Right Council in Geneva as their only forum.

Honourable Speaker, we never led communally-targeted military activities during the operations con-ducted to rescue our people from the grips of LTTE ter-ror. All benefited through peace and security. Displaced

147 148

[ ]

2014 24

people were settled and helped to develop their liveli-hood. Former LTTE cadres were rehabilitated and re-united with their families, having even channelled budget-ary resources. Over 3,000 jobs were given to them in se-curity and police forces. We have launched a reconcilia-tion process to consolidate the hard-won peace.

We all know how our country was governed under Emergency Regulations for years. Since the removal of Emergency Regulations, with the restoration of public services throughout the country, encouragement of press freedom and the conduct of regular elections including the Northern Provincial Council elections, the country has witnessed a notable improvement in governance. For the first time all nine Provincial Councils are functioning since their creation in 1987.

As we have constantly explained in this Parliament and at international forums, while appreciating the joint efforts of the international community to understand our domestic problems, there should be no international inter-ference on national security, peace and development. The world must appreciate our success that was achieved while managing the diversity in our country within a de-mocratic setting. The Tamil political parties and con-cerned groups must work with the Parliament Select Committee to find a durable solution to their concerns within the Sri Lankan context since Provincial Councils are already functioning with regular elections being held.

Further, I cannot see the rationale to devolve the sub-jects of land and police powers to the nine separate Pro-vincial Councils and how such a move could serve the best interest of law and order and the national economy. We must develop national standards for education, health, poverty reduction and social services to ensure equality. For this we must see how well we can set up Jana Sabas at Pradeshiya Sabhas and Provincial Councils and coordi-nate them with the Government through a meaningful and cost-effective governance framework. I, therefore, invite the Tamil National Alliance once again, to move away from ideological barriers and work with the Government towards finding a realistic political proposal that will make Provincial Councils more meaningful to promote development for the benefit of all our people. Instead of pursuing communally-biased political perspectives, all of us must work together towards building a united commu-nity with strong economies in the regions while reaping benefits from the hard-won peace and reconciliation.

Honourable Speaker, the Government donated rice to the World Food Programme, surgical gloves to Ebola Virus-affected African countries through the World Health Organization, medical assistance to those affected by the cyclone in the Philippines, deployed our security personnel on humanitarian missions to Haiti and Sudan and donated humanitarian assistance to the value of US Dollars 1 million to the people of Palestine. It is a matter of pride that our nation has graduated from a humanitar-

ian aid recipient country status to a humanitarian aid do-nor country status. These are reflections of our endeav-ours to promote humanitarian and peace-building efforts in the world and our desire to strengthen global peace.

All this could be done, only since our security forces, our farmers, our labour force, our women and small en-trepreneurs, those who are engaged in overseas employ-ment, our teachers throughout the country, our health workers, our rural based Public Servants, our religious leaders, our artistes, the emerging business community and SMEs, global financial institutions and entrepreneurs were devoted to development. Above all, our people con-tinued to place trust in democracy by actively participat-ing in a peaceful election process that could be placed on par with any advanced democracy in the world, adding value to democratic institutional arrangements of govern-ance. We wish to extend our heartfelt appreciation for their uncompromising commitment to promote peace, national reconciliation and economic progress that are unstoppable within the democratic setting that gained ground since the end of the terrorist conflict.

In the three Provinces in which Provincial Council Elections were held this year, which represent around 47 per cent of total registered voters in the country, 54 per cent of voters voted for the United Peoples Freedom Alliance. Our Government is encouraged that an over-whelming majority of our people continue to place their confidence in Mahinda Chintana - National Vision for the Future, which is designed to create a proud future for our children blessed by the success achieved in building peace, reconciliation and development all over the coun-try.

Honourable Speaker, the per capita income of 2015, for which I am presenting this Budget, is expected to be US Dollars 4,000. It is four times higher than what it was in 2005 and we achieved one year ahead of our expecta-tions. The economy is growing around 8 per cent. Earn-ings from exports, tourism and remittances have in-creased income sources of the people and have opened new investment opportunities to the business community. They have strengthened our external transactions to gen-erate a lower current account deficit of around 3 per cent of GDP. International Reserves are nearing US Dollars 10 billion as we have increased local production, having restored peace and security. The Budget deficit is below half of what it was in 2005 and public debt is below 30 per cent of GDP in comparison to 2005.

Our Government has developed the countrys interna-tional ports and airports to global standards, attracting trade and tourism and enabling the country to gain from its strategic locational advantage. Equally, the country is progressing rapidly with regard to its expressway net-work that connects all major townships and development corridors to industrial, agricultural and tourism zones as well as IT and university townships. The Northern Ex-

149 150

pressway and Ruwanpura Expressway with a parallel new railway line to Ratnapura are expected to be ready by 2017. The countrys national highways have been mod-ernized almost fully with new capacity to be able to cater to transport requirements of the next decade. The North-ern Railway line connecting Talaimannar and Jaffna has been completed. Similarly, the ColomboMatara railway connection has been upgraded. The Matara-Kataragama new railway line is under construction and the Beliatta section will be ready by end of 2015.

The power generation capacity between 2005 and 2015 has doubled at around 5,000 megawatts and trans-mission losses have been reduced to 9 per cent, saving around 300 megawatts of generated power. Alternative renewable energy sources have also generated about 300 megawatts power in the country. With the strategy that was adopted by us to gradually move on to low-cost power generation, the Government was able to reduce the cost of electricity by 25 per cent from last September, to provide benefits to almost all our 4.5 million households.

Moragahakanda, Uma-Oya, Deduru-Oya and Yan-Oya diversions will provide irrigated water to the dry zone areas in the Northern, North-Western and Southern districts, by 2016. Several new schemes such as Vehera-gala, Rambaken-Oya, Gurugal-Oya reservoirs, have been built. All major reservoirs including Parakrama Samudraya, Minneriya, Giritale, Ridiyagama, Tabbowa, Inginimitiya have been rehabilitated with new safety stan-dards. Making use of the drought, the major and minor irrigation schemes have been rehabilitated. Investment made in this sector from 2005 to increase the production of agriculture, fisheries, livestock, power generation and sustain biodiversity has been significant.

Honourable Speaker, the rehabilitation of existing fishery harbour facilities, the early completion of Sila-wathurai, Gurunagar, Gandara and Kalametiya new fish-ery harbours, the development of fishery harbours and anchorages at Wennappuwa, Kapparatota, Dodanduwa, Hikkaduwa and Negombo Lagoon in support of the coastal fishing industry commenced in order to explore the vast fishery resource base of the country. Fishing boats consisting of 4,374 multi-day vessels, 24,364 one-day vessels and 20,868 normal vessels have been main-tained and 186,939 fishermen in the industry are assisted through a variety of development assistance.

In terms of public investment strategy, the Govern-ment has completed the construction of water distribution systems in Galle, Colombo, Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, and ongoing work of major water schemes in Gampaha, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Matale, Anuradhapura, Hamban-tota, Kandy, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts has been accelerated. Community water supply schemes are developed in small towns and rural areas

under the newly created Community Water Supply De-partment.

Honourable Speaker, our Government attaches special importance to the development of human resources. The University Townships initiative has progressed well with each University having developed new facilities for ex-pansion by providing new subjects for advanced studies. Hostel facilities for over 25,000 undergraduates are under construction to solve their accommodation problems. Salaries and research incentives of university lecturers have been increased by twofold.

Vocational education is another area that went through revival in recent years having targeted youth towards skills development. The construction of a new School of Business Management and an Institute of Tech-nology at Malabe, an Advanced Technology Institute at Mullaitivu, the expansion of the IT School and a Teacher Training College at Malabe and several advanced univer-sity colleges in which technical education could be pur-sued, are in progress. The establishment of an Ocean Uni-versity was legislated to undertake skills education that is in demand with regard to fisheries and ocean resource management.

The Government ventured on a child-friendly school development initiative to accommodate about 350,000 children entering schools every year. Facilities in 6,500 secondary schools are being upgraded and all other pri-mary schools are being improved with the introduction of a more child-friendly environment, sanitation and staff facilities. In order to promote English, Mathematics, IT and Science among all school-going children, new Mahindodaya Labs have been completed in 1,000 schools all over the country. A school-specific recruitment drive is in progress to fill teacher vacancies in distant schools. Conducting teacher training programmes, providing teaching material, improving standards of examinations and extracurricular activities are in progress to extend greater benefits to children.

Due to these initiatives, the success rate of students of far-away districts such as Hambantota, Kilinochchi, Bat-ticaloa, Polonnaruwa, Badulla at the Ordinary Level Ex-amination has increased from 46.6 per cent in 2005 to 62.4 per cent as of now. It is a matter of pride for all of us to hear that nine out of the top ten students who got high-est marks in the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination this year, are from remote primary schools in the country which confirms the revival in education in rural areas. Pirivena education and Daham School education were given a boost through the last year Budget to promote the number of students attending such education.

Honourable Speaker, what is most encouraging is the global recognition that we have received for promoting IT education at rural level through the setting up of 900 Nanasala Centres in rural areas and 26 Prajashakthi Tech-

151 152

[ ]

2014 24

nology Centers in plantation areas. This has contributed to raise countrys IT literacy to 45 per cent this year from a negligible level in 2005. The World renowned Milinda and Bill Gates Foundation Award was awarded to Sri Lanka out of over 140 global applications, in recognition of the success of e-library Nanasala initiative.

Research undertaken by our scientists in areas such as food technology, non-communicable deceases, low cost construction technology, renewable energy, and indige-nous medicine is encouraging. Private-Public Partnerships in Nano Technology initiatives have produced advanced results.

Preserving and protecting a free healthcare system is also an important priority in the Mahinda Chintana De-velopment Framework. Our Government recruited the required specialists, medical personnel, nurses and para-medical staff, revised their emoluments and incentives, an increased expenditure for pharmaceutical drugs, ambu-lances, and medical equipment to develop hospital facili-ties. Nearly 50,000 persons were recruited to the Health Sector alone. The Government has also expanded its ca-pacity to manufacture essential drugs in addition to en-couraging local pharmaceutical manufacturers to increase their production capacity so that the cost of these drugs will reduce while also saving foreign exchange. The total annual expenditure for the provision of free health ser-vices as of now is nearly Rs. 150 billion.

Sport is another area of priority in the overall child and youth development strategy. It is a must that all schools have a playground, with sports instructors who will promote a healthy and sporty lifestyle development among students. Sports activities are now an integral part of education, providing extracurricular activities to school going children. The Government has also developed sev-eral international stadiums and modern sports facilities in many districts. This nation at one time had only a few urban sports facilities.

Honourable Speaker, our country has a rich rural heri-tage. Majority of our people live in rural settings. Re-specting this strong cultural attachment and national val-ues of our rural life, our development policies were cen-tred round empowerment of villages through the Gama Neguma infrastructure development programme and Divi Neguma livelihood development programme. On priority basis, we accelerated the implementation of rural electrifi-cation programme, Maga Neguma - rural road develop-ment programme, while also expanding telecommunica-tion facilities to all Grama Niladari divisions spread across the country. We also expanded small irrigation facilities, maternitycare centres and primary schools at village level. Six rounds of Divi Neguma assistance have been carried out to promote backyard economies and to develop livelihood initiatives covering around 2.5 million low income households.

The provision of fertilizer at Rs. 350 per 50 kg bag from 2006 to date for paddy and at Rs. 1,200 per 50 kg bag for other crops, popularizing the cultivation of maize, onion, potato, green beans, vegetable and fruits, as well as promoting poultry and aquaculture, processing dryfish and engaging in small industries have helped low income people to expand their livelihood opportunities. Micro-financing facilities have been expanded through Divi Neguma community banking societies and agrarian banking. The provisions in the annual Budget for Divi Neguma/ Samurdi cash allowances have been increased. Over 100,000 motorcycles have been distributed among field level officers at villages giving new recognition to Government services at rural level. The Farmers Pension Scheme was restored and crop insurance and compensa-tion coverage for wildlife related destructions were ex-panded.

Honourable Speaker, during the last 8 years, the hous-ing stock of low income people have increased by about 750,000 through rehabilitation of houses that are in a poor condition and new constructions targeted for low income households, provision of toilets and roofing tiles, providing replacements in the case of houses affected by disasters and through the provision of housing loans. Nearly 100,000 houses destroyed by the LTTE were re-built in the North. Further, the Government commenced the rehabilitation of old housing schemes, while provid-ing improved common facilities. Already 22 housing schemes including Maligawatta, Bloemendhal, Gunasing-hepura housing schemes have been fully modernized and a further 23 housing schemes including Soysapura and Anderson Flats are being rehabilitated.

The new facilities provided to rural and urban town-ships, coupled with security and livelihood development helped many low-income families to improve their living standards having purchased motor bicycles, three wheel-ers, hand tractors, small cars, water pumps, fishing boats et cetera. Most of the low income people also use mobile phones.

The income growth and improved living standards among low-income people are shown from the decline in people below poverty line. The number of people living below the National Poverty Line has declined from 15.7 per cent in 2006/07 to 8.7 per cent in 2012/13. Rural pov-erty has declined from 15.7 per cent to 7.6 per cent while poverty in the plantation sector has declined from 32 per cent to 10.9 per cent. People below US$ 2 per day in-come have declined from 28.3 per cent to 18.9 per cent. Maternal mortality has declined from 12.1 per 100,000 live births in 2004 to 7.2 in 2013. The nation has ap-proached malaria free status. The number of children attending primary schools has increased to 98 per cent while the number attending secondary schools have in-creased to 84 per cent. Rural unemployment has also de-clined from 7.8 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Unemployment among youth in the age group of 18-30 has declined from 15.8 per cent to 13.1 per cent.

153 154

However, the remaining facets of poverty including vulnerabilities to droughts, non- communicable deceases, lack of access to quality drinking water, sanitation and malnutrition remain to be addressed further to eradicate poverty and reduce unemployment.

The Real Economy - 2014

Honourable Speaker, paddy agriculture, the backbone of our rural community has suffered a setback during the last two years due to severe drought conditions. The 2013/14 Maha paddy production and the 2014 Yala paddy and maize production, suffered losses. However, the Government promptly implemented cash for work pro-grammes targeting those in such districts, who are de-pendent on daily earnings. Arrangements were made to distribute drinking water and neglected wells were re-stored. Using the drought as an opportunity, several major and minor irrigation systems totalling 678 were rehabili-tated at a cost of about Rs. 3,000 million to create extra water storage capacity in Hambantota, Monaragala, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Mannar, Polonnaruwa and Vavuniya Districts. The importation of rice was temporar-ily liberalized to ensure sufficient food supplies and to prevent speculative price hikes in the market.

Despite the setback to the paddy and maize produc-tion, the production of black gram, green gram, big onion, potatoes, fruits and vegetables has increased. Milk, poul-try, fish and eggs have also shown a similar improvement. The coconut production which, severely suffered due to the prolonged drought in the coconut triangle, is recover-ing with a favorable production trend. The production of tea, cinnamon and other export crops has also shown an improvement. Remunerative farm gate prices, the fertil-izer subsidy, the price stabilization tax structure that pre-vails at the point of import, provision of quality seeds and planting materials and better storage and marketing facili-ties have helped our farmers to increase production through diversified crop cultivation.

Tourism industry has sustained its growth momentum with foreign tourist arrivals exceeding 1.1 million and domestic tourism expanding to 5.1 million, at present. Foreign earnings have reached US Dollars 1.9 billion up to September and are expected to surpass US Dollars 2.5 billion this year. The contribution of countrys construc-tion industry increasingly driven by local companies is growing at around 17 per cent due to expanded invest-ments in infrastructure as well as higher private invest-ments in urban property development, housing, tourism facilities, new factories and other logistics.

Honourable Speaker, import-competing industries such as cement, steel, rubber-based products, agricultural and industrial machinery, equipment, spare parts, power generation and transmission machinery and equipment,

building materials, furniture and boat and ship building have expanded. A similar expansion is seen through new investments in food processing, sugar and vegetable oil manufacturing, diary and pharmaceutical production and renewable energy industries. Many of these activities have a potential to graduate to export markets in the me-dium-term. The foreign investment is nearing US Dollars 2 billion. The revised Customs tariffs that will come into force tonight will facilitate a further expansion of such value creating, import competing industries. Quality stan-dards will be enforced on imports and exports to promote competitive industries. An anti-dumping legislation will be placed before Parliament shortly to ensure fair prac-tices in external trade.

Export industries have picked up showing a 12 per cent growth. The apparel industry has shown a 15 per cent growth and is expected to generate US Dollars 5,000 million export earnings this year. Value-added tea, rubber and cinnamon products have increased exports earnings to US Dollars 3,000 million. Software, gem and jewel-lery, handloom and confectionary industries have gained momentum. Export earnings are expected to generate US Dollars 11,500 million this year.

An increased number of people in the skilled catego-ries have secured foreign employment and departures for housemaid jobs have declined. The remittance income from foreign employment is expected to be around US Dollars 7,000 million this year.

The Government maintained stability in commodity prices and the food supply. Annual average inflation reg-istering at 4.2 per cent so far confirms our ability to se-cure a mid- single digit inflation this year in spite of ad-verse impacts of the drought. The exchange rate stabi-lized in comparison to the historical average of an annual 10 per cent depreciation. I wish to table the reports of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Finance and Planning that provides a full account of the economy and finance.

Development Goals - 2020 and Beyond

Honourable Speaker, sustaining an employment level at 97 per cent of the labour force remains our employ-ment goal for 2020. Our vision is to engage students after reaching GCE Ordinary Level and Advanced Level stan-dards, either in higher education for graduate studies or in the vocational stream of education to drive the economy making optimum use of knowledge and skills of our work force, is the overall target of our employment strategy. Maintaining youth employment at 95 per cent is a special target of our employment strategy.

Pre-school child development, 100 per cent school enrolment for primary and secondary education, 100 per cent literacy and 90 per cent computer literacy, knowl-edge in English, Mathematics and Science, and basic

155 156

[ ]

2014 24

vocational skills, together with active involvement of children in sports are our goals for general education. Marching to the top of the Asia Pacific region in Human resources by 2020, remains to be our primary goal in edu-cation. Matching advanced country standards in health remains our goal for health. Improving healthcare to reach higher standards while registering a zero maternal and child mortality is our goal in healthcare for women and children. The elimination of malnutrition among children gets equal high priority. Similarly, we must double our efforts to eliminate risks faced by our people to communi-cable and non-communicable diseases and raise life ex-pectancy to beyond 80 years of age, by 2020.

As proposed in the 2014 Budget, steps have been taken to set up a National Science Centre to promote sci-entific knowledge required for the advancement of our society. The Government and private sector partnership has worked well in the setting up of a Science Park for the promotion of nanotechnology in manufacturing and to further advanced technology and research. An Atomic Energy Authority is being set up to promote specialized research and technology development in advanced sci-ence. The number of professionals engaged in the field of accountancy, commerce, finance, law, medicine, IT, engineering and architecture has increased considerably. Our vision is to increase the university intake to 100,000 in 2020 and place our universities among the top 30 in Asia.

A National Drug Policy has been formulated for the regulation of drug usage, clinical trials and research ac-tivities in specialized hospitals. Parallel to these develop-ments, we propose to expand the subject areas of the Post-graduate Institute of Medicine and also to double the in-take for postgraduate studies in medicine. The Post Graduate Institute of Medicine will be transformed over the next three years, as a state-of-the-art facility that would connect neighbouring teaching hospitals to engage in postgraduate research and advanced studies and in-crease medical specialists capable of treating kidney ail-ments, malnutrition and similar contemporary challenges faced by our society.

The Governments effort over the last eight years to promote IT as a major industry is expected to raise for-eign earnings to about US Dollars 1 billion by 2016, while creating around 100,000 well-paid employment opportunities. Our vision is to lift Sri Lanka to be among the Top 30 IT destinations in the world over the next three years and to raise foreign earnings to US Dollars 5 billion and make it a major employment generation sector for youth, by 2022. The ICT Zone at Hambantota offers facilities of global standards for IT/BPO services, to transform Sri Lanka as the emerging ICT Hub in South Asia.

Honourable Speaker, I have explained to this august Assembly and in other international forums that economic

growth makes no meaning to the ordinary and less eco-nomically privileged people unless it improves their in-comes and living conditions. Therefore, raising income and livelihood opportunities of low income people will continue to be an uncompromising goal of our develop-ment strategy. Our effort is not only directed at raising their income but also to eliminate their vulnerabilities to climate related challenges, non-communicable diseases, disabilities et cetera and improve their access to quality drinking water, decent housing and sanitation, easy ac-cess to schools and hospitals.

Honourable Speaker, we have set our export target at US Dollars 20 billion in 2020. Our aim is to raise export earnings of high value tea, apparel, handlooms and rubber products to US Dollars 15 billion by 2020. Our vision for tea, apparel and cinnamon exports is to position Sri Lanka among the Top 10 high quality product manu-facturing countries in the world by 2020. Natural rubber, cinnamon and spices while being exports capable of se-curing premium value, will also protect our environment and biodiversity interests in development. We have re-quested the World Trade Organization to declare Ceylon Cinnamon as a specific product based on a geographical identification. These will pass on broad-based benefits of development to a majority of our people, who are pre-dominantly smallholders. Our desire is also to promote fruits, vegetable, foliage and poultry also as exports, since our producers have developed such products to a level that meets international standards. The promotion of pineapple, mango, papaya, banana, dragon fruit and strawberry as export earning sources, are expected to earn US Dollars 500 million by 2020.

Sri Lanka has the potential to export high value prod-ucts from mineral sands, graphite, ilmenite and gems. However, these valuable natural resources must be ex-ported only with full value addition done locally, while adhering with stringent environmental compliances to be able to secure the best export income from such manufac-turing industries. The export performance in ship and boat building, machinery and equipment argues well for entering high-skilled engineering stage of industrializa-tion which can raise the value of manufactured exports beyond US Dollars 20 billion in 2020.

Honourable Speaker, this country has also proved its potentials in exporting services such as business and knowledge processing services, professional services, ports and aviation services, and banking & financial ser-vices. It is encouraging that IT and tourism industries are projecting US Dollars 5 billion each in foreign exchange earnings in 2022. As skilled and technical categories are encouraged towards foreign employment, remittance in-come from oversees employment is projected to be over US Dollars 15 billion in 2020.

Honourable Speaker, the Government is committed to gain a higher investment grade by reducing debt to GDP

157 158

to below 60 per cent, further strengthening countrys al-ready strong macroeconomic environment by 2020 to consolidate countrys economic strength. In the backdrop of this direction, the overall investment to GDP is ex-pected to rise to 40 per cent. The total Gross Domestic Production is expected to exceed US Dollars 165 billion at a rate of around 13 per cent growth. Taking the process of transforming the economy from a less-developed econ-omy with a per capita income of less than US Dollars 1,200 prior to 2005 to a US Dollars 4,000 per capita econ-omy by 2015, moving further forward we plan to surpass US Dollars 7,500 per capita income for our people, as a high middle-income country is our national income goal by 2020.

Consolidating the progress made in governance be-tween 2005 and 2014, we aim at gaining a ranking among top 10 countries in the Asia Pacific region in the World Peace Index, Economic Freedom Index, Rules of Law Index, Doing Business Index, Human Resource Develop-ment Index and Infrastructure Development Index, with a poverty-free status in 2020. The 2015-17 Fiscal Framework

Honourable Speaker, I wish to remind our fiscal ex-perts in the Opposition, that our fiscal policy framework is significantly different from the way they approached the Budget. All post-1977 Governments prior to us oper-ated on higher budget deficits, way above 8 per cent of GDP and left us an accumulated debt stock in excess of national income. Our immediate past United National Front Government removed pension rights of Public Servants and also imposed a recruitment freeze to curtail Public Servants to 300,000. Subsidies were curtailed. Pri-vatization was accelerated. Public investments were re-duced. These were the salient features of the fiscal policy during that period.

Our Government did not privatize a single State Enter-prise since 2005. To the contrary, we got back the Gas Company, SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Telecom, Insur-ance Corporation, Pelwatte and Sevanagala Sugar Com-panies, Colombo Hilton et cetera. The value of asset crea-tion in CEB, Ports Authority, Water Supply and Drainage Board, Airports and Aviation Authority, Urban Develop-ment Authority, Road Development Authority, Irrigation Department, in universities, hospitals, schools, public offices, land and property are far in excess of Government debt that we raised to build them up.

We increased expenditure on infrastructure develop-ment, salaries and pensions payments, Divi Neguma, Samurdi benefits, the fertilizer subsidy and introduced guaranteed prices for local producers. Around 500,000 Public Sector employees and a further 100,000 unem-ployed graduates were recruited. Instead of reducing the

Public servants to 300,000, we raised it to around 1.3 mil-lion. Further, areas liberated from terrorists were demined. The Government spent funds for the implemen-tation of recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and to popularize the usage of bilingual practices to promote national reconciliation and for the rehabilitation of misguided youth. We have also been able to provide a monthly living allowance to all parents of our three forces, to disabled soldiers and relief assistance for those affected by natural disasters.

With all these measures that have been taken, the Budget Deficit has been reduced to 5 per cent of GDP in 2014 and will target 4.6 per cent in 2015. We are deter-mined to raise a surplus in the revenue account gradually towards 2.5 per cent of GDP and bring down the Budget deficit to 3.8 per cent by 2016 and 3 per cent by 2017, underscoring our commitment to limit borrowings only for capital formation and not for consumption. We will reduce the Debt /GDP ratio to 65 per cent. We have paid back almost half of IMF debt of US Dollars 2.5 billion, which we obtained through a Stand-By Arrangement in 2009 to stabilize our economy. We will provide a strong National Budget that is capable of servicing all such debt of our country promptly, to maintain the creditworthiness of our nation.

The Government revenue in 2015 is likely to be around Rs. 1,600 billion and current expenditure will be around Rs. 1,400 billion. This will secure payment of salaries, pensions, fertilizer subsidy for pharmaceutical drugs, welfare expenditure and interest cost of debt. Fur-ther, the Budget will maintain public investments of Rs. 730 billion to expand infrastructure, human resources development and economic activities.

The proper coordination of development programmes in each sector in terms of economic priorities is necessary in order maximize benefits from public expenditure. Hence, expenditure programmes taking place through line ministries, Provincial Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas have been sequenced in the 2015 Budget in terms of de-velopment priorities of 2015-17 medium-term. Provisions have also been made to channel all foreign grant-aided projects through the Consolidated Fund and the National Budget, adhering with the applicable planning and public financial management procedure. I have also directed the Treasury to strictly monitor commitment controls of all spending agencies to have smooth cash disbursements and uninterrupted implementation of public expenditure pro-grammes.

State Enterprises

Honourable Speaker, our Government strongly be-lieves that State assets and enterprises are the biggest re-source base of our country. The Government through its Public Investment Programme has built up the asset base of major State Enterprises to increase their earning capac-

159 160

2014 24

ity and further reduce cost to the people from their ser-vices. Following a proposal of last years Budget, we have commenced to convert all previous loans granted to them by the Treasury-to-Government equity, in order to further strengthen their Balance Sheets.

In terms of the strength of SriLankan and Mihin Lanka airlines which are going through capitalization and re-structuring, we now operate from our two International Airports a 25 fleet air services to 90 destinations in 44 countries linking them direct to Sri Lanka. For the final phase of capitalization of the two airlines, this Budget has allocated US Dollars 150 million in 2015. The Ports Au-thority and Airports Authority now mange two interna-tional ports and airports making a regional attraction and profits. I am pleased to inform this august Assembly that, out of the 54 State-Owned Business Enterprises, 47 have been turned around to be profitable entities. I value the contribution made and the guidance provided by the Par-liament oversight Committee on Public Enterprises, to-wards improving governance and accountability of these enterprises.

Part II

Proposals

Honourable Speaker, I would like to spell out the Budget Proposals for 2015 within 2015-17 medium term budget framework and how the Government will engineer the fiscal policy towards further strengthening public fi-nance, development and welfare of the people.

Government Revenue

We need to strengthen Government revenue efforts in view of increasingly high commitments of the Govern-ment to provide a wide range of public services, welfare programmemes and public investments. I propose to im-pose Excise Special Provision Tax on motor vehicle im-ports in lieu of all multiple taxes at the point of import. This simplified taxation will generate an additional reve-nue of Rs. 5,000 million. It is proposed to fix the tax-free threshold applicable for VAT and NBT on supermarket scale retail businesses at Rs. 100 million per quarter, while increasing the tax free threshold for VAT and NBT to Rs. 15 million a month to create tax free environment for small business. I have also increased the Excise Tax on cigarettes and liquor to raise Rs. 14,000 million of additional revenue in 2015. I also propose to levy a US Dollars 100 per person entrance fee to premises where casino entertainment activities take place and raise the Gaming Levy to 10 per cent of turnover to raise further revenue of Rs. of 2,500 million.

Honourable Speaker, it has become customary among some that tax due to the Government and EPF contribu-tions are disputed to delay or evade such payments. Therefore, I propose to introduce a refinance facility to

provide 5-year credit at 6 per cent interest from all banks to enable liable taxpayers to pay their tax arrears, in terms of prevailing taxes operational from 2010 and Provident Fund payments up to 31 March 2014 to facilitate them to meet their statutory compliances. I expect to recover Rs. 40,000 million of arrears through this measure. I invite the Judiciary, the Tax Department and default taxpayers to assist to conclude the settlement of disputed tax and EPF payment arrears accordingly within 6 months. I pro-pose to vest in the State, property corresponding to such arrears of default taxpayers who do not make use of this opportunity.

I propose to fix the maximum PAYE tax rate at 16 per cent to ease the burden of wage earning employees and professionals. It is proposed to reduce the Value Added Tax to 11 per cent.

Foreigners can have access to State and private land only through long lease arrangements subject to payment of a land lease tax. As such, I propose to strictly enforce the payment of 7.5 per cent or 15 per cent tax and other provisions contained in the Act. I expect Rs. 2,000 mil-lion from this new land alienation tax on foreigners next year. I propose to enforce exchange control regulations to prevent foreigners from engaging in illegal land transac-tions through the use of local names and local companies. I also propose to amend the Finance Act to strictly en-force the transfer of all surplus funds other than those committed expenditure of all spending and other agencies of the public sector to have a better control on public fi-nancial management.

The Inland Revenue Department is being computer-ized to link all relevant agencies to improve tax admini-stration and to enable the use of a Personnel Identification Number to co-ordinate all transactions. I am pleased to announce that with effect from tomorrow the Inland Revenue and Customs will go online to simplify income tax registration and export and import transaction-related payments.

Strengthening State Business Enterprises

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has contained its losses and has also reduced its debt to banks. The recent reduction of prices of petrol by Rs. 5 per litre, diesel by Rs. 3 per litre and kerosene by Rs. 20 per litre, is a reflec-tion of its improved financial position. Therefore, the Government will convert Rs. 150 billion of CPC debt to equity and guarantee its financing to rebuild the pipeline network, storage facilities and capacity expansion of the oil refinery to 1,500 metric ton. The CPC will form a joint venture to protect its interest in the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm that had been sold to the Indian Oil Company, to develop storage facilities.

I propose to convert previous loans and interest pay-ments of the Water Supply and Drainage Board to the

161 162

Treasury amounting to Rs. 60 billion to Government eq-uity, to strengthen operational profits and service their own project financing arrangements. I propose to reduce water charges for household consumption up to 25 units by 10 per cent. Following my Budget Proposal last year, a National Community Water Supply Department has been established to regulate and develop community wa-ter supply schemes. I propose to allocate Rs. 750 million for the rehabilitation of community water supply schemes and develop new schemes under this Department with particular emphasis on villages affected by kidney and waterborne diseases.

Following the Budget Proposal to improve rural trans-port services, arrangement has been made to deploy 400 small buses. I propose to import further 500 small buses to expand these rural services. In order to strengthen the bus fleet of Sri Lanka Transport Board with a further 2,000 buses, a public investment of Rs. 1,000 million has also been provided to SLTB. Salaries of CTB employees were raised to equalize minimum salaries of the Public Service salary structure. I also propose to allocate Rs. 10 billion over 2015 -17 to rehabilitate the national airports at Ratmalana, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura, Palali, Batti-caloa and set up new airports at Kandy and Nuwara Eliya to promote domestic travel and tourism and to ease traffic congestion.

The Government-owned Kurunegala and Chillaw Plantation Companies have performed well and paid divi-dends to the Treasury. On this success, I propose to set up a separate Government-owned Plantation Company to develop all JEDB and SLPC plantation lands with a capi-tal infusion of Rs. 1,000 million. In order to strengthen State construction companies, I propose to allocate Rs. 3,000 million to provide the capital contribution to State Engineering Corporation, Central Engineering Consul-tancy Bureau and State Development and Construction Company. The sugar plantation industry, which had been neglected and used largely to manufacture liquor was taken over by the Government in 2012 and has been re-vived to increase sugar production. Further, it also helps about 25,000 families in Uva and Eastern Provinces to improve their livelihood earnings. Therefore, I also pro-pose to allocate Rs. 5,000 million to build modern sugar manufacturing plants at Kantale, Hugurana and Pelwatta and develop smallholder plantations under Sri Lanka Sugar Company during 2015-16. I propose to increase the farmgate price of sugarcane to provide a greater incentive to be involved in sugar cultivation, to Rs. 4,500 per metric ton.

Strengthening Banking and Financial Institutions

Honourable Speaker, the capitalization of the Central Bank with Rs.50 billion this year laid a solid foundation for the financial system stability in this country. Similarly following the last year Budget Proposal, consolidation of

finance companies has witnessed progress. As part of financial sector strengthening, the two Development Banks are also being merged to create a strong develop-ment bank in the country, next year. I also propose to provide Rs. 10 billion capital to strengthen the Bank of Ceylon. In order to provide greater security to deposit holders of the banks, I also propose to increase deposit insurance by 50 per cent.

Honourable Speaker, the Central Bank manages the Employees Provident Fund, which has an asset base of Rs. 1 trillion. Central Bank in recent years has invested about 10 per cent of its assets in income earning commer-cial assets, which has gained capital appreciation of around Rs. 10 billion this year. I, therefore, propose to distribute dividend to members of Provident Fund who has over 10 years of active accounts. This is the first ever dividend distribution by the EPF and I see this as a special benefit to members. In addition, the Fund has got stronger to pay all members of the fund an interest income in ex-cess of 10 per cent each year.

Honourable Speaker, Sri Lanka has membership in the IMF, the World Bank and the ADB. This year, we sup-ported the initiative taken by the Peoples Republic of China to set up an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to meet infrastructure financing needs of Asia. I am pleased to inform this house that today we signed as a founder member of AIIB with several other member countries to set up this Bank.

Equity and Debt Market

Following the incentives in the 2013 Budget to pro-mote equity and debt market, the market capitalization has surpassed Rs. 3 trillion. Net Foreign inflows have reached nearly Rs. 100 billion. The value of unit trust has increased beyond Rs. 70 billion. Many companies have also listed their debt and total value now stands at around Rs. 100 Billion showing that the market has become a low cost source of raising money for capital formation. In the context of low interest rate regime that we have restored, I am sure that more equity and debt finance will be raised by our business community, for their business develop-ment.

Legal and Judicial Reforms

Honourable Speaker, steps have been taken to estab-lish an International Arbitration Centre in Colombo and to setup dedicated Courts to deal with tax matters and con-tract management disputes to expedite early dispensation of cases and prevent denial of revenue to the Government due to laws delays. As a step towards raising professional attraction to the Judicial Service, Personal Allowance of Judges has also been raised and their residential facilities are being rehabilitated. I propose to allocate an extra Rs. 750 million for such rehabilitation expenditure and to provide knowledge enhancement of Judges.

2014 24

Irrigation Development

Improving irrigation systems, providing quality drink-ing water and the conservation of wild life are priorities in the 2015-17 medium-term Budget framework. Accord-ingly, I propose to increase the irrigation budget by fur-ther Rs. 15,000 million for the early completion of Yan-Oya, Uma-Oya and Moragahakanda Development Pro-grammemes and to commence work connected with Gin River, Nilwala River, Kelani River, Howpe Dam Scheme, Ma-Oya and Badulu-Oya - Ranella, Malwathu Oya, Kalinga Nuwara, Veli-Oya, Kalugal-Oya, Maha Galga-muwa Weva and Thalpitigala Reservoir Development and to further develop downstream and livelihood activities associated with Weheragala, Rambaken-Oya and Deduru-Oya Reservoirs. I also propose to allocate Rs. 2,000 mil-lion to build small dams across rivers flowing through dry zone plains, to create water reservoirs.

Provincial and Rural Roads

Honourable Speaker, a new initiative has been under-taken to develop provincial and rural roads and bridges to connect 1,000 well populated villages with the assistance of development agencies. In order to accelerate this rural centric development initiative, I propose to raise the Gov-ernment contribution by Rs. 20,000 million to provincial and national road development authorities to rehabilitate access roads in rural areas.

Sri Lanka Railways

Honourable Speaker, the Northern railway infrastruc-ture destroyed by LTTE was fully restored and Yal Devi train service was put back in operation. Matara-Kataragama railway extension is under construction. Fur-ther, I propose a medium-term development strategy to expand railway infrastructure by introducing double tracks to Vavuniya, Anuradhapura, Polgahawela and Kandy sections as well as to the Kelani Valley section together with connectivity to major townships in the Greater Colombo area to improve commuter transport. I also propose to restore the cadre of Sri Lanka Railways to its 1993 position of 13,000 employees and work out a rational recruitment and salary structure in terms of new Service Minute to make it a special service. This will cor-rect the longstanding salary anomalies among railway employees. I propose to allocate Rs. 2,000 million of ad-ditional provision in 2015.

Postal Department

Honourable Speaker, the Postal Department that has a near 25,000 workforce, which was once a heavy financial burden to the Treasury has made significant improve-ments in recent years. In this background, the rehabilita-tion of postoffice building complexes with sufficient cli-ent facilities is essential for its expansion. The Depart-ment also requires new machinery and equipment as well

as improvements to its distribution system. Reflecting the unique nature of this service, I propose to establish a separate Service Minute for the Postal Department to de-velop its human resource skills and service delivery. I propose to allocate Rs. 2,500 million over 2015-17 for the modernization of postal services. I also propose to give motor bicycles to all postmen in 2015, at an affordable cost.

Wildlife Conservation

Honourable Speaker, in order to cultivate animal fod-der in reserved areas and the rehabilitation of water tanks and such other facilities to prevent animals from entering villages, I propose to continue to allocate Rs. 10 million to each relevant Divisional Secretariat to expand Wildlife Conservation and Community Protection Schemes taking into consideration the specific needs in such areas. I pro-pose to give a special recognition to such Divisional Sec-retaries who give leadership to community base conserva-tion programmemes by giving them priority in foreign training. I also propose to allocate Rs. 200 million to the Wildlife Conservation Department to purchase required utility vehicles and equipment. I also propose to extend the insurance scheme introduced in the 2013 Budget to compensate losses to human life and property to cover crop damages from elephants as well, from 2015.

Agrarian Development

Honourable Speaker, we consider that our rural centric development strategy must focus on agriculture for food security and a higher income to the rural people. There-fore, I propose to continue with the fertilizer subsidy scheme to provide all varieties of fertilizer at Rs. 350 per 50 kg bag for paddy cultivation. Since farmers were badly affected by the recent drought, the Government has al-ready decided to give paddy seeds to all small farmers free of charge in 2014/15 Maha season. I propose to in-crease the guaranteed price of paddy to Rs. 34 - 40 per kilo. I also propose to strengthen the guaranteed price scheme to farmers for potato, onion, dry chili and maize by linking Divi Neguma and Agrarian Service purchasing centres with Lanka Sathosa, while expanding their stor-age facilities. It is also proposed that high taxes prevailing at the point of import on these items during harvesting times should be continued.

In keeping with our Government policy, we have be-gun to implement a three-year rehabilitation program-meme to restore abandoned paddy lands and put them back to use for the cultivation of paddy, fruits, vegetable and floriculture using organic fertilizer. It is proposed that aquaculture, cultivation of grassland for animal feed, wa-ter reservoirs, community parks and walking tracks will also be developed along these lands. I propose to allocate additional Rs. 2,300 million in 2015 for these land devel-opment initiatives. I propose to extend agricultural credit to those who cultivate in such lands. We have already

165 166

increased the cadre of Agrarian Service Department, the Department of Agriculture and provincial agricultural divisions to expand extension services while providing required training for the staff.

Smallholder Plantation

Honourable Speaker, following the last year Budget Proposal, I propose to continue the Rs. 5,000 per acre grant assistance to support land preparation towards water retention, soil conservation, the use of organic fertilizer for smallholder tea cultivation to increase production. The subsidized price of Rs. 1,250 per 50 per kg bag will also be continued for all these crops. The prevailing high taxes on edible oil, coconut oil and palm oil at the point of cus-toms will be maintained in the long-term interest of coco-nut plantation. Financial and technical assistance will be provided for the development of Palmyrah and Kitul plan-tation and associated industries. The CESS applicable on the export of tea, rubber, coconut, cinnamon and pepper in primary form will be further strengthened to channel such revenue to encourage cultivation and related im-provements of these crops.

I propose to increase the replanting subsidy to tea smallholders from Rs. 875,000 to Rs. 1 million per acre and the new planting subsidy from Rs. 625,000 to Rs. 750,000 from next year. Financial assistance will be ex-tended to fully modernize smallholder tea factories with modern machinery and processing equipment. In order to encourage rubber growers, I propose to increase the CESS on rubber imports by Rs. 10 per kilo and also implement a guaranteed price of Rs. 300 per kilo to encourage small rubber growers from November 2014. Rain-guard instru-ments will be provided for small rubber growers in the wet zones and lands will be provided in other areas to grow rubber. Therefore, I propose to increase the alloca-tion to the Department of Rubber, by Rs. 3,500 million.

I propose to increase new and replanting subsidy for coconut from Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 10,000 per acre and the subsidy for the rehabilitation of coconut land from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 per acre. I also propose to increase Kapruka Investment Loan up to Rs. 3 million to cover soil improvement and water retention in coconut lands. I pro-pose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million for these initiatives. I propose to increase the planting subsidy for minor export crops by 25 per cent and accordingly increase the alloca-tion by Rs. 250 million to the Department of Agricultural Exports. It is proposed to increase the subsidy granted for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables as well as operat-ing dairy farms by 50 per cent.

Large-Scale Plantations

Large-scale Plantations were privatized in 1992 on 50-year lease arrangements. However, only a few plantation

companies shown notable development having increased their productivity. Therefore, each plantation company which has not responded to my Budget Proposal last year will be put on notice for six months to enable the Golden Shareholder being the Government to make appropriate decisions regarding the development of plantations under each company, including the cancellation of their lease holding.

I propose to implement a credit scheme with an 8-year maturity at 6 per cent interest to all well performing com-panies that will commit, on an agreed area for planting and replanting, for social development of plantation workers and to increase the volume of value added tea exports. This facility will not be extended to plantation companies, which have not paid due lease rental value to the Government unless they pay such sum with arrears. Companies that have not paid their land lease rentals will not get this facility.

Professional Skills and Research for Plantation

I propose to set up a Plantation Academy to develop a new generation of professional planters and smallholder planters, to extend training on best agricultural practices and technology skills. Public investments on Tea, Rubber and Coconut Research Institutes will be doubled to facili-tate the private sector to fully benefit from triple deduc-tion tax facility on research and development. I propose to allocate Rs. 3,000 million to develop Tea Research Insti-tute at Talawakele and Rubber Research Institute at Agalawatta as state -of the-art research institutes.

Farmer Pension and Crop Insurance Scheme

I implemented a pension scheme to provide a mini-mum of Rs. 1,250 as a monthly pension for farmers over 63 years of age, from January 2014. I have already made a capital contribution of Rs. 1,000 million by the Govern-ment to strengthen this contributory pension fund. This fund will also extend compensation for crop damage aris-ing from the Crop Insurance Scheme that was introduced. Arrangements will be made to allow those who could not contribute to this pension scheme during the time it was inactive, to continue to contribute. I propose to extend Farmer Pension Scheme to all smallholder farmers en-gaged in all crops to support their old age. Therefore, I propose to increase the capital contribution to the Farmer Pension Scheme by Rs. 5,000 million, over the next three years.

Export Industries

Honourable Speaker, manufacturers of exports are provided with a low income tax rate of 12 per cent, a high depreciation provision for advanced machinery and Cus-tom bonding and free port facilities. In order to further facilitate such exports, a one-stop service centre providing banking, quarantine, quality standards and other trade

167 168

[ ]

2014 24

services through a computer network will be established at Customs. In order to encourage the modernization of export industries, I propose to grant accelerated deprecia-tion provision and exemption from income tax on divi-dend provided they undertake over US Dollars 2 million investments on machinery and equipment. I also propose to implement a pension scheme for employees in the ap-parel industry to improve job attraction and security.

I also propose to expand triple deductions for expendi-ture on research, innovation and brand promotion for such industries. Export of high value products of tea, rubber, coconut, cinnamon and spices will be encouraged through increased cultivation of these crops and by maintaining a high level of CESS on primary commodity exports. I also propose to use 50 per cent of the special CESS collected by the Tea Board to share with local tea producers to pro-mote high value tea in global markets with a Sri Lankan identity and country image. In this regard, the Free Trade Agreement with China is expected be operational by mid-2015, which will provide a greater boost for the countrys exports. I also propose to reduce import taxes of packag-ing material required for exports suitably without affect-ing local industries that manufacture such material.

Fisheries Industry

Honourable Speaker, the fish harvest has doubled within the last five years and has exceeded 500,000 met-ric tons. The production of dried fish and sprats, maldive-fish, canned fish and fish food has increased while also reducing related imports to less than 70,000 metric tons. I propose to set up dried-fish processing zones around se-lected fishery harbours and implement a guaranteed price scheme to purchase the fish harvest of small fishermen. The inland fishery production has increased to 20 per cent of total fish production. Aquaculture has gained consider-able interest among small and medium-term entrepre-neurs. Therefore, I propose a loan scheme to assist such entrepreneurs to develop their fish farms. I also propose to allocate Rs. 200 million to develop 1,000 inland fish farm villages and Rs. 50 million for the expansion of or-namental fish exports. Fish breeding centres of NARA at Udawalawa, Dambulla, Inginiyagala and Polonnaruwa will be further developed to help SMEs.

I also propose to allocate Rs. 1,500 million for the rehabilitation of cold room facilities and setting up of marketing outlets to improve supply and distribution at affordable prices. Import duties on equipment required for the expansion of marketing facilities will be reduced.

Socioeconomic Empowerment of the Fishing Com-munity

The improvement of living conditions of the fishing community requires special programmes to improve the quality of life especially of women and children. There-fore, I propose to implement a dedicated three-year pro-

gramme for pre-school children, primary schooling chil-dren, livelihood opportunities for women and the elderly, skills development of youth and improvement of housing and sanitation conditions of the fishing community. I pro-pose to allocate Rs. 750 million each year, from 2015 to the Ministry of Fisheries to implement this in collabora-tion with respective Provincial Councils.

Livestock and Poultry Industries

Honourable Speaker, local milk production has in-creased to 40 per cent of local consumption requirements. Public sector and private sector dairy farms as well as small and medium enterprises have substantially in-creased their investment in this sector. Funds have been allocated for the expansion of the production of MILCO by doubling its capacity as well as to import 20,000 high quality cows to promote small and medium dairy farms as well as Government farms.

A special loan scheme is being implemented at a low interest rate in support of SMEs to promote dairy farms, set up milk collection centres and procure equipment, increase animal feed production etc. A CESS of Rs. 150 per kilo on imported milk powder and the high CESS on the importation of butter, yoghurt and dairy products to be maintained to further support this industry. I now pro-pose to increase the guaranteed price of liquid milk to Rs. 60 per litre to increase local milk production and reduce the price of locally made milk powder by Rs. 100 per kilo and yoghurt by Rs. 5 per yoghurt to popularize local products. I propose to increase allocations to Provincial Councils to assist small dairy farmers to promote cattle farms and quality animal feed production at provincial level.

I propose to allocate Rs. 700 million to expand the capacity of training centres at Mahaberitenna, Thalpo-kuna, Kekunadura, Karandagolla, Sippikulama, Va-vuniya, Vannigama, Kotadeniyawa, Udugoda, Uppuveli and Weeravila to increase training programmes for field level officers as well as small and medium dairy farmers.

Poultry production has exceeded 155,000 metric tons eliminating the deficit production that prevailed a few years back. The per capita consumption at 7.5 kg is al-most double the consumption that prevailed five years ago. This industry has also entered export markets. In order to assist small poultry farms, I propose to introduce a supply mechanism to provide maize at Rs. 40 per kg and provide export incentives for chicken and eggs. I also propose to allocate Rs. 200 million to strengthen related veterinary services with modern facilities and equipment. I propose to recruit 500 Technical Assistants to the field of animal husbandry in 2015 to expand extension work.

Health Services

Honourable Speaker, people suffering from kidney diseases have increased in some districts. Therefore, a

169 170

coordinated effort has been launched on an accelerated basis to provide health care facilities to kidney patients with doctors, medicine and equipment. Preventive care against kidney diseases has been taken through the provi-sion of water purification plants scholl in affected areas. I also propose to grant a monthly living allowance of Rs. 3,000 for those adversely affected by kidney deceases. I also propose to provide Rs. 750 million to expand facili-ties at the Kidney Hospital at Maligawatta to be able to cater to an increased number of patients and to expand the facilities of the Anuradhapura and Hambantota Kidney Hospitals.

The Maharagama Cancer Hospital has been developed to be able to manage an increased number of indoor and outdoor patients. Radioiodine treatment and radiotherapy units at Jaffna, Kandy, Badulla, Kurunegala, Batticaloa, Anuradhapura, Karapitiya and Ratnapura Hospitals will be expanded. I propose to provide Rs. 700 million for a cancer prevention programme in women. Following the last year Budget Proposal, work is in progress to set up a National Stroke Centre to manage stroke- related medi-care. I propose to allocate Rs. 300 million to set up spe-cial stroke centres with modern medical facilities at Anuradhapura, Ratnapura, Badulla, Ampara, Matara and Kurunegala Hospitals.

As maternity care should be given special attention, I propose to allocate Rs. 1,500 million to develop Karapitiya, Colombo, Kandy and Anuradhapura Mater-nity Hospitals as super centres in maternity care and de-velop Badulla and Beliatta Hospitals as maternity and childcare specialized centres. Steps have also been taken to accelerate the modernization of the two national chil-drens hospitals as centres of excellence capable of pro-viding the next 10-year paediatric care needs of our coun-try as well as medical research on paediatric care. The OPD treatment and ancillary facilities of the Colombo National Hospital expanding its outdoor patient care ca-pacity will be completed by 2017.

I propose to allocate Rs. 500 million to implement accelerated medical examinations of all citizens through mobile medical clinics and expand testing-related facili-ties to strengthen preventive healthcare. I seek the support of all religious places of worship to give leadership in organizing such clinics in each Grama Niladari Division. I propose to commence a mobile ambulance service in all main hospitals through the National Insurance Trust Fund to provide emergency care at their doorsteps to persons who fall ill suddenly, to be taken to hospital safely.

Indigenous Medicine

I propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for the rehabilita-tion of ayurvedic hospitals and promotion of indigenous medical research. I also propose to grant a monthly allow-

ance of Rs. 5,000 for indigenous medical doctors who serve in government ayurvedic hospitals. I propose to implement a loan scheme for indigenous medical practi-tioners to be able to draw upto Rs. 500,000 at 6 per cent interest, to improve their dispensaries and to process re-quired medicinal treatment.

Pre-School Child Development

Honourable Speaker, in order to provide greater atten-tion to child development, pre- school childhood develop-ment must be given special recognition. Therefore, I pro-pose to support all pre schools through the provision of child development apparatus and pre-school material. I also propose to grant a monthly allowance of Rs. 2,500 along with a credit facility of Rs. 10,000 to be used for incidental expenses by teachers operating such schools. They will be given training facilities on child develop-ment and pre-school education. I also propose to encour-age the setting up of pre schools close to every primary school in areas where no pre-school facilities are pres-ently available. I propose to set aside Rs. 300 million for this initiative.

Education

Honourable Speaker, it is proposed to increase the allocation made for 1,000 schools in which Mahindodaya Laboratories are located covering each Divisional Secre-tarys area by Rs. 15,000 million towards an overall im-provement of such facilities over three years. An alloca-tion of Rs. 1,500 million will be provided for the ongoing initiatives to upgrade sanitation and other facilities in ru-ral schools. I propose to increase the annual number of Year 5 Scholarships to 25,000 and to increase the allow-ance to those who pass the scholarship from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,500.

A further Rs. 750 million will be allocated to develop the Maharagama Teacher Training College as a well equipped training centre with regard to all subjects, while facilities in all other teacher training colleges in the coun-try will also be upgraded. An allocation of Rs. 300 mil-lion will be provided for the setting up of a Faculty of Management Enterpreneurship as well as a Faculty of Technology at the Training College at Meepe to expand training streams for teachers.

A new Service Minute for the Teacher Service has been already approved and promotions, salary increments and service-related administrative problems of around 240,000 teachers are expected to be managed efficiently. The approval of leave and salary increments for teachers will be delegated to the level of Principals. I also propose to recruit 50,000 teacher assistants to rural schools next year in English, mathematics, science, information tech-nology, aesthetic studies and sports. Once they complete their specialized subject training and leadership training, they will be absorbed to the respective schools. They will

171 172

[ ]

2014 24

be required to complete the degree in education within five years before absorption into Sri Lanka Education Service, after which they will be required to serve in the same school for a further five years. They will be given an allowance of Rs. 9,500 per month.

Pirivena Education

Pirivena education has been revived to raise the re-lated student population to be expanded by 25 per cent by the year 2016. I propose to double the grant of Rs. 500,000 given to each Pirivena in order to upgrade Pirivena education facilities. In addition to facilities ex-tended such as distress loans, property loans and Agrahara insurance benefits, I propose to raise the student allow-ance for monks and other students by 25 per cent.

Skills Education

Honourable Speaker, the intent of the fast-track skills development programme for our youth is to develop 100,000 diploma holders and certificate holders each year. For this purpose, diploma-awarding Technical Col-leges, Government Technical Training Institutes and joint programmes with private training institutes and work places are being expanded to accommodate a larger stu-dent intake.

In order to incentivize vocational education, I propose to implement a new student scholarship scheme for 50,000 students per year from low-income families who pass Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations, but are unable to enter universities or other advanced in-stitutes for further studies. Each student will be given a Rs. 3,000 monthly student allowance. This scheme will bring about diploma and certificate holders above Level V of the National Vocational Qualification, in employable fields. I also propose to increase the number of student scholarships to 50,000 per year and grant a student allow-ance of Rs. 3,000 per month to those studying at technical university colleges.

Higher Education and Research

Honourable Speaker, creating a higher education sys-tem that provides critical knowledge and analytical skills to our children, to place the country on an advanced re-search drive, is our vision.

Therefore, we have implemented a hostel construction programme for 25,000 students on an accelerated basis. Financial incentives will also be provided to house own-ers in the surrounding University Township area to pro-vide student accommodation facilities. I also propose to increase the Mahapola Scholarship monthly allowance to Rs. 4,000 per student from January next year. I propose to further raise incentive payments of academic and non-academic staff, to ensure a successful transformation of the higher education system.

Within the medium-term development programme, funds have been provided for the establishment of an En-gineering and Technology Faculty at the Jayawar-denepura University, an Information Technology Centre at the Kelaniya University, an Advanced Medical Faculty at the Peradeniya University and Electronics, Petroleum and Aeronautical Engineering Faculties at the Moratuwa University, to broaden subject streams. Capacity expan-sion would broaden subject streams in management, food technology, veterinary science and agriculture at Co-lombo, Wayamba, Jaffna, Rajarata, Eastern, Uva-Wellassa, Sabaragamuwa and Ruhuna Universities. The expansion of advanced degrees in indigenous medicine, research on non-communicable diseases through Ay-urveda Teaching Hospitals, is also a recognized priority.

I propose to allocate Rs. 1 billion to develop the nec-essary residential and research environments at the Post-graduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, to attract our scholarly monks, historians and research students to work together with foreign students and researchers to be able to share our cultural and Buddhist values around the world.

As part of broadening horizons of our higher educa-tion, I propose to set up a school of Economics and De-velopment Engineering that offers arts, commerce and science students qualifying from GCE A/L Exam to learn multidisciplinary subjects such as economics, law, engi-neering, science and mathematics being subject options in a single degree. Further, I propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for research on cancer by the Colombo Univer-sity, on kidney diseases by the Peradeniya and Rajarata Universities and on diabetics by the Ruhuna University and another Rs. 500 million to the National Research Council for research on other fields.

Nenasala

Honourable Speaker, I propose to allocate Rs. 1,000 million to set up a fully-equipped Nanasala centre at each such Grama Niladari Division in 2015 to mark our jour-ney towards a knowledge-centric economy by 2020.

I also propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for research lab facilities, equipment and research work at field level by universities located at provinces, with successful ven-tures in dairy, poultry, aquaculture, food technology, handloom designing, household dcor and gift-item de-signing, to be provided to small entrepreneurs at village level through the Nanasala network.

Art and Culture

Honourable Speaker, with the widespread develop-ment witnessed across regions, it is necessary that the Government expands modern infrastructure facilities for performing arts and culture. In this context, as I have pro-posed in my last Budget, the work of the two performing arts and cultural centres in Kandy and Anuradhapura is being completed. Further, steps have been taken to mod-ernize the cultural centres in Jaffna, Trincomalee and

173 174

Galle. The modernization of the Lionel Wendt Art Centre and the Lumbini Theatre is in progress. I propose to allo-cate Rs. 300 million for the improvement of parking fa-cilities, sanitation and waste management at each of our cultural and heritage cites. I propose to expand the con-cessionary loan scheme that was extended to media per-sonnel to purchase motor vehicles, to cover expenditure connected with facilities required to cover their profes-sional development.

Holiday Bungalows for Artistes

I proposed in my last Budget Speech, to build five holiday bungalows exclusively designed for artistes. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has com-menced the construction of these bungalows to be ready next year. I also propose to provide a half-tax holiday for a period of five years and financial assistance, to film and play producers to promote the production of films and plays capable of winning awards and recognition at inter-national festivals, to elevate this industry to international repute.

Divi Neguma

Honourable Speaker, Divi Neguma initiative has at-tracted over 2.5 million households and has now em-braced almost all villages in Sri Lanka. I propose to pro-vide loans up to Rs. 50,000 at an interest rate of 3 per cent without requiring any collateral to the best five homegar-dens in each Grama Niladari division developed with the participation of the entire family, to put up greenhouses, poultry farms, livestock sheds, fish farms, handloom or small industries. I also propose to implement a 5-year credit facility at a 3 per cent interest rate to five cottage industries in each Grama Niladari Division, to be devel-oped to commercial enterprise scale.

An allocation of Rs. 1,000 million will be provided to set up a Revolving Fund to provide loans up to Rs. 100,000 to pensioners associations, senior citizen clubs and death relief societies to promote social development activities. I propose that an amount between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 250,000 not exceeding a maximum of 50 per cent of their savings in Banks, be used to give small loans to them at a low rate of interest on the strength of a group security, to empower them economically. I also propose to increase the Divi Neguma monthly allowances, in the case of a family with four or more members to Rs. 3,000, in the case of a 3-member family to Rs. 2,500 and for the rest to Rs. 1,000 per month.

Child Nutrition

Honourable Speaker, I propose to allocate Rs. 500 million for the provision of nutritious food for children, to improve nutritional standards of mothers and children by

engaging nutritional specialists in each district and to carry out community level mobile clinics to distribute Thriposha and Samaposha nutrition supplements to all lactating and pregnant mothers and for the provision of meals to children attending pre-schools. The Divi Ne-guma/Samurdi programmes are directed to popularize consumption of homegrown vegetables, milk and eggs towards improving nutrition. I promote breastfeeding through these initiatives. I also propose to give infant milk food at concessional prices through Lanka Sathosa outlets. Since infant milk food is totally free from taxes, I request all supermarkets and traders to reduce the price of infant milk food.

Rataviru Empowerment

Honourable Speaker, as of now nearly 2 million of our people, a relatively large number being engaged in high-earning skilled jobs, are working in overseas destinations. Therefore, I propose to allocate further Rs. 500 million to develop five dedicated vocational schools in Badulla, Kurunegala, Hambantota, Vavuniya and Ampara Districts to increase skills of those seeking foreign employment. I also propose to introduce a pension scheme for overseas employees, similar to the Farmers Pension Scheme.

I propose to grant dual citizenship or 5-year work visas to young Sri Lankans living abroad and do not have a Resident Visa to permit them to serve their motherland. I also propose to grant concessionary duty permits similar to those given to Public servants to high-income earning Sri Lankans working overseas for the importation of a motor vehicle to the value of 60 per cent of foreign ex-change they remit to Sri Lankan banks.

Women Enterpreneurs

The Regional Development Bank, which is dedicated for Women Enterprise Development implemented a Women Enterprise Credit Scheme to provide working capital loans up to Rs. 250,000 without requiring any se-curity to 25 women entrepreneurs from each Divisional Secretarys area under the coordination of the Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs, this year. I propose to extend this facility to a further 25 women en-trepreneurs each year during 2015 -17. Those who have successfully developed their businesses through the Divi Neguma initiative or on their own strength will be assisted under this scheme. The Industrial Development Board and Export Development Board will provide technical and marketing assistance for their development.

Land Ownership of the General Public

Honourable Speaker, to ease the burden of small land owners specially in urban areas in having to pay a heavy lease rentals to the State, I propose to exempt those earn-ing less than Rs. 25,000 per month or Rs. 300,000 per year from having to pay any such lease rentals. Further, I

175 176

[ ]

2014 24

propose to introduce a sliding scale ranging from 0.5 to 4 per cent for each income slab of Rs. 100,000 in excess of Rs. 300,000. The 4 per cent slab will only be if the in-come is in excess of Rs. 600,000 per year.

The value of land alienated in terms of the State Land Ordinance will be based on the underdeveloped valuation as at the date of alienation. No arrears will be imposed when implementing this new structure. They will also be permitted to use such lands for small businesses in addi-tion to residential use. This will relieve over 100,000 land owners who are expecting State land ownership. I also propose an additional allocation of Rs. 500 million to the Ministry of Lands and Land Development to accelerate the implementation of above initiatives and to survey lands to issue proper title registration to ensure owner-ship.

Small Businesses

Honourable Speaker, small restaurants, shops, tailor-shops, saloons, groceries, traders using pavements, weekly fairs et cetera to provide a large number of self-employment opportunities in our economy, at least cost. A large number of consumers also benefit from these widespread service providers. I propose to exempt small traders engaged in businesses with a monthly turnover less than Rs. 50,000 from all levies imposed by local authorities. They need a tax and levy-free environment. Arrangements will be made to provide suitable space fa-cilities to payment hawkers and small traders involved in mobile businesses along new roads and weekly fairs in metropolitan areas. I propose to provide loans up to Rs. 50,000 at 6 per cent interest to small tailor-shops and salons to introduce sewing machines, salon equipment and tool kits to modernize those services. The Floating Market City in Pettah has already accommodated 85 small pavement traders of Pettah. I also propose to allo-cate Rs. 1,200 million to build a mega-market with park-ing and other community facilities in the 9-acre Chalmers Grannery Land in Pettah to provide trading facilities to around 1,500 small traders in Colombo Fort, to improve their livelihood and business environment.

Wooden Furniture and Home Dcor

Sri Lanka has a unique advantage in developing its traditional wooden furniture manufacturing industry for exports, considering the skills of craftsmen who are en-gaged in this industry, particularly from well-known places such as Moratuwa. In order to assist this industry for exports, outsourcing arrangements will be made to enable small and medium-scale manufacturers to supply larger orders with the National Timber Corporation and other reputed manufacturers. The process on the importa-tion of advanced machinery and equipment will be made easier for the industry, to facilitate production for export.

I propose to set up a credit scheme to promote small craftsmen engaged in the manufacturing of unique arte-

facts, home dcor, designer fabrics, embroidery work, pottery and production of items using precious metals to enable them to acquire material and machinery needed. The restriction on the importation of household and office furniture will be strictly enforced to encourage the local furniture industry. Hotels and property developers will be encouraged to use locally-manufactured furniture to the maximum extent possible, by placing a condition in in-vestment approvals.

Gem and Jewellery Industry

Honourable Speaker, I propose to reduce the duty on importation of gold by exporters using their foreign cur-rency accounts for the purpose of exports to 3.5 per cent by way of a 50 per cent duty waiver, to encourage jewel-lery exports. I also propose to reduce the service fee im-posed by the Gem and Jewellery Authority to 0.25 per cent of FOB value of exports. To bring a new dimension to the industry, I propose to set up a gem and jewellery processing zone and a gem trading centre in Ratnapura as a global attraction to Magampura-Ruhuna development.

The New Wave of Industrialization

Honourable Speaker, I propose to provide lands on long-term leases to set up 300 factories in every Divi-sional Secretarys area in the background of improved prospects for export and import competing industries. Provisions will be made to permit lump sum depreciation for the importation of plant and machinery in addition to exempting them from dividend tax and providing a half-tax holiday for a period of three years. I also propose to provide modern machinery and equipment for small and medium handloom industries to expand this industry to cater global markets. Investors undertaking new invest-ments in excess of Rs. 500 million will be given a 7-year half tax holiday provided such investments are registered with the Inland Revenue Department before end of 2015.

Recognition of Pioneering Enterprises

Honourable Speaker, the entrepreneurs who started industries in Sri Lanka even before the opening of the economy in 1977, have made impressive performance by sustaining their capacity to compete with imports as well as entering export markets. Therefore, I propose to give a 10 per cent discount on taxes payable by them.

Environment and Waste Management in Greater Colombo

Honourable Speaker, I propose to increase the alloca-tion granted to the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation by Rs. 1,500 million for the acceleration of the development of Weras-Ganga, Kalu-Oya, the Beira Lake and the Hamilton Canal for the promotion of biodi-versity and environmental development in the Greater Colombo area and to improve flood-protection systems.

177 178

As solid waste management in the Greater Colombo Area is an equally important priority to ensure proper sanitation and a healthy living environment, I propose to allocate Rs. 10,000 million over 2015-17 to complete this initia-tive parallel with other urban development programmes in the Greater Colombo Area to the relevant implementing agencies.

Township Development Programme

Honourable Speaker, I propose to allocate Rs. 3,000 million for the development of modern urban Sati Polas and related community facilities in townships and semi- townships connected with urban development pro-grammes to transform Kandy, Badulla, Kurunegala, Galle, Ratnapura, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Batticaloa and Trincomalee as modern environments.

As proposed in the 2014 Budget, with regard to hous-ing schemes being built to meet requirements of nearly 50,000 families who are living in the Colombo City areas without proper housing, one-third has already been com-pleted. It is expected that these new housing schemes will be completed in 2015, so that all shanty dwellers would have decent housing and living facilities. I propose to increase the allocation by Rs. 750 million for the acceler-ated development of housing schemes, including Soysa-pura, Elvitigala, Anderson Housing Complexes, Jayawa-danagama, Mattegoda, Andarawaththa and 34 other hous-ing schemes that commenced in terms of a 2012 Budget initiative. I also propose to provide a further Rs.750 mil-lion to double the housing improvement programme of the National Housing Development Authority, for low-income people.

Plantation Community Housing and Sanitation

Honourable Speaker, the construction of 50,000 hous-ing units has already commenced, to replace the poor quality housing presently available in the plantation sec-tor, over the next three years. I also propose to allocate Rs. 2,000 million to the Plantation Trust to improve exist-ing houses with sanitation and toilet facilities. In order to increase the number of housing units jointly developed by the owner and Cooperative Societies on housing loan schemes, a further Rs. 750 million is proposed to be allo-cated.

Social Security

I propose to increase the Rs. 1,000 allowance granted to elderly people to Rs. 2,000 from January 2015. Elderly clubs will be set up in all Grama Niladhari areas to create an enabling environment for elderly people to spend their leisure time watching TV, reading and being engaged in other facilities available at day centres. Medical clinics will also be organized at these centres. An accelerated

programme will be carried out to ensure eyecare as well as primary healthcare of the elderly. I also propose to al-locate Rs. 250 million to provide financial assistance to reputed social organizations, which promote elderlycare in our society. Rs. 200 million will be allocated to reha-bilitate elderly homes at Saliyapura, Kataragama, Miri-gama and Jaffna. I also propose to allocate Rs. 100 mil-lion to provide financial grants to film producers and ar-tistes to make films and teledramas promoting success stories of traditional family values towards elders.

I propose to extend a Rs. 3,000 monthly living allow-ance to all differently-abled people and a monthly trans-port allowance of Rs. 750 to children with disabilities to help attend school. I propose to provide Rs. 100 million to modernize vocational training schools located all over the country to improve such facilities. I also propose to give railway season tickets, festival advances, Agrahara insur-ance benefits to teachers in these schools.

Protection to Children and Women

Honourable Speaker, the coordinated effort of Sri Lanka Womens Bureau, Child Protection Authority and Sri Lanka Police have reduced child abuse and violence against women, considerably. I propose to allocate Rs. 300 million to strengthen field level officers at Divisional Secretariats to expand awareness programmes in schools through parent -teacher associations, Divi Neguma com-munity-based organizations and to engage retired Public servants in family counselling.

Sports

Honourable Speaker, our country is privileged to host the 3rd Asian Youth Games - an international multi-sports event. We must make every effort to mobilize our youths from all corners of Sri Lanka to take part in this interna-tional event, particularly from rural schools. This is a good background to popularize multi-sports at school level from next year in addition to developing our youth with multi-skills. Therefore, I propose to allocate Rs. 750 million to appoint sport instructors from the Sports Minis-try, to all schools that do not have such instructors, from next year. I also propose to provide Rs. 2,250 million to extend financial assistance for the preparation of our school children, athletes, youth and sport clubs, to take part in multi-sports events by utilizing the already-built sports-related infrastructure around the country and to rehabilitate Sugathadasa and Kettarama Stadiums and related facilities in Colombo. As our country moves well in the area of sports, I propose to set up a state-of-the-art academy for sports to train instructors and professionals in sports.

Empowerment of Pradeshiya Sabhas

Recognizing the inadequate income sources available to many Pradeshiya Sabhas to provide basic community

179 180

facilities such as sanitation, waste management, mainte-nance of drainage systems, access roads, childrens parks et cetera, the Government in the 2014 Budget provided tractors, small construction equipment and machinery to every Pradeshiya Sabha to strengthen their maintenance units. I propose to increase the grant aid being given to low-income Pradeshiya Sabhas to maintain such commu-nity facilities in an orderly manner to Rs. 2 million a month in 2015. As per the recent review of cadre of these agencies to operate their maintenance and sanitation units, an additional sum of Rs. 600 million is allocated to recruit 15,000 field-level employees to engage in such work, instead of having to contract-out such work.

Development Expenditure of Provincial Councils

Honourable Speaker, I am very pleased that the Fi-nance Ministry was able to engage with each of the nine Provincial Councils for the first time since Provincial Councils were set up, to formulate a well-coordinated expenditure programmes in accordance with priorities in the context of 2015 17 Medium-Term Budget Frame-work.

In this context, the transformation of provincial schools to be child-friendly environments with sanitation, teacher facilities and accommodation as well as strength-ening provincial hospitals and dispensaries, strengthening provincial services on agriculture, livestock, fisheries and small industries, the improvement of commuter transport facilities, access roads, market facilities and sanitation, need to be done. Therefore, I propose to augment the allocations provided in the Budget Estimates to Provincial Councils by Rs. 7,000 million to expand these activities. I also propose to provide motor bicycles to school teachers in semi-urban and rural schools, at a concessional price of Rs. 50,000 each.

Private Transport

Honourable Speaker, I propose to set up a Transport Training Academy to expand facilities to train drivers and conductors of the private bus service to improve the qual-ity of such service as it provides 60 per cent of commuter transport. The pre-paid card scheme in operation will be exempted from taxes. I propose to allow duty conces-sions to import new buses, an engine and gearboxes for any bus that has operated at least for five years. I also propose to introduce a credit scheme at 6 per cent interest to encourage investments in new buses by private bus owners, who have operated for at least five years. I also propose to exempt income tax from the sale of used buses by private bus owners.

In order to facilitate the transportation of school chil-dren, tourists, small entrepreneurs and goods, the taxes at the point of imports on vans, small buses and truck will also be reduced with effect from today. I also propose to introduce a new insurance and pension scheme through

the social security arm of the Divi Neguma Development Department for those engaged in selfemployment, with a re-insurance by the National Insurance Trust Fund.

Electricity Tariff

This rich power generation and distribution asset base with its efficiency gain in management, enabled us to reduce the cost of electricity to household consumers by 25 per cent in September this year. I propose to create a separate tariff band for those industries and services con-suming below 300 units a month to extend a 25 per cent cost reduction to encourage economic activities of SMEs, restaurants and small shops. The charges on KV connec-tions will also be reduced to facilitate such business de-velopment and improve competitiveness of their eco-nomic activities. I also propose a tariff reduction of 15 per cent for all other industries from November 2014.

In order to reduce fuel imports and promote environ-mental friendly living, the customs based taxes on all electric cars will be reduced to 25 per cent.

Ranaviru Parent Gratitude

In appreciation of the blessings of parents for their children to join our security forces to liberate our mother-land from terrorism, this Government granted a monthly allowance of Rs. 750 for each of the parents of our secu-rity personnel. I propose to increase this allowance to Rs. 1,000 per month. I also propose to extend this allowance to parents of the police and civil security service person-nel, from January 2015.

July Strikers

Honourable Speaker, in my 2013 Budget, I provided a monthly retirement payment of Rs. 5,000 to each of the victims from both the private and public sectors due to 1980 July Strike who have passed 65 years of age and who became helpless. I propose to increase this allowance to Rs. 6,000 from January 2015 and reduce the connected age limit to 63 years. I also propose to extend this to any surviving spouse of such striker, to assist their living.

The Sri Lanka Police Service

The Sri Lanka Police Service has made an admirable progress in dealing with high traffic volumes, crimes, tax and financial frauds, illicit liquor and drugs business and civil security responsibilities in liberated areas. We took steps to extend a special allowance to strengthen this ser-vice. Modern technical equipment and mobile vehicles have been provided to make traffic police service more efficient and effective. Steps have been taken to expand facilities at the Police Academy to develop professional skills and to construct three new housing complexes in the Greater Colombo Area, to solve housing problems of po-lice officers working in Colombo.

181 182

I now propose to grant a non-resident living allowance to any police officer who is attached to a Police Station outside his residential district, if such police stations do not have sufficient residential facilities. I propose to give a motorcycle at a concessional price of Rs. 50,000 to each police constable and sergeant. I also propose to introduce a separate service minute to formulate a service-specific salary structure and strengthen the administration of the Police Service.

Tri-Services

The Sri Lanka Tri-Services have performed well in providing national security as well as in maintaining high standards of conduct. The devotion of human and finan-cial resources for nearly 30 years to counter terrorism did not enable the tri-services to develop their infrastructure and other resources required to provide peace time secu-rity and to manage a variety of risks that can be seen in the modern environment. The capacity development in tri-services to address security at sea, air and ground is es-sential for economic development and peace. Therefore, I propose to commit Rs. 10 billion of capital expenditure in 2015-16 to develop the required infrastructure, logistics and professional skills of the tri-services conducive for a upper middle-income economy by 2020. I propose to in-crease foreign training facilities for the tri-services and implement a new salary and allowance structure from January, 2015. I propose to extend the grant of Rs. 100,000 which is given at the birth of the third child to those in the tri- services to promote their family environ-ment, for a further three years. This grant will also be extended to those serving in the Police Service.

Stable Interest Income for Elderly People

Honourable Speaker, I propose to offer a 12 per cent annual interest rate for deposits of pensioners and elders, who maintain their deposits in State Banks. In order to enable State Banks to pay this interest rate on such depos-its, I propose to issue Rs. 30 billion worth of Government Bonds at 12 per cent to subsidize the elderly. The Central Bank will exempt the statutory reserve requirement on individual deposits maintained by the elderly people in all commercial banks. The Central Bank has also permitted finance Companies to pay 11 per cent interest on such deposits. I propose to exempt interest income of deposits held by elders and reduce the withholding tax on interest to 2. 5 per cent from next year.

Market Facilities

Honourable Speaker, the revival of the Paddy Market-ing Board and market outlets of Lanka Sathosa, Osu Sala, Fisheries Corporation, MILCO and Laksala have assisted producers as well as consumers by providing stable prices. Therefore, I propose to expand market outlets and

storage facilities of all these institutions and set up a Lanka Sathosa Peoples Supermarket chain covering the entire country, to provide infant milk powder, pharmaceu-tical products, milk food, chicken, egg, fish and essential food items under one roof, to ensure fair competition in the market. The dedicated economic centres and Sathi Polas in urban areas will also be expanded to promote market competition. I propose to provide Rs. 3,000 mil-lion for these initiatives.

Organized supermarkets and large retail traders have excessively expanded their own in-house brand products along with excessive margins being imposed for products of other suppliers affecting local SME producers and sup-pliers unfairly. Therefore, I propose to amend the con-sumer protection law to ensure that supermarkets will provide equal treatment to all suppliers in their outlets and to limit charges imposed by them, not to exceed more than 25 per cent of the maximum retail price marked on such domestically-supplied products. I request super-markets and the business community to reduce prices of all essential goods by at least 10 per cent in view of the reduction in VAT by 1 per cent, electricity by 15 to 25 per cent and lending rates of banks by significant margins.

A new Salary Structure for Public Servants

Honourable Speaker, the new Pay Commission, which I appointed last year, has recommended some changes to the salary structure introduced in 2006. Therefore, I pro-pose to introduce a new pay structure with effect from January, 2015. Accordingly, the special allowance given to Public Servants will be absorbed to the salary structure and raise the minimum salary to Rs. 15,000 per month. I propose to maintain a salary ratio of 1: 4.25 between mi-nor employees and Secretaries to accommodate higher annual increments. I also propose to raise the Cost of Liv-ing Allowance by Rs. 2,200 to Rs. 10,000 per month from January 2015 to all Public Servants. Accordingly, the minimum monthly income of a Public Servant will in-crease to Rs. 25,000.

It is proposed to clear anomalies of those in the lower rank categories in the Public Service. The new salary structure will recognize specialized services such as edu-cation, health, police, railway and postal and service-specific allowances will be incorporated accordingly. Ser-vice-specific allowances of university lecturers, doctors and judicial officers will be raised appropriately. The pro-fessional allowance granted to professional categories will be extended to Class I and above officers of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, and all other All-Island Services and any public servant with 20 years of service with a recognized professional qualification, by paying a professional allowance of Rs. 15,000 per month. The Uni-form Allowance of nurses and midwives will be increased by Rs. 500. The Uniform Allowance of other services will be increased by Rs. 300. I also propose to create the re-quired cadre positions to absorb all casual employees who

183 184

[ ]

2014 24

have been in employment for over 180 days in public corporations and statutory agencies.

Honourable Speaker, the new salary structure, allow-ances and other salary related benefits will provide Public Servants a pay increase of Rs. 3,500 to 15,000 per month from January, 2015 with a minimum monthly income of Rs. 30,000 to the lowest rank employees. I also propose to allow Public Servants to borrow up to 40 per cent from of their gross salary, including all allowances. Grade 5 and Mahapola Scholarships will be extended to children of Public Servants as well. All Public Servants will be given a bank card with a credit limit of Rs. 10,000 on interest-free basis to be paid in 10 instalments, to meet festival advances. This credit facility will be guaranteed by the National Insurance Trust Fund. I also propose to increase the insurance coverage under the Agrahara Scheme for surgical operations from Rs. 350,000 to Rs. 500,000.

I propose to permit Public Servants particularly serv-ing in transferable services such as education and health who have served in several places during their services, to be able to draw 75 per cent of their last-drawn salary from a bank of their choice, immediately after their retirement. Upon retirement, the Department of Pensions will make necessary arrangements to transfer related files to the re-spective Divisional Secretariats to be able to expedi-tiously process the pension entitlement with a maximum period of three months. I propose to secure pension rights of members of the civil security service as well.

Pensioners

Honourable Speaker, I propose to place pensioners salaries not on the 2006 Salary Structure as was requested by all pensioners but on the proposed 2015 Salary Struc-ture to once-and-for-all correct the inherent anomalies affecting pensioners when salaries of Public Servants are revised. All pension payments will be adjusted in accor-dance with the 2015 New Salary Structure and hence, there will be no pension anomalies hereafter.

I also propose to grant a loan of Rs. 50,000 each, to at least 100,000 retirees from Public Service to develop their own backyard economies and for them to generate self-employment income in addition to their pension income. Such loans could be drawn from bank branches from which they draw their monthly pension without sureties.

Since all these conversions of salaries and pension payments would take time, I propose to grant an interim allowance of Rs. 2,500 per month to all pensioners and Rs. 3,000 to all Public Servants with effect from Novem-ber 2014, in addition to their salaries and allowances. Full salaries and pensions will be paid with arrears in July 2015 to all those in the non-staff categories and to all those in the staff categories in September 2015, once the conversion of individual salaries and pensions are ad-justed.

Minimum Wages of the Private Sector

Honourable Speaker, the National Salaries Commis-sion has drawn my attention to the minimum wages of the private sector employees guided by the Minimum Wages Board. While the overall emoluments of private sector employees have increased satisfactorily, such increases have taken place through variety of allowances and not in the minimum wage itself. However, in the context of de-clining trend in unemployment and with the economy growing at around 8 per cent per annum with diversified economic activities, I believe it is time to consider a revi-sion of minimum wages in our country to provide incen-tives to the labour force itself through better remunera-tion.

Therefore, I propose to raise the minimum wage of the private sector employees to Rs. 10,000 per month from January, 2015 and to increase all minimum wages above that threshold at least by Rs. 500 per month. As new sec-tors have been emerged in the economy, I propose to ex-tend Minimum Wage Boards to those sectors within a rational economic cluster arrangement. I also propose to increase the employer contribution to EPF by 2 per cent, to 14 per cent so that each employee will have 22 per cent savings from their salaries.

Youth Employment in Public Service

Honourable speaker, in the background of vacancies particularly in the provincial and rural centric services, a large number of retirements from the Public Service is also witnessed. I propose to recruit 50,000 youths as train-ees who have GCE A/L qualification but have not been able to secure university admission for technical services of provincial services, and management and accounting assistants to serve in rural areas. They will undergo pro-fessional and leadership training at the professional train-ing institutes for selected jobs for a period of six months. They will be paid an allowance of Rs. 8,000 during the training period and will be confirmed after successful completion of the training. Therefore, I propose to allo-cate Rs. 7,000 million for this programme. This pro-gramme which has been initiated on the suggestion made by representatives of youth organizations will be coordi-nated by the National Youth Services Council and the National Youth Corps.

Parliament

Honourable Speaker, you have brought to my notice the need for a salary revision of the staff of Parliament. Therefore, along with Public Service salary revision, I propose to raise the minimum salary of Parliament em-ployees, including the special allowance given to Public Servants to Rs. 16,500 per month and place the salary scale of Secretary- General on par with Ministry Secretar-ies. The Parliament Sitting Allowance will be increased by 10 per cent. Allocations have been provided to refur-

185 186

bish the Parliament and build new housing facilities to Members of Parliament.

The underlying fiscal framework incorporating the impact of these Budget Proposals is presented in Annex I to this Budget Speech. The relevant Amendments to bor-rowing limits to the Appropriation Act, 2014 on account of bond issue to the State enterprises and for accounting of disbursement of foreign finance and revised borrowing limit for the Appropriation Bill 2015 are given in techni-cal notes.

Conclusion

Honourable Speaker, having restored security and peace during the first five years and having got important infrastructure and economic activities in place during the last nine years to satisfy basic needs of the people, our next phase will be to double our efforts towards strength-ening education, skills and human resource development so that our economic progress will be driven by knowl-edge and skills. For all these, it is essential to further con-solidate hard-won peace and national security. That is the prime responsibility of all of us.

Let us commit ourselves to give a better life to all our children. Let us devote all our efforts towards their better-ment. This Budget within 2015-17 has laid the foundation

to enable our people to cross their boundaries beyond US Dollars 7,500 by 2020 on the strength of human resource development. It is a valuable opportunity for our children, to enjoy the transition to an advanced economy.

Our resolute in this Budget is also to address the re-maining facets of poverty and prevent people from devel-oping non-communicable diseases. The creation of an awareness in people on the importance of consuming quality food and priority attention on mother and child-care as well as a good education for the new generation while creating new livelihood opportunities for our people must be given special emphasis by Public Servants, health sector employees and teachers. The vulnerabilities to droughts in dry zone districts can be addressed only by water conservation, advanced technology and diversion of water from wet zone rivers to dry zone lands.

Let your vote for this Budget be a vote to drive pov-erty out of our nation. Let that vote be a vote to enable our people to go from strength to strength as a truly inte-grated community, free from religious or language differ-ences. Let all Sri Lankans enjoy equal opportunities through human resource development and have equal opportunities in economic advancements as well. We, being true representatives of our people, cannot let these to be compromised. Let us make Sri Lanka the Emerging Wonder of Asia.

Thank You. May the Triple Gem Bless You!
