(iv) The mechanism available is provided for in the Constitution which specifies the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and the Provincial High Courts, in exercising appellate jurisdiction. Appeals from judgments or orders of the Court of Appeal may be made to the Supreme Court and appeals from the Provincial High Courts and courts of the first instance are heard by the Court of Appeal. So that at present, appeals may be made both to the Court of Appeal and thereafter to the Supreme Court. Further, the High Court of the Provinces is vested with appellate jurisdiction from orders and sentences imposed by Magistrate's Courts and Primary Courts within the Province.

(b) (i) & (ii) These questions cover a period of over 65 years and it would entail a great deal of research; hence, it is difficult to supply the information.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. R. Yogarajan to second the Motion, please. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for permitting me to second the Motion moved by my Colleague, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, which is a very important Motion that is relevant in todays situation. The UNHRC Resolution in 2009 by this Government was self-sponsored; you said that you would do everything possible to uphold human rights in this country. The subsequent resolutions came from others because you did not do that. My Friend, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, was trying to point out here that you are not only forgetting what happened in the past, but you are doing more things like that in the South, because any person has the right to express himself. The freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution. Every protest, as long as it remains non-violent, should be permitted by any government. As my Friend pointed out, in Judes case in Chilaw, in Roshens case in Katunayake and then in Rathupaswala, what did you do? You used force of the armed forces to kill people to stop protests. This is giving the wrong message. "Maybe, during the war we did it but in peace, we would not do it". That is the message you have to give to the international community, if they are not to penalize you for the wrongs that were done those days.

The war took place asking for more devolution. The Government promised the whole world that they would give "Thirteen plus". Today, you are going back on it. There was a simple resolution passed by the Northern Provincial Council two days ago asking for international flights from Jaffna and Trincomalee. You built Mattala

1115 1116

2014 20

Airport recently but the Jaffna Airport had been an international airport for more than 50 years. I can remember when I was a student studying in India, I travelled from Trichy to Jaffna because the airfare from Trichy to Jaffna was half of what it was from Trichy to Colombo. So, what is wrong in asking for facilities for international flights from Jaffna or Trincomalee? It is not another country. - [Interruption.] Please sit down, Hon. Azwer. If you want, talk later. Sit down.- [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, at that time, what you had was the Air Ceylon which was a domestic airline.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) What? Air Ceylon was an international airline. You do not know. It flew from Colombo to London. So, do not call it a domestic airline.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Azwer, do not disturb. You speak during your time.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It was an international flight. If you fly from one country to another, it is called an international flight. We had Immigration facilities; we had Customs facilities in Jaffna. You have Immigration facilities and Customs facilities only for international flights, Hon Azwer. If you

do not understand, please do not shout. - [Interruption.] But, what is the Minister of Civil Aviation saying?

He says that the request for an international airport in Jaffna or Trincomalee is ridiculous. "How can we allow it?" If you can have an international airport in Mattala, why can you not have one in Jaffna?

When the Indian High Commission decided to open a Consuls Office in Jaffna, they also opened one in Hambantota. So, when you have an airport in Hambantota, why can you not have one in Jaffna? Do not misunderstand these things. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, just because you have to shout something to keep your place, please do not say wrong things.

When you are leaving a country, if there is Immigration and if there is Customs, that is an international flight.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will teach you what international flights are. You are from the up-country, not from Jaffna.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) My good Friend spoke about freedom of expression. Do we have freedom of expression in this country? Once, I spoke in this House about a common day of remembrance. The common day of remembrance has been recommended by the LLRC. Your own LLRC has recommended a common day of remembrance. I proposed in this House that we have a common day of remembrance for the victims of war. But, there was so much of disturbance that day; nobody allowed me to express myself.

This Parliament is protected by the privilege to speak freely. Parliamentary Privileges cannot be taken away by even a court of law. Nobody can question what a Member of Parliament says in this House but I was not permitted to speak that day freely because you do not tolerate the freedom of expression in this country. Any person has the right to say what he feels and if he is a victim of certain policies of a government, then he has the right to protest against it. Today, what are we doing? We had a "Gotas War". Because of "Gotas War", you are going on your knees to Geneva, to the UNHRC to defend yourselves. After "Gotas War", what is prevailing today is "Gotas law" where he thinks that he must break houses, put up upstair flats and people must move in. They have to move in; this is "Gotas law". For "Gotas law", maybe you will not be taken to the UNHRC but you will have to go before people on knees very soon because you are breaking houses and denying the rights of the people to express themselves to ask for what they want and receive what they want. That is a right that has been granted to them from the day they were born, because no person can be forced to do something that he need not do.

The Government of Sri Lanka today is involved in branding all Tamils and Tamil diaspora and anyone who disagreed or spoke against the Government, as terrorists. Similarly, the Senior DIG for Colombo Division comes and says at the protest at Wanathamulla, Borella, that he knows that the abduction of Sunil was manoeuvred by either the UNP or the JVP. How does he know that? Did he have any evidence? He promised the public that within two hours he will see that Sunil is released and brought there. But, he goes on media and says that the Opposition did it. It is similar to what you do to the Tamils and Tamil diaspora who speak against what your Government is doing by calling them "terrorists".

Somebody who called the Canadian Tamil Congress as an LTTE-front organization was taken before a court in Canada and Justice Stephen Firestone of the Ontario

1117 1118

Superior Court of Justice ruled that it was defamation by Mr. Rohan Gunaratna and awarded damages of US Dollars 37,000 and US Dollars 16,000 in addition as cost against Mr. Gunaratna. So, this is what your Government is also doing; calling every person who is speaking against your Government, if he is a Tamil a terrorist, and if he happens to be a Sinhalese, then you say it is an action of the Opposition to topple your Government.

This is where you are failing to uphold human rights in this country and you are being taken to the UNHRC. If you had changed your attitude after the war, treating the Tamil people in this country as equals, respecting their views, granting them the devolution you promised in 2009, then you will not be on your knees today in front of UNHRC in Geneva. So, what we are asking is, reverse your attitude towards the people; whether they be Tamils or Sinhalese, respect their rights, listen to their views, change your attitude. Otherwise, you would have to face many more "Genevas" in the time to come.

It was said those days - I will say it in Tamil because it is so rhyming. . , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, it was an area which was under the army control. That is why it has become a problem for you. -[Interruption.] Similarly, it happened in Matale and it was the JVP people who were killed and buried in Matale. Again, when they dug in Trincomalee they found skeletons. - [Interruption.] Come on! Hon. Azwer, you also know where you were at that time. So, do not talk. - [Interruption.] No, no, that day you were defending - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You were the person who called President Rajapaksa, a traitor. Do not talk more than that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, the time allotted to the Opposition is over. Please wind up now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I will wind up now. So, you had better think of what you have done by changing what you are doing today. Then, maybe you can overcome what can happen in Geneva.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

The front page of the "Daily Mirror" of 20th February, 2014 states, I quote:

Chief Incumbent of Gangaramaya condemns haste to carry out international probe.

Venerable Galaboda Gnanissara Maha Thero has written a letter and handed it over to US Ambassador, Michele Sison. On Navam Full Moon day, he went there with the elephants - . He went there with Sri Lankan elephants. .

I quote from page 6 of the "Daily Mirror" of 20th February, 2014:

" .that the rising concern in this country today is about the extreme haste that is seen in seeking an international investigation into wide ranging, and even surprising allegations about war crimes and violations of human rights,."

I further quote:

".....- irrespective of community - through nearly three decades of brutality that was ended in May 2009. These forces of terror were identified and described by the State Department of your country as being the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world.

Although he is called Podi Hamuduruwo he is the Nayaka Thero of Gangaramaya. A renowned and much honoured Buddhist monk said this. Sir, I table* this newspaper report for Hansard.

, . . , . [ ] , . , .

It also states, I quote:

"....- killing innocent people, Buddhist monks, Hindu and Muslim priests, farmers, children, pregnant mothers and destroying infrastructure of a wide range and above all attacking places of worship irrespective of religion."

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) It is only because my name was mentioned and he continued to mention my name with inaccuracies, I just want to say that if you want to have an investigation, we will completely agree with you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer you may carry on with your speech. You have one more minute.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Now, see what is happening today. Look at this newspaper article, this photograph, Amirthalingam Bageedharan is appearing in the front page of the "The Island" of 20th February, 2014. It states, I quote:

Amirthalingam Bageedharan, son of Leader of Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) assassinated by the LTTE, called on President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday (19) at Temple Trees. LTTE assassins shot dead Amirthalingam in Colombo in January 1989

LTTE assassins shot dead Amirthalingam in Colombo together with Yogeswaran and others, and Sivasithamparam escaped in January, 1989. Are you not shedding a tear for the late Hon. A. Amirthalingam? His son has called on the President and discussed many matters. That is an occasion of one of the greatest historic reconciliation that is taking place in the Presidents Office, Sir.

Then, Sir, investigations reveal that in 1989 during peace talks between the LTTE and the then UNP Government, they had freedom. Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, that is the freedom you must stop. They had the freedom to fly to Colombo and murder the great man called Appapillai Amirthalingam in Bauddhaloka Mawatha. It was a cold- blooded murder. Shame! Hon. R. Yogarajan, another Tamil, cannot voice his sentiments.

What is happening across the Palk Strait. Now, Jayalalitha is going to release all the assassins of Rajiv Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi is protesting. The Congress has come forward. The only question I ask from people who have a conscience is: when they release these people, V. Sriharan (Murugan), A.G. Perarivalan (Arivu), T. Suthanthiraraja (Santhan), Nalini, Jeyachandran, Ravichandran, Robert Pius, where will they go? They will go to London; they will not come to Sri Lanka to face the consequences. Therefore, do not do things like that. You are the person who can think otherwise. Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, you can think straight. So, do not fall into the pit of - "" . ( ) (The Hon.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, my good Friend, which states, I quote:

Deprivation and violation of the freedom of speech and expression is taking place without any regard for the allegations of grave violations of human rights levelled against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne would have come to Parliament recently. I am sure the other Members and also the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne's friends would have suffered from 1971, during the insurgency in 1983, then again during the 1989 insurgency in the South and thereafter, during the final stage of the war to rescue people from the clutches of the LTTE, which was started by the Government with the closing down of the sluice gates of Mavil-Aru by the LTTE. As you know, had the Mavil-Aru sluice gates not been closed down then, even today the LTTE would be in Geneva, Norway or somewhere else, talking and bluffing. So, I do not know whose advice the LTTE took to do that, just like the advice they took to assassinate a very good leader, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, who led India in the right direction for her to be what she is today. They took somebodys advice and assassinated him. Similarly, they took somebodys advice and closed down the sluice gates of Mavil-Aru and finally, all that ended up on the 19th of May, 2009.

So, if I am to tell you about the human rights issue, Sri Lanka would definitely not go down on her knees. But, you all must remember that this is a fight not against the Sinhalese, the Tamils or anybody else, but against the country. This is a time when all are enjoying the freedom and they can go from one place to another at any time of

1125 1126

the day without any fear; a majority can do that. A lot of Tamil and Sinhalese people who have left the country are now returning to Sri Lanka, wanting to have dual citizenship or Sri Lankan citizenship again. That is a fact. They are returning to Jaffna and other parts of the country and are very happy to be back in this country after the economic constraints they faced in the countries where they had worked, and for many other reasons.

I will not go into detail about the human rights issue, which will be taken up on the 3rd of March in Geneva and discussed in this Adjournment Motion. This Motion goes in different directions. If you take the freedom of speech and the freedom of media in our country - you can take it up from then to now annually - we may be at the 165th position today on the World Press Freedom Index, but the number of institutions and people joining the media like newspapers, radio channels and TV channels has increased tremendously.

Please remember that without misleading and saying that we have gone down three or four places on the Index.

Basically, we live without fear now. Our children can move freely; whether it be a Tamil, a Sinhalese or a Muslim child, they can travel anywhere. The Jaffna railway track will be back in operation very soon, taking them on the "Yal Devi" to Jaffna. In time to come, there will be flights to India, do not worry. Today may not be the right time, but definitely when the economy opens up more, there will be flights, not only to Trivandrum, but also to Puttaparthi, Bangalore and to North India. But, you have to remember that this Government has done what no other Government has done for this country. If you compare the present situation in our country with a similar situation in any other country where there had been a war, maybe, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, you would see that they are still unearthing landmines. Even Vietnam is still faced with the problem of the diaspora. Some countries have a separate Ministry for the diaspora. We do not refer to a Tamil person as an LTTEer. There is an LTTE diaspora. There are well organized groups. You know how many people were paying money to the LTTE. You know how the LTTE was collecting funds. But today, nobody gives them money voluntarily. Still, the LTTE diaspora has to sustain their pressure saying something, that they are not free to live in this country. Otherwise, all of them will be sent back to Sri Lanka. So, in order to enjoy those benefits and their power, to continue with the way they have been living and to carry on with the jungle law or the kangaroo courts they have been conducting, they have to continue to say something. But, everybody, in their heart, knows about the freedom of expression and the freedom to live we had and we have in this country, then and now.

Now, I would like to mention some facts about the post-conflict developments. There was the independent

Darusman Report. Subsequently, there was the LLRC Report, which, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne said, was a Government report. Then, he went on to say about the good things in that Report. All the members in that Committee were honourable people who compiled that Report and they could be challenged.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Why do you not implement its recommendations? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) We are implementing those. The Government cannot implement those overnight. The biggest reconciliation effort we have made was the releasing of over 11,700 LTTE child soldiers without any charge whatsoever against them. The LTTE not only harassed the Sinhalese, but also conscripted Tamil children in the North. There are claims to that effect. Some people could not live in the North because the LTTE was abducting their children forcibly and those children died fighting.

If I go on to mention some more facts about the LLRC Report, which you all want implemented, within a short period of four years following the end of the conflict, Sri Lanka has made significant progress in terms of reconstruction, resettlement, rehabilitation, reconciliation and reintegration. This process has been internationally acknowledged. Even Ms. Navi Pillay said that the good work we had done has not been given enough publicity; she mentioned that and finally agreed that we had done a lot. There are some areas that we have to concentrate on more; we agree, but that takes time. Overnight, we cannot forget the atrocities we saw being committed and cannot change the hate the individuals feel. We all are human beings. You have to remember that and go on without tarnishing the image of the country. The forces brought peace to all of us, irrespective of our party or religion. All Internally Displaced People resulting from the ending of the conflict have been resettled.

Over 95 per cent of the ex-combatants have been rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society and 99 per cent of the areas identified for demining have been cleared of mines bringing life back to normal. The Government has expended over US Dollars 3 billion for rehabilitation and reconstruction work in the North alone since the end of the conflict. It is reflected in the 27 per cent growth rate in the North, while the corresponding national figure is only 7 per cent in the year 2012.

We did all these and then held the Northern Provincial Council Election. The Government did not want to take the blame for holding the election immediately after the war. Then, they would have said that the Government had

1127 1128

[ ]

2014 20

filled the ballot boxes; various things would have been said. So, it was a genuine election but nobody appreciated the genuineness and the transparency. The Government continues to uphold democracy by having regular elections all over the country at regular intervals.

Civil administration mechanisms have been restored both in the East and the North including democratic freedoms. After more than two decades, people in the North exercised their franchise at the Provincial Council Election held last year in that province.

Sir, I would also like to say a few words about the implementation of the recommendations of the LLRC. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, the home-grown mechanism to achieve national reconciliation, was appointed by His Excellency the President following the end of the conflict. Recommendations of the LLRC are being carried out by over 20 line ministries. The Committee monitoring the National Plan of Action on the Implementation of the LLRC Recommendations, to give it the highest priority, is headed by none other than the Secretary to the President, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga.

The Government has launched a programme to transform the country into a trilingual society, Sinhala, Tamil and English, within the next 10 years as recommended by the LLRC. This process will effectively help national reconciliation. So, these things cannot be done overnight. You cannot force children to learn other languages. Most of our children who are going to Colombo schools or to the northern schools may not know all three languages. So, the Government is encouraging them to learn at least two languages. In order to have a smooth functioning of the society, the Government is encouraging Government servants by paying them higher remunerations, to learn a second language. Unlike earlier, over 90 per cent of the police personnel who are working in the North can speak or can manage to speak Tamil or can understand that language.

In keeping with another recommendation of the LLRC, a new Ministry of Law and Order was created last year and now the Police Department is placed under its charge. Acceding to another key recommendation, a three-member Commission of Inquiry has been appointed to Investigate Cases of Alleged Disappearances in the Northern and Eastern Provinces from 1990 to 2009. Today's newspapers report that last year so many cases have been reported to that Commission. So, everything is publicly known. This has also been a recommendation and we have implemented that. These could not have been implemented earlier. People have to have the knowledge of freedom to make a complaint. Earlier, they probably would have feared that if they do so, they would have been abducted by the LTTE because there were many people who had been abducted by various Tamil Organizations in that area. Please remember that there were many Parliamentarians who had been killed by the LTTE.

The UNHRC Resolution that is to be moved in March is against peace and reconciliation. It is so because it is one-sided and biased; it is so because its intention is to punish Sri Lanka, not the Government but Sri Lanka, for geo-political reasons, not because the sponsors love the Tamils or are aggrieved by what they say is their plight. If this was so, the Tamils themselves should ask these countries where they were when their leaders were being murdered by the LTTE. Nineteen Parliamentarians were assassinated by the LTTE. They should ask where they were when thousands of children were being dragged away from their homes, while their parents were wailing, by the LTTE to be conscripted as cannon fodder They should ask where they were when the LTTE ruled some areas of Sri Lanka with an iron fist and summarily executed Tamils after cases in kangaroo courts set up by them So, please do not forget that. Let us get together, it is time for reconciliation, put party politics aside, issues aside and sort out the issues that we have to face and help bring this country forward, which no other leader with the same forces would be able to do. So, we have to forget about the past at some time or the other and go on for the sake of the future of the children.

Thank you very much.
