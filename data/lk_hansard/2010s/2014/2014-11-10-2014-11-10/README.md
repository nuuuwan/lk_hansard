. . . - . Women Claiming Rights and Spaces, Activism to Reform Muslim Personal Law in Sri Lanka - Muslim Womens Research and Action Forum 2014 . , . . .

Sir, this book titled Women Claiming Rights and Spaces comprises of articles titled "History of Muslim Personal Law Reforms of Sri Lanka" by late Alhaj S.M.A. Jabbar, my very good friend, "Claiming Spaces and Voices Beyond the Notion of Legal Equality: The Struggle of 25 years to reform the Muslim Personal Law" by Faizun Zackariya and "The Independent Committee on Muslim Personal Law Reforms" by Safana Gul Begam and Justice A.M. Mohamed Mackie. All these are very useful articles on women's rights.

I am very happy, Sir, that there had been two committees appointed on Muslims Rights in this country. One Committee was headed by Mr. H.M.Z. Farook. When I was the Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs in 1990, I appointed the other Committee called the "Sahabdeen Committee" headed by Dr. A.M.M. Sahabdeen. That Committee has finalized its report.

Sir, I would also like to say a few words about the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, of which I also had been a Minister. That was the first time the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs was created separately and given to me. I gave vehicles to all the Members of Parliament. Now, they are asking whether the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs can import vehicles. I gave vehicles to all Members of Parliament irrespective of their party. They are talking about only Government Ministers receiving vehicles. Of course, the Ministers will get their vehicles.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, please wind up your speech now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Please give me one more minute, Sir. Then, I will refer to the salary increase that has been given.

( ) (The Chairman) . . [1.31 p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - , ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader - Deputy Minister of Environment and Renewable Energy) Hon. Chairman, the 10th consecutive Budget of this Government led by His Excellency the President was presented to this House last month. Today, when the Heads of our Ministry is discussed, I am very pleased to say that the Budget for the year 2015 has been prepared with the sole objective of developing this country.

This Government has not only protected the people by defeating the LTTE and releasing them from the clutches of the Tamil Tigers, who engaged in an armed struggle for nearly three decades in the North and the East, but has also been carrying out its development activities with a view to achieve economic development in the country. Sir, this Government has been carrying out its development activities on a large-scale.

At the same time, this Government formulates policies and implements programmes, under the guidance of these policies, in order to protect the environment and ensure the judicious use of natural resources. It is generally found that the environment is affected when development activities are carried out, but these

1103 1104

[ . ]

2014 10

development activities can be made sustainable by reducing the adverse effects on the environment as much as possible and taking remedial action.

Sir, conserving biodiversity and forest cover, managing solid waste, maintaining the quality of air and water resources, and building resilience to meet the adverse impacts of climate change are the most common environmental challenges that our country is faced with at present. To meet these challenges successfully, our Ministry and the institutions that come under its purview, have implemented several programmes under the guidance of "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future", the Development Policy Framework.

A three-year programme has been implemented in order to increase the forest cover, up to 35 per cent. Rs. 500 million was allocated for this programme in the year 2014, and another Rs. 400 million has been allocated in this Budget to implement this programme. In addition to this, through the Community Forestry Programme, forest plantation activities have been carried out with the active contribution of the general public. Further, in order to increase the green cover of the country, thousands of trees have been planted annually under the Deyata Sevena Programme. I am pleased to say that this Budget consists of allocations required for the implementation of these programmes in 2015.

Our Ministry has been implementing several programmes with a view to properly manage the solid waste in the country. In this regard, under the Pilisaru Project, Local Authorities have been provided with facilities to manage the solid waste effectively. Also, action has been taken to construct four sanitary landfills with modern technology in selected locations of the country. We have completed the construction of a model sanitary landfill built with modern technology in Dompe this year. I am happy to state that allocation has been made in this Budget to implement another project next year to promote the recycling of plastic waste. For the implementation of major projects linked to solid waste management, nearly Rs. 790 million has been allocated through this Budget.

Global warming and climate change are the most commonly spoken environmental challenges in the world at present. In the recent years, our country also experienced severe droughts and floods. In order to build the country with resilience to meet the adverse impacts of climate change, our Ministry has prepared climate change adaptation strategies. Action has been taken to implement a programme linked to this in the areas close to the Mahaweli River Basin. For the implementation of this pilot project, Rs. 200 million has been allocated through this Budget.

Sir, todays younger generation would be the future leaders of the country. Our Ministry has been implementing the School Environmental Pioneer Brigade Programme to create awareness on environment among

the school children. Our Ministry has planned to implement this programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, expanding the scope to include all schools from next year. Since our country is an island, we will be able to receive a lot of benefits through keeping our marine environment clean. Action has been taken to formulate policies and strategies in order to achieve this target.

With the economic growth taking place in our country, the demand for energy is also increasing continuously. While meeting the increasing demand for energy, "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future", has targeted to generate 20 per cent energy from renewable sources by the year 2020. I firmly state that action is continuously being taken to meet this target and it will be met within the said time frame.

Sir, we are continuously taking action to ensure the sustainable exploration of mineral resources and promote value addition to minerals. Further, I would like to mention in my speech today that our Ministry will take action to develop the Gem and Jewellery industry in a way that it would benefit our country to a large extent.

We are also encouraging Public-Private partnership in implementing environment conservation projects. Several non-governmental agencies have proposed several projects on environmental conservation. They are also now involved in project development and implementation. Some of the projects developed by them, have been considered for implementation.

Our Ministry has taken action to implement projects in line with the development policy framework which would beneficial to the country. We have also taken action to review the existing policies on environment conservation and update them according to the present situation and formulate new policies. A new waste management policy is being drafted at present.

Sir, in concluding my speech today, I would like to state that our Ministry has taken several initiatives towards the conservation of environment in the year 2014, and will continue with new endeavours towards our prime objective of saving the nature and conserving the environment. Thank you.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) , , , , .

Mr. Presiding Member, the Governments "Mahinda Chintana" vision has been successful and effective in transforming the Sri Lankan economy from a low-income economy to a middle-income economy. The per capita income prior to 2005 was US Dollars 1,200 and we would reach almost US Dollars 4,000 by 2015. Moving forward further, the Government plans to surpass a per capita income of US Dollars 7,500 and reach the high middle-income status by 2020.

While increasing the per capita income to reach the upper middle-income country status, the Government has focused on the rural economy through an Inclusive Development Strategy, where backward regions, low-income and vulnerable groups have been integrated into the mainstream of economic development.

The Governments focus in the past years was heavily on infrastructure development. However, in the next phase, the Governments focus has shifted towards strengthening a Knowledge Economy, concentrating on

education, skills development and development of health and human resources. This shift will ensure that the country smoothly surpasses the expected per capita income levels towards an upper middle-income status and avoids the middle-income trap. The Governments pragmatic development model needs to be commended.

With regard to micro, small and medium industries, handicrafts and traditional industries, my Ministry has aligned its development programmes and projects in line with the Governments Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future, which is the National Development Policy Framework of the Government. Based on the Budget Speech of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, my Ministry has developed a five-year strategic plan, which sets out the road map including programmes and projects. This Ministry plays an active role in contributing to rural economic development, which is a key element in the "Mahinda Chintana" vision to achieve inclusive economic growth and development.

The work plan of my Ministry is being implemented by the statutory boards and institutions that come under its purview, which include the Industrial Development Board, the National Crafts Council, the National Design Centre, the Palmyrah Development Board and the Northsea Limited. With regard to the development of micro, small and medium industries, the Industrial Development Board is actively involved in undertaking technology transfer, training for local industries, self-employment-related training, distribution of raw materials at concessionary prices, industrial estate support for SMEs, market facilitation, facilitation of capital, credit, marketing, management and technical facilities, legal advice for SMEs and promotion and support of industrial development in the country.

The National Crafts Council holds "Shilpa", the National Crafts Exhibition and Trade Fair, along with the National Design Centre, awards prizes and medals to master craftsmen in the handicrafts sector to recognize and motivate them, provides training and incubation to craftsmen through crafts training centres, undertakes master craftsmen training programmes, carries out cultivation of raw materials, improving the quality of handicrafts, preserves the crafts sector to protect the countrys art, heritage and culture and as a livelihood development strategy to access the high-value market for rural community. The development of a crafts museum is also an important activity of the National Crafts Council.

The National Design Centre helps craftsmen in product development, market-oriented new designs, extends support to develop gifts and souvenir items, conducts new design development programmes and finds substitute raw materials for the crafts sector.

The Palmyrah Development Board is responsible for developing the palmyrah sector through planting, supporting the production of pulp, sap, fibre, tuber,

treacle and jaggery and for the development of palmyrah handicrafts, extension services and livelihood of the palmyrah sector community.

The Northsea Limited undertakes production of high-quality, fast moving fishnets and twine. The three factories in Gurunagar, Lunuwila and Weerawila are working closely with the Cey-Nor Foundation and the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development to meet the fisheries sector requirements. Some foreign buyers have expressed interest to purchase fishnets and therefore, there is potential to export fishnets to the foreign market and that will be explored in 2015.

The Ministry has conceptualized, formulated and implemented the following programmes and projects to uplift the micro, small and medium industries, the handicrafts sector and traditional industries to support and strengthen rural economic development. The first is the development of Enterprise Villages and strengthening women entrepreneurship. The Budget Proposals - 2014, have given emphasis to strengthening women entrepreneurship development and supporting Enterprise Villages to develop micro and small enterprises to ensure the development of entrepreneurship in the community.

Cluster-based villages promising high potential were selected and technology transfer, training, skills development, introduction of market-oriented new designs, product development, access to credit and common service facilities including machineries, tools and infrastructure were undertaken to strengthen the villages and establish links with large producers, exporters and markets through buy-back and subcontracting arrangements.

Sectors such as leather, lace, bamboo, coir, bricks, batik, cashew, lacquer, jewellery, banana fibre and palmyrah were supported under this programme. The Thalakola Village in Kurunegala, the Lace, Jewellery and Ornaments Village in Nuwara Eliya, the Lacquer Village in Matale, the Coir and Bricks Villages in Hambantota, the Cashew Village in Puttalam, the Leather Village in Anuradhapura, the Batik and Embroidery Village and the Banana Fibre Village in Jaffna, the Palmyrah and Fibre Products Village in Kilinochchi and the Palmyrah Food and Handicrafts Village in Mullaitivu were covered under this programme.

This programme has benefited over 700 women entrepreneurs directly and assisted to strengthen women entrepreneurship in the country in line with the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future".

The second programme implemented by our Ministry is the development of Pottery Villages. Based on the Budget Speech - 2013, of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development formulated a project

for the development of Pottery Villages to support the pottery industry; to gain access to modern technology, equipment and design to manufacture specialized gift items preferred by tourists. This Pottery Village programme provided support to 13 villages in 11 districts covering Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Colombo, Nuwara-Eliya, Matara, Batticaloa, Matale, Hambantota and Jaffna. This project will benefit over a thousand pottery industrialists islandwide. The project intervention includes provision of mobile pug mill, electric potter wheels, kick wheels and kilns, product development programmes, new designs, development of gift and souvenir items and market facilitation with a view to increasing production volumes, diversifying the products and developing new products to cater to the tourism market.

The third programme implemented by our Ministry is the Development of Handicraft Villages. Based on the Budget Speech - 2013, our Ministry has developed 12 Handicraft Villages in eight districts and assets created in these villages have been peopolised. Musical Instruments and Jewellery Village in Kandy, Sesath and Lacquer Village in Matale, Mask Village in Kalutara, Woodcarving Village in Galle, Musical Instruments Village, Bobbin Lace Village, and Coir Village in Matara, Clay Village in Anuradhapura, Palmyrah Handicraft Villages in Jaffna and Batticaloa have been developed, supported and strengthened. Project intervention includes supporting craft cottages and infrastructure, technology transfer and training, product development and new designs, provision of machineries, tools, raw materials and common services facilities including market facilitation. Over 800 craftsmen are benefited directly under this programme.

In 2014, an additional 16 handicraft villages are being supported and strengthened in 13 districts covering the Jute Village in Kandy, Thalakola Village in Puttalam, Musical Instruments Village in Gampaha, Rush and Reed Village in Kalutara, Lacquer Village in Hambantota, Bamboo and Bobbin Lace Village in Matara, Cane Village in Polonnaruwa, Palmyrah Handicraft Village in Paththinipuram in Trincomalee, Navithanveli in Ampara, Mailampaveli in Batticaloa, Kirangi in Kilinochchi and Karaveddi in Jaffna. Thalakola Village in Kurunegala and Coir Village in Jaffna are being supported. The direct beneficiaries are over 850 craftsmen. Further, with the Indian Grant Assistance Programme, Handicraft Production and Marketing Village is being established in Kawantissapura, Hambantota and work is almost nearing completion. Similarly, the Indian Grant Assistance Programme has also supported the establishment of a Handicraft Production and Marketing Village in Kaithady, Jaffna and is expected to commence work in 2015.

The fourth programme implemented by our Ministry is the National Kithul Development Programme. Under

1121 1122

the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future", my Ministry works on the implementation of the National Kithul Development Programme to support and strengthen the kithul sector, which contributes significantly to the rural economy.

In 2014, my Ministry has undertaken many programme interventions including the Tappers Training Programme completing 33 programmes in 14 districts, imparting tapping skills to over 1,200 young people. Safety kits including safety jackets, helmets, belts and knives have been provided to over 1,500 tappers in the 18 kithul production districts. Kasper technology has been introduced to increase the sap yield and 33 programmes have been conducted in 14 districts. Quality improvement programmes for kithul treacle and jaggery have been completed through 11 programmes in eight districts covering 455 industrialists. Kithul plantation programmes and insurance scheme for master trainers and trainee tappers, and awareness programme for officers were conducted.

In 2014, the Government declared the 1st week of April as Kithul Promotion and Consumption Week and various awareness programmes and promotion programmes were conducted to popularize kithul as a healthy sweetener among local people and foreign visitors. Kithul exhibitions known as "Kithulaka Varuna" Exhibition and Trade Fairs were conducted in Colombo, Rantapura, Kandy and Matara. These exhibitions and trade fairs helped to popularize kithul products and establish linkages with exporters and large-scale traders. It is reported that the kithul treacle and jaggery exports have increased from Rs. 26 million in 2011 to Rs. 58 million in 2012 and to Rs. 69 million in 2013. The rate of increase of exports was an exponential growth, which shows the promising potentials for the kithul sector in the international market. The Ministry has set up a special unit for kithul sector development with dedicated staff to strengthen this sector.

Now, I will move on to the Atchuveli Industrial Estate under the development of SMIs. This Industrial Estate was completely abandoned in the 1990s due to the conflict situation and was not operational for the last 25 years. The Ministry was supported by the Indian Grant Assistance to the value of Rs. 220 million and the Government of Sri Lanka funded Rs. 50 million to establish the Atchuveli Industrial Estate with all infrastructure facilities including internal roads, three-phase power supply, drinking water supply, storm water drainage facility, water tank facility, water treatment facility, fire protection system, water disposal facility, an administrative complex including a post-office and a canteen. Twenty two plots have been developed and currently high potential viable sectors with eight promising industrialists in Light Engineering, Food and Beverages, Waste Paper Recycling, Fibreglass, PVC

Pipes, Fishnets, Vegetable and Fruit Dehydration have entered into an agreement on a 30-year lease, and started putting up their buildings and factories The other Expression of Interests and applications are being screened by the Industrial Development Board to select smart entrepreneurs based on Picking the Winners policy in viable sectors. The IDB will provide technology transfer and training to industrialists and facilitate access to credit and market to these industries. The Atchuveli Industrial Estate is an important industrial hub for the Northern Province as it will create many forward and backward linkages.

Sir, I would like to say a few words with regard to the Rehabilitation and Reactivation of the Elephant Pass Saltern with community involvement. The Elephant Pass Saltern was commenced in 1938 and due to the conflict situation, the operations in the Saltern were abandoned in the 1990s and it has been closed down for the last 23 years without a single operation. ,

: : Rest of the speech tabled: Upgrading and modernizing main and mini industrial Estates:

There are 18 main and mini industrial estates managed by the Industrial Development Board and over 400 small and medium industries in various sectors such as agro-based products, chemicals, plastics, wood-based products, light engineering, food and beverages, rubber-based products, furniture-based products, cement-based products, surgical products, coir-based products, water bottling, brassware, paper products and fiber-glass products are operating in these small medium industrial estates.

Under the Mahinda Chintana National Development Framework, the small and medium industries and enterprises have been recognized as the backbone of the economy. These industrial estates have not been modernized in the past. The Government has provided the Treasury funds to the value of Rs. 305 million under a three-year Medium Term Budgetary Framework to modernize and upgrade the infrastructure facilities such as roads, tube wells, boundary walls, water facilities, drainage systems, security huts, sanitation facilities et cetera.

Industrial Estates such as Pallekele in Kandy, Ekala in Gampaha, Panaluwa in Colombo, Lunuwila in Puttalam, Galigamuwa in Kegalle, Pussella in Ratnapura, Wawulugala in Kalutara, Poonthoddam in Vavuniya are being covered under this programme.

The modernization of the industrial estates will provide a great boost to the small and medium industries which is given very strong emphasis by the Government under the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future.

Rehabilitation and Reactivation of the Elephant Pass Saltern with Community Involvement:

The Elephant Pass Saltern commenced in 1938 and due to the conflict situation, the saltern operations were abandoned in 1990s and it has been closed down for the last 23 years without any single operation. The Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development under the Vadakin Vasantham (Uthuru Wasanthaya) Programme with the financial assistance from the Ministry of Economic Development has commenced rehabilitation and reactivation of 330 acres of the saltern as a phase I initiative. I wish to very specially express my gratitude to the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development for his excellent co-operation, support and funding assistance for saltern and other development activities.

The total acres under saltern is 1946 acres, out of which 330 acres is under phase I programme. Reservoir has been rehabilitated, 15 numbers of evaporation pans have been renovated and 267 numbers of crystallization pans are being rehabilitated, 30 numbers of salt platforms have been established, access roads, renovation of buildings, reconstruction of spill ways and canal system, flood protection bunds, rip rap protection for reservoir and earth bunds are being established and are expected to be completed by the end of this year. In all the rehabilitation work, the Ministry involved the 10 Rural Development Societies (RDS) and Women Rural Development Societies (WRDS) based in Kilinochchi District.

Therefore, over 300 members in the Kilinochchi RDS/WRDS are involved in the rehabilitation and benefited during the implementation of this project.

The project has built a strong ownership and community involvement in the implementation which is an innovative and creative implementation modality. It is envisaged that the rehabilitation of phase I saltern will lead to a production of 20,000 to 25,000 metric tons of salt per annum. The saltern will provide employment opportunities for over 3,000 people once it is fully operational.

At the second phase, 477 acres of saltern will be developed in 2015 and it is envisaged that the salt production will increase by a further additional production of 25,000 to 35,000 metric tons. When the saltern is fully operational the production can be increased to over 100,000 metric tons.

Sir, at the outset, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for showing confidence and trust in me by appointing me as the Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development to carry out the concept of "Mahinda Chintana", under which priority has been given to food security and to foster Sri Lanka to be self-sufficient in milk by an accelerated programme.

The main objective of the Ministry is to develop the livestock sector from the subsidiary level to a commercial level and at the same time, introduce and develop livestock activities for the livelihood development of rural people, and to increase the local production of milk, eggs and meat to sufficiently meet the needs of the country.

The Ministry is functioning as a major policymaker, regulator and facilitator in the livestock development of the country. The Department of Animal Production and Health, the National Livestock Development Board, the Milco (Pct.) Limited, the Sri Lanka Poultry Development Company (Pvt.) Limited and the Mahaweli Livestock

Enterprises Limited are the major arms under the Ministry for implementation of policies, regulations, programmes and projects related to livestock development.

The Department of Animal Production and Health - DAPH - is the main implementing organization of the countrys livestock development sector and it provides technical leadership, expertise and back-up services through its nine provincial departments to relevant stakeholders and other organizations. The main objectives of the DAPH are: to assure an efficient preventive and curative animal health service; to enhance utilization of quality animal feeds and feed resources; to improve the genetic or production potential of the livestock; to assure safety of products of animal origin; to conduct research and development activities towards a sustainable livestock industry; to develop technically competent human resources and to ensure welfare and well-being of the animals. It also implements a range of statutes pertaining to the livestock sector under the provisions of Animals Act, Animal Diseases Act and Animal Feed Act.

The DAPH presently operates through its six technical divisions such as Animal Health, Animal Breeding, Veterinary Regulatory Affairs, Veterinary Research, Human Resource Development, Livestock Planning and Economics and two support service divisions, namely Administration and Finance. In addition to those, two Animal Husbandry Schools are managed to produce the required diploma holders for the livestock sector and two Semen Processing Centres and two Goat Breeder Farms are operated to get the inputs for Breed Upgrading Programme. A total of 310 Divisional Offices are scattered throughout the country managed by veterinarians, which are the main functional units of the DAPH.

In line with the policy decision taken by the Government, 18 District Level Veterinary Investigation Centres -VICs - have been established to strengthen disease surveillance in the country. Seven VICs are to be built in the future years.

The Milco (Pvt.) Limited embarked upon its initiatives among the local fresh milk producers and stakeholders to make our country self-sufficient in fresh milk through the local dairy farmers. We have been able to set upon that direction with the increase of fresh milk price up to Rs. 50 per litre from Rs. 28 during the first quarter of 2011. Whilst recording an increase of 32 per cent in fresh milk intake during the past three years, it is pleasing to note that today, our price at Rs. 60 has reached almost the best farmgate price among the international fresh milk producers.

Meanwhile, we have focused attention in the direction of Mahinda Chinthana Idiri Dekma to popularize the consumption of fresh milk in the country with the setting

1157 1158

up of two UHT machines - one in Polonnaruwa and the other in Digana - in the year 2011. Since the setting up of the machines, we have produced 66 million packets of milk to date. Our long-term intention is to eliminate the use of milk powder, which incurs a colossal amount of foreign exchange that can be saved and used to enrich our local dairy farmers. Most importantly, we will cater to the nutrition demand of the Sri Lankans.

The Milco company, being a commercial organization, is focused on serving the people of the country and also becoming a financially viable organization standing on its own. The 2013/ 2014 financial year was successful for it, making a profit of Rs. 166 million. During this year, the Milco has paid their farmers Rs. 3.4 billion as milk payments and it offers 11 nutritious dairy products to the people of Sri Lanka. It has been able to increase the sales turnover from Rs. 4 billion in the year 2010 up to Rs. 7 billion during the last year and is expected to register a sale of over Rs. 8 billion during the current year.

The machinery at Milco factories is over 50 years old and there had not been any upgrading in the past. The Ministry has already taken initiatives to refurbish the three factories, namely Ambewela, Digana and Polonnaruwa. This project is expected to be completed by April, 2015. The Colombo Milk Factory established in the year 1956 will be relocated at Badalgama with a state-of-the-art factory for dairy-based products. These efforts will increase the production capacity at the Milco fivefold.

Sir, the livewire of the milk industry is our local dairy farmer. A Social Security Fund is in place for them and it has disbursed Rs. 55 million for 18 essential benefits to farmers. The fund has a deposit of Rs. 60 million. In addition, we will propose a pension scheme for the dairy farmers in the near future. Further, we had initiated action to make the casual and trainee staff permanent during the year 2012, making 31 employees permanent. The rest will be made permanent during the course of the year.

Sir, with regard to the National Livestock Development Board, we had 3,000 breedable cows in all the farms of NLDB, out of which only 2,500 were milk-producing, supplying around 6,000 litres per day. Also, around 600 heifer calves had been issued to the public for breeding purposes annually. We undertook the implementation of the Sri Lanka Dairy Development Project, under which we have already completed the first phase by importing 2,000 heads of high-yielding cattle for our up-country farms and also issuing the first generation, mainly Jersey and Jersey x Friesian crosses, to the mid-country and low-country NLDB farms and also to other dairy farmers. At present, the milk production of the NLDB has increased up to 30,000 litres and also the yield per milking cow per day of the dairy farmers, to whom

those issues had been made, has increased up to 20 - 25 litres. The second phase of this project is to bring another 2,500 high yielding dairy cattle, Jersey and Jersey x Friesian crosses, which will arrive in March or April next year, for farms in the South, where land development, pasture planting and housing have commenced.

With the arrival of these cattle, the NLDB production per day would be around 70,000 litres, which will add to the national requirement and also this project will produce around 1,500 heifer calves to be issued to the dairy farmers from which there would be a further increase of milk, which will have a direct impact on the national requirement. Further, the NLDB has made the required arrangements, with the collaboration of the Department of Animal Production and Health, to import "Grandparents" stock of swine to NLDB in 2014 in order to enhance the genetic potential of the national swine breeding stock.

Sir, the poultry sector is almost entirely with the private sector and market forces influence the industry trends. However, in order to minimize the effects of adverse prices, my Ministry has established the Sri Lanka Poultry Development Company (Pvt.) Limited using the resources of the former joint venture company, LANLIB. It is a 100 per cent Government-owned company, which is solely for the purpose of developing the poultry sector. I want to make this company a Government instrument to help smallholders to reap the benefits of the growing poultry industry and be the link between Ministries and Government institutions related to this field, as well as private sector institutions.

Also, restarting of the breeder operation to the maximum capacity of 10,500 birds is going to be done by the Sri Lanka Poultry Development Company (Pvt.) Limited in three stages. I am happy to say that Stage 1 and 2 are now in operation with 6,150 birds. A broiler project in batches of 2,000 with a two-week interval is going to commence from December, 2014 totalling 10,000 birds. The feed mixing plant, the slaughterhouse, the cool room, stores and other buildings within the farm premises are to be repaired and brought to functioning order.

The Mahaweli Livestock Enterprises Limited is an organization which caters to the poultry sector and it comprises of stock of parent birds, a hatchery, a feed mill and a chicken-processing plant.

With the intention of helping the rural community, the Plantation Human Development Trust has been re-registered under the Companies Act. It was first formed in 1992 by the incessant efforts of the late Hon. Saumyamoorthy Thondaman. It was first established under the name of the "Plantation Housing and Social Welfare Trust". The main objective of this is to uplift the social welfare of the plantation community. Towards this

1159 1160

[ ]

2014 10

goal we have taken the following steps through the Plantation Human Development Trust. We have completed around 25,000 houses and shifted around 100,000 people to "New Life Housing" Project, which has addressed the dignity of the workers. In the same manner, we have covered around 55 per cent of the requirement of sanitation of the plantation workers along with about 45 per cent of the requirement of drinking water. We have also started construction to upgrade the child development centres which were earlier called, "Pullemadu" and the coverage is around 60 per cent on this activity. As an interim measure, we have re-roofed the barrack-type line rooms covering about 45 per cent until such time each family is allocated a separate house for which the plantation companies will release the required lands. In addition to that, the UDA has commenced to construct 50,000 houses, which will assist the landslide victims in Koslanda and other areas as well. The Indian Government too has commenced the preliminary work of constructing 4,000 houses for the people in the plantation sector. It is our view that around 150,000 houses are required to meet the balance to replace people in the barrack-type line rooms.

In addition to all these activities, several social awareness programmes have been conducted in the plantations on health, hygiene and environmental issues, which have assisted the workers to lead a better life. As a result, our estate health statistics indicates an upward trend due to the conducting of awareness and educational programmes. The Maternal Mortality and infant mortality rates have come down due to institutional delivery, which is almost 99 per cent at present.

Sir, there are five project units functioning under the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation at present. They are: Prajashakthi Development Project, Nawashakthi Self-employment Entrepreneurship Project, Thondaman Vocational Training Centre at Hatton, Thondaman Cultural Centre at Ramboda and Thondaman Sports Complex at Norwood.

The Prajashakthi Development Project aims to achieve comprehensive, complete and overall socio-economic development of the underprivileged rural community through extensive application and use of Information and Communication Technology. This project not only integrates the educational, social, cultural and civil activities of the plantation community, but also facilitates the use of technology as a catalyst in transforming the community into a united, well-informed and self-sufficient society. There have been around 45 Prajashakthi centres established in the plantation sector and another 35 Prajashakthi centres are expected to be completed in the coming years. Up to now, 38,683 youth and school children have registered with these 45 centres and they are being benefited directly from the facilities available at the centres.

The Navashakthi Self-Employment Entrepreneurship Scheme, which is under the Prajashakthi Project, has been providing training to plantation youth over the last five years in various fields in self-employment projects such as dairy farming, poultry farming, goat farming, setting up of small business, tailoring and cultivation. So far, it has given loans to 349 plantation youth for such types of business activities.

The Ministry, in collaboration with the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation, has established the Prajashaksthi Youth Empowerment Cooperative Society - YESCOOP - for the purpose of promoting self-help activities among the beneficiary youth of the Prajashakthi and Navashakthi programmes. This Cooperative Society has been incorporated under the Cooperative Societies Act, No. 5 of 1972.

While focusing attention on human capacity development for plantation youth, we have emphasized on having 15 vocational training courses, which have the National Vocational Qualification - NVQ - standards. These are being conducted on behalf of the plantation youth at the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre and through that, around 400 youth could be trained per year. Up to now, 2,855 youth have undergone training at this training centre. Most of them who have passed the examination; they have secured jobs in reputed business organizations. Moreover, training courses in Bharatha Nattyam, Karnatic Music, Violin and Miruthangam are being conducted at the Ramboda Thondaman Cultural Centre. At present, there are 35 students following these training courses.

Sir, last but not least, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Deputy Minister, the Secretary and the Additional Secretaries of my Ministry and their staff along with the Chairman and Heads of Organizations coming under the purview of my Ministry, and my adviser and personal staff for the support rendered to me to carry out my duties. Thank you.

Hon. Thondaman, I am telling you, this is a shame and a disgrace. Why is there a lack of co-ordination? See the spokesmen of these three Ministries. What are they talking? Are we jokers here? I ask you. I am going to speak on livestock. I respect your grandfather. He was a great man. I bow down to him.

, . Hon. Thondaman, you have connections with India. I have visited India many times. I visited India recently also. You know better than me how many litres of milk they take from a Sindhi cattle in India. They take 10 to 20 litres. We have the same climate. But, you have brought down cattle from Australia. I know the culprit behind this. He is one of my friends working in Nestle. This guy has taken you for a ride at a cost of Rs. 300,000. You have brought them to Andigama and other areas. I had a herd of 40 Jerseys at that time. I gave up because they fell sick and did not give milk. They are Arctic animals. Do they suit a low country climate like ours? I ask you. Do not do this. This is a curse. I do not know who is behind this and who is gaining from this. Hon. Minister, you cannot get 30 litres or even 20 litres from these cattle in our areas. Why are you doing this? The army - [Interruption.] Wait, I am going to tell you. Do not talk about the past. Now, you are the Minister. You want to know the names of the farms. I will tell you. They are: Siringapatha, Nikaweratiya and Bopaththalawa. - [Interruption.] You can get this from your own Chairman. I am going to table all these documents.

The Sri Lankan Army is going import 10,000 Jersey to Kandakadu farm in Welikanda. In a dry zone like this, how can you get milk from these cows? Who is behind this? What is this racket? Please stop these things from happening.

The Hon. Minister knows about India better than me. The Commissioner of Elections and I came in the same flight on the 31st night. Now, look at this news which has sent shock waves across India. The Supreme Court of India has ordered Narendra Modi's Government to disclose the entire list of black money account holders

who are business magnates, politicians of BJP and Indian National Congress. They are going to inquire into it. Will that happen in Sri Lanka? No.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have one more minute.

[6.00 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman, we are now discussing the Votes of four very important Ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development, the Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development and the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy.

The Ministry of Agriculture is to provide the starch-based food needs of the people and the Ministry of Livestock Development is to provide the protein-based food needs of the people. The Ministry of Livestock Development has been successful in increasing the price of milk purchased from the dairy farmer from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, which is a 20 per cent increase; an increase that has come after four years, but a substantial increase for which we are glad, because the dairy farmer has to go through a lot of hassle to produce milk and he should obtain a fair price for his production.

However, I have an issue to raise in this House. Today, we import powdered milk from various countries and it is sold at Rs. 960 per kilo. A kilo of powdered milk can produce up to eight litres of milk, according to the manufacturers and suppliers of this milk powder. So, it

1191 1192

[ ]

2014 10

costs Rs. 120 for the consumer to buy a litre of milk in the powdered form. Out of this, Rs. 15 is the tax imposed on powdered milk that is imported to this country. So, the actual cost of milk got from powdered milk is Rs. 105 per litre. We are buying today liquid milk from the dairy farmer at Rs. 50. But, when it comes to the consumer, it is sold at Rs. 122. A packet of 450 millilitres of liquid milk is sold by the NLDB at Rs. 55, which works out to Rs. 122 per litre of liquid milk. The liquid milk that is bought from the dairy farmer is taken to the processing centres, pasteurized - boiled, put into polythene bags and distributed to the consumer at a retail price of Rs. 122. That means, there is a value addition of Rs. 72 per litre of milk. I do not know what this value addition is. It is boiled, put into polythene bags and brought to the consumer. So, the cost of Rs. 72, I feel, is unjustifiable. The officials have to explain why and how this Rs. 72 value addition is taking place. This has to be found. Today, when we increase the price paid to the farmer by 20 per cent, then, maybe, Milco and the NLDB will increase their prices of their production again by 20 per cent, which should go to about Rs. 145, whereas the powdered milk brought to this country, with duties paid, repacked, advertised and sold through wholesale dealers and retail dealers still costs only Rs. 105 without tax. So, there is something drastically wrong in the production and sale of liquid milk in this country.

Recently, the Milco factory land was given on lease to the Softlogic Company and a new processing centre is to be set up in Badalgama. Okay. There is, today, the possibility of rethinking as to how milk production in this country has to take place. Today, we have three processing centres. Milk from producing areas is brought to these centres, processed and transported again. So, instead of having one unit, a large factory in Badalgama, I would like to know whether regional factories or processing centres can be set up in the producing areas itself, so that once the liquid milk is taken to the processing centres, it can be processed and taken direct to the consumer, without transporting it twice, sometimes from the producing area to the factory and back to the producing area for distribution. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, I consider this as constructive criticism. Please discuss with your officials and try to reduce the cost of liquid milk that reaches the consumer. If you do that, you will be encouraging the use of liquid milk by the consumer, which is your final target.

Everyone talks about liquid milk being used instead of powdered milk. True. Our people have got used to the easy way of using powdered milk, which can be just bought from the shop, mixed and taken, instead of liquid milk which can get spoilt easily. Liquid milk also needs refrigeration and there are so many processes. It maybe difficult, but at the same time I feel this is something that you must look into in a constructive manner and try to correct because the value addition of Rs.72 today is not justifiable.

Now, I wish to speak a few words about the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy. Hon. Minister, there is the Gem and Jewellery Authority under your purview. This Gem and Jewellery Authority does not have a Director-General, the post is vacant. This has been probably kept vacant to serve a particular purpose. There is one Mr. K.L.D. Dayasagara who has been appointed as the Deputy Director-General. This person does not have a degree; he does not have the basic qualifications. He has not been recruited through the normal recruitment process in an institution of this nature but he takes all decisions that a Director-General should take. How is this happening?

.. ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha - Minister of Environment and Renewable Energy) Hon. Member, you have been misled by somebody. I will answer that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay, please do that. This is an issue that I am raising in this House and if you reply, you will be clearing the doubts of the people. A person who carries such high responsibility should have the necessary qualifications and should have been recruited in the right process, but this has not been done. He is taking vital decisions, signing very important documents and licences are issued by this Deputy Director-General in the name of the Director-General of the Authority, which does not augur well for an institution with such high responsibility.

The Hon. Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development is here again. The Industrial Development Board was under late Aiyar Thondaman. It was a very effective organization. You have so many regional offices, but today, generally a feeling is there that the Industrial Development Board is not functioning the way it did then. Micro industries or small industries are the -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan, now wind up please. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) One moment, please. The small industries are the seeds - [Interruption.] That is a different thing, it is not because of that, Hon. Minister. I believe in small industries, I have great interest in them. I believe that small industries are the seeds for large industries. So, it is important that more small industries come up. I mentioned in this House last week that in the plantation

1193 1194

areas, youth are looking forward to starting small and micro industries and you could be of help in this. - [Interruption.] This is constructive criticism, Hon. Minister. I am not criticizing you. I am only telling you that there is a greater need. Please go forward and support small industries, which can grow into big industries in the future.

Thank you.
