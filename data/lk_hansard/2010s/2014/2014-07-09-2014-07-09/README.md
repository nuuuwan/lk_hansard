1. The intimation by the Australian authorities to the Government of Sri Lanka has been in respect of one boat originating from Sri Lanka carrying Sri Lankans which had been intercepted.

2. Identity of the occupants of the said boat has been established.

3. The Government of Sri Lanka is unable to attribute a reason for an action taken by a third country.

4. Yes. The Government of Sri Lanka has information only on the 41 illegal immigrants who were intercepted in late June and handed over on the 7th of July.

5. The question does not arise.

6. A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed on the 9th of November, 2009 between the Governments of Sri Lanka and Australia concerning Legal Cooperation against the Smuggling of Migrants.

A Joint Working Group - JWG - on People Smuggling and Transnational Crime has been established between Sri Lanka and Australia through an Exchange of Letters. (The Hon. Jason Clare, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice of Australia, sent a letter on 15th October, 2012 proposing the establishment of JWG to which the Hon. G.L. Peiris, Minister for External Affairs had replied in agreement on 26th November, 2012, thus establishing the JWG.) The officials of the two Governments meet and discuss matters pertaining to combating people smuggling on an annual basis. That is with respect to the Bali Process.

Sri Lanka and Australia work in close cooperation on combating people smuggling, which is an ongoing constructive engagement between key domestic operational agencies which underline the commitment to work together in practical ways to address people smuggling issues. Thank you.

[3.50 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am very happy that you called me early in the day to address this august Assembly. I consider it, perhaps, a rare privilege.

Today, Sir, we are discussing particularly about ocean pollution. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Sri Lanka, as an island nation, has the right to explore the resources in the Indian Ocean around our country. The Exclusive Economic Zone - EEZ - of Sri Lanka or the sea area where we have the exclusive right to explore and exploit resources is eight times larger than the extent of our land area. Marine resources are required for our future development activities.

As a Government, Sir, we have fully realized the importance of it. Therefore, under the "Mahinda Chintana", we have already commenced megaprojects to explore the resources in our sea area. We have already taken all the measures to develop Sri Lanka as a tourist hub in the region. Also, we have taken several measures to develop the fishery industry of the country. In all these industries, sustainability is heavily dependent on the resourcefulness of the coastal belt and the Exclusive Economic Zone.

Sir, I remember representing our country at a Conference in Nagoya, Japan some years back, where they passed several resolutions in order to protect the environment and particularly, the ocean bed, because for the mere survival of human beings, the conservation of the ocean is very important. We have heard in the past that in the Pacific, the Atlantic and other oceans, there had been large oil leaks from large ships, polluting the entire ocean. The world population is growing; pollution of the air, the sea, water and land is increasing. Now, this

231 232

is a real challenge for the human beings. Therefore, the Nagoya Conference, which I attended, made an appeal, a request from all the delegates to have laws passed in the respective parliaments in order to bring home the truth about the importance of the marine environment and its protection so that adequate and sufficient measures would be taken by their respective governments, first, to educate the people of the country and second, to take meaningful steps to protect the environment.

These are two most important things, which today this House is privileged to hear from my Good Friend, the Hon. Abdul Rahim Mohideen Abdul Cader, Acting Minister of Environment and Renewable Energy. He, Sir, coming from a hill-locked land, and also an area covered with a large extent of jungle, knows the truth about the preservation of environment. Human beings, animals, birds, flora and fauna can survive only if the environment is protected and the nature is preserved.

Sir, earlier in the day, I heard my good, young Friend - whom I carried when he was very young - whom I called "Patiya" those days, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, ridiculing the efforts of the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy. He is a person who is always in Yala. Perhaps, he thought that he was speaking to the animals of Yala and not to the Hon. Members in the House.

Sir, the mere fact that there is a separate Ministry created by His Exellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, our President, proves beyond doubt the importance that is attached to this subject and the Resolution passed at the Nagoya Conference. We are very happy today that the Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader moved this Motion and said a mouthful of very meaningful things for today and for the future generations as well.

Talking of oceans, I must also bring to your notice a very important matter about one of the oceanic islands of Sri Lanka, the Kachchatheevu. What is happening today? Not the Indian Government, but certain forces in the southern part of India are trying to pollute the entire ocean, not only around Katchatheevu, but around the entire Palk Strait. Sir, there had been an Agreement reached long ago between the two Prime Ministers of that country and this country. The credit should go to the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who was the Prime Minister then and who in January, 1974 visited India and signed the Agreement with the then Indian Prime Minister.

"" .

" 1974 .

."

The Indian Prime Minister agreed, the whole India agreed that Kachchatheevu belongs to Sri Lanka and nobody can thereafter act otherwise.

" .

1974 28 ."

The House must be told of these facts and through this House these facts must be informed to the people of India.

" . . ."

They have completely put a stop to the arguments as to whom Kachchatheevu belongs.

Sir, there was a news item in the "Daily News" of Thursday, 3rd July, 2014 under the caption, "No Indian Fishing in Katchatheevu". That is also very significant.

It states, I quote:

Indian fishermen have no right to fish near Katchatheevu and are entitled only to dry their nets on the Island; besides, almost all arrests by the Lankan Navy of Indian fishermen have taken place only in Sri Lankan waters, the Union Government told the Madras High Court on Tuesday."

. UNDP Report . UNDP Report :

The Ceylon Electricity Boards future generation plan relies hugely on coal; while the burgeoning transport sector and many industries are completely dependent on imported oil. Sri Lanka has 1,600 km of coastline; large parts of it disappear into the sea each year during the South West monsoon from severe erosion. Coastal erosion in Puttlam is severe enough to threaten the Norachcholai coal power plant and coastal windmills established by the private sector"

The UNDP-supported Hazard Profiles for Sri Lanka warns that there will be sea level rise in areas like the Puttalam, Jaffna and Hambantota Districts.
