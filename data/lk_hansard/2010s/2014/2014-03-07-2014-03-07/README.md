We are very thankful to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran and the UAE Embassy because they - whether I am the Minister of Muslim Affairs or not - have made it a practice to send me packets of dates annually and I used to, as you know, distribute them among our Members and the staff here.

Douglas Devananda, Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, and his worthy Deputy Minister, Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake. They take lot of interest to promote by-products of kithul, palmyrah and coconut. They also hold an exhibition annually in the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Hall and a large number of people from all over the country come to see it. Sometimes, people who are unable to engage in any other industry; who are victims of LTTE bombings and dependents of soldiers, particularly in the Sinhalese areas, get into this industry because it is very easy.

[2.02 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Hon. Speaker, I think this Motion moved by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer is a very timely Motion and I am glad that the Hon. Member brought it up because this particular subject is of great importance. I would also have welcomed more mention of work in the North and

the East, where I think this could be a fantastic basis for more cottage industries. This morning, we had the COPE and we were discussing the work of three vocational training institutes in this country. I think it is important, in line with the suggestions made by the Hon. Member, that we should broadbase our whole approach to vocational training and make sure that it also deals with the day-to-day problems of the citizens of this country. There is a massive need for expansion of vocational training in many of our rural areas, particularly in the North and the East. There is also a need for broadbasing value addition of our agricultural and other products. So, I think that the Hon. Member, in bringing up this subject, has raised a very important issue and I am happy to second this Motion.

"The Island" newspaper dated 09th December, 2013 under the caption "Kitul Jaggery, treacle to Japan" states, I quote:

"Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development Douglas Devananda, has initiated a programme to further develop the Kitul Project operative in his Ministry and export Kitul based products to highly competitive international markets, thereby to enhance the economy of those engaged in the industry."

? , . . . ? .

The same news report further states - this is very important, Sir, - I quote:

"As the first step of this project, a contract to export Kitul treacle and jaggery was entered into between Japan Sky International Company and Sri Lanka Jegota Agro Company on November 28."

That was, last year.

"Keiso Sakura on behalf of the Japanese company and Priyantha Samarajeewa, Chairman of Sri Lanka Jagota Agro Company signed the agreement. Accordingly, 10,000 litres of treacle will be purchased by the Japanese Company monthly."

We must appreciate the Hon. Minister Douglas Devananda for all his efforts taken. His able Secretary, Mr. V. Sivagnanasothy, also supplied us with a lot of information. He is also taking a very keen interest in developing this industry. I must also appreciate the good work of Mr. Susantha de Silva, the Additional Secretary (Development), Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, who is in charge of the development of the kithul industry.

Sir, kithul grows on altitudes as high as 5,000 feet and above the sea level. It grows even on the Himalayas. , - - . ... . . . . ; . . . , . , " !" . .
