* : : Annex tabled:

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Minister. Sir, now, may I ask the three Supplementary Questions. The first Question is this. Hon. Deputy Minister, you said that your earning capacity in 2013 was US Dollars 1.7 billion, during which year you had 1.2 million tourists. So, what you are basically saying is that US Dollars 1.7 billion was earned for that year and you had 1.2 million tourists in that year. With 365 days a year, if we calculate the cost incurred by a tourist, a tourist has spent only US Dollars 5 a day in that year. Is that realistic? What type of tourists came to this country?

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Sir, in 2013, a tourist had spent an average of 8.6 days in Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, my question is this. You had earned US Dollars 1.7 billion for the year 2013 and you had 1.2 million tourists in that year. A year has 365 days. So, if you have a simple division of those statistics, you will get US Dollars 5 as the average cost incurred by a tourist per day. Therefore, you have either had too many tourists or you have underestimated your revenue.

393 394

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) No, that is not correct. Sir, the average cost incurred per 10 days by a tourists is US Dollars 1,670 in 2014. That means, the cost incurred by a tourist per day is US Dollars 167.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, I am going by the figures you have given. You told us that you had earned US Dollars 1.7 billion in 2013. If you divide it by the 1.2 million tourist arrivals and 365 days, then, you will get how much a tourist spent for a day in that year. So, you have either counted anybody who had been in transit through Colombo as a tourist or you have understated your revenue. Sir, it is a very simple calculation. I am trying to ensure that foreigners pay a realistic price for the hotels they stay in. They do not come and stay in chummeries here. So, Hon. Deputy Minister, with a simple division, you can find the answer.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Mr. Deputy Speaker, according to the Answer, the average duration of stay of tourists in Sri Lanka is 10 days in 2012. According to the amount they have spent in Sri Lanka - [Interruption.] In 2013, it has increased. In 2013, they have spent about US Dollars 1,453. In 2014, it is US Dollars 1,670. That means, the average is US Dollars 167.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I did not get an Answer to my Supplementary Question. Hon. Deputy Minister, I can see yours is a Ministry that is working, but please ensure that we are given the correct figures. Just because some official gives it to you, it is not right information that has been provided.

My second Supplementary Question is that 48.9 per cent of an invoice in a hotel is subject to either direct or indirect taxation. This is a very high figure compared to that of the region, which is normally between 22 to 30 per cent. How are you going to make the tourism industry more attractive? How are going to get more tourists coming into this country and ensure that there is no overcapitalization in the tourist industry?

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) I will answer this Question in two weeks time.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My third Supplementary Question Hon. Deputy Minister is, you are hoping to get 4.5 million tourists by 2016. Is that a realistic figure?

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) It is 2.5 million. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, is 4.5 million for 2020? .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) In your submission to the House, you stated that you have 16,000 hotels. So, if you have 2.5 million tourists coming in 2016, - there are 500 days more from today - how are you going to increase 6,000 rooms within these 500 days?

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Under the guidance of the Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, our Ministry is making all arrangements in this regard and a number of international hotel chains have already started their operation. We are promoting investors to come in and invest in the hotel industry in Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How do you define a tourist? Do you count a person who comes out of the airport and stays more than 24 hours and a person who just comes to Katunayake and goes out, all as tourists?

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Whoever who comes to Sri Lanka for one day, two days, one week, two weeks and so on, are tourists. When people come as tourists, they become tourists.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Even if he is a dual citizen, is he considered as a tourist?
