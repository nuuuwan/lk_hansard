[2.36 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have pleasure in seconding the Motion, so ably moved by my Colleague, the Hon. Janaka Bandara. Since he read the Motion in Sinhala, Sir, I would like to table* the Tamil and the English translations of it to be included in Hansard.

Sir, this is a very historic moment. This is a challenge for every Sri Lankan citizen, whether he is for Sri Lanka or whether he betrays this nation and supports foreign conspirators. I rise in Parliament today, Sir, as a member of the Muslim community, which has a proud record of supporting the natives against every foreign force - the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British - for almost four and a half centuries since the year 1505. Our forefathers have been in the forefront, fighting against foreign domination.

History records proudly that during the Sitawaka regime of King Mayadunne, illustrious Muslim warriors, who included Ali Marikar, Pitchai Marikar and Kunjali Marikar, joined the Kings army and valiantly fought against Portuguese invasion, displaying their sheer patriotism and absolute loyalty to the motherland. This is vividly described in the book "Arabic, Arwi and Persian in Sarandib and Tamil Nadu" written by Afdalul 'Ulama Dr. Tayka Shuayb 'Alim, the Head of the Arusia Movement.

Sir, I stand in this House today to pay tribute to the Sinhala kings of the Kandyan Kingdom, who were generous enough to bestow the Muslims with Nindagam lands, goda and mada edam, in response to their undying loyalty to the king and the country.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] -[ ]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) , -[ ]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . . . .

Sir, the Sinhalese gave goda edam and mada edam to the Muslims in response to their undying loyalty to the king and the country. So much so, the Muslims, even to this day, carry Sinhala "Ge" names such as "Veda Muhandiramge Gopallawa Arachchilage Gedera Sithy Ayesha Umma". - [Interruption.] Sir, I am talking about the proud Muslim forefathers of this country who have been very patriotic. Gopallawa Arachchilage Gedera Sithy Ayesha Umma was the mother of the late Hon. A.C.S. Hameed, Dese Gurunansalagedera Shahul Hameed, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the UNP Government. Also, there were names such as "Vidyatilaka Muhandiram Gopala Mudiyanselage Udayar" et cetera.

Sir, I also rise today in this House as a Member of the party, the leader of which is His Excellency Mahinda

Rajapaksa, who played a remarkable role as the leader of this country in wiping out the scourge of terrorism, which had almost destroyed this resplendent land for 30 long years. We all have enjoyed the much-yearned peace since May, 2009. Cometh the hour; cometh the man! So, when the hour dawned upon , the man emerged to save our country, our nation, our motherland.

Sir, I rise in this House today to recall the stand taken by our remarkable Muslim leaders of the past such as Sir Mohamed Macan Markar Effendi, Dr. T.B. Jayah, Sir Razik Fareed, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Dr. Badi-ud-din Mahmud, Gate Mudaliyar M.S. Kariapper and other leaders of that calibre, all Members of this hallowed House of Parliament, in striving for Independence and preserving the unitary state of this nation. In the same strain, I urge you, all patriotic Members, to group as one body in this House and show to the entire world, whatever the power you maybe, that we are together and we will not allow foreign conspirators to come into the country and rob our hard-earned freedom. Sir, I rise to the occasion by stating that we will prevent our motherland from being destroyed by conspiracies, plots and intrigues hatched by the Western powers, who are on a bullying spree. Surely, Sir, the world is not in need of a world policeman! We do not want a world policeman. Every nation wishes to protect its dignity, self-respect, sovereignty and territorial integrity. - [Interruption.] - -

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

, .

Today, Sir, we are called upon to play a significant role, which the Members of this House are aware of, and would also agree with me, on this occasion, that we should stand together as one body or else, we will fall. I can do no better than to quote the architect of the present Constitution, former President J.R. Jayewardene, from his book titled Relived Memories", ably documented by Mr. P.N. Meddegoda, Media Consultant to J.R. Jayewardena Cultural Centre. What does the former President say? Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I am asking you, what does your uncle say in that book? These are historic words, which state, I quote.

Whoever adopts violence against the State for whatever cause should be outside the pale of our friendship and protection.

Let me repeat it, Sir. The late President J.R. Jayewardene, the architect of the Constitution, said in no unmistakable terms that "whoever adopts violence against the State for whatever cause...." - "for whatever cause" - "...should be outside the pale of our friendship and protection". I tell the followers of JR, the people of the United National Party, you will go outside the pale of the friendship and the protection of the Sri Lankan nation, if you go against this Motion that we have moved today.

The future generation of our Muslim community should never fail to meet peril as and when it rises. They should rise to the occasion and meet the threat with fortitude and courage to crush it.

In conclusion, Sir, I can do no better than to quote Sir Winston Spencer Churchill from one of his daring speeches made when he visited Harrow School on 29th October, 1941 after the Blitz . He said, I quote:

Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never -........."

So, Sir, let us in this House at this crucial hour tell our benign leader, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, never give in, never give in, never, never, never, but fight, fight and fight.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I call upon the Hon. R. Sampanthan to start his speech. [3.37 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for the opportunity given to me.

Sir, I wish to place on record the position of the Tamil National Alliance regarding the Motion that has been put forward for debate and related matters of public importance.

It is indeed ironic that the Government, now at this late stage, seeks the imprimatur of Parliament for its own dire failings. This Government, which has so brazenly turned Parliament into an object of ridicule by enticing Members of the Opposition to cross over for personal gain and by providing executive posts to almost half the Members of the House, now turns to Parliament on a question of fundamental importance to the country. It is plainly clear to the entire country that this turn to Parliament is nothing but a cheap political sleight of hand, and it is a great misfortune to the people of this country that their Government is more interested in playing immature political tricks than in dealing with important matters of national reconciliation and foreign policy with sobriety and wisdom.

Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva has already announced the countrys non-cooperation with the envisaged investigation. What then is the point of this exercise in Parliament? Is the Government so insecure with its isolationist policy that it wishes to share the blame with Parliament and use it to rubber-stamp the obnoxious pronouncement by the Governments Representative abroad?

The Motion before us is illustrative of the frivolity that has characterized the Governments attitude to reconciliation and accountability.

The Motion refers to a Resolution by the Human Rights Commission, although the United Nations Commission on Human Rights was replaced by the Human Rights Council more than eight years ago. Further, the Motion refers to the Council Resolution as one that is against Sri Lanka. The Resolution affirmed the Councils commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. How then can the Government claim that this Resolution is against the country?

On that point, Sir, I wish to raise the question as to whether, by the Governments own logic, His Excellency the President was acting against the country when he issued a Joint Statement with the United Nations' Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on 26th May, 2009, where it is stated, I quote:

The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law

And, where the President made an undertaking that, I quote:

The Government will take measures to address those grievances

Sir, the internationalization of the question of accountability and justice in respect of violations

717 718

2014 17

committed by both sides during the war was entirely on account of a considered decision made by the Government and the President in May, 2009. That decision was a correct one and the governance of the country would have been significantly smoother if the Government had only made good on its own assurances to the Secretary-General. But, that was not to be. The Government reneged on its commitment to the Secretary-General, which led him to appoint a Panel of Experts to advise him on implementing his agreement with the Sri Lankan Government.

Instead of keeping his promise to the Secretary-General, President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - LLRC - on 15th May, 2010. The LLRC released its final Report on 16th December, 2011. The TNA welcomed a number of LLRC recommendations dealing with human rights issues including displacement, land dispute resolution, detention, media freedom, investigations into extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. To date, merely a handful of these constructive recommendations have been implemented. The Governments own claims about progress have been contradictory. In February, 2014, the Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, asserted in Parliament that 85 per cent of the LLRC recommendations had been fully implemented. Meanwhile, the President himself informed the UN Secretary-General in May, 2014 that only 30 per cent of the LLRC recommendations had been fully implemented. We recall that the Minister of Plantation Industries, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, claimed at a Press Conference in March, 2013 that 99 per cent of those recommendations had been fully implemented.

We, therefore, note that the Government has been completely disingenuous in reporting progress with respect to implementing these recommendations. Moreover, many recommendations the Government deems fully implemented have, in fact, not been implemented at all. For instance, in January 2014, the Government claimed to have fully implemented the recommendation on investigating past attacks on media personnel. In proof of such a claim, the Government cited the online complaints mechanism available to journalists to complain to the Sri Lanka Press Council, which is a highly ineffective mechanism that contributes more towards restricting media freedom rather than promoting it. Meanwhile, investigations into the assassination of the Editor of "The Sunday Leader", Lasantha Wickrematunge, the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda and the numerous attacks on the staff and offices of the Jaffna-based "Uthayan" newspaper, are either incomplete or non-existent. Moreover, in January 2014, the Government claimed it fully implemented the LLRC recommendation on the investigation and prosecution of illegal armed groups. Yet, many identified perpetrators of gross human rights violations, who belonged to these groups and enjoyed the patronage of the Government, continue to enjoy the impunity.

Though the LLRC did not have a direct mandate to address accountability issues, it did, however, possess a mandate with respect to ensuring national unity and the non-recurrence of ethnic tensions in the future. It is in this context that the LLRC sought to also deal with the question of accountability. The TNA in its response to the LLRC Report published in January, 2013, expressed disappointment with respect to the Commissions findings on accountability. The LLRCs analysis was flawed for a number of reasons including weaknesses in methodology and in the application of international law to the facts surrounding the last stages of the war. We note, however, that the LLRC called for investigations into specific incidents involving the death of civilians. These include the alleged attack on civilians in Chundikulam by the Navy on 10th May 2009, an incident at Mathalan on 20th April, 2009 where the Army allegedly prevented civilians from crossing over to Government-controlled areas and the Government shelling of civilians in Pokkanai. Yet, no genuine steps have been taken to investigate these incidents. The Army Board on the Recommendations of the LLRC, in its Report released on 24th January, 2013, observed that the questions whether civilian casualties in fact occurred or whether such incidents were collateral for incidental damages that are inherent with the vagaries of war have not been answered affirmatively by the LLRC. The Board recommended the appointment of another Army Board of Inquiry to investigate allegations contained in the LLRC Report and the Channel 4 footage. The Army then appointed a Court of Inquiry to investigate these allegations, which concluded in February 2013 that instances of shelling referred to in the LLRC Report were not caused by the Sri Lanka Army.

Moreover, a Navy Board of Inquiry concluded that "the allegations made against the Sri Lanka Navy that it fired at civilian targets are baseless as there is no evidence to indicate that the navy personnel were responsible for any attacks on civilians or civilian property either deliberately or by negligence. The reports of the Army Court of Inquiry and the Navy Board of Inquiry have not been published to date. This policy of secrecy and non-transparency is entirely consistent with the Governments failure to publish the Report of the Udalagama Commission, which made certain crucial findings on certain gross human rights violations, including the killing of five students in Trincomalee and the killing of 17 aid workers in Muttur in 2006.

It is precisely because of the failure of the Government to conduct a credible domestic inquiry that the Secretary-General was compelled to take steps himself to give effect to his agreement with the President. The Terms of Reference provided to the UN Panel of Experts on accountability in Sri Lanka was fundamentally based on the Joint Statement made by the President and the Secretary-General. In fact, the very purpose of the Panel was stated in the Terms of

719 720

Reference as advising the Secretary-General on the modalities, applicable international standards and comparative experience relevant to fulfilment of the joint commitment to an accountability process having regard to the nature and scope of violations.

When the Panel presented its Report on 31st March, 2011, it was clear that they had conducted a meticulous study of the steps that needed to be taken, both by the Sri Lankan Government and the United Nations, having regard to the nature and scope of violations. The Panels examination of the nature and scope of violations - a necessary part of the mandate - revealed credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both parties. The allegations laid down in detail in the Report were a shocking revelation of the barbarity and unlawfulness that characterized the conduct of both parties during the last stages of the war. In respect of the Government, the Report found credible allegations of a number of war crimes and crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, imprisonment, persecution and disappearances. Critically, the Panel found that the majority of civilian casualties during the last stages of the war were on account of indiscriminate shelling by Government forces. On the part of the LTTE, the Panel found credible allegations of war crimes and the crimes against humanity of murder. The Panel found that the credible allegations suggested criminal culpability on the part of senior military and Government leaders as well as senior LTTE leaders.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Government has, as is typical of their engagement with the United Nations, sought to vilify the eminent members of the Panel which included Mr. Marzuki Darusman, a respected diplomat and former Attorney-General of Indonesia; Ms. Yasmin Sooka, a former Commissioner of the South African and Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and Professor Steven Rattner, a credentialed academic from the United States. Despite the indecent vitriol of the Government on the home front where it equated these respected international experts with terrorists, it cannot ignore the fact that it participated, of its own volition, in the deliberations of the UN Panel of Experts. While posturing to its domestic audience as defiant champions of non-interference, the Government dispatched a high-level delegation to New York, which made comprehensive submissions to the Panel on 22nd February, 2011. The members of the delegation are named on page 127 of the Panels Report. They included the then Attorney-General and incumbent Chief Justice, Mr. Mohan Peiris; Foreign Secretary Mr. Romesh Jayasinghe, the Sri Lankan Permanent and Deputy Representatives to the UN in New York and an Adviser to the Foreign Ministry.

Based on its finding of credible allegations of international crimes committed by both sides, the Panel

recommended that the Government immediately commence genuine investigations into alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed by both sides involved in the armed conflict. It also recommended that the UN Secretary-General establish an independent international mechanism to: (1) monitor and assess the extent to which the Government is carrying out an effective domestic accountability process; (2) conduct investigations independently into the alleged violations; and (3) collect and safeguard for appropriate future use information provided to it that is relevant to accountability for the final stages of the war. It also recommended that the UN Secretary-General conduct an internal review of the actions by the United Nations system during the war, and that the UN Human Rights Council be invited to reconsider its 2009 Resolution in the light of the Panel Report.

Sir, it is notable that pursuant to the release of the Panel Report, the Secretary-General transmitted the Report to the President of the Human Rights Council and to the Government of Sri Lanka. He refrained from constituting an international investigation himself, even though that course of action was recommended by the Panel of Experts and the Secretary-Generals legal advisers at the Office of Legal Affairs advised him repeatedly that he had the legal power to do so. The Secretary-Generals immense caution in this regard exposes the Governments untruths about an international conspiracy against it. The reality is that the Secretary-General was exceedingly generous towards the Government by providing it the time and space to do what it had promised, even at the cost of failing to heed the recommendations of his own Panel.

Sir, in the light of the Panel Report and the Governments prevarications, the UN Human Rights Council was compelled to act, when it passed Resolution 19/2 in March 2012 titled Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka. The resolution was mild; it merely called on the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the constructive recommendations of the LLRC and to take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans.

In short, Sir, the Human Rights Council did precisely what the Secretary-General himself had done previously. It gave the Government further time and space while encouraging it to make progress on its guarantees. And yet, the Governments injudicious outbursts against the co-sponsors of the resolution was totally at odds with the courtesy it had been provided. We must recall that this resolution was passed nearly two-and-a-half years ago. I ask, why was the Government so hostile to this friendly exhortation by the very countries that supported its war? Would this country not have benefited from a more mature response by its Government? Instead of making

721 722

[ . ]

2014 17

progress as requested, the Government became even more intransigent. Notwithstanding this attitude, the Human Rights Council adopted a very similar follow-up resolution in March, 2013. Again, the Government failed miserably to accept the offers of engagement from a restrained Human Rights Council. Instead, it continued to attack those concerned over its post-war trajectory.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it was inevitable that in 2014, the patience of Sri Lankas friends had worn thin. The recent resolution finally established a comprehensive investigation to undertake the inquiries which the Government had failed to undertake for five long years. Today, that investigation has been constituted and by finally establishing the truth of what happened during and after the final years of the war, it will provide some respite to the victims who continue to endure the stifling oppression of a triumphalist military presence. We continue to hope that even at this late stage, the Government accepts the invitation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to participate constructively in the investigation, including by providing investigators access to victims, witnesses and forensic evidence. It must be known, Sir, that the failure of the Government to accept the offer to cooperate with the investigation will only send Sri Lanka further down the path of isolation. This is, indeed, a strange path for Sri Lanka to take. Sri Lanka has a proud history of active participation in the field of international criminal law, far surpassing the contributions of other similarly circumstanced countries. In fact, Sri Lankan judges and lawyers from the Attorney Generals Department have worked at all levels of international tribunals as judges and prosecutors. Sri Lankan lawyers, including incumbent Justices of the Supreme Court, have helped prosecute Heads of State, senior government functionaries, military commanders and rebel leaders from the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and East Timor. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan Judges, including former Chief Justice Asoka de Silva, former High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Justice Nihal Jayasinghe and the late Justice Raja Fernando, have served on tribunals for Rwanda, Cambodia and Sierra Leone. Moreover, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations, Mr. Palitha Kohona was the Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories. The Government did not treat such participation as a violation of the sovereignty of any nation. In fact, Mr. Kohonas Report to the UN General Assembly was sharply critical of Israels treatment of Palestinian civilians. Today, the Governments isolationism provides a stark contrast with its enthusiastic participation in international justice processes for other countries.

Sir, the Governments current course is also at odds with the conduct of its own leaders in the past. President Mahinda Rajapaksa was some time ago a leading

champion of the rights of victims. On the 11th of September in 1990, he attended the 31st Session of the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances in Geneva. He was prevented from carrying documentary evidence to the Working Group, when the police confiscated 533 documents containing information about missing persons and 19 pages of photographs of missing persons and extrajudicial killings.

Upon his return, he filed a Fundamental Rights application before the Supreme Court, whereby he claimed that his Fundamental Rights to freedom of expression and freedom from arbitrary arrest had been violated. He subsequently made several remarkable statements in this very House. On 25th October 1990, he justified his decision to engage the international community on the matter of Sri Lankas human rights record at that time. He stated: I took the wailings of this countrys mothers. Do I not have the freedom to speak about them? It was the wailing of those mothers which were heard by those 12 countries. - (Page 366 of the Hansard of 25th October 1990). He even admitted to asking donor countries to impose human rights conditions to giving aid. - (Page 365 of the Hansard of 25th October, 1990). The most striking of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksas statements in Parliament at that time was perhaps his avowal that If the Government is going to deny human rights, we should go not only to Geneva, but to any place in the world, or to hell if necessary, and act against the Government. - (Page 424 of the Hansard of 25th January, 1991).

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, recent history bears out that countries which have cooperated constructively with UN Human Rights mechanisms have emerged from those processes for the better - as respected members of the international community and with stronger domestic institutions to protect human rights. The approaches of Sierra Leone, Colombia, Mexico, Nepal, Mali, Togo, the Ivory Coast and many others are available as examples to the Government. Instead, the regime has chosen the path of the despots of North Korea and Syria, which incidentally are now being debated in the Security Council. The lesson, Sir, is clear - isolationism breeds further isolation and international censure. Instead, if Sri Lanka is to rehabilitate its image, it must deliver on its promises to the international community - both to devolve power in a meaningful way and ensure accountability for serious crimes.

Sir, it now appears that the Government has set its mind on defiance and seclusion. It is their prerogative. But, one day, the country must and will reverse the choices of this regime. We hope that day will come soon, and when it comes, that reversal will benefit all peoples of this country. The scourge of impunity has affected the Tamil people in particular, but it is no stranger to peace-loving citizens in the South. We all remember the insurrections by the youth in the South being brutally

723 724

crushed, with credible estimates of tens of thousands of disappearances. This behaviour was later repeated in the North, and now, racist forces are also beginning a pogrom of violence against the Muslim community. The black past of thousands of disappearances, killings, rapes, burnings and State brutality are not just a distant memory. Today, non-violent protestors in the South are shot at. Journalists are killed or sent into exile. Dissenters are not welcomed. In the North, the situation is even worse. People are not even allowed the troubled comfort of remembering their dead. Journalists from the critical press are routinely attacked, including in broad daylight. The recent report Stop Torture provides medical and forensic evidence suggesting that sexual violence and torture against Tamil women and men continues, with reports emerging from as late as January, 2014. Further, the evidence suggests that this sexual violence is targeted systematically to suppress the political rights of the Tamil people.

Sir, the Government invokes national sovereignty to reject expressions of friendly concern and offers of international cooperation and assistance in the area of human rights. But, the Governments notion of sovereignty is deeply flawed. Sovereignty does not mean seclusion; it does not entail the right to remain isolated. A proper understanding of the idea of sovereignty holds that it belongs to the people of a country and that it empowers them to engage confidently with the world as respected and equal members of the global community.

Today, the most significant obstacle standing in the way of people exercising their sovereignty is this regime. This regime has stripped the people of this country of their sovereignty by denying their rights, isolating their country and distancing its friends. This undermining of our sovereignty can never be countenanced for the purpose of protecting the narrow interests of a few people. So, today, when the Government is called into question, when it undermines the sovereignty of the people, the Government has no right to complain of a breach of sovereignty. In fact, international expressions of concern and actions to express that concern strengthen the sovereignty of the people by making its exercise more real for the citizens of the country in whom sovereignty is reposed.

The forthcoming investigation by the United Nations is not against Sri Lanka. It is against perpetrators of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law. It is against the culture of impunity that has victimized the whole country. It is against the disappearances of youth in the North as much as it is against past disappearances of youth in the South. It is against the crimes of Weliveriya, Mullivaikkal, and most recently, Dharga Town. It is against the crimes of the LTTE and it is against the crimes of the regime.

For these reasons, the TNA unequivocally welcomes the investigation into both sides. Just as we look forward to the investigation as an opportunity for the Tamil people to introspect on the crimes committed in our own name, we call on the Government to use the investigation as an opportunity to dramatically break with the past and usher in a new era of justice, reconciliation and harmony amongst all peoples of Sri Lanka.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, before I conclude, you will permit me, Sir - that is also a matter concerning human rights - to refer to the incidents that occurred in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town recently. Something happened on Thursday. The persons concerned were arrested and they were remanded. With that the matter ended. I have seen the video of a speech made by a Venerable Monk. It was a very vitriolic speech, a very violent speech; a speech urging the people to take to violence, insulting members of a particular community and saying that the police forces and the armed forces of this country are Sinhala. Consequent to that speech where the people were set up, there was a loud applause from the people. There was a procession and when the procession was taking place, shops were attacked, houses were attacked, mosques were attacked, people were attacked and a large number of people were injured; two people have died and immense damage has been caused to Muslim civilians.

Why were the law enforcement authorities quiet? Why were they silent? Why did they not act? After all, you stopped processions of workers demanding trade union rights or demanding wages or demanding salaries. You stop university students strikes when they protested with regard to their grievances in the universities. Then, why was this procession not stop? Was it a Government decision that that procession should not be stopped? Was it that the law enforcement authorities slackened in the performance of their duty; did not perform their duty and permitted these people to go on this outrage? I think, Sir, we must have answers to these questions. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition made a statement this afternoon. But, I think this matter cannot rest there. We are very concerned because this surely should not happen to any citizen in this country, irrespective of whether he is a Sinhalese, a Muslim, a Tamil, a Burgher, a Malay or whatever.

Is it that as far as law enforcement is concerned, there is one method of enforcement of the law against certain people in this country and a different method of enforcement of the law against other citizens in this country; that certain people are above the law; that certain people do not have to obey the law; that certain people can disregard the law with impunity in the belief that this Government will protect them? In my view, the law enforcement authorities would have acted if they had the confidence that this Government will be supportive of the action they take. If the law enforcement authorities did not take action as required by them under the law, I

725 726

2014 17

think it was for the reason that they feared that they might become culpable in the assessment of this Government in regard to their taking such action.

Sir, we need a very clear and definite position from the Government in regard to where this country is going as far as law enforcement is concerned and as far as the protection of the citizens of this country is concerned, irrespective of which ethnicity they belong to.

I thank you. [.. 4.15] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today this particular Motion proposed by the Hon. Janaka Bandara and a few other Members of Parliament, is alluding to the so-called international inquiry as being harmful for reconciliation and that it also goes on to violate our sovereignty and therefore we must, collectively as a House, vote for this Motion. But today, as the Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, I rise to speak at a time when the entire community is disillusioned and is in despair. The sense of outrage, disgust and helplessness that has pervaded the Muslim community today, is something that cannot be absent from my emotions when I speak in this debate today.

It is of course an issue for all of us when the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa countered the leader of the JVP, the Hon. Anura Dissanayake, on the question of him proposing an amendment to this Motion. The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa was challenging him and asking him - the incidents of human rights violations and the humanitarian law violations during the final phase of the war, going by the polarization in the opinion between those on both sides of the divide - whether they could separate it from the rest of the issues that he is raising. There is certainly an issue whether you could bifurcate the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. But we should, in the meantime, sincerely be prepared for a retrospection on the issues pertaining to our own Commission, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.

As a nation are we prepared to accept the recommendations of our own Commission and are we prepared go ahead with the implementations? As I told

749 750

[ ]

2014 17

you, I speak as a very disillusioned and despaired Member of this House. Certainly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights may be malicious towards us, but we cannot forget the fact that, time and again, there has been this clarion call to stem this rising tide of hate campaign of religious intolerance against minorities. We cannot fault anyone, least of all, Navi Pillay for saying so. The High Commissioner may have been biased against us. That is a different issue. But, we can no longer say that what she said in her Report before the Council in March 2014, is a tissue of lies. Her Report is there for all to see in the public domain. I quote from the Report freely available on the UNHRC website:

The High Commissioner remains deeply disturbed by the significant surge in attacks against religious minorities and the incitement of violence by Sinhala Buddhist nationalist groups, led predominantly by certain extremist Buddhist monks.

The High Commissioner has received reports of incidents of threats and violence against Muslims in 2013 as well as attacks on mosques and places of business. Christian groups also reported incidents of violence and attacks on churches and Christians in 2013.

Her Report further states, I quote :

After a lull prior to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, five violent attacks led by Buddhist monks were reported...

Perpetrators who are regularly captured on video footage are not brought to justice and in almost all cases, the police are seen standing as onlookers to the violence. This happened a few days ago also, two days before in Dharga Town and in Beruwala.

When Ms. Navi Pillay threw this indictment at us, what did we do? We responded with updates on hate speech legislation. Our response is also there in public domain; it is there for all of us to read.

The whole world has seen the inflammatory speech made in Alutgama inciting the Sinhala Buddhists of that area to violence; it is nothing but hate speech. I was reminded of the Srebrenica massacre, the darkest history in Europe, when thousands of Muslims were torched and an international inquiry was instituted in the end. Are we paving way for a further international inquiry to another dark and insidious period in the history of this country? Even if we are dragging our feet on enhancing penal sanction for these types of dastardly acts of furthering disunity and tarnishing the image of this country in international fora, there is legislative tool for us to respond to this. We have been making declarations to the world that we possess sufficient law with teeth to respond to hate speech through the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, No. 56 of 2007. We ourselves, this Government, enacted it; we gave effect to our international obligation to eliminate racial hatred. Article 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states, I quote:

Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.

We enacted this international obligation into domestic duty to prosecute such conduct in Article 3 of our International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act.

What happened in Alutgama is an example of cognizable offence under our own Act. So, why are we not taking into custody that very person who is spreading this hatred and inciting people to violence? It is the bounden duty of this Government to do so. Are we going to stand as mute sentinels and pay only lip service to these provisions and render them toothless? Having statutory provisions and declaring to the world that we have enough tools to prosecute such conduct is not enough. Full implementation of the letter and the spirit of these provisions is mandated in the light of the abysmal precipice we are sliding down today. It is something that we must bear in mind. We stand stoic to all that is happening around us and cry foul of Geneva when we ourselves provide evidence to them. This goes against the grain of the LLRC Recommendations. So, we must cry a halt to this culture of impunity by this group.

Then, Sir, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa was saying this.

the innocent Muslims, not simply of those in Alutgama and Dharga Town. The Venerable Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero has said that he is not responsible for this incident, but the police is. It is their dereliction of duty, is his excuse.

But, let me show you, Sir, from the Bodu Bala Sena's own publication what they are up to. They have already prepared a detailed publication.

It states, I quote:

"The Sinhala population in the country is 74.9 per cent according to the Basic Population Information Report of the Census of Population and Housing 2011. Director, Population Census and Demography Division of the Department of Census and Statistics, Indu Bandara said that according to the 2011 census, the Muslim population was 9.2 per cent and the Sinhala population was 74.9 per cent."

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The article further states:

"Answering a query, at a seminar held yesterday....Mrs. Bandara said that the Sinhala and Muslim populations had increased at the rate of 1.04 and 1.87 per cent respectively between 1981 and 2012, but it was not a threat to Sinhala people contrary to claims being made in some quarters to that effect."

This is the very fact. Several other unsubstantiated facts are being used to mislead people and then provoke

them to violence, when our police force was standing by and watching while all this carnage was taking place. Therefore, there must be some specific assurance given about taking action against the hate speech that is continuing to be made by this particular organization. Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. We were discussing about why children are educated in international schools. As my predecessor said, when one cannot gain admission for his child to a popular school, the child is, at least, sent to an international school. That is one reason. Then, there is another reason. That is, when a child studies in the English Medium, he has an advantage in life.

Last week I watched a debate on NDTV, where they said that the opportunity for getting a job when you are educated in the English Medium is 300 per cent more than a child educated in his mother tongue. Similarly, when salaries are discussed and decided in the private sector, the opportunity for getting a higher salary is 300 per cent more if you are educated in English than if you

773 774

[ .. ]

2014 17

are educated in the mother tongue. Sir, this is one reason why a lot of people send their children to international schools. As my predecessor said, it is not because somebody has a lot of money that they send their children to international schools. Those with very limited means send their children to international schools, which, in the outstations are not too expensive, sacrificing many of their comforts because the child can study and speak English.

I will quote an instance of a worker in Glasgow Estate, Nanu Oya, who sent his child to the Republican International School in Nuwara Eliya because he wanted his child to learn English, and go for a job rather than being a worker in an estate. When I went to that estate and met this worker, he brought his child forward, introduced him and told him to speak to me in English, to show how much he has done for his child. This occasion that I visited him was soon after the heavy rains, which had damaged his house. He was living in a mud hut which had collapsed, but inside that hut I found a computer for the use of his child. When parents are so devoted in educating their children even though they are backward estate workers, it is unfortunate that we are barring those children from international schools coming into the national school system. It is not only when you pass your O/Level that you go to a national school. There are families, who, when they are doing well, send their children to international schools. Unfortunately, due to some financial loss, they may not be able to afford to continue sending their children to international schools. They, then opt to send their children to a Government School. Even at that time these children are discriminated against; though even in international schools English Medium is used, the curriculum is the same as what the Ministry of Education has proposed. Under these circumstances, it is very unfair and I do not understand why this policy is being adopted by the Ministry of Education. I stayed today mainly to know the reason why the Hon. Minister decided to bar children from international schools entering National Schools.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . 35 .
