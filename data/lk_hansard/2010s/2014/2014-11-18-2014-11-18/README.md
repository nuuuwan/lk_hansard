( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood - Minister of Productivity Promotion) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for allocating enough funds for my Ministry.

The Ministry of Productivity Promotion functions as the pioneer in creating competitive human resource as well as the principal policy maker in productivity promotion sector. Different programmes focusing State institutions, schools, private and the Public sector are being carried out with the objective of increasing the productivity of the whole country, while various programmes are being activated to create human resource to its full potential. The staff of the Ministry can be introduced as the most important factor in activating this programme of work.

Distinctive and standard training is being given to all the Development Officers recruited to the National Productivity Secretariat and the Department of Manpower

and Employment, which function under the Ministry of Productivity Promotion. It is after this training that those Development Officers are assigned to District Secretariats and Divisional Secretariats islandwide. By now, we have assigned Development Officers to all the Districts and Divisional Secretaries' Divisions. Our ultimate objective is to accomplish a valuable and useful Public Service.

At the same time, this Ministry operates as the liaison office of the Asian Productivity Organization, in Sri Lanka . The Asian Productivity Organization has paid special attention to enhance human productivity. In view of this, they annually organize workshops and other scheduled programmes in various countries of the world.

A large number of programmes of productivity promotion will be implemented with the cooperation of the Asian Productivity Organization and its membership countries to achieve the Objective: Productivity for all by the year 2010. This has been viewed by the National Productivity Secretariat, which implements the schedules of productivity promotion. The main programmes projected are as follows: Productivity promotion programmes; Productivity promotion and capacity development; Productivity promotion award competitions and Award ceremonies; Coordinating activities of the Asian Productivity Organization; and Propaganda activities relevant to productivity. Also, productivity promotion programmes relevant to Education, State and private sectors will be implemented.

Productivity promotion programmes in the Education sector will be organized in pre-schools, schools and higher educational institutions. In this regard, attention will be concentrated towards the national target of making Sri Lanka the Centre of Knowledge in Asia under the 10-year programme of the "Mahinda Chintana".

Productivity promotion programmes in 1,547 pre-schools have been activated this year. A Productivity Award Ceremony has been held in the Matara District with the participation of 237 pre-schools and 87 of them have been certified as pre-schools implementing productivity strategies.

The National Productivity Secretariat is implementing these productivity promotion programmes in 1,289 schools islandwide this year. In 2013, the National Productivity Secretariat started a new productivity promotion programme for universities and higher educational institutions.

Productivity promotion programmes have been implemented in 45 higher education institutions this year, and the Ruhuna University participated in the productivity promotion competition and won the productivity award.

The Mahinda Chintana National Development Programme anticipates the creation of Public-Friendly Excellent State Service. The National Productivity Secretariat has given priority, so far, to enhance the productivity of the State sector. By now, a large number of State institutions are on the verge of absorbing the concepts of productivity and are making efforts to enhance their valuable service.

Productivity promotion programmes have already been implemented in Ministries, State Departments, Provincial Ministries and their departments, District Secretariats, Divisional Secretariats and Local Government institutions with the intention of providing an excellent service to the public. The number of productivity promotion programmes held in all ministries in 2014 so far, is 102. The number of programmes held in District Secretariats, Divisional Secretariats and institutions of the State Sector is 1,352. A separate productivity programme was conducted in most of the police stations and by now the productivity concept is functioning in them. A unique programme of productivity promotion is implemented for the Ministry of Justice. The productivity concept is made aware with constructive results among the entire staff of 40 judicial institutions, islandwide.

In view of rectifying the productivity promotional activities of the State sector, the Secretary to the Ministry of Productivity Promotion has held 38 programmes in order to enlighten the Secretaries of Ministries, Chief Secretaries of Provincial Councils, District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries. A special productivity promotional programme was commenced this year in Colleges of Education and Zonal Education Offices.

The leader in the economic development of the country is the private sector. Therefore, the National Productivity Secretariat is conducting programmes for the private sector. The Kaizen concept was commenced in the Gampaha District in 2010 as a pilot project for the purpose of development productivity in the private sector, with small and medium-scale industries. This programme was used in 2013 to develop the small and medium-scale business concerns in the Districts of Matara, Kandy and Kalutara and also in the Gampaha District, as the second stage.

More attention was given to develop the activities in the institution, in addition to the "5S" concept, quality circles and the Green Productivity Programme. From March 2013 to March 2014, the Kaizen management training programme was implemented in these institutions. The National Productivity Secretariat expects to promote Kaizen Projects for small and medium-scale business concerns in all the districts of Sri Lanka in the forthcoming year. Small and medium-scale productivity promotion programmes numbering 371were conducted this year.

In order to establish a fruitful culture in the country, priority has to be given to expand the home-based productivity concept projects. By providing the knowledge productivity concept to the rural folks, we can expect useful attitude development in them, introducing various methods to increase home income, increase the investing capability through savings promotion, and make aware the home units relevant to time management. Citizen productivity programmes numbering 745 have been implemented in the year 2014, and a programme for 165 village level supporters along with 74 village level voluntary organizations are held, based on the membership.

After conducting productivity promotion among various institutions by the National Productivity Secretariat, the National Productivity Award Competition is held to evaluate their performances.

These competitions are held with the participation of schools, State and private sector representation. Institutions numbering 1,376 came forward for this years National Productivity Award Competition and the income earned out of it was Rs. 3 million. Those who won first places in National Productivity Award competition are: R/Seevali Madya Maha Vidyalaya, Ratnapura; R/Higgaswatte Primary School, Kuruwita; Health Department, Central Province; Divisional Secretariat, Batticaloa; Pasbage Korale Divisional Secretariat; and Ukuwela Electric Power House. The Awards Ceremony for the years 2012 and 2013 was held on 4th September, 2014 with the participation of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development and myself, as the Chief Guests at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. The institutions that won the first, second and the third places were conferred with awards.

The 55th workshop took place from 21st to 23rd at the Hilton, Colombo, with the participation of 20 heads of the productivity promotion organizations, which hold membership with the Asian Productivity Promotion Organization. Heads of the Asian Productivity Organization, participated along with those who represented their relevant countries in agriculture and other fields.

The National Green Productivity Conference was held to enhance the production of all services and to reduce waste. This Green Productivity Conference was held for the first time in Sri Lanka on 7th October, 2014, with the participation of about 200 representatives. Two specialists of the Asian Productivity Organization and five local lecturers addressed the Conference. In order to attain a high quality of productivity through exchange of experience and understanding of intellectuals, another Conference was held for the first time at "Sethsiripaya" on 15th November, 2014.

My next brief is with regard to the Department of Manpower and Employment. This Department was established in order to institute a competitive workforce,

through technology and skills development under the vision of the "Mahinda Chintana". This Department was established in 2010, which comprises the following objectives: Implementation of national manpower and employment policy; Creation of employment promotion activities, Activities relevant to professional guidance, collection of labour market information and distribution; and all services rendered by the job bank.

A news item appeared in the online edition of The Nation of 11th September, 2014 which states, I quote:

Massive earthquake may hit Sri Lanka : Study

I am tabling* this news item.

It further states, I quote:

The Dec 26, 2004 Sumatra earthquake resulted in a trans-oceanic tsunami, killing more than 200,000 people.

Sri Lanka, and much of the Indian Ocean, is affected by large tsunamis at highly variable intervals, showed the study on the frequency of past giant earthquakes in the Indian Ocean region.

For the study, the researchers ..."

This study was done by a team of researchers.

"... collected and analysed 22 sediment cores - materials trapped within are scanned to re-construct past ocean conditions - from Karagan Lagoon, Hambantota in south-eastern Sri Lanka, to examine the historical record of giant earthquakes along the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone, where the Indo-Australian plate and Eurasian plate meet.

The lead researcher was Kelly Jackson from the University of Miami in the USA. They have analysed 22 sediment cores for this study. Therefore, we have to understand the fact that we have to live with the nature.

And, Sir, I am tabling* another article titled, "New study reconstructs mega-earthquakes timeline in Indian Ocean" which appeared in the website of "sciencedaily.com."

Sir, monthly, I did a follow-up of the five-year plan. I was a bit ruthless. Yes, officers are willing to work. Do not blame the officers. The politicians have to blame themselves.

But, the people who are cultivating in the Kiran Divisional Secretary's Division and the Chenkalady Divisional Secretary's Division are from Ampara. They are residents of Ampara, not from Mangalagama.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Yes, I have visited those places. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Right, you have visited those places. We also have visited those places and hence we know all the details of

Mangalagama and Gemunupura. - [Interruption.] I know that the Grama Niladhari in Mangalagama is a Tamil person. But, the illicit cultivators are not from Mangalagama, they are from Ampara. My question is that. If they are Mangalagama people, then it is okay. They are not from the Batticaloa District. These illicit cultivators are from the Ampara District. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) We will look into that. Our officials are working on it. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) But, there is pressure exerted on the DFO, Batticaloa from Colombo or somewhere else not to take legal action against them.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) No, that is not so. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) I spoke to the DFO, Batticaloa. Last year, he took immediate action. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Hon. Member, I will tell you this. Can you come to our Consultative Committee Meeting? All the officials will be there. Within the next couple of days, we are going to have our next Consultative Committee Meeting. So, you can come there and we will discuss this matter.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Okay, no problem.

On my request, the Minister of Lands and Land Development had a meeting with me and the District Secretary, Batticaloa. Thereafter, he called for a report from the District Secretary. She has sent a report to the Minister as well as to the Secretary to the Ministry, but nothing has happened so far. That land does not belong to the State. It belongs to your Ministry, to the Forest Department.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That is State land. Lands belonging to the Forest Department are State lands.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) No. That belongs to a ministry or a department, not to the State. If it is a crown land, the GA can take action on it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Once it is gazetted under the Forest Ordinance, nobody can enter that. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Yes, it was gazetted under the Forest Ordinance. Earlier it was a crown land and later you have changed that.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. Please conclude in one minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Sir, I have got 28 minutes. ( ) (The Chairman) You have already taken the time allotted to you and left with only one more minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) No. altogether I have got 28 minutes. ( ) (The Chairman) Yes. You have taken 27 minutes out of the 28 minutes allotted to you. So, only one minute is left.

There is a crowd close to Keviliyaamadu area. They have been colonised illegally by one Buddhist priest. The Divisional Secretary cannot issue identity cards to them because they are from the Ampara District, not from the Batticaloa District.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Anyway, they are from Sri Lanka. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) They are from Sri Lanka, all right. But, they have to have a Land Kachcheri and get land. Before that, they cannot -

[4.57]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, though the Hon. Minister is not in the House, the Hon. Deputy Minister is present and as he said, the "Golden Lady", the Secretary, may also probably be listening to us. Hon. Deputy Minister, you made a statement during the Budget Debate in December, 2012 that the Government had decided, as a policy, to allocate 7 perches of land to any person who needs to build a house. But, this policy has been changed by your Government.

( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara) No, we have not changed it. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) His Excellency the President has stated in the Budget Speech of 2014, that you would build upstair houses. This time again - [Interruption.] That may be your Ministrys policy but the policy of the Ministry of Finance or the policy of the Minister of Finance is different. This is the whole problem. There are some people in your Government who are willing to support the President unconditionally. For them, whether it is upstair houses or no houses, it is not a problem. But, there is a new Deputy Minister. He feels that people need separate houses.

2557 2558

( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara) Hon. Member, with your permission I would like to say that we have started building 50,000 houses. As the first step, we are building 100 houses in the Kalutara District and in Deniyaya. We started it just two weeks back. We are coming even to your district very soon, maybe in two weeks time. So, give me time. I am coming personally to start that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Recently, I had the opportunity to meet your Secretary. Then, she said that you are going to build 200 houses. But, we need 200,000 houses. So, you will take 1,000 years to finish them. This is the state of the housing in the plantation sector.

Anyway, Hon. Deputy Minister, you mentioned in your speech that the replanting subsidy has been increased to Rs. 500,000. That is not correct. It is Rs. 400,000 per hectare, not for an acre. When it comes to plantations, the Ministry of Finance always gets confused. Last year, in the English translation of the Budget Speech, they said that 35,000 hectares of land was available. In Sinhala, they said 35,000 acres of lands were available for taking over. But, that project has now been abandoned, I hear. That is very good, because it is not by taking over lands and giving to outsiders that you should increase productivity. You have a good proposal this time. You have said that you are going to give loans at 6 per cent to the large plantation companies for replanting. That is a very positivemove because in the Nuwara Eliya District, 45 per cent is still to be replanted.

In the Badulla District in the Uva Province, as much as 80 per cent has to be replanted. These companies which are running these estates do not have money. They only can pluck the leaves, sell them and live their lives. They do not have money to invest. So, your giving a loan at 6 per cent interest is a very good move.

In addition to that, I want to make a suggestion on a matter that your Hon. Minister said at the Annual General Meeting of the Ceylon Planters' Society in 2013. He said, "Outgrower Schemes" are the best way to sustain the plantation industry. If you are going to replant all the 45 per cent in the Nuwara Eliya District and the 80 per cent in the Badulla District, the money available will not be sufficient to do that.

So, what I suggest is that the Ministry promotes "Outgrower Schemes" for replanting. You select workers who have at least five years experience in the estates. Give them two acres of land that has to be replanted. Give them the money that you are going to give as loan at 6 per cent. Give them the raw materials, the plants, the pesticides, other inputs and the fertilizer for a period of

three years. Let the worker replant because the companies say that 75 per cent of the cost for replanting is labour cost. Let the worker invest his labour for the purpose of replanting. The balance 25 per cent can come from the capital that you are giving. By that, each family could be given two acres to replant and with that, the industry will resurface, grow again.

This morning it was told that 75 per cent of the tea is produced by smallholders and only 25 per cent is produced by large companies. The smallholders are getting a yield of up to 2,300 kilograms per hectare, whereas these plantation companies are getting only an average 1,200 kilograms per hectare. That is because they have not replanted. So, if you do not replant, the industry will die. The industry has to be sustained for the future of this country, not because my people are working in the plantations.

Even today, the plantations are giving this country a large foreign exchange earning, which is totally indigenous whereas for export of garments, which is number one, you have to import 75 per cent of the inputs. Here, it is grown on our land by our people. So, this is the industry that has to be supported. If you do not replant, in another 10 to 15 years we will not have tea plantations in the up-country; you will have tea plantations only in the low-country, because in the low-country, the individuals who own lands have replanted. They are getting high yields and they are getting better prices also. So, a similar operation has to take place in the plantations in the up-country.

Recently, the Ceylon Planters' Association has issued a statement asking the workers to produce two kilograms more per day.

( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara) Through the Divi Neguma programme, we have already started that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, Hon. Deputy Minister, you are doing that for those who have individual lands, who are planting tea themselves. What I am saying is for the plantation companies, the large-scale industries. You yourself find that these plantation companies are not performing. Because of that, last year you gave them a warning and said, six months . One year has gone. Now, you are giving another six months for them to perform.

( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara) There has been a big improvement with that warning.

2559 2560

2014 18

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If they do not improve, you must stop it; you must take action. Instead of that, you have offered them a better deal. You are offering them loans at 6 per cent interest. - [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Minister, I am not criticizing. I am only trying to give constructive criticism for the betterment of the industry as a whole. So, replanting is vital.

Involve the worker as a partner. Let him invest his labour; you give the inputs. Then, definitely productivity will increase. I suggest, Hon. Minister, that you go forward with this.

In addition to this, the tea industry is generating over Rs. 6 billion as cess. Out of this cess, at least a certain percentage must be spent on workers' welfare, which is not being done. Today, the plantation companies do not have money to invest on roads, water supply or housing. They do not do any housing at all, but they issue statements that they have built 25,000 houses during the last 20 years. All those 25,000 houses were built with Government money, not by the companies. Now, they are asking the workers to give two kilograms more per day while they pluck. By giving two more kilograms, they will lose Rs. 40, which they would otherwise earn on "over kilograms". So, these companies, which are not looking after the plantations and are exploiting the worker, are asking him to give Rs. 40 back to them by plucking two more kilograms everyday. This is not the way to do it. They must increase productivity. Then, automatically, profits will increase. The workers should also enjoy a share of that profit. He is willing to participate in reviving this industry, which will die in a few years if we do not do that.

Then, I would like to raise another issue, which actually is for the attention of the Hon. Minister for Social Services. Hon. Minister, in the plantations, these workers work throughout their life. They have worked in these plantations for six generations. You just go and see what they own in a house. The house is still owned by the company; it was built by the suddhas 150 years ago. These companies have not built any new houses. Twenty five thousand houses have been built by the Government since 1995. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga created the first Ministry for Estate Housing. Since then, 25,000 houses have been built. But, you go into a line room and see. The total assets they have is worth less than Rs. 50,000. In the hall, they will have a small cabinet with some glasses in it, a small TV on top of that and a few chairs to sit. In the second room, you will find a bed or two. Then in the kitchen, you will see aluminum utensils. That is all. After six generations, what have these people earned? What have they saved? Just Rs. 50,000! Today, our people go to the Middle East, work there for two to four years and come back with Rs.

600,000 to Rs. 800,000 to build a house. But, these people do not have land; they do not have a house; they still live in line rooms. So, building houses for them is for the Minister of Plantation Industries.

After that, at the age of 55 or 58, they retire. Because of the hard work, they cannot work till 60 years though they are allowed to go on till 60. So, they retire. Then, they get their EPF. That is the only saving they have. When they get that, their children are grown up. They have to get them married. The son wants a job. He cannot get jobs outside the plantation because his education is poor. So, he asks for a three-wheeler and they buy him one. Then, the money is exhausted. After that, they live at the mercy of their children.

You have proposed to increase the allowance given to the senior citizens from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000. It is very appropriate. But, this is not reaching the people in the plantations. Whoever has to give it to them is not doing it and our people are also not organized enough. Hon. Minister for Social Services, you can ask your good Friend, for whom you have mobile services in the Nuwara Eliya District, the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan, whether it is true or false. So, please create a system for your officials to go into the estates also.

Identify these people who are living a very difficult life at the mercy of their children and provide this allowance to them. If their parents get Rs. 2,000, these children will look after them like kings and queens. This is something, Hon. Minister, for which I appeal to you. You are a very kind person who has been helping the people in the plantations. I have heard about it. You had come and held so many social service camps there to help our people. So, please see that this allowance reaches those people also. That is a request from me.

I want to say a few words about disaster management also. The Minister of Disaster Management is not here. The Hon. Minister cannot just help people who meet with disasters only during the short period when that incident is still in our memory. They have to be given long-term assistance. If we take the landslide at Koslanda in Haldummulla, those people have lost their homes. The Minister can give only Rs. 100,000 to rebuild a totally destroyed house. But, that is not enough. The plantation company says that they showed some lands. Showing lands is not enough. Houses have to be built there. To build the houses, the Government has to allow more than Rs. 100,000 to be spent on a house. The Minister has the heart to do it, but funds are not available. So, the Minister should put up a proposal to the Government that whoever is affected by natural disasters must be given sufficient funds to build a whole new house. If there is a likelihood of somebody losing a house, he should not only be given a land, but also a house.

In the process of resettlement in the North and the East, they did not give houses to those people. They just took them and put them back in their villages. The Hon. Minister agrees that they did not build houses. They put

2561 2562

them back in their villages and gave each family Rs. 70,000 to rebuild their lives. Fortunately, the people in the North have relatives and friends abroad, who had sent them money to build their houses. The Government of India is building 45,000 houses in the North and the East. Other than that, what is the scheme of the Government for rebuilding houses for those who have been resettled in the North and the East? I asked the Hon. Minister at the Consultative Committee about this. He told me, Yes, we do not have funds. That part is done by the Presidential Task Force, not by this Ministry. This Hon. Minister has a heart. - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. Minister?
