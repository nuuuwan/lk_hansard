, , , , , , , . [4.11 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees for giving me this opportunity to speak on two issues that have come up today: Institute of Fundamental Studies, Sri

499 500

Lanka (Amendment) Bill - which has now been renamed as the National Institute of Fundamental Studies - and also on the Regulations under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007, and the Societies Ordinance No. 16 of 1891 (Chapter 123).

Sir, I first wish to take up the issues connected with the Registrar of Companies. The Registrar of Companies is dealing with business people in Sri Lanka, and especially incorporated companies are functioning in the English language. So, they deal with the Registrar of Companies in English. They submit Memoranda, Articles of Association and other documents to the Registrar of Companies in English but the staff in the department, except the Registrar of Companies and down to the Assistant Registrars-General, all other officers are not fully competent in the English language and because of that, when companies file documents or secretaries to companies file documents, there is a long delay in the decision-making process within the Department of the Registrar of Companies. This has to be attended to. Maybe, today, there is a shortage of people who can deal with issues in the English language but the Registrar of Companies being a very important person in the functioning of trade and industry in this country where most business is done in the English language, it is important that the Registrar of Companies be equipped to work in the English language. So, selection of staff should be done in such a manner that services are provided in an efficient and quick manner to the investors and business people in this country. Maybe if you recruit from the general pool of clerical officers or management assistants in the country you may not find the necessary people. It may become necessary for the Registrar of Companies to recruit persons directly, who are competent in the English language, so that he can provide his services in a more efficient and quick manner to the business community.

Further, I am told by some of the secretaries who function for these companies that there are long delays, not at the stage of incorporation but subsequently, whenever a company needs to obtain certain documents. Even foreigners come to Sri Lanka, incorporate companies and they function here as local businesses. When that happens they expect the services to be provided quickly and efficiently like in their own countries. So, when they find that it takes three to four weeks to get a certified copy of Form 18 or other documents, then they become disappointed. Their activities are stifled; their progress is hurdled. So, all these have to be looked into because the Department of Registrar of Companies is a very important institution and should provide services in a quick manner. All this is because even today in this modern age, with a separate brand new building built about ten years ago called Samagam Medura being available to the Registrar of Companies, its filing systems are such that at least one

week is required for searching of documents and sometimes if the document or the file is not found, then more than three or four weeks are taken to issue a certified copy of a simple document that has been filed in that department. Today, we are in a modern world; we are in the 21st Century. We say that we are becoming more and more computer literate. We are talking about e-government. But, a vital department like the Department of Registrar of Companies is still relying on files, which are maintained in the old manner where they are kept in a record room; somebody has to search for the file, find it, look for the document and then issue the certified copies.

In foreign countries, once you file a document, it is entered into the computer and the businessman, whenever he requires a document of this nature, can go online and get an authenticated copy, which he can present to a bank or other institution for proceeding with his business. But, in Sri Lanka, certified documents are issued by manually searching for files in the record room. This is a very sad state of affairs when we say that we are moving towards the so-called Miracle of Asia. A Miracle of Asia cannot still follow a way of working in the 19th or the 20th Century and expect businessmen and investors to come to this country or even a local investor to invest in large amounts in this country when he is hurdled by the functioning of that very vital department. So, I would like to say that this Government, which spends so much of money on trivial things, is not looking after a vital institution that has existed for many decades and is still functioning in the same way as it did many decades ago. So, this has to change.

While talking about companies, my Colleague, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, spoke about our economy and said that though the Government talks about reduction in poverty and high growth, it is not reflected in the day-to-day life of the people.

I also wish to take up an issue in the realm of finance in this country. We all know that during the last three or four years, all banks and finance companies have jumped into the business of pawning. During the period that the banks and the finance companies came into pawning, they were competing with each other so much that they were offering lower interest rates and higher advances. They advertised rates of advances which were almost 90 per cent of the value of gold when they were competing with each other.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, give me another two or three minutes because many speakers on our side are not in the House.

501 502

[ . ]

2014 11

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Today, we find that the gold prices have crashed and because of that, the banks and the financial institutions which are competing with the traditional pawnbrokering business people are forcing the borrowers to redeem their jewellery, or to reduce the advance they have given or provide them repayment plans to redeem their jewellery because if the institution auctions the gold, they would not recover the capital sometimes, or the capital and the interest, in most cases. The Peoples Bank had to write off billions of rupees as losses because they were the largest bank in the pawning industry with up to 39 per cent of their total lending being for pawning.

Now, that pawning has crashed and all banks and other financial institutions, except for the traditional pawnbrokers, are withdrawing from the pawning industry; they all are jumping into a new business called leasing. We see banks advertising for harena kota leasing" and some others saying "pat pat gala leasing". So, leasing is the competitive lending business today. In pawning, the collateral, the gold, is kept in the vault of the bank itself. In leasing, the asset on which money is lent is registered in the name of the lender and there are provisions to seize the asset as soon as a default occurs. So, under these circumstances, the bankers are thinking of moving into the other industry, the leasing industry, in a big way competing with each other. But, in case the prices of vehicles drop due to a policy change of the Government, which may or can reduce duties drastically at any time - two-thirds of the value of vehicles today consist of taxes and duties that are paid - then, immediately these loans given become vulnerable. So, is it prudent to move from pawning to leasing? Is it the right way? We have to think.

The reason that the banks and financial institutions are moving from pawning to leasing is that the economy is so sluggish that there is no opportunity to lend safely to business or industry in this country. So, the talk about the booming economy or the growing economy is all false and is only in falsified figures and not in real terms, as my Colleague, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa also mentioned in this House. Thank you. [.. 4.25] ( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) !

Sri Lanka displays a very low level of national R&D investment as a proportion of GDP - a characteristic that has not changed over time. The number of R&D scientists have also decreased over time.

Indeed, the Budget 2012 notes that Sri Lankas universities as well as research and technology institutes have around 4,000 researchers at present. This number should be increased to about 20,000 by the year 2020.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is my privilege over and over again these days to address the House when you are presiding.

I think you, as an MP, who is representing the North, must also be happy because I always espouse the cause of the people of the North, especially the fishermen, who are being harassed and taken into custody in Tamil Nadu. Today, Sir, I should initially express my happiness over the initiative taken by the Hon. (Prof) G.L. Peiris, the Minister of External Affairs, who has met even the Chief Minister of Hyderabad, Mr. Chandrababu Naidu, and he got the release of the fishermen who were incarcerated in the Indian prisons. Today, Sir, Parliament is called upon to give approval for passing the Institute of Fundamental Studies, Sri Lanka (Amendment) Bill, ably moved by our Friend, the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka. Also, there are other Regulations made under the Companies Act and the Societies Ordinance, moved by the Minister of Industries and Commerce, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen. Sir, we give approval for passing these Regulations and for amending the Bill. This is what is stated under Regulations made under the Companies Act and the Societies Ordinance which I quote:

That the Regulations made by the Minister of Industries and Commerce under Section 527 read with Section 477 and 157(5) of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 and Section 19 of the Societies

513 514

[ ]

2014 11

Ordinance No. 16 of 1891 (Chapter 123) read with the Societies Ordinance (Amendment) Act No. 11 of 2005 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1841/8 of 18th of December 2013 and Gazette Extraordinary No. 1847/2 of 27th of January 2014, which were presented on 05.06.2014, be approved.

Today, Sir, I must also say at the start itself that the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ranks one of the greats in the Ministry of Industries and Commerce in this country. Going through the history a little bit, I find, Sir, that great people have occupied the chair of the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, sometimes together with Shipping. In the first Cabinet of the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, there was a great Tamil gentleman whom we respect even today, the Hon. Peri Sundaram, who held that very important portfolio. Then, Sir, there were the Hon. D.C.R. Gunawardana, the Hon. Shirley Corea and people of the callibre of the Hon. T.B. Ilangaratne, the Hon. Hugh Fernando, the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali, the Hon. Abdul Razack Munsoor, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon. Kingsley T. Wickremaratne, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem - presently the Minister of Justice - who held the portfolio of Minister of International Trade and Commerce, and also the portfolio of Muslim Affairs and Shipping Development, and the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle who fell a victim to the LTTE assassin. We cannot forget that the LTTE infiltrated even into the Sinhalese areas those days. This must be told to the international community. Navi Pillay and Callum Macrae of Channel 4 should know that the LTTE infiltrated into the Sinhalese areas and killed our leaders. It was a very serious situation. It is out of that situation His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to redeem the country and take it into the road of progress. We should feel happy about that but instead of that, there are forces still working amidst - the internal conspirators - who work hand-in-glove with international conspirators backed by the diaspora and the so-called Western powers. They are talking of expanding trade across the Atlantic, Pacific and the Indian Oceans. What is America doing today? The same America that is sermonizing the world over about peace, about a warless world, is breaking human rights all over the world every minute. I need not recapture all the details at this moment. So, is with Britain. Guantanamo Prison is a black mark in the history of the American State. Even today, people are tortured and suffering in this prison.

Talking about trade, all the industries were destroyed in Palestine. See what is happening to Palestine. Even today it is being bifurcated, bifurcated and bifurcated. Sir, Palestinian small children - the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena knows - are very beautiful and cute ones. Our mothers want them to adopt; our mothers are saying, Get us some children, we will adopt them.

They went into the land of civilization of great Mesopotamia; the present Iraq which was also known in history as Babylonia. They went in and destroyed the whole country. They are going to create three different

states; one against the other: Shias against the Sunnis, Sunnis against the Shias and there again Kurdish. It was Saddam Hussein who was able to hold all the divisions together and ran a very successful regime.

Then, again what happened in Libya? Trade and commerce was destroyed in Libya. The man who was ruling Libya was Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. What is happening in Syria today? Disasters all over. These are very serious matters to which the Hon. Yogarajan should address his mind.

Today, we are on the upward leap in the industrial sector. It was only yesterday that the historic Sri Lanka-Belarus Economic Pact was signed. That is a country we did not know earlier until our President visited Belarus. The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen was privileged and lucky enough to sign those trade agreements with Belarus. This is the progress that we are making to develop this country.

, , , the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen is endeavouring his best to promote trade - as small he is and new as he is - to the Ministry and even to Parliament. We wish him well because he is carrying out the great vision of industrial development as envisaged in the "Mahinda Chintana". If you wish, you can read page 53 of the "Mahinda Chintana" which is about Industrial Development.
