Therefore, in this respect, even the authority on Parliamentary Procedure and Practices, Erskine May, is also very clear. I would only recommend to the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake to read the book of Erskine May, if he can obtain a Sinhala version.

Sir, the other matter is that he was slinging mud at them. Also, he has violated Standing Order No. 78 by referring to the -

High Posts Committee . . . . .

Sir, I would like to state that we have signed agreements with several countries, as well as opened up Missions in some of the countries to strengthen diplomatic relations. There may have been some appointments made which do not yield expected results.We are prepared to call them back, and if there are people who are performing well, we will extend their services. That is the how it works.

181 182

2014 06

. ; ; . . . . . .

I would like to mention about the opening of Missions. We have opened Missions in Uganda, in many South African countries and in the Seychelles. In the Seychelles, we have opened a bank as well. Recognizing Nigerias emergence in the economic field in the West African region, we have signed many agreements.

There have been several bilateral visits by Heads of States. The highest number of visits have been made by our President to many countries in the world after the late Prime Minister, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike. I do not think that either any Head of State has visited so many countries after Mrs. Bandaranaike or have so many Heads of States visited Sri Lanka. Regarding bilateral visits, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited Seychelles, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. He has met several Heads of States and Governments at international events.

In 2013, His Excellency the President visited Uganda on the invitation of His Excellency Museveni, President of Uganda. He also visited Tanzania in 2013 on the invitation of His Excellency Jakaya, President of Tanzania. His Excellency the President not only visited these countries but we have also signed so many agreements with them. I have to state that there are several Sri Lankan businessmen who are enjoying benefits and doing business in those countries in the African Continent because of the agreements we have signed. Several agreements have been signed with the countries we have visited. Sri Lanka has started diplomatic relations with those countries. His Excellency the President visited Kenya in December 2013. Then, again he visited South Africa in December 2013. He also visited the Seychelles in 2014. The Deputy President of South Africa visited Sri Lanka. These are the inward visits of Heads or Deputy Heads of States. The Tanzanian Foreign Minister visited Sri Lanka.

Then, there are the proposed visits of the Heads of States of Kenya, Burkina Faso and Senegal during the year 2014. There are many agreements that are being handled and our Mission staff is doing their best towards making those workable. I must also state that the Consular Section of our Ministry, unlike in any other Ministry, starts work at 6.00 oclock in the morning. By 6.00 or 6.30 a.m, we open office unlike during the time of my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

Our officers in the Consular Affairs Division have earned over Rs.100 million as compensation for the last

six months in this year. This is the highest amount recorded so far as compensation paid to the workers mainly in the Middle East. There have been several political consultations made by our staff in the Missions and many bilateral political issues and other issues have been resolved.

Sir, there are many countries in the African Continent, nearly one-third, who are in the UNHCR. We have to continue supporting them. We will get benefits through this because this is an emerging region in the world where there are so many opportunities for Sri Lankans to invest.

Several repatriation agreements have been signed with many countries to help our people when they face issues due to the laws prevailing in those countries. Then, there were several incidents, such as a vessels being hijacked by Somali pirates. We have been able to get the assistance of those countries to get many of our people back to Sri Lanka. All these have been done by the Ministry of External Affairs.

We have also been able to get a lot of pardons for Sri Lankans facing death sentences in foreign countries. These were coordinated by our officials who are working tirelessly in those countries as well as in Sri Lanka.

Further, Prisoner Transfer Agreements have been signed with many countries. Many MoUs and multilateral agreements have been signed with several countries in the UAE as well as the European Union.

If I am to talk about East Asia, we are very soon going to sign an FTA with China for the benefit of our manufacturers as well as exporters. So, they will benefit from the Free Trade Agreement. The ASEAN countries were the only countries that were benefiting from the Free Trade Agreement. Due to shipping routes being located close to Sri Lanka, we will be able to supply the Chinese market better than the ASEAN countries and vice versa.

As far as the current position with regard to agreements is concerned, 31 investment promotion and production agreements and 55 air service agreements have been signed. Continental shelf agreements have been submitted on time and because of that, we have got the land on the continental shelf which we would have lost if not for the efficient work of our Ministry officials.

Many extradition agreements, mutual legal agreements and double taxation agreements have been signed; altogether 48 agreements have been signed since 2005. We have not had so many agreements for the last 50 years prior to 2005.

Many Readmission Agreements have been signed; I do not want to go into details. It is all available here. I must state that we are happy with the current agreements that we have entered into and the output of our officers.

183 184

Our officers are faced with a heavy workload but they are doing their utmost. Also, officers who have been appointed to countries like Japan and Australia - not from the Foreign Service - from the Forces, are doing a very good job. They bring credit to the country as well as expose Sri Lanka to benefit from financial sources.

I would like to mention further about the inward State visits since 2005 for your information - these are good indicators to show that our foreign policy is good and accepted - from Egypt, we had a visit from Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, His Excellecy Ahmed Amin Fathallah; from Nigeria, we had the current President Goodluck Jonathans visit; from Kenya, we had a visit from Hon. Amina Mohamed, Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; from Malawi, we had the Vice-President's visit and we also had a visit from Ugandan President, Yoweri Kagurta Museveni. These are plus points for Sri Lanka because many of these people have not visited here prior to 2005 due to the political unrest and also the war that had been prevailing in this country.

Further, we had a high-level visit from Burkina Faso, Ghana and Rwanda. Then, Foreign Ministers of Sierra Leone, Tanzania, South Africa, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia, the Seychelles, Mauritius and many other countries visited Sri Lanka during this time.

So, I would like to just mention that we are satisfied with the work of the Ministry of External Affairs, under the leadership of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, and also the work done by our present Secretary, Mrs. Kshenuka Seneviratne. There are some people who are jealous because the Ministry of External Affairs is doing better than what it had been doing before. I would also like to mention that the officers in the Consular Affairs Division are working tirelessly to help the people who are working abroad. We have a large number of Sri Lankans working abroad who bring foreign exchange to the country and all of them have been looked after by our Ambassadors and the staff in other countries as well.

It is true we have not given the best of conditions to our Ambassadors. Sometimes, vehicles are not in good order and houses are not replaced with new furniture. But, we are thankful for their services despite the conditions that they are working in. We must remember that it is only within three or four years since the end of the armed-conflict in this country that a Resolution was brought against Sri Lanka. If the war had continued, a resolution could not have been brought against Sri Lanka. We are doing our utmost and the officers are working hard to bring a solution within Sri Lanka for the benefit of all the people in this country as well as the Sri Lankans who are living abroad. Thank you.

[2.51 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for the opportunity given to speak on the Adjournment Motion on the performance, or rather the non-performance of the Ministry of External Affairs.

If the Mover of the Motion sounded like he was reading out a family tree, the Hon. Deputy Minister who preceded me sounded very much like an air traffic controller, talking about who came and who went, and he has placed in this House as a record, the performance of the Ministry of External Affairs. We are happy to note that more than 90 per cent of all these comings and goings have been from the Continent of Africa. I believe the Hon. Deputy Minister is an ardent safari fan himself and perhaps that explains his interest in Africa.

But, the issues that confront the country are more serious than that. The Hon. Deputy Minister referred, just before he concluded, to the Resolution concerning Sri Lanka. Although he termed it, "Resolution against Sri Lanka", it is a Resolution for promoting accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. He forgets that as soon as the war was over, that same Council actually congratulated Sri Lanka for concluding the war. So, he is wrong in saying that the present Resolution is only because Sri Lanka concluded the war and if the war had been ongoing today, that there would not have been a Resolution. He is totally cocksure. But, in 2010, the United Nations Human Rights Council congratulated Sri Lanka. But, when Sri Lanka did not keep to the promises given even at that Special Session and thereafter to the Secretary-General of the UN, to various world leaders that there would be a proper inquiry conducted within the country, it was after several years, - in fact, five years after the conclusion of the war - that an international investigation came about. After that Resolution was passed, still, you dragged your feet and then suddenly you have been involved in a frenetic activity last month. You have suddenly caused or you are trying to show that there is an international element that you are bringing into a local inquiry. A local inquiry, which in itself was too little, too late and only with regard to disappearances, has suddenly been given an enlarged mandate and then, three international personalities have been invited to advise, if advice is sought by the Commission. In that expanded mandate, you have referred to proportionality, distinction and collateral damage, all terms used in international law.

I wish to draw your attention not to the situation here, but to the situation that is happening right now elsewhere in the world, in Gaza, a parallel situation where these very principles of proportionality, distinction and collateral damage have become very important. Daily,

185 186

[ ]

2014 06

many civilian lives are being lost there and our Ministry of External Affairs remains mute. The Ministry of External Affairs here remains mute because of your own position, the position you have taken with regard to the situation in Sri Lanka. The civilians in Gaza are being shelled; children are dying there. The other day, I saw a news item of a high school, where, when results were being announced, the student who had got the highest was already dead; several children have died. And, you, who say that you are a friend of the Palestinian people, are keeping quiet. You are not able to stand up and state your position with regard to that huge humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding there. What is the value of your friendship? I want to be very clear here and not be misunderstood. I am not saying that Israel does not have a right to exist as a nation; I think they have a right to exist as a nation. But, at the same time, the Palestinian people also have a right to have a State of their own and Gaza being an occupied territory, the people in that region have a right to resist the armed aggression of Israel into that territory. That is a very clear and simple articulation of the principal position with regard to Gaza. Why is the Sri Lankan Ministry of External Affairs unable to even say that? What had your Ambassador in Israel, Air Chief Marshal Donald Perera, said? He was the Ambassador in 2010 and this is what he said with regard to Gaza. When the food flotilla was bombed, he justified it. Horrendous performance by your Ambassador in Israel! When your own Palitha Kohona was being appointed the Chairman of the Investigative Committee by the UN into that incident, the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Israel said this: Sri Lanka is a staunch supporter of Israels fight against terror. Israel was moved onto the military phase with full force. You should fight relentlessly until all the terror hubs are destroyed in Gaza. That was your authenticated Ambassador in Israel in 2010.

Not only in 2010, what did you do just last month? There was a tweet on the 17th of July, 2014 at 1620 hours and this is what it stated: "Sri Lanka calls upon Israeli and Palestinian leaders to display restraint and avoid civilian casualities with political courage to come for peace talks. You said avoid civilian casualties. Then, at 2013 hours, you corrected the tweet and signed off as "Ministry of External Affairs". It says, Correction - Violence in Gaza, Sri Lanka calls upon parties to engage at the earliest in direct dialogue, which is the only viable initiative for sustained peace...." You dropped that part about avoiding civilian casualties. Why? Suddenly you realized, Oh! How can we throw stones sitting in a glass house? So, you changed your tweet, but both tweets are recorded. One is there, calling on parties to avoid civilian casualties and the next one says Correction, in which you dropped your plea to avoid civilian casualties.

This is what happens when you do not have a principal position. When you do not act with principles in your own country, you are hamstrung; you do not have a voice; you do not have a credible voice; you do not have a

voice that the world will respect. So, how can you? They will call you a hypocrite; indeed, you are a hypocrite. That is why you yourself realized that and changed your tweets because you yourself realized, "How can we call upon those leaders to avoid civilian casualties when we have not done that?"

Now, suddenly, you wake up and want legal interpretation for "proportionality", "distinction" and "collateral damage". What is happening in Gaza? Is it proportional? Is there a justification for the nation of Israel to go to war, to use armed aggression on the people of Palestine? Is it justified? Is the force used proportional to any perceived threat that that country is facing? Even if it faces some threat, even if it justifiably perceives a threat, is it proportional? Is there a distinction as to who is a "civilian" and which is a "military target" in Gaza at the moment? Absolutely indiscriminate, and you keep mum; you are mute. All of the principles are being breached there and you do not have the moral courage to say a word.

Our position is that there are crimes being committed in Gaza. There are allegations that both sides are committing crimes. Both must be investigated. There must be an international investigation into Israel's armed aggression into the occupied territory of Palestine in Gaza; that must be done. Also, the accusation that Hamas is acting as a terrorist and harming civilians must be investigated. When you have serious allegations like that, both must be investigated. One may be totally disproportionate, but that does not absolve the other. A similar situation exists here. Both sides must be investigated, is our position. We are able to tell you today that with regard to Gaza and with regard to Sri Lanka, our position remains the same: violations of international law by whoever it is committed must be investigated and responsible parties must be made accountable to it.

What have you done with regard to India? Reference was made to that. It is not just your embarrassing tweet and the correction you make to it, further exposing yourself. What have you done with regard to the website of the Ministry of Defence? This website - this is not the first time it has done this - is known for publications like this. Your defence is worse than your offence. You apologize and say that that was published without proper authorization. Can anything be published in the official website of the Ministry of Defence without authorization? Is that what you are saying? Is that your defence? You say "unconditional apology" and then, you proffer an explanation that somebody has sneaked it in, that somebody has sneaked in a depiction, a cartoon, a story that is of the lowest quality. Are you not ashamed, Hon. Minister of External Affairs, that you are the Minister of External Affairs at a time like this when a great neighbour is being slandered like that, when the new Prime Minister of that country is being depicted like that and the closest State of that country to Sri Lanka and its Chief Minister

187 188

are being depicted like that in the official website of the Ministry of Defence of this country? We know who the Minister of that Ministry is. Are you not ashamed? There is uproar in the Indian Parliament today. What would you have to say today? Your Envoy is being summoned.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Can I answer to that, please? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, what is it? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Are you expecting the international community to do an international investigation on Gaza and Israel. Can you expect that?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Have I not made it clear to you in my speech? Where were you? You were talking to somebody else.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I was talking, but - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I made my position very clear that when international law is being violated, there must be an international investigation. - [Interruption.] I can only state my position. - [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Minister, you do not need me to speculate on what will happen and what will not happen. I have stated my position very clearly and that is a position of principle. - [Interruption.] That is the same principal position we take as with regard to Sri Lanka, as with regard to Gaza or anywhere else in the world. If there are serious violations of international law and there are serious allegations that crimes have been committed, international investigations must happen against all parties against whom there are allegations. That is our principal position.

The charge that I am making to you, which you are unable to answer - I wish that your Minister will even attempt to answer at the end of this Debate - is, what is your position with regard to Gaza? Why are you not able to say a word about Gaza today? Why are you speaking

with a forked tongue? Why was a tweet sent saying "avoid civilian casualties" and then a correction made? When you make a correction and take out the words "avoid civilian casualties", what are you saying? You are saying, Do not mind civilian casualties. We made a mistake in the first tweet, we do not care about civilian casualties". Is that not what your Ministry has said? It is signed off as "Ministry of External Affairs". You asked for my response and you have it now. Are you able to counter that?

How can you take the position that civilians can be killed in Gaza? That is the position that you have taken by correcting your own tweet. What have you said when you put on your official website -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I asked about the international investigation. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Even before you asked me I have told you our position.- [Interruption.] How many times do you want me to tell you? - [Interruption.] I am not one - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Sumanthiran, you have only one more minute.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude, Sir. Hon. Deputy Minister, you are also a lawyer.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) No, I am not. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Your are not? Oh! I am sorry.- [Interruption.] I am sorry. I thought you are. I meant no offence. I would not want to speculate on whether one inquiry is going to be proper or not. It is same with regard to what you have done here, inviting so-called international experts and so on. We will not pronounce on that. We will wait and see. We are not about to speculate on anything. But, the principles must be very clear and that I have made very plain and clear and I expect that your Minister will make his position clear. Thank you.

[3.28 p.m] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, as the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella seconding this Motion said a while ago, the United National Party has consistently maintained that the opening of the floodgates of international scrutiny can be avoided only by an independent and credible local investigation to look into the serious allegations of violations of human rights and humanitarian laws against the Rajapaksa Regime. In fact, when the Government sponsored a Motion against the international investigation initiated by the UNHRC on the 18th of June, - that was last month - moving an amendment to that, I said - I actually quote myself - Mr.Speaker, rejecting an international investigation can only be done acceptably if there is a credible local mechanism and along with it I proposed on behalf of the Party that the Government fully implements the recommendations of the LLRC Report; revive the provisions of the Seventeenth Amendment and to integrate the Latimer Principles as an integral part of the Constitution and make provisions for the early passage of the Freedom of Information Act in order to restore the credibility our democratic institutions lack today. As customary, Sir, you would remember, this amendment was greeted by a cacophony of catcalls and we, in the Opposition, as usual, were called traitors along with some choice Sinhala words by some of the Honourable Members of the Government benches, who I suspect would feel more at home sitting in the front rows of a cinema watching a Bollywood film rather than sitting in this august Assembly. The rowdy behaviour is still ringing in my mind.

However, exactly a month later, on the 17th of July, - last month - when President Rajapaksa issued a Proclamation announcing the launch of a domestic

investigation into alleged war crimes and conduct of his armed forces in the final days of the war, actually I must say my initial response was, "Perhaps sanity had prevailed at last". That was my initial response. Sir Desmond De Silva, Queens Counsel, Sir Geoffrey Nice, Queens Counsel and Dr. David Michael Crane were appointed as advisers to the local commission investigating "allegations of war crimes by all parties to the conflict. In fact, a regime which categorically rejected up till then all accusations of human rights violations during the war, now seeking the expertise of three of the worlds top war crimes prosecutors were interpreted by some as a 180 degree U-turn to mend its earlier ways, which was good - if someone accepts they have been wrong even at a later stage, that is a good thing - and to rebuild its relationship with the intentional community for the sake of the greater good of the country. In fact, the question everyone asked on the 18th of July was: Why has the Sri Lankan Government, which vehemently opposed the process of international justice picked three prosecutors with a history of indicting former Presidents and political regimes on war crimes charges in the Hague? I mean, they have a history of indicting Heads of States on behalf of the War Crimes Tribunal. However, on closer examination of the credentials of these advisers, it is obvious that the motives of the Government may not be as pristine and altruistic as it may seem at first glance.

. .

In fact, the role of Sir Desmond de Silva, Queens Counsel, as an apologist for the excesses of the Rajapaksa Regime during the last days of the war, is already well-documented. So, I am not going into too much detail; it has been written in detail. We know that at a dinner organized by the Association of Professionals of Sri Lankan Origin held in April 2012 at the Grange City Hotel, Tower Hill, London, to coincide with the Annual General Meeting, Sir Desmond de Silva who was the Guest Speaker, actually justified the killing of 40,000 Tamil civilians. He had said that the killing of 40,000 Tamil civilians by the Sri Lankan security forces in order to liberate 300,000 Tamils held by the LTTE, cannot be called a war crime. So, that is his opinion. But, that makes him a bias party in a very sensitive issue like this. But, what is not known is, Sir Desmond de Silva has also been accused of whitewashing not only the Sri Lankan Government but even the British Government, especially over one of the most controversial killings in Northern Ireland, the murder of Patrick Finucane in 1989. He was killed by a loyalist gunmen and the British Government actually appointed a one-man commission under Sir Desmond de Silva to look into this matter and according to an article in "The Guardian newspaper published in London, his wife, Geraldine Finucane denounced the

195 196

Report by Sir Desmond de Silva on the assassination of her husband and called Sir Desmond de Silvas Report, Report of the Patrick Finucane Review - that is the name the of the report which was presented to the British Parliament in 2012 - a sham and a whitewash. I will table* that article.

According to the The Guardian of 12th December, 2012, she is quoted as saying - this is very interesting - I quote:

Its a report into which we have had no input, she said. The British government has engineered a suppression of the truth behind the murder of my husband. At every turn it is clear that this report has done exactly what was required - to give the benefit of the doubt to the state, its cabinet and ministers, to the army, to the intelligence services and to itself.

At every turn, dead witnesses have been blamed and defunct agencies found wanting. Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused. 'The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others.'"

I am still quoting Mrs. Finucane. She states:

" 'This report is a sham, this report is a whitewash, this report is a

confidence trick dressed up as independent scrutiny and given invisible clothes of reliability. But most of all, most hurtful and insulting of all, this report is not the truth.' "

So, despite the stature we expected from him, when you go deeper into it, this honourable gentleman, this Knight of Queen Elizabeth II, has been accused before in his own country of whitewashing the government of the day and of hiding the truth. I would like to table* this article published in "The Guardian" newspaper of London dated 12th December, 2012.

Of course, I would say the lesser-known backgrounds of the other two advisers were also important in understanding the real motives of the Presidential Proclamation. So, Geoffrey Nice, QC, a Professor of Law at Gresham College is an expert on head of state immunity. .

This is what is very important. I do not know whether it was mentioned before. According to reports which he himself has admitted, he was contacted by Libyas Muammar Gaddafi in the last days of his reign when he was referred to the International Criminal Court and he did not get a chance to represent Gaddafi, because

Gaddafi was killed before anything could be done.

According to the "Daily FT" dated 24th July, 2014, he presented an application to the Court concerning the violation of Saif Gaddafis human rights, the son of Gaddafi who is now being held by, I believe, certain rebels in one part of the country and this is the man who was chosen by the Gaddafi family to protect the dictator and the dictators sons and all these details are given here in detail.

Sir, how much more time have I got? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have only two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Of course, the background of the second expert, Dr. David Michael Crane, is even more interesting because this gentleman was actually criticized in 2010 after he allegedly played down the violence and the regimes role in Guinea in the incident where over 100 odd opposition supporters were killed in a sports stadium in Guinea. Dr. Crane was one of the two war crimes specialists who was hired by the President Moussa Dadis Camara who now stands accused by the UN Commission of Inquiry for the responsibility of the massacre of 156 people on 28th September, 2009. But, what is very interesting here is, Hon. Colleagues, that finally Dr. Crane managed to absolve the President of the crimes and place the responsibility lower down on the military, lower down on the chain of command. Therefore, Dr. Crane has experience of saving the kins of dictators facing war crime charges and pinning the blame further down.
