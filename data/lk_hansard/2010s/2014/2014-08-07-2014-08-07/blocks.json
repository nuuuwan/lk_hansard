    "text": "( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I asked this Question because there is no provision in the Commissions of Inquiry Act for the appointment of a panel or an advisory council. The Commissioners have been appointed by the President to give a report and if the Commissioners are incapable, they should resign. That is why we raised this issue. Under Section 25, Public officers can be asked by the Commission to help or otherwise, assist in the inquiry or investigation. Otherwise, under Section 26, the Attorney-General, who is the legal adviser and who had gone to Geneva and New York to advise the Government, could be asked for his assistance. If you are not asking the Attorney-General for his assistance, is it because there is a lack of confidence in him? Has the Attorney-General recommended these people as advisers? So, that is the issue because there is no legal basis for the appointments. That is why I asked the Question, if there is no legal basis, how do we pay them out of the public funds? The Hon. Minister has not disclosed to the House the rate of payment, but the main issue is that there has been no legal basis to it. So, there maybe something in the argument - I do not know whether it is correct or not, but it was in the newspapers - that this is done just to certify to the Human Rights Council that the proceedings are properly held.",

So, these are areas of the law which have developed in recent times; they are very specialized branches of the law. I, myself, am a professor of law; I have a doctorate from the University of Oxford. But, this is not my field. We must have the humility to say that. Therefore, to say that the Attorney-General must be asked and nobody else, is not fair. Just because other persons are being asked to give their advice, it does not mean at all, in any manner whatsoever, that there is an erosion of confidence in the Attorney-General.

In my view, there is no legal impediment for taking a step which is obviously in the interest of the nation.

There have been various descriptions of it but then, fortunately, since we have the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, that has given a definition of who is a terrorist. Therefore, that would be useful in case this matter, for interpretation purposes, is raised in a court of law, subsequently.

    "text": "In other words, Sir, the original law pertaining to prescription would not apply during the period when they were disadvantaged persons. Thereby, the law of prescription would not run so as to deprive them of title to the land to which they were entitled to. As long as that person continues to be a disadvantaged person, the benefits of this law would be available both to him and to his successors in title. This goes on the basis that many militant groups have taken over lands belonging to civilians and these civilians, over a period of time, after 1983 and particularly until the conclusion of the war in 2009 - it is a continuing phenomenon - have not been able to take any action whatever for various reasons and therefore, when they were in that disadvantaged position of not being able to avail themselves of their rights under the law, the law relating to prescription should not run against them as the law existed earlier. That is the purpose of this law and in that sense, I must say that it provides relief to certain persons. But, one thing, I do not understand, which is in Clause 5. I do not want to get into a debate with the Hon. Minister, but I would like him to think about this. Clause 5 states, A disadvantaged person who was unable to pursue his rights shall be entitled to avail himself of the benefits conferred by this Act until twelve months after the coming into operation of this Act, which means that he will be entitled to the benefit of this Act for a period of 12 months after the Act comes into operation. But, if that person has been a disadvantaged person until the Bill becomes law, then in the normal course, the law of prescription will not run against him for a further ten years. So, why should that be confined to 12 months? I do not understand the logic behind this because if a person has been a disadvantaged person until the Bill has been passed and ceases to be a disadvantaged person only when the Bill is passed, he will be entitled to file an action within ten years. So, why should that be confined to twelve months? In the normal run of things, in the normal operation of even the existing law pertaining to prescription, this man will be entitled to take an action against a trespasser, a squatter, a person unlawfully occupying his land for a period of ten years from the time he ceases to be a disadvantaged person. So, I do not see the logic behind that period being reduced to 12 months under Section 5 of this Ordinance. I would like the Hon. Minister to give that matter a little thought. This also would apply largely, though the Minister said that it applies to the whole country, it is certainly a law applicable to the whole country, but in operation it will be largely applicable to the North and the East where land issues have been quite common and exist in large numbers.",

    "text": "very many. Problems relating to both private land and state land are multifaceted in the North-East. I would like to use this Debate to identify some of those problems. There have been High Security Zones in the North and the East. Some of the zones have been possessed by the armed forces as High Security Zones. Some have been legally proclaimed. Others have not been legally proclaimed but have been physically possessed as High Security Zones. All these High Security Zones comprise of private land. What is the rationale behind a High Security Zone? There was a time when the LTTE was in existence, LTTE was possessed of long range artillery. They were able to attack installations of the armed forces from some distance using such high range artillery and in consequence of this, there was a need to declare a High Security Zone preventing even normal civilians living in that zone so as to ensure that these installations were safe and that the LTTE would be kept a distance away that would ensure that their long range artillery would not reach these installations in these High Security Zones. Now, the LTTE is not there. The artillery is not there. What is the need for the High Security Zone? It is not necessary any longer. So, what is the purpose in the army continuing to occupy the land which was being held as a High Security Zone purely for security reasons against the LTTE and the LTTE's long range artillery? When the LTTE is not there, the long range artillery is not there, you are in complete control of all land, what is the need? Now, this land is to be acquired both in the North and the East. Some parts of these lands have been released, but substantial parts of these lands have not been released. The civilians who owned these lands have gone to the Supreme Court both from Walikamam in the North and Sampur in the East. The Government, through the Attorney General, has given commitments to the Supreme Court that these people will be resettled on these lands. It is a matter of record, but the lands have not been returned to those people. I have raised this matter in regard to the land in Sampur in this Parliament and the Minister of Economic Development interrupted me to state that except for a particular land required for the Coal Power Plant in Sampur, people can resettle on all the other lands. That matter is recorded in the Hansard. But, these commitments have not been kept and these civilians are unable to get back to their lands. A large number of houses, a large number of schools, a large number of temples within these lands have been destroyed. Some lands are possessed by the Army, some lands are possessed by the Navy. They have been used for purpose of occupation, for purpose of cultivation, for purpose of recreation and several other purposes. Tennis courts have come up on these lands, golf courses have come up on these lands, swimming pools have come up on these lands, luxury bungalows for occupation by security personnel have come up on these lands, lands on which our people lived and from which our people, farmers derived their livelihood. They have been taken over, they",

After all, it was manifestly unfair that those who had left their lands because of terrorism should have to lose these because others had occupied them for the period required to claim ownership. I recall being told that the draft legislation was ready at the time. So, it is sad that this laid, forgotten for so long. Perhaps, \"forgotten is the wrong word, for the Background Note we were helpfully given with regard to the Bill noted that the Law Commission had forwarded to the Ministry of Justice, a draft amendment to the Prescription Ordinance way back in 2009. Unfortunately, it took nearly five years to see the light of day in the form of these Special Provisions because of the delays that seem endemic in a system that is now on the verge of collapse. Though the reason for the delay is not mentioned, it may well have to do with the absence of any sense of urgency in the Legal Draftsman's Department, a phenomenon that also killed the admirable efforts of the Ministry of Higher Education to expand opportunities for tertiary education. What the Note makes clear is the need to streamline the procedures we now follow with regard to legislation and perhaps, bring the Legal Draftsmans Department under a specific Ministry that is able to concentrate on important issues and act expeditiously as decided.",

I could also understand why this should not be in terms of statutory compensation, since obviously we would be dealing, not only with cases of indigence, but also with those where individuals had contributed to the plight of those driven from the land. But, I am glad that the need for land for those who would now be rendered landless and in need has been acknowledged and I trust that suitable mechanisms will be set in place systematically to prevent any form of injustice.",

One of the best Reports this country has seen in the last several years, that of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, has talked of the importance of land in the context of our hopes for reconciliation and in fact, it had raised the issue prominently in the interim recommendations made in 2011. Sadly, the instructions of His Excellency the President that those recommendations should be implemented were flouted, perhaps in the unholy effort to avoid accountability issues, which has, at last, been thwarted by the welcome expansion of the mandate of the Presidential Commission on Missing Persons recently . As one who has consistently deplored any international investigation with regard to a conflict in which, by and large, the Sri Lankan Government and the forces behaved much better than those who point fingers at us, I welcome recognition of our own obligation to conduct our own inquiry into possible aberrations.

    "text": "responsibilities, as I did the physical office I had set up as Adviser on Reconciliation, since there is no point in multiplying entities that are not effective, and certainly no point in spending money on them. I hoped then that the Hon. Minister who had appointed me would point out to His Excellency that he needed a dedicated agency to take things forward, a Human Rights Ministry such as he himself has headed so effectively in the past, before that was abolished following the 2010 Election, and its functions handed over to the Ministry of External Affairs. That was a tragic mistake since he gave the impression that Human Rights was only for external consumption, whereas they need strengthening for the sake of all our people, a factor recognized when Cabinet adopted the Human Rights Action Plan. But, implementing it effectively needs a dedicated ministry to be headed by the Minister who now convenes an inter-ministerial committee on the subject which has no teeth and rarely meets. And, if such a ministry is not considered a good idea, I suggested alternatively that we could continue with his good work as deputy, if it was thought essential for that vital portfolio to be administered at the highest level.",

The many communications which I have sent following Divisional Secretariat Reconciliation meetings in the North and the East, the replies I have received from the line ministries that do respond to letters, which indicate willingness to help but incapacity in the light of different authorities with overlapping responsibilities, the need to coordinate activities with regard to service delivery as well as human resources development, all point to the need for a Ministry dedicated to Reconciliation. A Senior Minister would fulfil the required responsibilities admirably, in line with the coordination functions mentioned when such Ministers were created, but which have not been developed.",

This should be resolved, and indeed it can be resolved easily, only if we implement the Constitutional provision about setting up a National Land Commission. That Commission, with full participation by all stakeholders, including those from the provinces most affected by disputes regarding lands and the principles governing its use and distribution, should develop a National Land Policy by consensus. As my Colleague from the Gampaha District, the Hon. Vasantha Senanayake, so admirably put it in his submissions to the Parliamentary Select Committee, \"National Land Policy to be delivered prior to passing of new legislation at any level with regard to land. The National Policy shall clearly set out the mechanism of Central Government monitoring the implementation of the policy and ensuring corrective action if its policy is breached\".",
