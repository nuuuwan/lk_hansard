Therefore, will the Government make a statement to this House, the reasons for appointing the Panel?

Will the Government also inform this House:

1. What was the process followed by the Government in selecting this panel?

2. Which agency was responsible for negotiating with them?

3. The basis for appointing these Members?

4. Period of engagement?

5. Whether they are paid, and if so how much?

6. Where are the funds for the expenses of the Panel, and from where is it drawn?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I asked this Question because there is no provision in the Commissions of Inquiry Act for the appointment of a panel or an advisory council. The Commissioners have been appointed by the President to give a report and if the Commissioners are incapable, they should resign. That is why we raised this issue. Under Section 25, Public officers can be asked by the Commission to help or otherwise, assist in the inquiry or investigation. Otherwise, under Section 26, the Attorney-General, who is the legal adviser and who had gone to Geneva and New York to advise the Government, could be asked for his assistance. If you are not asking the Attorney-General for his assistance, is it because there is a lack of confidence in him? Has the Attorney-General recommended these people as advisers? So, that is the issue because there is no legal basis for the appointments. That is why I asked the Question, if there is no legal basis, how do we pay them out of the public funds? The Hon. Minister has not disclosed to the House the rate of payment, but the main issue is that there has been no legal basis to it. So, there maybe something in the argument - I do not know whether it is correct or not, but it was in the newspapers - that this is done just to certify to the Human Rights Council that the proceedings are properly held.

295 296

But, under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, you cannot take advice from anyone except the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General can advise to get other people to go on. Apparently, there seems to be a lack of confidence in the Attorney-General and the issue that has arisen is whether this is in connection with the Human Rights Council. So, obviously, I asked about the payment just to find out whether they are being paid and what the legal basis for that is because they cannot be paid under the Commissions of Inquiry Act.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have already said that there is absolutely no connection between the Resolution passed by the Human Rights Council in Geneva and this action that was taken. This action was taken in response to a request emanating from our own Commission.

The interpretation placed on the situation by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is a mischievous interpretation. There is absolutely no lack of confidence in the Honourable Attorney-General of the Republic; we have the fullest confidence in him. - [Interruption.] No, there is no impediment. Today, there are complex branches of the law. Nobody is a specialist in all branches of the law. I do not think that the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe or the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran will claim to be a specialist in every conceivable branch of the law, competent as they are, undoubtedly, in certain fields. That applies to any lawyer. So, these are areas of the law which have developed in recent times; they are very specialized branches of the law. I, myself, am a professor of law; I have a doctorate from the University of Oxford. But, this is not my field. We must have the humility to say that. Therefore, to say that the Attorney-General must be asked and nobody else, is not fair. Just because other persons are being asked to give their advice, it does not mean at all, in any manner whatsoever, that there is an erosion of confidence in the Attorney-General. That is a very mischievous and an erroneous interpretation of the situation.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) There is no legal provision.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) There is absolutely nothing to prevent - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Let us move on to the next Item. This cannot be converted into a debate.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, Sir, we cannot. Yesterday, - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) In short, I am extending the courtesy to him as the Leader of the Opposition.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Sir, yesterday, we had a four-hour debate. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition was not here when the Debate was concluded. It was the Oppositions own Motion. I checked with my Friend, the Hon. Chief Government Whip. He also cannot remember a situation where the Opposition initiates a debate and then, brings it to a closure, saying that there is no Quorum. - [Interruption.] So, yesterday, the Opposition aborted its own debate. Now, I strongly object to a revival of that debate today under the guise of a Question which has been put under a different procedure. - [Interruption.] It is not possible; it cannot be done under the Standing Orders of this House.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, cite your point of Order in brief.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I handed over this Question under Standing Order No. 23(2) yesterday morning. That was before the debate began and my Question covered only about the payments made to the appointed advisers, which apparently had not been the topic of the Debate. So, all I have done, as a Member of Parliament, is to look at the Commissions of Inquiry Act and the Attorney-Generals role under that because what is happening is, the Attorney-General had gone to Geneva and given us one advice and now, we are having another set of people.

What is the legal basis for this House to authorize payment? That is all I want to know. If I do not agree with what they say, I will say so at that time, Hon. Minister. I want to know the legal basis because the Commissions of Inquiry Act does not make provision for it.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) My brief answer to that question is that in the Governments view, there is no legal impediment. The whole basis on which we have been resisting international intervention is the strength of our own Commission. If our Commission is making this request and we are in a position to identify experts who are able to give them the assistance they require, it is certainly our duty to help them in that way. In my view, there is no legal impediment for taking a step which is obviously in the interest of the nation. It is obviously a protective measure for the nation in the circumstances in which we find ourselves and it is the clear duty of the Government to respond positively to the request that was made by the Chairman of the Commission and that is exactly what we have done. There is no legal impediment to it whatsoever. II

Is that in keeping with the traditions? I think we have to tell the Opposition, through the Party Leaders, that such a thing is not done. They move the Motion and then ask for the Quorum. This is what happened yesterday. They are shameless. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, it is not relevant to the subject under discussion. Hon. Hakeem, you can continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Azwer needs to get this raised at the Party Leaders' Meeting, not in the House.

Anyway, Hon. Presiding Member, I was talking about this matter relating to the Amendment to the Prescription Ordinance. Let me continue in Sinhala for a short while and then, I will explain it in English in detail.

In fact, the Attorney-General had looked into it in detail. The issue pertaining to the description of who would be a "terrorist group" has been identified. According to the Oxford Dictionary, militant means "aggressively active; combative" whilst terrorism means "using violent and intimidating methods to achieve political ends". There have been various descriptions of it but then, fortunately, since we have the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, that has given a definition of who is a terrorist. Therefore, that would be useful in case this matter, for interpretation purposes, is raised in a court of law, subsequently. Let me not get into that issue, but then, since we have to get over a practical difficulty, which the Hon. Sumanthiran understands, maybe we can explain it to the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera later.

Now, let me deal with this Act. Basically, it is a very simple Amendment though the understanding of it for non-lawyers might become a little confusing. So, let me, in very simple terms, explain this. In terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, a person who possesses land undisturbed and uninterrupted by a title adverse to and independent of that of the claimant for 10 years previous to the bringing an action is entitled to claim prescriptive title to the land upon proof of facts to that effect. So, this particular provision is causing some disadvantage to persons who have been displaced either forcibly or as a result of militant or terrorist action in several parts of the country. I must very clearly say that this right does not confine to affected individuals only in one part of the country; it applies to individuals in any part of the

country. So, the proposed law intends to clear a legal hurdle faced by individuals who are unable to re-possess land, recover money and other benefits under contracts and recover immovable property due to operation of the Prescription Law.

Clauses 2 and 4 of the Bill specifically identify what the subject matters are in respect of which a benefit in the form of grant of extended time is conferred on an individual.

In order to seek the benefit, an individual must show that he could not pursue his rights or defend himself in a court within the time granted by law owing to activities of militant or terrorist groups during the time commencing on 01st May, 1983 and ending on 18th May, 2009. So, we have for good reasons - I do not have to explain - decided that this period be considered the period within which this exceptional grant of time for those people who are getting affected, will be in operation.

Then, the prescriptive period stipulated in Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance does not begin to run against a disadvantaged person as long as such person remains as a disadvantaged person. Finally, in order to explain who is a disadvantaged person, we have even provided two illustrations which are normally given in various legislations. So, the two illustrations given in Section 2 make it clear that the period of prescription does not begin to run against a disadvantaged person notwithstanding whether the adverse and independent possession to immovable property including land commenced before or after the person had become a disadvantaged person. The illustrations have the effect of interrupting the period of possession of unauthorized individual and thereby deny him the right to claim title to immovable property including land through prescription.

Then, Clause 2 (2) of the proposed law extends the exemption granted to a disadvantaged person with regard to the operation of Section 13 of the Ordinance as well. According to Section 13 of the Ordinance, certain concessions are granted to persons who are under a disability: infancy, idiocy, unsoundness of mind, lunacy or absence beyond the seas. Therefore, in terms of Section 13 of the Ordinance, prescriptive period does not commence to run against any person in respect of any immovable property as long as such person is a disadvantaged person as aforesaid.

This provision operates to take away the entitlement conferred on a person in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance to claim title to immovable property on completion of possession for over 10 years.

Proviso to Section 13 of the Ordinance enables a person or those claiming under him to claim immovable property adverse by showing undisturbed possession for 30 years notwithstanding the above said disabilities.

311 312

Then, Section 3, which is yet another important Section, seeks to extend the benefits of Clause 2 of the proposed law to the lawful heirs of disadvantaged persons. So, the heirs of those people who may have been affected originally could also claim to have this exemption imposed in order to claim their right to property.

Section 4 states that the period a person is a disadvantaged person shall not be counted in computing the time period within which he has to take legal action for the recovery of any sum due upon any hypothecation or mortgage of any property, or upon any bond conditioned for the payment of money, or the performance of any agreement or trust, or the payment of penalty.

Period granted under Section 5 of the Ordinance is within 10 years from the date of such instrument of mortgage of hypothecation, or of last payment of interest thereon, or of the breach of the condition.

Then, Section 5 states that a disadvantaged person is entitled to claim benefits in terms of the provisions of the law within one year of operation from the date of enactment. Mr. Presiding Member, this is an important restriction we have brought in. It was felt that the principle laid down in the Prescription Ordinance should not be disturbed unnecessarily because of this extraordinary situation. Therefore, it was felt that we will limit the operation of this Act for a period of one year. As a matter of fact, today, in the Cabinet, the Hon. Douglas Devananda wanted this period reduced to six months which, we felt, was not possible for us to do it because he felt that there can be some constituents of his who could be adversely affected if we allow this to go on for one year and he feared that some people could be dispossessed of their lands because they have come into secondary occupation. So, there is one issue. - [Interruption.] Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, that is a matter you have to deal with him.

Sir, we must understand the applicability of the law. It is very clear. Provisions of the proposed law are applicable to privately-owned immovable property including land situated in any part of the country. A disadvantaged person is entitled to benefit from concession granted by the law during the period stated. Benefit in terms of the provisions of the law is available for a period of one year of operation from the date of enactment of this law and that is the basic tenets of this legislation.

It is also pertinent for me to mention here that the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission provides detailed observations with regard to the impact of land issues on the reconciliation process.

One of the key recommendations of the Commission was to amend the Law of Prescription in order to prevent legitimizing of forced eviction and secondary occupation of private land during the period of conflict. Therefore, this has been one of the important recommendations that the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission made, and this has been commented upon by various agencies, and it was left to our Ministry to try and address this issue by amending the law.

Several studies have been conducted to assess the impact of secondary occupation in Sri Lanka. A number of international organizations and policy institutes have also done considerable amount of work on this subject. It has been found that secondary occupation of land and houses raises some social issues as well: Potential to create fresh disputes is one issue. The others are: Competing claims and protracted legal action or administrative procedures and hindrance to orderly resettlement of the displaced. All of this have been identified.

Since the commencement of the conflict, a large number of affected families had left conflict areas and settled in safer areas or migrated abroad.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. Your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I believe there will not be many who would speak on this Bill. Anyway, if need be, let me have a few minutes. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera - Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms) Sir, I will give five minutes to the Hon. Rauff Hakeem from my time.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you, Hon. Minister. Sir, I may use that five minutes to say a few words in Tamil because it has to correctly get into the newspapers.

, , , . ! , . , - Law Commission 2009 . , . , . , . .

, , , . , , , , , , , . [2.55 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Presiding Member, we are debating a Bill that deals with Prescription, a Bill that is being brought to bring about certain changes in the existing laws pertaining to prescription in regard to the category of persons defined in the new Bill as disadvantaged persons. That is, persons who have been unable to pursue their rights shall be entitled to avail themselves of the benefits

conferred by this Act until 12 months after the coming into operation of this Act.

In other words, Sir, the original law pertaining to prescription would not apply during the period when they were disadvantaged persons. Thereby, the law of prescription would not run so as to deprive them of title to the land to which they were entitled to. As long as that person continues to be a disadvantaged person, the benefits of this law would be available both to him and to his successors in title. This goes on the basis that many militant groups have taken over lands belonging to civilians and these civilians, over a period of time, after 1983 and particularly until the conclusion of the war in 2009 - it is a continuing phenomenon - have not been able to take any action whatever for various reasons and therefore, when they were in that disadvantaged position of not being able to avail themselves of their rights under the law, the law relating to prescription should not run against them as the law existed earlier. That is the purpose of this law and in that sense, I must say that it provides relief to certain persons. But, one thing, I do not understand, which is in Clause 5. I do not want to get into a debate with the Hon. Minister, but I would like him to think about this. Clause 5 states, A disadvantaged person who was unable to pursue his rights shall be entitled to avail himself of the benefits conferred by this Act until twelve months after the coming into operation of this Act, which means that he will be entitled to the benefit of this Act for a period of 12 months after the Act comes into operation. But, if that person has been a disadvantaged person until the Bill becomes law, then in the normal course, the law of prescription will not run against him for a further ten years. So, why should that be confined to 12 months? I do not understand the logic behind this because if a person has been a disadvantaged person until the Bill has been passed and ceases to be a disadvantaged person only when the Bill is passed, he will be entitled to file an action within ten years. So, why should that be confined to twelve months? In the normal run of things, in the normal operation of even the existing law pertaining to prescription, this man will be entitled to take an action against a trespasser, a squatter, a person unlawfully occupying his land for a period of ten years from the time he ceases to be a disadvantaged person. So, I do not see the logic behind that period being reduced to 12 months under Section 5 of this Ordinance. I would like the Hon. Minister to give that matter a little thought. This also would apply largely, though the Minister said that it applies to the whole country, it is certainly a law applicable to the whole country, but in operation it will be largely applicable to the North and the East where land issues have been quite common and exist in large numbers.

Sir, land is the most complex problem in the North and the East and this relates to both private land and state land. The provisions of this Bill will of course relate to private land. But our problems in regard to state land are

315 316

very many. Problems relating to both private land and state land are multifaceted in the North-East. I would like to use this Debate to identify some of those problems. There have been High Security Zones in the North and the East. Some of the zones have been possessed by the armed forces as High Security Zones. Some have been legally proclaimed. Others have not been legally proclaimed but have been physically possessed as High Security Zones. All these High Security Zones comprise of private land. What is the rationale behind a High Security Zone? There was a time when the LTTE was in existence, LTTE was possessed of long range artillery. They were able to attack installations of the armed forces from some distance using such high range artillery and in consequence of this, there was a need to declare a High Security Zone preventing even normal civilians living in that zone so as to ensure that these installations were safe and that the LTTE would be kept a distance away that would ensure that their long range artillery would not reach these installations in these High Security Zones. Now, the LTTE is not there. The artillery is not there. What is the need for the High Security Zone? It is not necessary any longer. So, what is the purpose in the army continuing to occupy the land which was being held as a High Security Zone purely for security reasons against the LTTE and the LTTE's long range artillery? When the LTTE is not there, the long range artillery is not there, you are in complete control of all land, what is the need? Now, this land is to be acquired both in the North and the East. Some parts of these lands have been released, but substantial parts of these lands have not been released. The civilians who owned these lands have gone to the Supreme Court both from Walikamam in the North and Sampur in the East. The Government, through the Attorney General, has given commitments to the Supreme Court that these people will be resettled on these lands. It is a matter of record, but the lands have not been returned to those people. I have raised this matter in regard to the land in Sampur in this Parliament and the Minister of Economic Development interrupted me to state that except for a particular land required for the Coal Power Plant in Sampur, people can resettle on all the other lands. That matter is recorded in the Hansard. But, these commitments have not been kept and these civilians are unable to get back to their lands. A large number of houses, a large number of schools, a large number of temples within these lands have been destroyed. Some lands are possessed by the Army, some lands are possessed by the Navy. They have been used for purpose of occupation, for purpose of cultivation, for purpose of recreation and several other purposes. Tennis courts have come up on these lands, golf courses have come up on these lands, swimming pools have come up on these lands, luxury bungalows for occupation by security personnel have come up on these lands, lands on which our people lived and from which our people, farmers derived their livelihood. They have been taken over, they

have been used in this way and tens of thousands of Tamil civilian families are being kept out of these lands for these reasons because the lands are being used by the Armed forces in this way.

These persons are even more disadvantaged than anyone else. You have brought a Bill to Parliament claiming to confer some benefits on some disadvantaged people, there maybe a few people, but what about these people? These people are more disadvantaged than anyone else. Can anyone deny that? There are not just a few people. There are tens of thousands of Tamil families in this position. Why is there no serious effort to address this issue? Despite all the protests and demonstrations that are taking place in the North and the East, despite the matter having been raised in Parliament on several occasions, why is this issue not being addressed seriously? Is this attitude of the Government not indicative of the Government having a sinister objective? I want to pose this question.

Lands have been taken over on various pretexts: security, development, occupation, cultivation, tourism and recreation. This is all for the benefit of the majority community. At the expense of tens of thousands of Tamil families, persons of the majority community are being settled on these lands. Who are the members of the armed forces? The armed forces are almost exclusively Sinhalese. When they come into possession of these lands and when the Tamil civilians are permanently kept out, what will happen? These Armed forces will continue to occupy these lands, they will cultivate these lands, they will derive their livelihood from these lands and they will continue to live in the North and the East. Is this not yet another way of settling the majority community people on lands which have belonged to Tamil civilians for generations and centuries on which they have lived, on which they have farmed, which they have cultivated, and making these lands available to the majority community?

Apart from that, Sir, persons of the majority community are being settled in various areas in the North and the East. This is particularly intensive in the Trincomalee District, the northernmost district in the Eastern Province and in the Mullaitivu District, the southernmost district of the Northern Province. Around 4,000 to 5,000 new voters of the majority community have been registered in the Mullaitivu District since 2009. My information is that these persons had never been registered as voters before; for the first time, they have been registered as voters. I would not make this allegation if these were persons who were displaced and who have come back. That, I am told, is not the position. These persons were never registered before, but since 2009, around 4,000 to 5,000 people have been registered as voters in the Northern Province, which shows that these persons have been settled on these lands after the war came to an end. This is a serious question. They have been brought in anew. All these actions have State

317 318

[ . ]

2014 07

patronage from the highest level to the lowest level, from the national level to the district level.

Private lands from which Tamils were displaced and which were occupied forcibly by the majority community are sought to be acquired by the State to be given to those who occupy the lands unlawfully. This is happening in Sivayogapuram in Trincomalee in close proximity to the Nadesar Temple at a place called Kanniya. Why is it being done? You are talking of disadvantaged persons. Here, these persons were disadvantaged; they were displaced from their lands; they were driven out and other persons of the majority community occupy those lands. Are you prepared to give an assurance to this House to take up this matter and ensure that these persons who were displaced, who were disadvantaged are enabled to get back their lands if they take legal action? Why is the Government acquiring these lands so as to deprive them of the remedy which you are providing under this statute? You are bringing a Bill to Parliament, stating that you want to give such disadvantaged people some rights. But, those rights can never be enjoyed by them because the Government is acquiring these lands.

Sir, Hindu religious places have been destroyed; they have been desecrated. We have revealed information in regard to all this to Government; we have written to the Government; we have written to the President and we have raised this matter on the Floor of this House on a number of occasions. New majority Buddhist places of worship are coming up in the North and the East. I do not mind the statue of Lord Buddha being installed anywhere. We all venerate Lord Buddha. I do not want my Sinhalese friends to misunderstand me. We all venerate Lord Buddha. But, they are coming up even in places where not one Sinhala Buddhist person lives. What is the purpose? Why is this being done? Lord Buddha's statue is being installed in various parts of the North and the East where the Sinhala Buddhist people do not live.

Why is this happening? Hindu cultural places of great veneration have been forcibly taken over. I want to refer to one particular instance, Sir. There is a place called Kanniya in Trincomalee, which has seven hot wells. I must narrate to this House the history of these hot wells. Ravana, Sir, a great historical figure, went to the Koneswaran Temple in Trincomalee, Koneswaran which is referred in the Puranas as Dakshina Kailas, as the southern abode of Lord Shiva. He was so impressed by the lingam there that he cut the rock wanting to take the lingam for worship by his mother. Even today as one enters Koneswaran, on the right hand side one sees the cut on the rock which is called the Ravanan Vettu - "the Ravanas cut". When Ravana cut the rock in this way to take the lingam away, Lord Shiva was said to have got enraged and with his big toe he moved the rock. Ravana got trapped in the rock. His mother who was in India heard about this and thought that Ravana was killed. She died of shock. But, Ravana was not killed. He was only

unable to take the rock away. Ravana implored Lord Shiva that he be pardoned for his fault. Lord Shiva pardoned him and Ravana wanted to perform the 31st Day Ceremony of his mother. He went with his spear to a place close by called Kanniya where he dug with his spear in seven places. There were seven sprouts of hot water, each of a different temperature. That is the origin of the seven hot wells in Kanniya in Trincomalee.

There was a Pillaiyar Temple there and over generations and centuries the Hindu-Tamil people have been going there and performing the 31st Day Ceremony of their kith and kin. Today some statues of the Lord Buddha have been installed there. I have gone and seen it myself. At one time I wrote to the DIG of the area. He stopped it. There was no statue of Lord Buddha at that point of time. Now, some statues of Lord Buddha have been installed. A new passage is being opened up to the hot wells in such a way, that as you go along the path where the Buddhist Statues have been installed, you thereby take over and annex the seven hot wells to that area. The old road to the seven hot wells is sought be closed and this new road is sought to be constructed. Why is all this being done? The Pillaiyar Temple which was there has been desecrated. Lord Pillaiyar has been planted under a temporary shed; he is presently under a temporary shed. So, Sir, one can see that some people are working on these designs; some people are very assiduously, very studiously pursuing a programme which has certain objectives. This is, Sir, nothing short of being absolutely diabolical and outrageous denying the Hindu-Tamils of an ancient Hindu religious and cultural right. They cannot even freely perform the 31st Day Ceremonies of their kith and kin in this area, a right which they have enjoyed from Ravanas time.

I would invite the members of the international community to come to Kanniya in Trincomalee and see for themselves what is happening; see for themselves the situation.

We do not want these types of things to happen. But, you are compelling us to make such an appeal to the international community. I wrote to the President; I wrote to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. I have raised this matter in Parliament. You do not reply. You do not respond. But, you quietly carry on with your programme of work and your programme of work is being completed. Why is all this being done?. All this is being done because you want to change the demographic composition of the North and the East and you want to change the cultural and linguistic identity of the districts in the North and the East. These things are being done with a definite purpose, the purpose being to change the demographic composition of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and the cultural and linguistic identity of the Northern and Eastern Provinces so as to make a political resolution, a political solution irrelevant and unnecessary. That is the objective with which you are pursuing this agenda. This is

319 320

not good for the country. I am not saying these things because I want to cast any slurs or aspersions on anyone. But, I am saying these things because this is not good for the country. In this context, Sir, it is necessary that I refer to certain irrefutable facts which, I think, have a significant bearing on the future of this country and which also have certain geopolitical and strategic dimensions.

I want to refer, Sir, to the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement signed on the 29th of July, 1987. I will not read the whole Agreement but I will read certain important parts of it which are relevant.

Paragraph 1.1 of it states, I quote:

desiring to preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka ;

That is sacrosanct. That is something which could not be touched, "to preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka". That is the entire basis, the entire foundation on which the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was signed.

Then, Paragraph 1.2 states,

acknowledging that Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic and a multi-lingual plural society consisting, inter alia, of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims (Moors), and Burghers ;

Then, Paragraph 1.3 states,

recognising that each ethnic group has a distinct cultural and linguistic identity which has to be carefully nurtured ;

Then, Paragraph 1.4 states,

also recognising that the Northern and the Eastern Provinces have been areas of historical habitation of Sri Lankan Tamil speaking peoples, who have at all times hitherto lived together in this territory with other ethnic groups ;

Further, Paragraph 1.5 states,

Conscious of the necessity of strengthening the forces contributing to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka, and preserving its character as a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious plural society, in which all citizens can live in equality, safety and harmony, and prosper and fulfil their aspirations ;

Then, Paragraph 2.1 goes on to say,

Since the Government of Sri Lanka proposes to permit adjoining Provinces to join to form one administrative unit and also by a Referendum to separate as may be permitted to the Northern and

Eastern Provinces as outlined below :

Sir, Paragraph 2.2 of the Agreement states, I quote:

"During the period, which shall be considered an interim period, (i.e. from the elections to the Provincial Council, as specified in para 2.8 to the date of the referendum as specified in para 2.3, the Northern and Eastern Provinces as now constituted, will form one administrative unit, having one elected Provincial Council. Such a unit will have one Governor, one Chief Minister and one Board of Ministers."

Paragraph 2.3 states that there will be a referendum on or before a certain date and the rest of it deals with the referendum.

Now, I want to say this very clearly, Sir. That is why I referred to Trincomalee and Mullaitivu earlier. Trincomalee is the northern most district in the Eastern Province and Mullaitivu is the southern most district in the Northern Province. All these actions of the Government and persons who are working with the Government are concentrated largely in Mullaitivu and Trincomalee because you want to break the linguistic contiguity of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. That clearly shows that you are pursuing a definite sinister objective which cannot be permitted and this is why I say that these actions of yours have geopolitical and geo-strategic dimensions and there can be consequences which will not be to the benefit of this country. As a Sri Lankan, I have a right to ask that this country be not placed in jeopardy by reason of such actions. I have a right to ask that these actions of yours be terminated because if these action of yours are not terminated, eventually great harm can fall on Sri Lanka.

I also want to read, Sir, a further paragraph. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Leader of the Opposition, a couple of days ago raised a question in regard to the Trincomalee Port and the new facility that the Government is contemplating in Trincomalee with the involvement of some foreign power. He said that that would be in violation of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement. When you seek to change the demographic composition of the North and the East, are you not violating the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement where there is a clear acknowledgement that the Northern and Eastern Provinces have been the areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people? On that basis, the Northern and Eastern provinces must become one unit of devolution with one Governor, one Chief Minister, one Provincial Council. Are you not violating the conditions of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement which flow on that basis which recognizes Sri Lanka as a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, plural society, each people, the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims having a separate identity which must be nurtured, which recognizes the Northern and Eastern Provinces as the areas of historical habitation of

321 322

[ . ]

2014 07

the Tamil-speaking people on the basis of which they can be one unit? Are you not violating all these provisions? This is the question, Sir, I wish to pose.

The para 2(ii) of the annexure to the Agreement refers to the question that the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe raised. It states, I quote:

Trincomalee or any other ports in Sri Lanka will not be made available for military use by any country in a manner prejudicial to Indias interests.

That is what the Agreement states. Now, when you seek to alter, when you seek to change vital parts of this Agreement, am I wrong in saying that you are working with an insidious objective, which is to change the demographic composition so as to have your own way and do what you please? This is not acceptable, Sir, and if this continues, I would think that it would not be good for Sri Lanka.

I also want to refer to one other matter before I conclude, Sir, and it is this. Your Bill refers to "disadvantaged persons". The Tamil people in this country are disadvantaged in many respects, not merely what is contained in your Bill. We all know that under the Decentralized Budget, every Member of Parliament is given Rs. 5 million. The North and the East, in the course of the 30-year conflict, suffered the worst damage. Our people suffered the most; the Tamil people suffered the most. They were killed the most; their assets were destroyed the most; they suffered denial and deprivation the most. The Tamil Members of Parliament, except for those few who are with the Government, were given Rs. 5 million each under the Decentralized Budget. All the other Members of Parliament have been given Rs. 30 million - Rs. 5 million plus another Rs. 25 million. They have been given Rs. 30 million!

We represent the Tamil people substantially. The vast majority of the seats of the North and the East, where the Tamil people have voted and elected their Members, have come to us, but we are given only Rs. 5 million; everybody else is given Rs. 30 million. Is this fair? Is this just? Is this conscionable? How can you do this? You are mere trustees of Government money; you are mere trustees of Government property having been elected by the voters. We also have been elected by the voters. Are our people not sovereign? Are our people not equal? Are our people second-class citizens? Is that the reason that you are giving the Members of Parliament representing the Tamil people Rs. 5 million while you give all the others Rs. 30 million? I do not want to confront anyone, but I do not want to beg from anyone and my people do not want me to beg. My people are not beggars and they never want me to beg. But, I want you to know, I want the world to know that despite a 30-year conflict and despite all the denial and deprivation, all the immense losses, destruction that we have gone through and when we are

the most in need of assistance, we are being given by this Government only Rs. 5 million while all the other Members of Parliament are given Rs. 30 million. Is it conscionable? Is it just? Is it reasonable? I want your conscience to answer this question and I want you to do the right thing. After all, being in power and having the reins of governance is nothing more than a trust reposed in you by the people to do the just and the right thing. You must not assume that such power will be with you forever.

Sir, we were dealing with the Prescription (Special Provisions) Bill. But, I have used the time of the Bill to refer to some of the grave issues particularly pertaining to land, particularly pertaining to the tens of thousands of Tamil families who have not yet been resettled, who have not yet been rehabilitated, who do not have houses, who are living in camps and welfare centres and who do not have proper livelihood still in the North and the East. Can you deny the fact that there are such people in the North and the East and that you are giving Tamil Members of Parliament of the North and the East only Rs. 5 million and others Rs. 30 million? Can you deny that? Is it fair? How can you permit this? Will God pardon you for doing this? I will not take anymore of the time, Mr. Presiding Member.

Thank you.

The World Bank has two projects in Colombo. The first project they have in Colombo is the UDAs Metro Colombo Urban Development Project for US Dollars 213 million. Recently, they also have got a second project going for US Dollars 147 million called the "Strategic Cities Project" for developing or redeveloping Galle and Kandy. The World Bank has its own guidelines on involuntary resettlement and elaborate resettlement action plans. I want to know why the World Bank is not implementing its own guidelines. The World Bank is, on the one hand, strengthening the UDA while on the other, finding excuses for not implementing its own internal policy. When it came to the Southern Highway, they implemented the policy because they directly gave money for it. They implemented the policy so that the

329 330

[ ]

2014 07

people who had to be resettled were resettled according to those guidelines. But, in the City of Colombo, they are not doing it; they are ignoring it. Why are they ignoring it? They are hiding behind the fact that they are not giving money directly for the purpose of building houses. But, is the World Bank not guilty of complicity, for supporting the same Government agency, the UDA, which is actually relocating these people in the City of Colombo? I want to ask the World Bank, do you have clean hands? You are strengthening anti-democratic measures, hiding behind the fact that these are market efficiencies.

We also know that there are domestic and international standards. Now, I am going to read some of those standards. There are key Policy Principles in the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, which was adopted in the year 2001. Wherever in the country, whether it is in the North and the East, the hill country or in the City of Colombo, these policies and principles apply. According to the Domestic and International Standards on Development-based Evictions and Involuntary Resettlement : A Brief Overview, the key Policy Principles stressed by the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy are, I quote:

Avoiding or reducing involuntary resettlement as much as possible by 'reviewing alternatives to the project as well as alternatives within the project.'

Ensuring that affected persons are 'fully involved in the selection of relocation sites, livelihood compensation and development options.'

'Affected persons who do not have documented title to land should receive fair and just treatment.'

'Vulnerable groups should be identified and given appropriate assistance to substantially improve their living standards.'

These are our own policies and principles. We are in complete violation of these policies and principles, not only in other parts of the country, but even in the Capital City of Colombo.

We also know that there are UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-based Evictions and Displacement. From this document, I would also like to read some of those UN Guidelines which have to be followed. It states, I quote:

Appropriate notice to all potentially affected persons including public hearings on the proposed plans and alternatives;

That should be there. It further states, I quote:

Effective dissemination of relevant information in advance, including land records and proposed comprehensive resettlement plans specifically addressing efforts to protect vulnerable groups;

A reasonable time period for public review of, comment on, and/or objection to the proposed plan; Provision of legal, technical and other advice to affected persons about their rights and options; and

Holding of public hearing(s) that provide(s) affected persons and their advocates with opportunities to challenge the eviction decision and/or to present alternative proposals and to articulate their demands and development priorities.

These are UN Guidelines. The World Bank has the responsibility to either follow their own guidelines or internationally prescribed guidelines, but they are not doing that. Sir, I want to be even more specific. It further states, I quote:

"Even the World Banks Operational Policy (OP) 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement stipulates that all those recognised as affected persons, including 'those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are occupying' have to be 'provided compensation for loss of assets other than land.' Moreover, OP 4.12 also lays down that the resettlement plan or policy framework must include measures to ensure that the 'displaced persons are:

(i) informed about their options and rights pertaining to resettlement;

(ii) consulted on, offered choices among, and provided with technically and economically feasible resettlement alternatives; and

(iii) provided prompt and effective compensation at full replacement cost for losses of assets attributable directly to the project;'

As we are talking of international rights and standards here, I again quote from this document.

Finally, it is important to note that UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing has also stressed that 'protection against forced eviction should apply to all vulnerable individuals and groups, irrespective of whether they hold title to a home and or property under domestic law'......

So, Sir, we see that the World Bank is basically flouting or ignoring these international standards. They are hiding behind the fact that they are not directly funding the housing projects in Colombo, but are funding the institution that is basically implementing this policy of evicting people from Colombo involuntarily.

Although this amendment made to the Prescription (Special Provisions) Bill is acceptable, the one-year period is not sufficient. It is insufficient for many reasons. There are people who have lost their identity cards; then, there are people who have been really affected during the war, all their possessions have been burnt and their deeds have been lost. So, they are unable to collect those deeds. Therefore, I feel that a one-year period is not sufficient.

The second matter is this. There are people who have occupied these lands as trespassers, lands which were not their own lands, say, for 10 to 15 years. What will happen to them? How are you going to get rid of them? I, as a new owner of a property, can claim my property back. But, what is the situation of the persons who have been dispossessed of their lands? What is the alternate accommodation that you are going to give them? Are you going to pay them compensation? Is the Government going to pay compensation or will the owner pay compensation for them? What are those person going to be given? So, this is also one of the main issues that we have to consider. These factors have to be considered very strictly.

There are so many acres of land that have been taken over by the Government for the utilization of the armed forces. Although they have not been physically taken over by law, even today there are lands being occupied by the Government forces. Therefore, how are we going take them over? The Valikamam area, mostly inhabited by the farmers and the Tamil community, have been taken over by the Government for defence purposes. We need defence. I do not deny that the country needs defence because we all need it. But, the question is, defence should be there to an extent so as to safeguard the interests of the community, the Tamils who are in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, and not to their detriment.

As the Hon. Sampanthan very clearly stated, there are certain issues where Buddhist statues are being erected all over the country, in areas where Buddhists are not in occupation. I venerate Buddhism with utmost nobility, but we should be practical in our aspects and we should not divulge our cultural aspects and rights to another religion or to another person in a way that can prejudice the interests of another community.

Thank you. [.. 5.40] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Felix Perera - Minister of Social Services) , , ( ) . . , .

[6.03 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is an honour to have been asked to speak on this Bill, which I am very happy to support. It is a necessary measure and should have been introduced some years back. Indeed I recall, having, six years ago when I headed the Peace Secretariat, a meeting with the Chair of the Law Commission about the need to introduce legislation of this sort and being impressed because they too had already thought about it.

I had been unexpectedly drawn into public life from the rural pleasures of the Sabaragamuwa University, but I thought it necessary to interpret my mandate widely in the interests of peace and reconciliation. It seems sensible then to also plan for the future. Though much was uncertain at the time, we had to hope that we could overcome terrorism, as indeed we successfully did a year or so later. But, we also needed to eradicate the root causes of terrorism, which required, as the Secretary of Defence eloquently put in those days, at a function at the Central Bank late in 2008, a political solution, which was not his area of concern.

Planning for the future then was of essence and I was pleased to find that the Law Commission had already thought of the problems the existing provisions regarding Prescription might cause. After all, it was manifestly unfair that those who had left their lands because of terrorism should have to lose these because others had occupied them for the period required to claim ownership. I recall being told that the draft legislation was ready at the time. So, it is sad that this laid, forgotten for so long. Perhaps, "forgotten is the wrong word, for the Background Note we were helpfully given with regard to the Bill noted that the Law Commission had forwarded to the Ministry of Justice, a draft amendment to the Prescription Ordinance way back in 2009. Unfortunately, it took nearly five years to see the light of day in the form of these Special Provisions because of the delays that seem endemic in a system that is now on the verge of collapse. Though the reason for the delay is not mentioned, it may well have to do with the absence of any sense of urgency in the Legal Draftsman's Department, a phenomenon that also killed the admirable efforts of the Ministry of Higher Education to expand opportunities for tertiary education. What the Note makes clear is the need to streamline the procedures we now follow with regard to legislation and perhaps, bring the Legal Draftsmans Department under a specific Ministry that is able to concentrate on important issues and act expeditiously as decided.

367 368

With regard to the present Bill, Sir, I must note that, at the discussion way back in 2008, we also talked of the claims of those who had occupied lands in the interim. Many had done so in good faith and worked hard on those lands. While this should not take away from the rights of those who were driven from lands by terrorism, we also needed to think of those people and not leave them destitute.

I brought up this question when we discussed the Bill at the Parliamentary Group and was reassured when the Hon. Minister of Justice responded that he also recognized the need for making provision for them accordingly. I took his point that that could not be done through legislation, but required administrative action in the form of land grants. I could also understand why this should not be in terms of statutory compensation, since obviously we would be dealing, not only with cases of indigence, but also with those where individuals had contributed to the plight of those driven from the land. But, I am glad that the need for land for those who would now be rendered landless and in need has been acknowledged and I trust that suitable mechanisms will be set in place systematically to prevent any form of injustice.

This again, Sir, should have been looked into sometime back. One of the best Reports this country has seen in the last several years, that of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, has talked of the importance of land in the context of our hopes for reconciliation and in fact, it had raised the issue prominently in the interim recommendations made in 2011. Sadly, the instructions of His Excellency the President that those recommendations should be implemented were flouted, perhaps in the unholy effort to avoid accountability issues, which has, at last, been thwarted by the welcome expansion of the mandate of the Presidential Commission on Missing Persons recently . As one who has consistently deplored any international investigation with regard to a conflict in which, by and large, the Sri Lankan Government and the forces behaved much better than those who point fingers at us, I welcome recognition of our own obligation to conduct our own inquiry into possible aberrations. Only that would make crystal clear that the policies we had in place were in accordance with national and international law.

Our unfortunate obsession with dodging a few obligations, led way back in 2011, to avoidance of getting to grips with the interim recommendations concerning land. This was unfortunate, because when I was tasked with convening the Task Force on our Human Rights Action Plan and went into the subject, I found nothing but cooperation, and solicitude for those who have suffered from the Ministry of Lands and its admirable Secretary. But, my Task Force had no power to expedite action, which is why with great sadness I gave up my

responsibilities, as I did the physical office I had set up as Adviser on Reconciliation, since there is no point in multiplying entities that are not effective, and certainly no point in spending money on them. I hoped then that the Hon. Minister who had appointed me would point out to His Excellency that he needed a dedicated agency to take things forward, a Human Rights Ministry such as he himself has headed so effectively in the past, before that was abolished following the 2010 Election, and its functions handed over to the Ministry of External Affairs. That was a tragic mistake since he gave the impression that Human Rights was only for external consumption, whereas they need strengthening for the sake of all our people, a factor recognized when Cabinet adopted the Human Rights Action Plan. But, implementing it effectively needs a dedicated ministry to be headed by the Minister who now convenes an inter-ministerial committee on the subject which has no teeth and rarely meets. And, if such a ministry is not considered a good idea, I suggested alternatively that we could continue with his good work as deputy, if it was thought essential for that vital portfolio to be administered at the highest level.

But, just as we need a Ministry for Human Rights, what this belated most welcome Bill that we are voting on today makes clear is the crying need for a Ministry also of Reconciliation to take a holistic view of what is now being done in bits and pieces. The many communications which I have sent following Divisional Secretariat Reconciliation meetings in the North and the East, the replies I have received from the line ministries that do respond to letters, which indicate willingness to help but incapacity in the light of different authorities with overlapping responsibilities, the need to coordinate activities with regard to service delivery as well as human resources development, all point to the need for a Ministry dedicated to Reconciliation. A Senior Minister would fulfil the required responsibilities admirably, in line with the coordination functions mentioned when such Ministers were created, but which have not been developed.

Indeed, such a Minister, with a commitment to consultation, could have intervened with regard to the worries you yourself expressed so eloquently, Sir, about this Bill, and which other Members of both the Government and the Opposition have mentioned. At the very least, reducing the period of exception to six months, which you advocated and which I too suggested to the Ministry Secretary when the Consultative Committee met, would have helped assuage fears amongst those who will be disadvantaged by this Act. And, it would make clear that the Government is balanced in its approach, and takes all concerns into account.

In this context, Sir, the question of land is vital. Even if not everyone can be satisfied fully, the Government must be sensitive to all concerns and do its best to deal

369 370

with the worries of the vulnerable. As you are aware, in addtion to the prevailing uncertainties about the principles involved, there is much controversy, in general, over land powers. This should be resolved, and indeed it can be resolved easily, only if we implement the Constitutional provision about setting up a National Land Commission. That Commission, with full participation by all stakeholders, including those from the provinces most affected by disputes regarding lands and the principles governing its use and distribution, should develop a National Land Policy by consensus. As my Colleague from the Gampaha District, the Hon. Vasantha Senanayake, so admirably put it in his submissions to the Parliamentary Select Committee, "National Land Policy to be delivered prior to passing of new legislation at any level with regard to land. The National Policy shall clearly set out the mechanism of Central Government monitoring the implementation of the policy and ensuring corrective action if its policy is breached".

The present Bill, Sir, is a welcome step in the right direction. I hope it is the precursor to concerted action to settle uncertainties in the areas afflicted by conflict, to return to their rightful owners the bulk of lands of those disadvantaged by so many aspects of the conflict, to explain clearly why in some cases, - I hope very few - land cannot be returned, and to provide adequate compensation in such cases, as also to those who will now be deprived of the right of prescription. Only through equitable settlement of such matters can we move forward, and strengthen agriculture, develop livestock rearing, and promote value addition and agribusiness initiatives, for all these require security of tenure and confidence in the rule of law.

doubts were cast by the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama, we need certain explanations on the amendments that have been proposed. Although we are Members of the Government, we need a certain amount of time to reassess the whole situation. The Hon. Ajith Perera also, a little while ago, spoke about the need for reassessment and I support what he said.

Sir, since this Bill is a very important one as far as this country is concerned, let us postpone this Debate. Since it is such an important Bill, we have to discuss it fully.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Considering the request of the Hon. Members wanting more time for the Debate, the Government is ready to give more time, Hon. Deputy Speaker. . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , , . ,
