() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If you do not want, I can sit down.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I can give one or two minutes only. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am saying, this in a spirit of objectivity. I am not trying to take credit or anything. I want only to clarify that the pattern of disbursement is not something that we can control. Some countries like China, for example, are very generous lenders. They have a large pot, which can be given as assistance not only to Sri Lanka but to Africa, Latin America and all, as you know very well. With India and some other countries, we have to negotiate. Let us say with the Saudi Fund or with the Arab Fund, they have ceilings. So, each one is a specific case. Nobody can come and say, Well, why do you not take this? It is cheaper here". It is a whole package. Firstly, the urgency of the project; secondly, the return on that project; thirdly, there are other classifications, like for example, the period of repayment, the mode of repayment. Then, you know very well that some countries insist that the recipient country pays for insurance, freight and so on. So, these are all negotiable issues. It is not a question that we not taking at concessionary rates. I mean, anybody in his proper senses or any institution will try to get the lowest possible interest, not only interest even the other terms, like repay back period and all that. But, it so happens that we have to go to different countries, whether it is Japan or China, there are different windows. And, for your information, Hon. Member, I want to say that now most of these people are going away from bilateral assistance like that, to money coming through import and export banks. In other words, they are shifting from various country-to-country arrangements to commercial transactions. The grant component and country component is being reduced and the commercial bank transactions are being increased. That is a fact of life. There are a variety of reasons. We are becoming a middle-income country. Various things like that are also affecting it, but basically these countries are moving all over.

Yesterday, I had discussions with a delegation from Thailand. They are also now moving away from this type of country-to-country bilateral relationship to giving loans through their banks. That is a development that is taking place globally. So, we have to situate each of these projects within this total system and I can give you an assurance, on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, that we are doing our very best through the External Resources Division to negotiate the best possible terms for our projects.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I like your sense of humour, because I asked you a Question on India and you give an example from China.- [Interruption.] I understand. But, you must understand that the Indians as opposed to the Chinese, it is four times what you borrow from China than from India.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If they are giving, we are quite happy.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Because there are no conditions attached to that - in China, there are no conditions. But, India is a special case.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Believe me, Hon. Member, if we get offers for projects or funding from India, we will use all our exertions to take that money. There is no inhibition.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My second Question, Hon. Minister -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is only that some countries do not give in that way. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Come direct to the question, please.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, I will do so. Sorry for the time factor.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am grateful to him for raising it.

Now, we are having a big debate with the Tamil Parties. Some people want it to be kept in Kilinochchi while some others want to take it beyond Kilinochchi to the Jaffna Peninsula. We have asked the Hon. R. Sampanthan to help us to negotiate this matter. These are the realities of the Government. When you are not in the Government, what am I to do? People do not put you in Government, so you do not have to face these complexities.

Mr. Presiding Member, I am very happy to speak on the Motion moved by the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana on "Regulating of religious school education and administration of Sri Lanka". My good Friend from the Eastern Province, the Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran spoke at length about the education imparted to Tamil Schools and the development of Hindu Schools there.

I also want to speak a few words, Sir, without taking much time, about Muslim Daham Pasal which are called, Ahadiya Schools. I am thankful to the Ministry of Education for conducting these schools everywhere primarily in Government Schools on Sundays. Sir, the teachers in these Ahadiya Schools do voluntary service. I know that the teachers in the daily schools devote their time in order to impart religious education to the Muslim children. This is very important. Even the Presbyterian School System was introduced by Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, an American though, in order to help the Buddhist children to develop their religious education. It is an acceptable principle that all religions must be taught to students of all denominations so that a sense of belonging to the nation, culture, and good conduct could be inculcated in the students.

Sir, today I recall the memory of famous Advocate M.H.A. Aziz who started these Ahadiya schools throughout the Island. It was later carried foward by Alhaj A.H.L.A. Saleem who was the President of the Muslim Missionary Society and the All-Ceylon Ahadiya Central Federation. The Ahadiya song was composed by Alhaj M.H.M. Bahawudeen, who was also a teacher of mine at the Usmaniya Primary School conducted at that time by the Dewatagaha Mosque. These Ahadiya Schools were ably conducted at that time by the Registrar, Katheeb Jezuli Salahudeen and presently it is done by Alhaj A.L.M. Azwar. He is travelling right throughout the country attending to the needs of Ahadiya Schools such as providing books et cetera. He even approaches wealthy people for monetary help in order to make some payment for these voluntary teachers and to meet other expenses of these schools.

Sir, as suggested, the certificate issued to all these Daham Pasals must be recognized including that of Ahadiya Schools. Believe me, there are teachers who have been teaching in Ahadiya Schools for the last 40 to 50 years. They need our recognition and also our charitable disposition, so that the children who are being

577 578

educated will be benefited. I know that even certain foreign embassies, wealthy people and others donate uniforms for these children. It has been a voluntary organization throughout and it should be so, as far as religious schools are concerned.

While thanking my young Friend, the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana for moving this Motion, I would urge that Ahadiya Schools also be included in the subject under discussion and make help forthcoming to them through the Ahadiya federations.

Thank you very much. [.. 4.50] ..... ( ) ( ..... - , ) (The Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana - Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs) , , . . . .

III INITIATING ACTION TO DEVELOP CASHEW CULTIVATION [5.06 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I am privileged to move Motion No. P.143/'11 appearing in the Order Paper today under my name:

That this Parliament resolves that an action must be initiated to develop cashew cultivation in order to help processing, marketing and plantation of cashew and allied products and thereby help Sri Lanka to become a leading producer and exporter of quality and value added cashew products.

Sir, I table* the Sinhala and Tamil versions of the Motion to be included in the Hansard.

* : * : * Sinhala and Tamil versions of Motion tabled:

" , , ."

" , .

Sir, cashew is a wonderful plantation; a good fruit. Delightfully crunchy cashews!. That is how it is described. Mildly sweet yet crunchy, the taste of cashew nuts has been a hot favourite among many. This delightfully nutritious fruit is closely related to the mango and pistachio plants. Though the tastes and sizes of cashew differ according to the area where it is grown, one fact remains true; everyone loves its tantalizing crispy essence.

There are so many health benefitsin eating cashew. Eating cashewnuts is good for those with ischemic heart disease, which is caused by an obstruction in an artery and account for about 80 per cent of all strokes. It reduces the unhealthy cholesterol and controls diabetes. It comprises iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorous, vitamin A, B, and C. It improves blood circulation by 20 per cent. What a good thing? What a good doctor?

The chemical properties in cashew nuts help people retain in their youthful look. Wonderful! That is what we see in the faces of the Bataleeya "Kadju Girls". It is good for the skin colour and its lustre, and ensure long life. Though we compare engaging in easy tasks to eating cashew, the reality is that a lot of work goes into planting, trending and peeling cashew. Cashewnut processing takes time and effort. The cashew has to be dried in sunlight properly before the peeling process takes place. The final product after all this labour is that which you find in the market as kernels and roasted cashew.

Cashew was originally introduced to Sri Lanka from Brazil by the Portuguese in the Sixteenth Century. More than half the cashew extant is confined to areas in the dry zone like Puttalam, Anamaduwa, Elluwankulama, Nikaweratiya, Mannar, Batticaloa, Ampara, Maha Oya, Moneragala and it is grown even in the Kurunegala District.

..... ( ..... ) (The Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana) Gampaha also. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, in Gampaha and in Colombo also.

Cashew is a tree that could be grown throughout the Island. In Jaffna and Mannar, there are large acres of cashew plantation. When you go to the Eastern Province, Sir, it is a sight to see - from Kattankudi up to about Periya Neelawanai or Thurai Neelawanai in Kalmunai, that is about a distance of ten miles - cashew trees are grown on both sides of the road. Even you know that, Hon. Gunawardena. Also in Jaffna, cashew has been grown. So, without much effort, manuring or labouring, if you plant a cashew tree, it gives . ?

, , Gaffooriya Arabic College . . . The late Alhaj N.D.H. Abdul Caffoor donated that land to a Boys' Home and for many other voluntary purposes. Today, most of that land is occupied by our Sinhala brothers and others as well. Even in that land around the Arabic School, there are cashew trees.

When we go to the Eastern Province, the best cashew - raw as well as fried - could be bought from Eravur, the third-order administrative division. Those days, when we used to go to Eravur, there was a uncle of mine, Deen Baas Mama, who was building a Mosque there. A Mudliyar, Dr. Fareeth Meera Lebbe, who was once a

Deputy Minister in this House used to give us packets of cashew and my uncle used to bring them. Recently, when we went there, the Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana, a former MP, and also Hon. Habis Nazeer Ahamed, a Provincial Minister in the Eastern Provincial Council gave us packets of cashew. There is also a very good friend of mine, Mr. Abdul Razaak at "Tokyo Tailors", who also gives us packets of cashew. They do not allow us to return to Colombo empty-handed.

Cashew is such a lovely fruit. As I told you, it is good for our skin, colour, health and it helps us to keep up our body healthy and also helps us to have a sound sleep. Cashew is served in almost all the airlines also. What I wanted to tell you, Hon. Minister, is that in order to serve cashew in our own airlines, we have to purchase cashew from abroad at a cost above the price that we could buy here in Sri Lanka. So, we must resort to buy packeted cashew from our producers to serve our passengers who travel by the SriLankan Airlines and also by Mihin Lanka.

Sir, when I was a Minister and in charge of the Puttalam Electorate, the then Minister of Plantation Services, the Hon. M.L.M. Aboosally came and opened a Cashew Processing Centre at Senakudirippu on the Kurunegala Road. The present Chairman of the Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation knows that very well.

He is Mr. Sanath Weerakoon, a lovely gentleman. His face is like a " ." He is very fair and smart. . . . GA . . . , . , General Manager. after about 45 years, they gave bonus to the employees. They increased their bonus. Mind you, the amount of income they derive by popularizing cashew packets. Now, there are about 12,600 employees. This is a record, Sir, that we must appreciate. The credit should go to our Hon. Minister also, who is heading this Corporation. Therefore, Sir, it is a well-known fact that cashew is a produce that could be marketed throughout the world.

Sir, cashew has been developed as a distinct identity in the world as a snack food even in comparison with other competing tree nuts such as almonds, pistachio and walnuts. Its rich food value in terms of protein, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins are acceptable not only to consumers, but also to medical and food scientist. Cashew is also botanically known as "Anacardium occidentale".

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

585 586

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me two more minutes, Sir. So, I am very happy to move this Motion in order to encourage the popularization of cashew, so that we will be able to have a good income locally too. I also want to suggest to the Hon. Minister to establish sales outlets throughout the Island. Earlier, there was a sales outlet in Galle Road, Kollupitiya put up by the Ministry of Plantation Industries but it is no more now. There is also a report in my hand prepared by Mr. A.M. Jaufer, the President of Chamber of Tourism and Industry. He has given us a project report as to how to popularize cashew cultivation in order to boost tourism and industry in Pasikuda, Nilaweli and also in Pottuvil, Arugambay areas. That is an important project to study and implement.

Now, Sir, I think I must read you a very interesting song which the Hon. Reginold Cooray, Minister of Minor Export Crop Promotion will love to hear because he is a singer of class, not only of Sinhalese but even Hindi songs.

Sir, what has happened to the "Kadju Girls" in Bataleeya? I remember during the time of the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, - we were also going behind his motorcade to Kandy - when Zhou Enlai, the Prime Minister of China came here; he stopped the car at Bataleeya after seeing the "Kadju Girls" and bought cashew. He also had a king coconut.

. , . . , . . . . . [5.35 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I was elated to listen to the speech of the Hon. Reginold Cooray, our Minister, and realized what an important Motion I have brought in before the House today. .

He mentioned about Goa, so is Kerala. In Kerala, there are factories all over. It is a vast area, just like Sri Lanka. As you know, Kerala also grows cashew, jak, breadfruit, coconut, arecanut, pepper, and even tea. Whatever we grow, Kerala also grows; whatever Kerala grows, we also grow. But, they have a systematic method adopted in order to get more revenue and provide employment, particularly to the womenfolk in that country.

Therefore, Sir, I would express my thanks to the Hon. Neranjan Wickramasinghe, Member for Kurunegala and also to Minister Reginold Cooray, who are ably supporting me.

I only want to say this much. Cashew is being exported. The cashewnut is a very important nut. It is exported to countries like Saudi Arabia, Canada, USA, Britain, Japan, China, Australia and to many other countries. Sir, when we visit embassies here, particularly the Iran Embassy, they serve us with pistachios. Likewise, if we visit foreign countries, they serve us with pistachios, cashewnuts, walnuts, and fruits like that. However, they prefer cashew more than any other fruit grown in their country, Sir.

2012 145.7. 2013 51.0. 2012 1,703. 2013 75.0.

. You can produce non-alcoholic beverage out of cashew. I think the Muslims would like this very much. They can promote it so that a large number of Muslims will go for this beverage .

non-alcoholic beverages, , , . . You can popularize this. This is a very good drink because even when you go to the Holy City of Mecca, they have non-alcoholic beer.

A large number of our pilgrims going to Mecca. I am very happy to state in this House that a contingent of Umrah pilgrims flew to Jeddah last week from the Mattala Airport.

The people who are growing cashew in the Eastern Province - the Muslims and the farmers - have easy access to the Mattala Mahinda Rajapaksa International Airport. It is from there that they go. This is a new chapter in aviation and human transport. Therefore, as the Hon. Minister said, we are very happy and I insist that these things be taken into consideration.

I would also like to suggest to the Hon. Minister to have a press at the Ministry of Mass Media and Information. He can always have access to Dr. Charitha Herath and Dr. Ariyaratne Athugala. They will be very helpful to us in order to have a press and popularize, particularly, the non-alcoholic cashew beverage.

, General Manager .

Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

In fact, today, there are two reasons for education in the English Medium. One is the demand in the market for people who know the English Language well and who can deal with issues in English. The other one is that all higher education institutions are supposed to teach in the English Medium, especially the Law College, which even stipulates that the Entrance Examination be done in the English. Today, a major part of the higher education is provided by institutes that give training, and send students for sitting exams from foreign universities and from foreign institutes that promote education for professions. So, under these circumstances, it is necessary that the school system provides facilities to study in the English Medium.

My Colleague, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, has also stressed the need for English education to be provided, free of charge, by the State. That is the most important matter. All governments are committed to free education in this country. So, if you have to find English education only in private schools, which are so-called international schools, then the commitment of the Government to

provide free education is not being met. Today, most parents who cannot admit their children to popular schools look for the other alternatives, which are international schools, for the education of their children.

When we talk about teaching in the English Medium in our State schools, they often give an excuse that they cannot find teachers to teach in the English medium. Unfortunately, I do not understand why the State says so, while international schools that are coming up in small towns all over the country are able to find people to teach in the English medium. I am sure the Deputy Minister of Education, who has opened so many branches of his international school, could advise the Ministry as to how to find English medium teachers to teach in the State sector. I am sure there are a large number of people, able and willing, to serve in Government schools to teach in the English medium. If the State fails to provide facilities to study under the free education system in the English medium, then the State is failing and is being unfair to those parents and the children who prefer to study in the English medium.

Those who seek to study in the English Medium must be provided the facility to study in the English Medium. I have been arguing this at the special Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Education that was drawing up an Education Act that every child who prefers to study in the English Medium should be provided facilities to do so, and my Colleagues Motion today is confirming that proposal that I put forward at the said special Consultative Committee and I am so pleased to second this Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to take this opportunity to second the Adjournment Motion brought in by the Hon. Tissa Attanayake. In fact, it is no secret today that Sri Lankas democratic institutions have been under severe attack by the Rajapaksa regime over the last several years. In fact, we know that since the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunge, some of the best media people either have been killed, assaulted or many, in fact, have had to seek exile or refugee status in foreign countries, and the other journalists who are living in Sri Lanka have had to resort to self-censorship to survive. Today, after years of exercising violence, intimidation and coercion to silent Sri Lanka's mainstream media, the regime is now turning its eyes completely on the web-based media, which has been the last refuge of the countrys truth seekers and those who have dissenting opinions.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the censorship of credible news websites is proof that the Rajapaksa Governments true aim is to suppress all news sources which fiercely refuse to toe the regimes propaganda line and continue to expose truth and corruption rampant within the State machinery. In fact, as the Hon. Tissa Attanayake just stated, some of the most popular websites, seven in all, - eight, in fact, with the "tamilnet" which was, of course, banned sometime ago - have been blocked in recent times. The seven websites which have been blocked are "lankaenews", "colombotelegraph", "lankanewsweb", "srilankamirror", "lankaguardian", "theindependent" and "jaffnamuslim". Here, I am using the word blocked because this Government is now resorting to an insidious method of censoring news, not by actually officially banning any news station but by using Chinese technology. In fact, I have talked about this about one-and-a-half years ago in this House how they have brought Chinese experts to the Ministry of Defence, so that many of these websites can be blocked without going through the procedures of banning a website. In fact, "lankaenews" and "colombotelegraph" have been two of the most vociferous websites and both these websites are run by two very senior journalists, who were living in Sri Lanka until a few years ago. They had to leave the country because of serious threats against their lives. When based in Sri Lanka, as the Hon. Attanayake said, "lankaenews" was attacked several times by, as usual, unknown elements. The office, I believe, was bombed about twice and was subject to some arson attacks and finally, Mr. Sandaruwan Senadheera, was compelled to go into exile in the United Kingdom, and now he is running this website because of his love for this country, all by himself, without any funding from anyone in order to keep the Sri Lankan public alive to the horrendous things which are happening in this country today.

Of course, "theindependent", as the Hon. Tissa Attanayake said, is run by Mrs. Diana Gamage, a UNP candidate at the Provincial Councils elections last time. It is not a porn site; it is not a terrorist site; it is actually a news website which gives a very balanced view of what is happening in this country today.

The "srilankamirror" is a website run by a colleague of mine, Mr. Ruwan Ferdinandes. These two websites have been subjected to a lot of harassment over the years. In fact, I remember on the 29th of June, 2012, the office of this website was raided by the CID; I went there myself and had to have an argument with those people there on why they were raiding it, and to my surprise they actually said that the place was raided because some of the news items of that website violated the majestic aura of the President, without knowing that Sri Lanka now has a Republican Constitution. We do not have a king; we do not have a monarchy - . raid 60 . After our lawyers appeared, the lady we managed to get out after one day. But, that case is still continuing and they got permission from the courts to continue with the website.

Despite all this, an invisible hand is directing the TRC. Even though the Minister, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, is here to answer on behalf of the Government, this gentleman has nothing to do with this banning. In fact, the TRC itself has no right, Sir, to take decisions of this nature or to ban any website, because I, as the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in 1996, brought an amendment to the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act to establish the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka. According to that Act, the Director-General absolutely has no right, whatsoever, to be blocking or banning or to take such decisions. Of course, according to that Act, the Chairman should be the Secretary to the Ministry of Telecommunications. But, today, as you know, all the plum institutions have been hijacked by the Presidential Secretariat and today, this institution has also been gazetted under the President. Therefore, the Chairman of the TRC is now none other than Presidents Secretary, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga. So, it is they who have to answer us. I know you will have to give a standard answer, because we know you had nothing to do with it. We know who was sending the SMSs. , websites SMS . . . I also would like to tell Mr. Palpita, that by carrying out these illegal orders, as a senior Civil Servant he is putting his own future in jeopardy. . . . " " . .
