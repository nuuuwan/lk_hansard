( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. R. Sampanthan. You have 45 minutes

[1.43 p.m.]. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Presiding Member, we are discussing today the Votes of the Ministry of Defence, the Minister of Defence being His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Secretary to the Ministry being his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who rumour has it will probably be a Member of this House fairly soon. We would welcome that.

May I, Sir, in dealing with the Votes of this Ministry, have your indulgence to raise certain issues relating to this Ministry that has an impact on the life of civilians in this country. I do not do this, Sir, in a spirit of confrontation, but I do think that in this House, in particular, we should have the freedom of expression and we should be able to articulate the feelings of the people we represent. After all, we claim to be a vibrant democracy and it is therefore imperative that if that claim of ours is to be recognized and respected, that such freedoms are freely exercised, not merely in this House, but by all people who live in this country.

I wish to first refer to the investigation which has been mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council, which has appointed a panel of investigators and a panel of experts. These persons have been appointed by the UN establishment. They have not been allowed to enter the country. They cannot carry out any investigations or record any evidence in Sri Lanka. If I might say so, with respect, this is clearly not consistent with the conduct of a party that proclaims innocence. At the time of the military operations and until shortly thereafter, the Sri Lankan

307 308

Governments position was that it was conducting a humanitarian operation with the policy of zero civilian casualty. This was the Sri Lankan position when the war came to an end. The true position, however, seems very different. No one can blame the Sri Lankan Government for conducting a war against the LTTE. Different considerations apply in relation to civilians. The Government estimated the civilian population in that area, the Wanni, where the war was raging at around 70,000.

Eventually around 290,000 civilians came out from that area. The true figure of the people there is believed to be over 350,000 civilians. Government officials and civil society activists have testified to that effect.

It was a war conducted without any independent witnesses. Members of Non-Governmental Organizations and International Non-Governmental Organizations were asked to leave that area in September, 2008 without consideration of the consequent harm to the civilian population in that area, because it was these voluntary organizations that were till then largely responsible for supplying the population in that area with drinking water, food, medicine and shelter, particularly in the context of the Governments gross underestimation of the total population in that area. The ICRC and the UN personnel were asked to leave that area. They were not able to fulfil their mandate in regard to humanitarian and protection issues.

The media, both domestic and international, were kept out of that area. Members of Parliament were not permitted to go to that area. Persons who came out of that area - eventually about 290,000 persons came out - were detained in detention centres called, welfare centres. We placed on record in Parliament all that happened at that time, as and when, it happened. What we said in Parliament was not contradicted. Grave civilian casualties raised issues in regard to violations of International Human Rights and International Humanitarian Laws. The matter was eventually taken up by the Human Rights Council. Three Resolutions have been adopted by the UN Human Rights Council, the latest one being in March 2014, which authorized an independent international investigation. This could have been averted if the Sri Lankan Government had set up a credible, transparent, domestic investigation after the adoption of the Resolutions in 2012 and 2013.

Now, the international investigators and the Panel of Experts appointed by the UN establishment are being denied entry into Sri Lanka. Citizens of this country who are possessed of the knowledge and information and who are able and willing to testify before the international investigators in regard to what happened to them and their compatriots are being denied their legitimate right to do so.

This is a denial of their fundamental rights as citizens of this country. This is also a blatant denial of their right to justice. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan Government, through persons in authority, has been publicly stating that any one who testifies before or assists the investigation in any way would be violating Sri Lankas Constitution or its laws and would be prosecuted. This is clearly intended to intimidate witnesses and prevent them from making available information or giving evidence on matters within their knowledge, matters that are known to them.

I wish to pose the question whether such action would serve the long-term interests of this country though it may serve the short-term interests of some individuals. No witnesses and victims protection law exists in this country. A Bill was brought to Parliament sometime around 2007/2008, at the time when the Udalagama Commission was investigating certain grave violations of human rights. The Bill was taken up for debate and thereafter, it was abandoned. There had been commitments made to the international community that the victim and witnesses protection law will be passed in this country, but that commitment has not yet been kept.

While on this matter, Sir, I need to refer to a news item that appeared in The Island newspaper on Saturday, the 1st of November. I want to specifically deny the correctness of that report. The TNA has no official by the name referred to in that report, nor has the TNA engaged in collecting any such documents as is alleged in that report. While the TNA laments that citizens of this country are being denied the opportunity of appearing before and testifying before an investigative panel appointed by the UN, the TNA is certainly not engaged in any activity, which would not be in conformity with the required standards of such investigative processes.

In the Joint Communiqu, Sir, issued by the President and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the conclusion of the visit of the Secretary-General of the UN to Sri Lanka on 23rd May, 2009, the Sri Lankan Government committed itself to address the question of accountability. Accountability and reconciliation can be addressed meaningfully only through genuine, credible processes. They cannot be addressed through processes that are spurious and such processes cannot achieve the desired results. The Sri Lankan Government, in my submission, needs to rethink its whole approach to this question of accountability and reconciliation in the long-term interests of this country.

Before I get on to my next point, Sir, may I have your indulgence to refer to some observations made by the Internal Panel appointed to review the working of the UN during the crucial stages of the war in Sri Lanka, certain observations made by the Secretary-General of the UN himself and also certain observations made by the

309 310

[ . ]

2014 04

International Independent Group of Eminent Persons who served in Sri Lanka at the time of the functioning of the Udalagama Commission that was tasked with the responsibility of investigating certain grave violations of human rights.

Sir, this is what the Report of the Internal Panel appointed to review the working of the UN during the final stages of the war stated. In fact, there was some dissatisfaction with the way in which the UN establishment functioned during the final stages of the war and this Panel was appointed to go into that question.

The Panel stated, I quote:

Between August 2008 and May 2009, as the war between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) entered its final stages, an estimated 360,000 or more civilians were crowded into an ever smaller part of the Wanni area of Northern Sri Lanka where many died as a result of sustained artillery shelling, illness and starvation. Almost 280,000 survivors were forcibly interned in military-run camps outside the area of conflict.

A further observation they make is, I quote:

The UNs failure to adequately counter the Governments under-estimation of population numbers in the Wanni, the failure to adequately confront the Government on its obstructions to humanitarian assistance, the unwillingness of the UN in UNHQ and Colombo to address Government responsibility for attacks that were killing civilians, and the tone and content of UN communications with the Government and Member States on these issues, contributed to the unfolding of dramatic events.

The third observation in regard to the Report of this Panel is, I quote:

Sri Lankas peaceful and stable progress will require a process of accountability and reconciliation and a political solution to the long-standing grievances of all communities, as well as a response to ongoing and new concerns, and prevention and protection in the future. Working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka, the UN needs to take on this further challenge.

The Panel of Experts, Sir, in their Report, emphasized the need to address accountability and reconciliation in a meaningful way and also emphasized the fact that if accountability and reconciliation were to be addressed in a meaningful way, in a way in which the entire citizenry in this country could accept it, there had to be a political solution. That political solution would enthuse the question of accountability and reconciliation to be addressed in a moderate, reasonable and sensible way.

I wish to quote, as I mentioned earlier, certain remarks made by the UN Secretary-General in September, 2013. In fact, when he made these remarks His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself was personally present.

I quote :

"In a rare admission of systemic failure of the UN, its chief has said the world body had failed during the final stages of Sri Lankas ethnic war in 2009 that saw military defeat of the LTTE.

Ban made the remarks while addressing the UN General Assemblys 68th session on Tuesday where Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa was also present.

These remarks were made in the presence of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

I further quote:

The Secretary-General said as an immediate step, he will organize a senior-level team to give 'careful consideration' to the reports recommendations and advise him on the way forward. 'Other action will follow in short order', he said

So, in other words Sir, the Secretary-General himself had accepted the fact that there have been certain failures by the UN establishment during certain crucial stages of the war, which needed to be addressed and that those issues are being investigated by the UN system through their internal processes.

I also want to refer finally, Sir, to certain observations made by the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons - IIGEP - when they were in Sri Lanka assisting the Udalagama Commission at the final Press Conference they held on 14th April 2008 before they withdrew from their mandate and left the country. At the final media briefing of the IIGEP on 14th April of 2008, the results of intense military action taken by the Sri Lankan Government against the LTTE having a harmful impact on the Tamil civilians came up and the IIGEPs response was that such a situation would amount to a clear violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws and would inevitably have its own consequences. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons comprised of 11 persons from different countries the world over, was chaired by the retired Chief Justice of India, Justice P.N. Bhagwati. This is the observation they made, Sir.

Finally they said, I quote:

Summary executions, massacres, disappearances, wanton destruction of property and forcible transfer of population can never be justified. No efforts should be spared to uncover responsibility, including recognition of command responsibility, for such actions. The IIGEP has, however, found an absence of will on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka in the present inquiry to investigate cases with vigour, where the conduct of its own forces has been called into question.

That was in reference to the matters being investigated by the Udalagama Commission and the role of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons to assist and guide that Commission.

In the course of that final interview, Sir, it so happened that a journalist who was aware of the situation in the North and the East at that point of time, raised this question of what the impact would be on international human rights and humanitarian laws if the Sri Lankan Government disregarding the rights of civilians,

311 312

disregarding the safety of civilians, disregarding the entitlement of civilians, carried out a ruthless operation against the LTTE and the answer given by them clearly was that it would be unacceptable; that it would be in violation of international humanitarian and international human rights laws. And, exactly all that they quoted as being the possibility: massacre, summary executions, disappearances, displacement, destruction, all of it happened in the course of the war in its final stages.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Why does the Hon. Sampanthan, being a leader of a Party, not speak about the massacres by the Tigers?

( ) (The Presiding Member) No, no. That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sampanthan, you continue with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I would earnestly appeal to you, Hon. Azwer, not to disturb me.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is not disturbing. It is my right to ask a question. ( ) (The Presiding Member) You cannot raise questions at this moment. It is his time. Hon. Sampanthan, please continue.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I now get onto my second point, Sir. That is, the Northern Provincial Council and its governance. Sir, governance can only be with the assent of the governed. Governance cannot take place without the assent of the governed. The verdict of the Northern Provincial Council Election clearly indicates the democratic wish of the people of the North. I wish to place that verdict before

you. The elections were held for the Northern Provincial Council in September, 2013. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchchi received a total vote of 353,595 which was 78.48 per cent of the total vote at that election. The United Peoples Freedom Alliance received a total vote of 82,838 which was 18.38 per cent. Seventy-eight per cent against 18 per cent. That was the difference and the Muslim Congress received 6,761 votes which was 1.50 per cent. The ITAK won 30 seats, the UPFA won seven seats and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress won one seat. This vote, Sir, is clearly indicative of the wish of the people of the Northern Province as to who should govern them at the provincial level.

That verdict of the people must be respected. Sovereignty is vested in the people. In respect of matters that come within the competence of the Provincial Government, the democratic verdict of the people of the Northern Province must be respected. The Northern Provincial Council Election was not held to cast into the dustbin the democratic verdict of the people in the Northern Province. If that be the attitude of the Government, it must have consequences. Though the current provincial council arrangements are largely inadequate, even the present constitutional arrangements in the form of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act came into being largely through the demands of the Tamil people for the sharing of political power in the North and the East and through the sacrifices made by the Tamil people. While in the Northern Province, the Chief Minister and the Provincial Government are being impeded at every turn in the performance of their legitimate duties, in the Eastern Province through an unholy alliance, contrary to the wishes of the people as demonstrated by their democratic verdict at the elections held in September 2012, we have a Chief Minister who will act only as directed by the Central Government. The irony of this situation is that the other seven provinces who never demanded power sharing enjoy a measure of autonomy even beyond the Thirteenth Amendment while frustration pervades the political environment in the North and the East.

This, Sir, I respectfully submit is a travesty of justice and cannot continue. The excessive presence of the armed forces, particularly in the North and also in the East, is a largely contributory factor to the erosion of the powers of provincial governance, and the lack of an environment that can facilitate the fulfilment of the democratic wishes of the local people. The conclusion is inevitable that the Central Government and the armed forces do not want provincial governance in the North and the East to be successful. This is a deliberate subversion of the democratic wish of the people, which has a seriously adverse impact on their future politically, economically, socially and culturally.

It is the duty of the Central Government, I submit, to extend to the Provincial Government all the assistance

313 314

[ . ]

2014 04

required to make provincial governance a success under the present constitutional arrangements. The Sri Lankan Government must also realize that it has committed itself to take further steps to make devolution more meaningful and more purposeful. It is also said in this regard that commitments made to the Provincial Government and the Chief Minister of the Northern Province have not been honoured.

Efforts to sabotage the effective functioning of provincial governance must inevitably have undesirable results. Sir, this will be tantamount to stating that only Tamil politicians loyal to the Government can successfully engage in provincial governance, whatever maybe the verdict, whatever may be the democratic wish of the people of the province. The position of the Central Government appears to be, regardless of the verdict of the people of the Northern Province, provincial governance can only be carried out by persons from the province who are loyal to the Government and by the Central Government. Such an authoritarian attitude must inevitably lead to undesirable consequences in the whole country. It will only mean that democracy in Sri Lanka is no longer of any value.

I would like to deal, Sir, next with the question of land in both the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, which is the main problem that we have. Particularly in areas like Valikamam in the North and Sampur in the East, we have done our best to get the Government to be able to look at these things objectively and come to fair decisions. But, we have thus far not been successful in having those lands returned to our people though we have done all that we could do to enable that. High Security Zones were declared in the Northern Province and in the Eastern Province, quite understandably, when the LTTE possessed long range artillery and there was a possibility of that artillery being able to reach security installations in the North and the East. In such a situation, the Government cleared certain areas up to a point beyond the reach of the LTTE artillery to ensure the security of those security installations. That is understandable; that is legitimate. But, now the war is over; the LTTE is over; LTTE artillery is not there. So, there is no need for a High Security Zone. These are lands on which these people have lived for generations and centuries. They have lived on that land. They have farmed on that land. They have cultivated on that land. They have derived their livelihood from that land for generations and centuries. We went to the Supreme Court both in regard to Valikamam and in Sampur, you gave a commitment to the Supreme Court that those lands would be returned to the people; that in keeping with best practices once the lands have been demined and all the explosives removed, that people will be resettled, but it has not been done yet. I raised the matter in Parliament, particularly in regard to Sampur. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa stood up here and gave us the assurance that the people will be resettled; that people can go back. But, that has not happened.

His Excellency the President went to Jaffna. I would have been a very happy man if he had gone to these camps and seen for himself the position, the situation in which these people are living in several camps in Valikamam. Unfortunately, he did not go. I hope he will go again and when he goes there next time he will see for himself.

I want to make an appeal to the Defence Secretary - you are a very pragmatic person -to kindly give your mind to this question of the people going back to their lands not only in Valikamam and Sampur, wherever land had been taken over by the Army. In all districts of the North and the East, land has been taken over by the Army even after the war came to an end. Kindly return those lands to those people because they need those lands to live, to reside, to carry on their livelihood in keeping with what they have done for several generations and centuries.

I will deal lastly with three matters. I would like to lump them together because I am short of time. The first is, in regard to the functioning of Non-Governmental Organizations. The second is in regard to special passes required by visitors from abroad to go to the North. They can be truly fully foreigners or they can be Sri Lankans who hold a foreign passport for the reason that they have lived in some foreign country for a long period of time. The third is the question of dual citizenship.

I will deal with the dual citizenship first, Sir. Persons are entitled to apply for dual citizenship. A number of Sri Lankans living abroad have applied for dual citizenship because they want to be citizens of Sri Lanka. In whatever circumstances they went abroad , now that this facility is available - it had been suspended for some time but now it has now been reactivated - they want to come and back and get citizenship in Sri Lanka. If they do that, that is going to benefit Sri Lanka more than anyone else because if they come here, they are going to invest, they are going to buy property and they are going to start businesses. They will do various things.

Now, the persons who require passes to go to the North in regard to foreigners, well, it is for you to decide. I should think that if they come on a visa to Sri Lanka, they should be able to go to any part of Sri Lanka. But, in regard to persons who went abroad some years ago, have now become citizens abroad and want to come back because they have their relatives, their parents and their next-of-kin living in the North, they have temples in the North; they have properties in the North. So, they want to come back, they want to invest here, they want to start business here. You should encourage them. That will be good for the country as a whole; that will be good for the people living in the North. So, why should they be subjected to things like passes and inconvenience.

It is my respectful submission that the Non-Governmental Organizations have always made very

315 316

valuable contributions to the improvement of the quality of life of our people in several ways. I am not saying that they must be allowed to do anything illegal. I am not, for a moment, asking that they be permitted to adopt any modalities which are questionable or illegal. But, if they function in a legal way, I think they must have the right to function without any restriction, without any embarrassment, without any disturbance and without any inconvenience.

These are my humble requests. I would request the Hon. Minister of Defence, particularly the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence to give his mind to these matters and see to what extent these issues can be addressed in a reasonable way.

Thank you, Sir.

The Department of State of America has released its latest statement, which states, The LTTE used its international contacts and the large Tamil Diaspora in North America, Europe, and Asia to procure weapons, communications, funding, and other needed supplies. The LTTE's international network of sympathizers and financial support persists and LTTE Members and supporters still operate in Sri Lanka and South India.

TNA , . I must say in this House that the TNA has brought misery to the Tamil people, not joy. - [Interruption.] Yes, that is my view. Prabhakaran is a ruthless killer. He killed pregnant women, cutting open their tummies, taking out the foetuses and chopping them like fish. One of the TNA MPs said that Prabakaran is a hero. That is the attitude of the TNA. Another TNA Member stated in this House a few days ago that, at the way things are going on, Tamil people do not have any other option other than to go for an Eelam.

In my opinion, Sir, the TNA should not be here in Parliament, enjoying all the facilities and privileges like they are doing today; in my opinion, the TNA should have been banned the moment the LTTE was crushed because in other countries, the corresponding political parties have vanished. When Hitler was defeated, his Nazi Party was destroyed; when Pol Pot was killed, his political party, the Khmer Rouge Political Party, vanished; when Saddam Hussein was killed, his Baath Political Party was destroyed and when Hosni Mubarak was taken out of power, his political party was banned. But, after we comprehensively defeated the LTTE, we allowed you to stay because of the compassion of our President and you are taking advantage of that doing treacherous activities abroad and letting down our motherland. - [Interruption. ]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara)That is not a point of Order. Do not take my time. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Sarath Weerasekara, you continue with your speech.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara)Then, Sir, the Hon. Sumanthiran said that the army is occupying a large number of lands in Jaffna. Also, both the TNA and your Chief Minister, Wigneswaran say "Sinhalization" and "Militarization". I must ask what happened to the 24,000 Sinhalese who were living in Jaffna in 1981? Through natural growth, you must understand that by now, there would have been 100,000 Sinhalese families in Jaffna. - [Interruption. ] What about the 15,000 Muslims who were living in Jaffna? You are not talking about them. You are only talking about the land that is being taken over by the army. That is your attitude. That is ethnic cleansing and you definitely supported the ethnic cleansing of the LTTE. That is why there are no Sinhalese and Muslims in the Jaffna Peninsula. I propose to the House that we should definitely resettle all the Muslims and the Sinhalese who were chased out from the Jaffna Penninsula years back. - [Interruption.] How many minutes more have I got, Sir?

( ) (The Presiding Member) You are almost nearing the end of the time allotted to you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara)Sir, give me two more minutes.

Your Chief Minister, Wigneswaran says there is "Sinhalization". I must say that both his sons are married to Sinhalese women. He was born, lived and worked here in Colombo among the Sinhalese; he virtually lived all his life in Colombo. Also, he attended the most popular boys schools in Colombo with the Sinhalese. He became a Supreme Court Judge. So, he is the least qualified person to talk against the desire of the Sinhalese to live in the Jaffna Peninsula.

Also, he talks about militarization. What did he speak about for the last 30 years? It was about the de facto rule of the LTTE in the Jaffna Peninsula. He never condemned the LTTE-rization Did he ever talk on behalf of the low caste Tamils and against the LTTE taking their children and using them as canon fodder, as child soldiers? So, what did he do all this time? After keeping mum for 30

years, all of a sudden he has woken up and is talking about the Sinhalese militarization.

Also, I must tell this to the Hon. Suresh Premachandran. He talked about his dream of Eelam. I must tell him that his dream of Eelam will never come true. It will never happen as long as we live; it will never happen as long as he lives, or even after his death. Even in Hell, he will not see an Eelam because that is the place he will be going after death, to meet Prabhakaran and all his comrades there. When "Yama Rajjuruwo" starts skinning you alive for the atrocities you have committed to mankind, just think of me, and I will put a bucket of salt water on your body from Heaven .

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe. You have 20 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) . Sir, I have 25 minutes.

( ) (The Presiding Member) From whom are you getting the other five minutes? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Five minutes will be given to me by the Hon. Vijitha Herath. , five minutes ?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Why do you not tell? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I will tell that later. Sir, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, the Leader of the TNA spoke on the 30th of October in this House. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe)

. . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) My dear Friend, I will tell you one thing. What I have done is done. Do you think that I have come from the gutters? My family has had money; my forefathers and my grandfathers had money even before you could walk. You could not even speak English. It was the late Hon. Monty Gopallawa who had you in his house, gave you the education and made you a lawyer but what did you do in that house? Do you want me to talk about those things? Sir, let me apologize for bringing in personal matters. But, when Members behave in such a manner, that is the only way we can make them understand.

Sir, let me now refer to the speech made by the Hon. R. Sampanthan on the 30th of October where he stated that during the time bilateral discussions were taking place between the TNA and the UPFA Government Group, there was an agreement signed or a consensus

337 338

2014 04

reached, and that he was going to table the relevant document. I was very eagerly awaiting for that document and I have been going to the Parliamentary Library so many times, but unfortunately up to now, I have not seen a document like that been tabled. I have, of course, seen from your speech two other documents. One was a statement made by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the other was by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva. So, I would like to ask the Hon. Member whether this was a fictitious statement made or whether, in fact, there is a document as such that we do not know about.

Also, in the speech that the Hon. R. Sampanthan made during the Second Reading Debate of the Budget, in Column No. 951 of the Hansard of 30th October, 2014, he has stated, I quote:

President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Planning also, has presented his 10th Budget. In my view, the Budget seeks to ensure that he would present many more Budgets.

He goes on to state further, I quote:

It must not be denied that there are benefits that accrue to the people in the matter of development, in the matter of relief, in the matter of employment and other facilities.

Now, Hon. Sampanthan, I am very happy to see that you have finally, at least once, realized that something positive exists in this country and the fact that President Mahinda Rajapaksas Budget is definitely a blessing to all the people of this country.

If you look at the post-2009 history - in particular to the North and the Northern Provincial Council in that sense - even in your speech today, you were crying out loud for the need of a proper reconciliation, for the need of proper accountability. Hon. Member, you know that after 2009, when there was absolute chaos at the last stages of the war, it was a humanitarian operation that took place because the LTTE was keeping 300,000 odd people as shields, as human captives. Since then, we all know what happened with the LTTE, and how did we proceed on this as a responsible Government? You would have been casting insinuations and saying that we should have reached out to accountability at the beginning of May, 2009. But, what did we do as a Government? We had more important things to take care of. We had to provide them with food, shelter, health and sanitation services and education. We had to bring in infrastructure development and take care of the general upliftment of the people. Then, there was the demining aspect. That was the humanitarian aspect of it. Infrastructure development came second.

Today, the growth of the economy in the Northern Province is more than 24 per cent. Why? Because the Government has invested a colossal amount of money exceeding US Dollars 4 billion. Then, came up the next step: reconciliation. Yes, there was a need for reconciliation and there is still a need for reconciliation.

Then, there was the setting-up of the LLRC. One hundred and eighty five recommendations have been made and about 35 to 40 per cent of those recommendations have been fulfilled and is in progress. But, there is one thing that is vital. The fundamental aspect in this whole equation of achieving total reconciliation at a rapid pace is missing. You would agree, Hon. Sampanthan, that if you do want to have reconciliation, there has to be two sides. The members of that community, the peers of that community must reach out for reconciliation. I might say that the TNA today represents the Tamil polity. So, you as well must reach out for reconciliation.

Then, came up the aspect of franchise. For forty long years the right of franchise was denied to the people of the North because of the war. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave them that as well. We knew very well that you would be victorious in the Northern Provincial Council Election. But, we had to give you that. That is something that had to be given.

Finally, came up the aspect of accountability. We have had a trajectory from 2009 up to now where the primary concern was the people of the North. Then, there were the development of infrastructure, education and health, the aspect of reconciliation and finally the aspect of accountability. Out of all these aspects, look at the aspect of accountability. On reconciliation, my earnest appeal to the TNA is, let us stop talking. You can talk about it for another 30 to 50 years. Why do you not reach out with your people to our people to achieve that reconciliation?

The Hon. Sampanthan in his speech very clearly elaborated on the exercise of the UN investigative panel. Sir, we are not bound to accept that.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, can I have a little more time? I think we can sort that out. Can you please give me five more minutes? I will sort that out with the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena.

So, look at the aspect of accountability. We have a Commission here which has received more than 20,000 submissions. These are credible submissions, Hon. Sampanthan. There are 20,000 affected people. This Commission has gone from house to house, from village to village seeking this. Look at the aspect of credibility here, vis--vis, what is happening somewhere else on a different agenda. Compare that aspect of credibility.

I appreciate the fact that you differentiated the act of terrorism in your speech today. Let that go into practice.

339 340

Accept the credibility of the Commission on Missing Persons. It is the 20,000 people who lived amongst you, who have gone to that Commission and said, So and so, my next of kin, is missing. So, why not accept that? Why are you alienating those people?

Then, Sir, regarding the utilization of land I would like to say this. After a 30-year long war, military presence must be there to a certain extent. You cannot expect the army to pack up and go. Do not forget that we have released 11,876 ex-combatants after a mere three months rehabilitation programme. - [Interruption.] I do not have time. Fine, let us say that they are all back to normal. But, you are not, as the TNA. Certain segments of the TNA still want separation and you are trying to achieve it in different ways. So, what is the guarantee and what is the trust from the perspective of the larger polity of this country - not from the perspective of the Government - we can have? When I say, "larger polity of this country", I mean the Tamils, Muslims and the Sinhalese. What is the guarantee that we have, as a nation, that they will not go back to terrorism? There is no guarantee because neither of you are behaving in that way.

Since I do not have much time, I have to cut my speech short. I must say that I go to Jaffna quite frequently. I go to Vanni, Mullaitvu and Kilinochchi quite frequently. So, I know that the people there have realized one thing. -[Interruption.] When they voted for the TNA at the Provincial Council Election held in 2004, yes, those were the feelings that they had. But, today they have realized that the TNA themselves are divided. A part of the TNA want a solution from the international community and the other part of the TNA want to work for the people. So, now, the people have realized what they need today is political freedom. Unfortunately, the TNA is suppressing the political freedom of these innocent people.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) That is because there is no freedom for the people. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) There is freedom, Hon. Mavai Senathirajah. But, you are not utilizing that freedom for your own political gain. -[Interruption.] The best example is, the Northern Provincial Council has been given Rs. 63 billion for this year. But, the Southern Provincial Council, where I come from, has got only Rs. 53 billion. Do you see me complaining? No. Why? Because we know that there is a need for that. Rs. 1,200 million has been given to the Chief Minister of the Northern Province. But, he has spent only Rs. 224 million out of that during this year. -[Interruption.] We all know the power of the Governor is

not much. He plays only an administrative role in terms of transfers and so on and so forth. The monetary authority lies with the Chief Minister. The monetary authority as well as the responsibility lies with the Chief Minister. So, you cannot fool the people all the time. You have to wake up. It is only in your interest. On the one side, you do not want new politicians or political personalities to come into politics from the North. On the other, you are suppressing the freedom of the people, and also from another side, there are people instigating terrorism, wanting to go back to terror. Therefore, decide what you want. - [Interruption.] Do you want another war? Do you want a division of this country or do you want reconciliation and development to your people? Decide on that. Your political expediency, your political future and your political existence will take a second place very soon.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up your speech now. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I will conclude, Sir. What is important today was signified by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas visit to Jaffna on the "Yal Devi".

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) For what? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is what has connected the South with the North. So, today the people there have realized that connection once again. But, unfortunately, none of you are realilzing the reality. - [Interruption.] But, the writing is on the wall. There will be a day soon when the people will rise against not the Sinhalese, not against the Government but against the TNA. Remember that will happen soon.

Thank you.

[3.25 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) Sir, thank you very much for the opportunity given to me to speak on this Discussion. I am very glad to speak after my dear Friend, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe. Fortunately, today he did not mention my name because otherwise he always mentions my name. Yesterday also,

341 342

[ ]

2014 04

my dear Friend, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe mentioned my name. He said that Karuna Amman is with the Government; Karuna Amman is with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is correct; that is right.

I want to ask a question. The JVP fought against the Government. But, today they are here. The TNA fought against the Government; today they are also here. So, why can I not be here? - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order, Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Karuna Amman, I said that it is good that you are here.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Deputy Minister, you continue.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) I want to mention about the history of this country. Some senior UNP Members of Parliament, the Hon. John Amaratunga and the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella are here. They know the history; they know what happened in Sri Lanka. In 1989, at the time the IPKF went from Sri Lanka, only 350 LTTE cadres were left. The others were either scattered or dead. After His Excellency President Premadasa took over the leadership of this country, he strengthened the LTTE. He gave more than 5,000 weapons to the LTTE. He gave crores and crores of money to the LTTE, and the 350 LTTE cadres increased to 6,000 within three months. You all talk of the LTTE but you do not know the history. Therefore, I kindly request you not to mention my name. If you mention my name again and again, I will come out with many secrets. Then, you will not be able to go to the West; you will not be able to go to the Central nor will you be able to go to the South.

According to my knowledge, three factors are very important for a military victory. The first is decision making. The second is planning; the third is implementation. I highly appreciate His Excellency

Mahinda Rajapaksa for the brave decision he took to destroy the LTTE through the military. He gave powers to our Defence Secretary, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. He said, Do, whatever you can- [Interruption.] Listen to my speech. The Defence Secretary drew up a good plan, a master plan of how, where and when to start the operation. How did you crush the LTTE? That was in the master plan. He handed it over to the three forces. They implemented the plan very well. That is how we got freedom; that is how victory was achieved. It was a rescue operation.

Our senior Parliamentarian, Sampanthan Aiyar is here. In his speech, he said that it was a massacre. It was not a massacre. It was a rescue operation. More than 10,000 LTTE cadres were there; three hundred thousand Tamil civilians were there. They used the Tamil civilians as a human shield. It was the responsibility of the Government to rescue these people. What else could the Government have done? They had a responsibility to rescue the civilians. That was why a rescue operation was carried out.

Without any damage, you cannot wage war. Damages do happen. I too lost my own brother. He was killed by the LTTE. Everybody suffered. But, again and again do not let the same thing happen. That is what I am saying. Again and again I am saying, do not make Sri Lanka like Syria or Afghanistan. What is happening in those countries? NATO went into Afghanistan. They said that they finished the war and restored peace there but what is happening now? Everyday people are dying; everyday, there are killings; everyday, there are bomb blasts. That is why our Government did not allow the international community to come to Sri Lanka. Do not encourage them.

Our Government appointed the LLRC. Now, the inquiries are openly going on in the North and the East. Your TNA people are encouraging people to go and give evidence. Everybody is going. So, why are you shouting?

What happened in South Africa? If you go to South Africa, you will realize as to what has happened. After the war, they appointed the TRC - Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They never allowed the international community into their country. Go there and find out as to how many people are missing. More than 12,000 people are missing in South Africa. There has been no answer to that question so far. The war in South Africa was more terrible than the war in Sri Lanka. We should not ignore the kind of things that happened in other countries. That is why I say that we have to work together. We have to bring peace. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaka has already brought peace to everybody in this country.

You go and see the number of Mahindodaya Technical Laboratories in the North and the East and the number of computers that have been given to those

343 344

students. The TNA has not given a single computer to the Tamil students. Even the Diaspora has not given a computer for the Tamil students. See the number of Science and Technology Institutes set up there by the Government.

Recently, there was an article in a newspaper. When His Excellency was visiting Jaffna, he had met a girl from Wattala who was studying in Jaffna. His Excellency had asked, "Why are you studying in Jaffna?" She had said, "I got a good chance to study in the Science and Technology Institute in Jaffna. I did not get a chance to study in Colombo. That is why I am here". That shows, Sir, how people are appreciating the development that has taken place there. The education sector is doing very well. Not only education, all the sectors are doing well.

Today, I am very happy to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence. The Vote is not only for defence but for urban development also. Last year, Rs. 135 million was spent for the beautification of the Batticaloa Town. If you go to Batticaloa, you would see how beautiful the Batticaloa Town is. That was also done by the Defence Secretary, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa. That is why I kindly request you to coordinate with them.

Recently, they withdrew more than five army camps in Batticaloa. They allowed people to resettle near the Morakottanchenai Camp area. They totally withdrew the Kiran Camp; they totally withdrew the Kinnayadi Camp; they totally withdrew the Kinnayadi Morwadi Camp and they totally withdrew the Mancholai Camp. We resettled more than 500 families there. Not only that, what is happening in Keppapilavu? Two hundred acres have been given to the people.

You TNA Members always ask, "Why is the army present there?". That is because of you. You people talk of racism. You people encourage violence there. Then, how can the Government withdraw the army? Whether there is an LTTE threat or not, national security is important for the country. Not only Sri Lanka, all the countries need their own army for national security and they cannot be withdrawn. You have to coordinate with them. You have to deal with them.

In case of a disaster, what are you going to do? In 2010 and 2011, we had heavy floods in Batticaloa. At that time, day and night, it was only the armed forces, the army, navy and the air force, who supported me. It was only with their help that we were able to rescue people. Now, what is happening in Koslanda, Badulla? Day and night, under severe weather conditions, the forces are rescuing the people. If a Tsunami comes to Jaffna, what are you going to do? Who is going to save you?

In the same way, with regard to the fishing community in Jaffna, who safeguards their fishing area? Our Sri

Lankan Navy is there to safeguard our sea area. Otherwise, all the Indian fishermen will come into our sea area and they will take all the fish; they will destroy our nets and also our boats. Who is safeguarding the Jaffna fishermen? It is our Navy. You have never safeguarded them; you have never talked about those things. Now, you are talking of international inquiries.

Then, what do you think about the IPKF? When the IPKF was here, they raped a lot of Tamil women. They killed a lot of Tamil people. What have you got to say about that? I ask that question from the TNA Members. At that time you were in India. All of you were abroad. You all do not know the history. You all keep your mouths shut, because otherwise, you cannot go to India. I openly say that many women were raped by the Indian Army. There is a lot of evidence. Go and see; go and ask the people there.

That is why I am telling you, we have to work together; we have to develop this country together. Come and join us. That is what our Excellency President always says, "Our doors are open at any time. You can come and join us; we can work together".

Mr. Chairman, I am happy to address the House when you are in the Chair. After the advent of King Vijaya, never before has geography, topography and the landscape of Sri Lanka had undergone such unbelievable and amazing transformations as it is today under the enlightened leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Therefore, Sir, now there is nothing that the Opposition can do. See what is now happening around the country and around the City of Colombo. Houses are coming up everywhere. A friend of mine, Sadruddin, who came from abroad told me the other day, I come from Hong Kong. I got down in Singapore and

then came here. I looked up to see the skyline of this country. It is so marvellous and beautiful than the skylines of Hong Kong and Singapore. There are houses coming up all over the city in areas like Henamulla, Aluthmawatha, Mayura Place, Fergusons Road, K. Cyril C. Perera Mawatha, Lionel Edirisinghe Mawatha, Maligawatta CGR land site, Estate 31-Orugodawatta site, Estate 54 and 66 sites, Government factory land in Salamulla, Kolonnawa, Angoda and Sirisara Uyana.

Victoria Park Viharamahadevi Park . - when we were studying at Zahira College- We go there to revise our lessons for exams. I remember my past classmates - M.S.M. Nizar, M.Velu Mayil, H.I.M. Cassim, Ismet Zaheed, M.A.A. Ansari,

395 396

C.M.M. Kamaldeen, A.M. Tayoob and all the others - and we enjoyed the beauty in the park. Today, even Mr. A.J.M. Muzammil, Mayor of the UNP-controlled Colombo Municipal Council, is also helping our Government in order to beautify the City of Colombo. This city park has become one of the most scenic beauties of the entire world today. Therefore, the Opposition has nothing to talk about.

I also want to say this. This is Parliament. Sir, you have ensured us the freedom of speech in this House and it is guaranteed by the Standing Orders. The greatest authority on Parliamentary Practice and Procedures, Erskine May, also says, "There is complete freedom in Parliament; although the Speaker has eyes, he cannot see; although he has ears, he cannot hear; although he has a mouth, he cannot speak. That is the wonder of the post of the Speaker in a Parliamentary democracy. Now, there was a note of warning issued to me by the TNA Leader when he spoke in the morning. Just dismissing aside any comment contradictory to his views and attempting to take refuge under a false pretext of enjoying freedom of speech in the House is, surely, displaying an attitude of authoritarianism. He was talking about Jaffna. What authoritarianism are you exercising in Jaffna? We went to Kilinochchi with the President. What do they say?

. . . . ... . , - An alarming news, Sir! It is a note of alarm. In this House, we have people - they say they are representing the people. - , . I must warn the security forces, there are - , - those people are there, and also a Kilinochchi master who gave children as child soldiers to the kotiya is also in this House. Therefore, you have to be very sharp; you have to look around and see.

An MP brought carrots to the House the other day. So, why can we not believe that these people would bring bullets to this House? We have a lot of confidence in the police. They are doing a wonderful job of work. Now, you are talking of a massacre. The Hon. Sampanthan addressed the international diaspora from this House. I am also addressing the international diaspora from here. It was not a massacre. It was a rescue operation. The LTTE was using young and old women, and children as human shields. At the last stages of the war, about 3,000 Tamils came running away from the clutches of the Tigers to the arms of the heroic Sri Lankan Army. They turned into

doctors, parents, father figures and they were not only fighting a war. Today, they are developing the country.

When the Vietnamese Vice-President came, - Mr. Chairman, you hosted him - I asked him, Your Excellency, you had wars in Vietnam for 20 years, you had wars in Korea. What were those American soldiers doing there? "They are nowhere; now they are unknown figures", he said. The army fought the battle and won the freedom for us. The Hon. Sampanthan and others are among the living today because His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa won the war and freed the country from the marauding and atrocious Tigers.

Do not forget that President Mahinda Rajapaksa took the "Yal Devi" safely to Yalpanam. Thousands of people from Jaffna come to Colombo daily and travel from Colombo to Jaffna. It plies from Matara to Jaffna. I must tell the diaspora that this is now one country. It is now united together. It is the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe who gave an undertaking to Prabakaran. He wrote an agreement to say, three-fourth of the sea was yours, and one-fourth of the land was yours.

Today, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has made Sri Lanka "one country". Therefore, I will tell you that, . Parents in Jaffna are bringing their children day and night to see the wonder called the train, when it stops at the Jaffna Railway Station. Why? The present generation has not seen a train before.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon.Azwer, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, Sir, I will wind up.

Now, those children in Jaffna display the greatest evidence of freedom in the country. Boys and girls clad in white uniforms cycle to schools, which is one of the most welcome sights, I should say, in Jaffna. All this transformation has taken place because of the Mahinda Chintana. Now, the world is talking about the Mahinda Chintana including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Geneva, America and Norway.

Finally, Sir, I must say that the Mahinda Chintana has been translated into the Chinese language. Never in history has a policy statement made by a leader of a country been translated into another language. But, the Mahinda Chintana has been translated into the Chinese language by a Professor by the name of Ma Zhongwen of Jinan University in Guangzhou in the Guangdong Province. Sir, I will get that book from Ambassador Niyangoda soon and present it to you.

Thank you.

Sir, I am very thankful to the Hon. Shantha Bandara, our Colleague, for bringing this Motion before the House to indicate to the country that there is a free health service that has taken root very well. Action has been taken to supply ambulances, medical equipment and pharmaceutical drugs. These are required to improve the infrastructure facilities of hospitals. In addition, the pharmaceutical drug production capacity of the Government has been increased to encourage local producers of pharmaceutical drugs. Sir, the present Government - mark my words - is currently incurring a cost of approximately Rs. 150 billion to provide free healthcare facilities to the people. Therefore, free healthcare has been ensured in this country, then and now. Sir, the President is rendering such an immense service to the health sector to reach a top rank in human resources in the Asia-Pacific Region by 2020, as mentioned under Development Goals - 2020 and Beyond of the Budget, 2015.

Then, Sir, I want to hurriedly make mention about the Colombo South Hospital, well administered by the Directors and staff, which is catering to a large number of patients from Colombo up to Kalutara and Avissawella, and even those patients from your Electorate also go there. Sir, if we could provide the facility of having "paying wards" - I have taken this up with the Hon. Minister also - at the Colombo South Hospital, that would

be very helpful because the Merchant's Ward at the National Hospital is always full. Even people who can afford to go to the Merchant's Ward are unable to get admission there, and are forced to enter private hospitals to get treatment.

Sir, the doctors in Parliament also take good care of our health. I must particularly thank them, and mention their names here: Dr. Gamini Udangawa, Dr. (Mrs.) Shanthi Weerasinghe, Dr. (Mrs.) Nimali Moonesinghe and also the Ayurvedic doctor, Dr. (Mrs.) Kanthi Bandara.

Finally, I must thank the Hon. Minister of Health for modernizing the whole health service and running it efficiently. I also thank my Colleague seated next to me, the Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, who is an able lieutenant to the Hon. Minister.

Thank you. [.. 6.49]
