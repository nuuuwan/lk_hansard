( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Speaker, at the outset I must bring to your notice that no Member in the House can question a remark or an Order made by the Chair. Yesterday, when that question was asked suddenly, the Deputy Chairman of the Committees, who was chairing at that time - after consultation - said that it maybe because of a technical error. That is all. Therefore, you cannot question it. - [Interruption.]

The other thing is this. I want to further clarify it. As far as this test transmission is concerned - [Interruption.] May I finish? As far as this test transmission is concerned, it is not a rule or a law; also, it is not even in the Standing Orders. Sir, I have just returned from the United Kingdom after visiting the House of Commons and the House of Lords. - [Interruption.] I want to tell for the information of the Hon. Members of this House that even the mother Parliament does not telecast live the entire proceedings. It is always edited - [Interruption.] . , . .

Therefore, it is not an accepted principle. We like telecasting. We wanted to give the Opposition "bully full". We wanted to give the Opposition belly full, not only "bully full". But, the point is this: A decision must be taken in consultation with both the Government and the Opposition. Procedures adopted by other Parliaments in terms of live telecasts must be followed because, Sir, most of them do not telecast the whole proceedings - even the mother Parliament or the House of Lords does not telecast the entire proceedings. This must be taken

139 140

note of. Therefore, I think we can continue it after reviewing and take a final decision in keeping with the good traditions of the Parliament of Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you. Your observations are noted.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) . . rose. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . [ ] Let him speak.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Deputy Speaker, you mentioned that that was a test run. I think it would be only proper that Parliament is made aware of what the test results are before a decision is made. After all, it involves the whole of Parliament. It is a situation in which the freedom of expression is being stifled. So, if the transmission is to be stopped, it should be done in consultation with the Party Leaders at least at the Party Leaders Meeting. When the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised this issue with the Hon. Speaker of the House, the Hon. Speaker said he would consider all matters before a decision is made. There was a suggestion made that, maybe, there is a need for a code of conduct in relation to the transmission and we agree with that principle. But, to take a unilateral decision and to discontinue the service, I would say, is a stifling of the

rights of citizens to have information and to see how their Representatives behave in Parliament.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Now, the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, please. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I am referring to Standing Order No. 138. The conduct of the Business of the House is done according to the Standing Orders, which have been adopted by Parliament for its good conduct. Standing Order No. 138 is very clear. It states, I quote:

Anything which by these Standing Orders may be done by Mr. Speaker may be done by the Deputy Speaker or Deputy Chairman of Committees or by a member elected by Parliament presiding in the place of Mr. Speaker.

Now, they are misconstruing or misrepresenting what the Hon. Speaker said. He categorically said and it was even published in the newspapers that that was only a test transmission. So, today you can take a decision according to this particular Standing Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, you were giving an interpretation of what is going to happen in Parliament, but what is now being spoken here is shown on the screen in the car park there. So, if that is the case, why can it not go from there, out into the world?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Now, let me answer.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If there is any problem, then it should be -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, there is no problem. The screen outside Parliament has continuously been functioning. The issue is with regard to the transmission over the PEO TV. As all of you are aware, there was no agreement whatsoever between the Parliament of Sri Lanka and the PEO TV over a transmission. On that basis, you may understand that it was only a test transmission. It is up to the parties to come to the table and negotiate, to enter into an agreement based on the final findings of the test transmission. Also, to be very clear, we, as the Parliament of Sri Lanka, have not spent a single cent on this effort of transmission. It is very clear that we have not spent a cent, it was a test transmission and also, it was the idea of the Hon. Speaker to transmit the proceedings live. So, you must, I believe, admire his attempts to transmit the Parliamentary proceedings live. As you know, it is not an easy decision. There are various observations, objections, protests and various viewpoints from all the 225 Members. You are also aware that the Hon. Speaker is out of the country. When he is present, he will take into consideration the outcome of the test transmission, place his position and all observations before the Party Leaders and will come to a final decision. So, this is, under no circumstance, an attempt to curtail the rights or the freedom of the Members of Parliament.

. . . , . . [ ] I have given you enough time; I have listened to you.

8, . ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to just reflect one thing. I admire your ability to come out of a bad situation at this moment and you got your message across. You mentioned that Parliament has not spent a cent on the transmission. We are in charge of the finances of the country. I said that Mobitel has paid for it and that is a Government-owned company.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, will you ask your Question? - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, are you asking the Question?

145 146

2014 22

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Question? If you are dictatorially telling me, I will ask the Question.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I am not dictatorial. But,I have to be mindful of the time.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, you have given him enough room. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Sir. Reluctantly, I will ask the Question. : :

It maybe in the Order Paper, it maybe in the Agenda for the day but at the moment the Chair refers the matter to the Hon. Member. If the Hon. Member gets up and says, "I am not asking the Question", it also amounts to the same. So, we cannot prevent this from happening. Practically, we cannot prevent anything like that.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, I am happy to participate in this Debate moved by my good Friend, the Hon. R.M. Ranjith Madduma Bandara. I extend my felicitation to him for being elected as the Secretary of the Sri Lanka-Maldives Parliamentary Friendship Association yesterday. We met the Maldivian Parliamentary Delegation today. An honourable Member, Mr. Ahmed Siyam Mohamed, told us that they need healthy vegetables from Sri Lanka because the standard has deteriorated. I think it is the mistake of the people who are exporting them. These are all matters connected with it. Therefore, stern action should be taken at the point of exportation of those vegetables in future.

, . My father-in-law, the late Mr. M.M. Sameen, was one of the first persons who manned the stores of the Galoya Development Board; he was a storekeeper. The Hon. P. Dayaratnas family and my wife's family were very good friends.

, , , , . ? , . .

The Government is not encouraging anybody to destroy the natural vegetation of this country. That should be properly understood.

2014 21 "" " " . It is reported in yesterdays The Island newspaper also. All these days it has been smuggled and exported. I know His Excellency the President has also given his full attention to this because these are all our resources, our wealth. Why do we not preserve them?

" . ."

, . . .

Sir, I was fortunately in the House of Lords last week. This is coincidental with the subject we are discussing. Mrs. Ajantha Tennakoon, Solicitor, who studied here, is the daughter of the famous Lionel Sarath Edirisinghe. She is contesting for the Barnet London Borough Council from the Conservative Party and she had told me a lot of good stories. I was given a reception by Lord Sheikh in the House of Lords. Mrs. Ajantha Tennakoon also came there together with so many others of the House of Lords and four Members from the European Parliament. , Borough , Municipal Council , UC .

In a news sheet under the heading "Working hard for West Finchley Ward - intouch" issued by them, it has been pointed out that in order to have a healthy forestation, they must control the carbon footprint.

The news sheet states, I quote:

Every year millions of pounds of our Council Tax is used to pay landfill Tax. Increasing the amount we recycle therefore reduces our carbon footprint while also saving us money.

These are very good steps that they have taken even in England. With my granddaughter, Sarah, I was passing through the Sherwood Forest where Robin Hood lived.

, . , . . , go to see Sherwood Forest too while seeing other places like the Land of Shakespeare. They are protecting that forest and all the water resources. It was an amazing sight. Whatever political differences we may have is a different matter. From North to South, the entire Britain is kept very clean and they give number one preference to protect the environment. Thank you Sir.
