Members of this House that the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, though he speaks like this at a given time, was the Co-ordinating Secretary to His Excellency the President. - [Interruption.] In answer to what he said during his speech, I will speak quite adequately and amply during the Committee Stage on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, explaining what he did and what he believed in, in those days and how he scuttled the entire discussion process between the Government and the TNA. - [Interruption.]

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have a prepared text today so that I could speak with facts and figures in their proper order and accuracy. I would like to commence by branding this Budget as a new generation Budget for Sri Lanka and I thank His Excellency the President for taking on such a long vision for the countrys development, having raised the country's status from a less developed country in 2005 to a middle-income economy with a US Dollars 4,000 per capita income by 2015. The Budget 2015 marks a special milestone in our post-independent history. Although some people describe this as an election Budget, it is very clear that this is a continuity of 10 successive Budgets, adhering to the consistent policy strategy enunciated in the "Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka, A Ten-year Horizon Development Framework 2006-2016" placed before this House when His Excellency the President presented his first Budget Speech in 2006.

This Budget is a new generation Budget because it is futuristic. Firstly, it speaks about full employment for the youth by 2020; it is committed to generate 95 per cent employment for the youth. No Budget in the post-independent Sri Lanka spoke of full employment for the youth.

Secondly, it speaks of a poverty-free Sri Lanka, which would be free from communicable and non-communicable diseases, vulnerabilities to droughts and

1299 1300

[ ]

2014 01

old-age uncertainties. So, it speaks of preventive healthcare, massive livelihood development for low-income people to raise their income, a high per capita income to the people and all island irrigation to transform the dry zone to a wet zone.

Thirdly, it is the first time a Budget speaks of mothercare and childcare development by committing to achieve zero maternal and child mortality by 2020. The Budget Proposals and funds allocated on preventive healthcare on cancer, stroke et cetera are impressive. People, in the future, not needing to wait in queues at the Maharagama Cancer Hospital, being one example. This is why life expectancy is targeted to be at 80 years.

Fourthly, for the first time, it speaks of pre-school education, which has been an urban luxury up to now. Also it speaks of 100 per cent school enrolment in both primary and secondary education. The IT literacy rate is targeted to be at 90 per cent so that it would bring about a new generation information technology society. The Budget proposes a complete transformation with 1,000 Mahindodaya Schools to provide well-equipped education facilities for all Sri Lankan children to have an all-round education with English, mathematics, IT, science, sports and extra-curricular activities to enhance their global acceptability.

The Budget has even gone to the extent of providing a transport allowance for disable children to go to school. It proposes to set up a well-equipped Nenasala Centre in each Grama Niladhari Division, not only to popularize IT at rural level, but also to ensure that rural people have access to information on seeds, agricultural practices, health-related information et cetera. We all know that this programme has already received global recognition.

Last, but not least, universities have been provided with new faculties for higher studies. The number of university students, which has increased from 12,000 in 2005 to 25,000 as of now, will be raised to 100,000 by 2020 and the vision is to raise the status of Sri Lankan universities to be among the top 30 in the specific fields and to develop each university under university townships. On these grounds, the vision of the Budget 2015 is to raise Sri Lankas Human Development Index to be the top in the entire Asia.

There are several steps taken in this Budget to put the country on the path towards opportunities for the new generation. First, scholarship opportunities for Grade 5 students have increased to 25,000 and each student is given a scholarship allowance of Rs. 1,500, which is three times an increase of what was given in the past. Hence, in 2015, nearly 100,000 students, including the existing number of students and the new entrants, will have a Rs. 1,500 scholarship allowance. The next step is to provide 50,000 opportunities for those who have GCE (O/L) or GCE (A/L) to enter into the field of skills and vocational

education with scholarships. Each student selected from low-income families will be given a Rs. 3,000 monthly allowance to complete this education up to satisfied National Vocational Qualification Diploma requirements recognized globally. These students will have opportunities in the fields of education such as construction, engineering, tourism, information technology, irrigation, agricultural technology, beauty care, ship and boat building, logistics skills et cetera. Fifty thousand students in the vocational and technical education sector are also given scholarships to the value of Rs. 3,000 each. The target for this sector of education is 100,000 admissions each year. So, in future, all students who sit for the A/L Examination will either go to universities or vocational training schools and have jobs soon after their studies. It is also praiseworthy that the Budget has increased the Mahapola Scholarship allowance to Rs. 4,000 per student in addition to providing over 25,000 hostel facilities. Sports, which have been an urban facility, have been expanded all over the country and made part of education. It is noteworthy that all school children are encouraged to participate at 2017 Youth Games to provide new opportunities to rural youths.

The 2015 Budget also speaks of new economic activities of youth interest. The first is information technology and BPO services as a major export activity generating US Dollars 5 billion in 2020. Already, industry has generated nearly US Dollars 1 billion export earnings and 100,000 well-paid jobs. When this industry expands in fivefold by 2020, we speak of over 500,000 youth working over well-paid jobs. The second is tourism and related industry, which is expected to generate US Dollars 2.5 billion earning this year. This industry, too, is expected to generate over US Dollars 5 billion earnings and well-paid jobs. The third is the logistic services centred around exports, shipping and aviation, which are new generation economic activities.

This is the post-independent Budget that we speak of the lowest Budget deficit of 4.6 per cent GDP and outline a road map to reduce it to 3 percent by 2017 along with debt to GDP falling below 65 percent of GDP. So, we see a generation not indebted as was the case when the UNP raided debt to GDP to 102 per cent of GDP in 2004 and rein in fiscal deficits of over 10 per cent when they were in power for 17 long years.

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said the other day in the House that in 2002 they made a negative growth economy to a 5 per cent growth by 2004. He did not say how. They sold all important public enterprises like Insurance, Petroleum, Sugar et cetera. Next, they curtailed the Public Service, stopped the pension and subsidies, still they could not reduce budget deficit or debt. So, this Budget, the 10th consecutive success story of the "Mahinda Chintana", is truly a historic and landmark achievement for future generation.

1301 1302

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in the light of what I have just said, I would like to elaborate to this august Assembly on the aspect of the overall achievements of His Excellency the President, both as the President and the Minister of Finance of Sri Lanka. The Mahinda Chintana 2006 - 2016 policy framework has enabled the Sri Lankan economy to grow at a phenomenal pace. Not only has the economy grown by 7.7 per cent for the first half of the year 2014, but it has boosted many sectors that affect the people of Sri Lanka and heralded economic prosperity.

I, therefore, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, would like to highlight some of the achievements of this Government in the overall context of the economy and the advancement of the economy in every sphere which has enabled the Government to present a futuristic and a new generation Budget for Sri Lanka.

The general economy grew by 7.7 per cent. Agricultural sector grew by a record of 6.4. The industries sector grew by 12.4 per cent, whereas in 2013 the growth was 9 per cent. Domestic savings are projected to increase to around 22.6 per cent of GDP which was 20 per cent of GDP in 2013. National savings are projected to increase to 28.4 per cent of GDP from 25.7 of GDP in 2013. Exports - production and productivity- during the first eight months of 2014 recorded an increase of 14.8 per cent to US dollars 7,385 million. The trade deficit narrowed to US Dollars 5,170 million during the first eight months of 2014 from US Dollars 5,568 million during the same period in 2013 which is a substantial reduction of about US Dollas 398 million within a short span of about 6 - 7 months.

Trade in services continued to expand recording a growth of 49.9 per cent to US Dollars 817 million during the first half of the year compared to US Dollars 545 million in the corresponding period in 2013. This, yet again, is an expansion of US Dollars 272 million.

Transport services recorded a growth of 16.1 per cent. Computer and information services have increased by 13.4 per cent. Tourism earnings - a very significant factor in the economy - increased to US Dollars 1,600 million signifying a 31.4 per cent increase compared to 2013. The workers remittances grew by 10 per cent to US Dollars 4,515 million. The external current account deficit contracted, let me reiterate, contracted to US Dollars 677 million during the first six months of 2014. Inflows to the financial account continued to increase during the first half of 2014, the financial account recorded a net acquisition of assets of US Dollars 2.8 billion. The total FDI to BOI companies increased by 54.8 per cent to US Dollars 850 million during the first six months of 2014.

The stock exchange recorded an inflow of US Dollars 43.7 million to the secondary market and US Dollars 4.4 million to the primary market. It is very encouraging to see that there is more investment, more foreign funds coming into the secondary market in the stock exchange.

Then, here is the red herring. The balance of payments recorded a surplus of US Dollars 1,954 million during the first half of 2014. It is a surplus, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees. The improved performance in the external sector helped strengthen gross official reserves to a historic US Dollars 9.2 billion. Now, the Sri Lankan Rupee has been kept constant in order to help the export sector and the Sri Lanka Rupee appreciated by 0.3 per cent during this period. Reflecting on, this is very important, the cross currency exchange rates movements, the Sri Lankan Rupee appreciated against the Japanese Yen by 4.5 per cent, Pound Sterling by 1.8 per cent and the Euro by 9.1 per cent. A significant aspect was the intervention of the Central Bank to absorb excess foreign exchange liquidity in order to prevent undue appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee. Accordingly, the Central Bank has purchased US Dollars 985 million from the domestic foreign exchange market on a net basis during the first nine months of 2014.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the overall Budget deficit for the first half of 2014 was 3.7 per cent of estimated GDP compared to 4.3 per cent of the corresponding period of 2013. Sir, it is therefore very important to reiterate the fact that the Government has been in a position to bring about such development and advancement in every sphere, be it economic, social, political and religious due to the peace dividend that all people of Sri Lanka today enjoy. The eradication of terrorism, the dawn of sustainable peace coupled with the correct economic policies and implementation of these policies for the benefit of the larger polity of Sri Lanka helped derived these results.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, please give me two more minutes. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I can give you only one minute. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I am going to cut short my speech. I will conclude within one minute.

1303 1304

2014 01

I would like take this opportunity to congratulate and thank His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera and all officers who work tirelessly at the Ministry of Finance and the General Treasury.

I would like to mention to the TNA - please do not cut short my speech because this is very important - to learn from our Government, to learn from His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, how to create a situation that is conducive for economic growth, learn how to heal the wounds of the people after thirty years of war, learn how to govern towards achieving lasting peace and prosperity and most importantly, learn how to truly work for the people, for the benefit of the people and not to satisfy international aspirations and ambitions. The Government of Sri Lanka has not alienated or excluded the economic prosperity of the Tamil polity of the North. The economic growth of over 24 per cent of the Northern Province is as a direct result of the colossal investment that the Government of Sri Lanka has made in order to resurrect the war-ravaged economy of the North.

Let me conclude, Sir, - even though the Hon. R. Sampanthan is not here, my Friend, the Hon. R. Yogarajan is here, and after listening to the Hon. R. Sampanthan speaking in this House two days ago - by saying, "You cannot fool all the people all the time". The polity that you represent is waiting for you to wake up; to wake up from the deep slumber that you are in. It is still not late to wake up, realize the past mistakes and forge ahead by rectifying them in the interest of the people, not only of the North but the entire nation and time is of essence to wake up. That applies to you as well, Hon. Yogarajan. Perhaps, after the next election you will be on this side. [.. 11.38] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , . , , , , . , . .

Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for granting me this opportunity to speak in the Debate

during the Second Reading of the 10th Budget of our Government guided by Mahinda Chintana - National Vision for Development and presented by His Excellency the President. The ambitious development initiatives of the Government over the last nine years have started yielding results and this years Budget has proven it by sharing the dividend with the people by way of a variety of reliefs to all segments of society.

The economic indicators such as the economic growth of 8 per cent, the anticipated per capita income of US Dollars 4,000 for 2015, which is four times higher than what it was 10 years ago, keeping the budget deficit at 5 per cent of GDP, trying to further reduce it in the coming years and the reduction in debt-to-GDP ratio, was stated by His Excellency the President during the course of his Budget Speech is testimony to the success of the "Mahinda Chintana" vision.

The drastic decline in the number of people living below the National Poverty Line from 15.7 to 8.7 per cent within the last five years; rural poverty from 15.7 to 7.6 per cent; poverty in the plantation sector from 32 to 10.9 per cent; people with less than US Dollars 2 per day income from 28.3 to 18.9 per cent and reduction in the maternal mortality rate are all indicators that the "Mahinda Chintana" vision is yielding better results.

Sir, in spite of the fact that the economy has proven its resilience despite the challenges and obstacles faced in the aftermath of ending a prolonged conflict and in the midst of external vulnerabilities, my Parliamentary Colleagues from the TNA have condemned the Budget stating that it has not provided any relief to the people affected by war.

By glancing through the Budget Estimates for the Provincial Councils, anybody can find out that the Northern Province has got the highest allocation for capital expenditre as compared to all other Provinces. It reiterates the Governments policy of balanced regional development and development of hitherto underserved areas. Considering the fact that this province was neglected in every aspect of development in the past, special attention is always given to the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. I do not understand why these TNA MPs have made such a false statement.

Sir, recently we had a Special District Coordinating Committee Meeting to review the progress made and to discuss future plans for all the districts in the North under the Chairmanship of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The progress reports presented by the District Secretaries of all the five districts of the Northern Province revealed incredible sums of money being spent for development of these districts since 2009. Unfortunately, the TNA Parliamentarians did not participate in the meeting. Had they participated, they would have come to know the amount of money that the

1319 1320

[ ]

2014 01

Government has spent for the development of these districts, since the end of the conflict. The facts revealed at this meeting were that the Government had spent a staggering sum of Rs. 290,271 million from 2009 to September 2014 for the Northern Province; the breakdown being Rs. 89,031 million for the Jaffna District; Rs. 60,529 million for the Kilinochchi District; Rs. 38,407 million for the Mullaitivu District; Rs. 62,804 million for the Mannar District and Rs. 39,500 million for the Vavuniya District.

These progress reports further reveal that the mega development drive carried out in these districts has resulted in yielding enhanced productivity and contributes towards the GDP of the country. The Northern and the Eastern Provinces, which missed the economic impetus to keep in par with the economic development of the rest of the provinces for over three decades, have now almost regained the infrastructural framework needed for reactivating the economic activities. The Economic Development Ministry under the able and charismatic leadership of the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa guided by the Mahinda Chintana : Vision for the Future has completed these mammoth tasks within a short span of time.

The TNA does not want to see these developments. They do not want the people to benefit out of these development initiatives. When the Northern Chief Minister, Mr. Wigneswaran was appointed as Co-chair of the Jaffna and the Kilinochchi District Development Committees in November last year, he and other TNA leaders made a public pronouncement that they would not accept Co-chairmanship and did not participate in the DCC meeting that took place in November 2013. But, when they saw that in spite of their boycott, the DCC was going ahead with its development-oriented initiatives and fearing that we will get the credit for it, they sneakily came to the DCC during this year. They had the power, but they not only refused to use it but also used it against the interests of the people.

Sir, the long-awaited wish of the Jaffna people materialized when, on the 13th of October, the train service was extended up to Jaffna with the visit of His Excellency the President. The TNA leadership, as usual, requested the people of Jaffna to boycott the event. But, the overwhelming crowd that gathered to greet His Excellency at all the railway stations from Pallai to Jaffna shows that the people of Jaffna have rejected their request. The TNA leadership also maintained that the people of Jaffna do not need the train service; the Chief Minister openly announced that the Government was keen to introduce the service not for the benefit of the people but to transport the security personnel. They also said the same for A9 road, but they are the people who are using the A9 road with their newly-acquired vehicles through the Provincial Council.

The TNA has made several statements condemning the issue of land permits to more than 20,000 people by His Excellency in Kilinochchi on the 12th of October. They have even threatened to take legal action against it. Do they not want our landless people to get lands? They cry aloud about land ownership, but when the ownership is given to our landless people, they not only work against it but also turn a blind eye. This is their "poli-tricks" and crocodile tears.

In line with the Government policy of providing drinking water to all, the Government in 2011, secured an ADB loan of US Dollars 164.4 million, that is about Rs. 21,000 million for providing drinking water to the people of Pallai, Pooneryn of Kilinochchi District and Jaffna from the Iranaimadu Tank. The Project also has component packages to renovate and raise the level of Iranamadu Tank, which is in a depleting condition as the bund was not maintained for nearly 92 years, and a sewerage system for the Jaffna Municipality area. The Government even signed a commitment agreement with the ADB for the said loan. The Project should have commenced in February this year. But, there is a clause in the Project Administration Manual that a reconfirmation and a new MoU has to be signed before the commencement of the Project by the Irrigation Department for excess water extraction from the Iranamadu Tank. Since the Irrigation Department is under the provincial administration and it has refused to sign the MoU on the instructions of the Provincial Minister, the Project has now come to a halt. This very clearly indicates the power given to the provincial administration and how they are used against the interests of the people in the Districts of Jaffna and Kilinochchi.

This is how the Northern Provincial Administration is run today. Sir, the Government has allocated Rs. 5,831 million for capital expenditure for the Northern Province for the year 2014, which is the highest out of all the provinces. But, the Financial Progress Report up to 30th September, 2014 reveals that they have spent only 25.17 per cent of this allocation. This is how they are running the provincial administration. They are like the "dog in the manger". They will not do anything good for the people and they will not allow the others also to do that.

Sir, I wish to reiterate the request made to the TNA by His Excellency the President during the course of his Budget Speech, to move away from ideological barriers and to work with the Government towards finding a realistic political proposal that will make the Provincial Councils more meaningful to promote development for the benefit of all our people. , , ,

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Planning, presented the 69th Budget of Sri Lanka and the 10th Budget of this Government on 24th October, 2014.

The Budget has a medium-term outlook, is reform-oriented, focused on relief for the low-income population, development of infrastructure, healthcare, micro and SME enterprises and education. It also simplified the tax system, introduced safeguards to dairy and rubber sectors and focused on some local industries through import substitution.

The Government plans to grow its revenue up to 14.9 per cent of GDP, to Rs.1,689 billion in 2015 with 84 per cent of the revenue expected through taxes and with VAT projecting to take the top slot, contributing 5.5 per cent of the tax revenue. The non-tax revenue is forecast to be 10.3 per cent of the total expected Government revenue.

The total planned expenditure for 2015 is Rs. 2,210 billion maintained at 19.3 per cent of GDP, which is slightly low compared to this year's estimated reach of 19.4 per cent of GDP.

I am pleased to note that many economic stakeholders, including the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka have welcomed Budget 2015 and described it as future-oriented and inclusive. Among the many positive measures of this Budget is relief for low-income families of the country. This clearly supports reduction of poverty. According to the Department of Census and Statistics, Sri

Lankas poverty levels have declined steadily over the past twenty years. Accordingly, the number of people below the poverty line in 1995-96 was at 28.8 per cent of the total population, which declined to 22.7 per cent in 2002, 15.2 per cent in 2006-07, 8.9 per cent in 2009-10 and further to 6.5 per cent in 2012.

Our per capita income, which was at US Dollars 2,000 six years ago, will increase to US Dollars 4,000 by 2015. The Poverty Headcount Index is prepared by taking into consideration the total basket, adding the need of food, which is at 68 per cent and the non-food needs, the balance 32 per cent. According to the Department of Census and Statistics Household Income and Expenditure Survey for 2012-13, the poverty level in Mannar is at 20.1 per cent, Mullaitivu, 28.8 per cent, Kilinochchi, 12.7 per cent, Batticaloa, 19.4 per cent, Badulla, 12.3 per cent, Monaragala, 20.8 per cent and Ratnapura, 10.4 per cent. Therefore, I have no doubt that relief given by Budget 2015 to low-income families would help a considerable number of families in Sri Lanka.

I commend the provision of fertilizer at Rs. 350 per 50 kilogram bag from 2006 to-date for paddy and at Rs. 1,200 per 50 kilogram bag for other crops, popularizing the cultivation of maize, onion, potatoes, green beans, vegetables and fruits as well as promoting poultry and aquaculture, processing dry fish. Engaging in small industries have helped low-income people to expand their livelihood opportunities.

It is also noteworthy that microfinancing facilities have been expanded through Divi Neguma community banking societies and agrarian banking. The provisions in the annual Budget for Divi Neguma and Samurdhi allowances have been increased with over 100,000 motorcycles to be distributed among field level officers in villages with new recognition to Government services at rural level.

As for Divi Neguma, it was launched in March, 2011 to revive and strengthen the economy by increasing family incomes. Six rounds of Divi Neguma assistance have been carried out to promote backyard economies and to develop livelihood initiatives, covering around 2.5 million low-income households. More recently, on 20th

October, 2014, 14,022 Grama Niladhari Divisions across the country took part in the launch of Phase Six of Divi Neguma. Today, Divi Neguma is successful in rural, urban and plantation areas under the Economic Development Minister, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksas direction and the guidance of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Sir, at the start, some people blocked the establishment of the Divi Neguma Development Department. But, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Economic Development Minister, the

1325 1326

Hon. Basil Rajapaksa finally won and were able to set up the Unit since it is administered by the people of the community, not by officials. It is the only such public service department in Sri Lanka run without officials. Eighteen Ministries are enlisted in this Programme under four sections - agriculture, livestock, fisheries and cottage industries. The First Round of the Divi Neguma Programme was launched in March, 2011 with the objective of reviving and strengthening the economy by raising family incomes. The Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, through Divi Neguma, has given leadership to uplift low-income families in Sri Lanka. Today, it is successfully carried out with the efforts of the Economic Development Minister, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, and over 2.5 million people are participating in the Divi Neguma Programme. As a result of this programme, vegetable prices are low and better, and fresh foods are available to consumers. In the First Phase, 1,000,000 household economic units were targeted and it received a strong positive response from the people.

The Minister of Economic Development, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, even supported and assisted the people of the Northern Province, whom I represent. Since the end of the war, he visited the Northern Province more than 100 times and rebuilt the war-damaged Province well. It is thanks to him that the Divi Neguma Scheme arrived in the Northern Province. The launch of Divi Neguma Credit Scheme this September in Mannar was a great initiative for the people of the Northern Province. Similarly, Phase Six has been launched on the 20th of October.

Please allow me to inform the House that the Divi Neguma Backyard Economic Unit Programme has received a boost from an unexpected direction. The Seychelles, which has the highest Human Development Index in Africa, wants to implement the Divi Neguma Programme to kick start its agricultural revival. In August, 2012, the visiting Minister of Natural Resources and Industry of the Seychelles, Mr. Peter Sinon, during the first-ever special and business-oriented courtesy call paid by a visiting high level Seychelles delegation in Sri Lanka held at my Ministry, informed me that he wants to introduce the "Divi Neguma" model to more than 8,000 people, whose livelihoods they are trying to upgraded through community development schemes.

Sir, I also commend the Budget for its focus on SMEs. In this Budget, the Government has committed itself to a two-year tax exemption on royalty paid by foreign IT and BPO companies to create and facilitate a knowledge-based economy in the country.

Then, I am pleased to inform the House that the National Enterprise Development Authority - NEDA - under my Ministry, to resolve SME issues in Sri Lanka, has launched the first and pioneering online issue tracker

and the SME Business Barometer in Sri Lanka this August. The NEDA is engaged in forming District Enterprise Forums - DEFs - in all districts of the country and the DEFs will be a source of input to this system, which is identified as an effective tool to find solutions to issues impacting on the growth and development of the Small and Medium Enterprises. The issue tracker is a tool developed by the Asia Foundations Local Economic Governance Programme to track identify issues which impact on an enabling environment for regional business. The issue tracker is designed to systematically track issues which emerge from various enterprise forums and working groups.

30 . , . , . ' ' . , , , . . [1.45 P.M.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I start my speech on the Second Reading of the Budget, let me express my deepest and sincere condolences to those who were affected by

the recent landslide at Koslanda. Some have died and some are missing due to this incident. I also take this opportunity to thank the "Sirasa TV" and "Shakthi TV" for having collected the necessary items and sent those to the affected areas. I also contributed some items yesterday.

Sir, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in this Budget Debate. This is an election-oriented Budget. The presentation of the Budget for the year 2015 has been advanced by one month because of the election that may be held next year.

The total expenditure for 2015 is estimated to be Rs. 2,210 billion while the total revenue is estimated to be Rs. 1,654 billion. The Budget will authorize the Government to raise loans up to Rs. 1,340 billion to cover the annual expenses. This time as well, the highest allocation of Rs. 285 billion has been made to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. The Government has allocated Rs. 200 billion to the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping and Rs. 153 billion for the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. The Ministry of Health will receive Rs. 138 billion and the Ministry of Economic Development will receive Rs. 113 billion. There is a massive amount of Rs. 243 billion allocated for the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils. The allocation for the Ministry of Education is Rs. 47 billion. The Ministry of Law and Order will get Rs. 57 billion and the Ministry of Transport will get Rs. 75 billion.

The President has allocated to himself the lions share of the Budget for 2015. Allocations made to the Ministries coming under his purview are Rs. 733.03 billion while the total allocations for the other Ministries are Rs. 606.7 billion. The lowest allocations are made to the Ministry of Power and Energy which is Rs. 2 billion, and the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage has been allocated Rs. 6.2 billion.

The war was over about five years ago, but we do not know the reason for increasing the allocation of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development; it has been on the increase every year. The expected revenue may not be sufficient to meet the total expenditure and it is a deficit Budget, and financing the Budget will be by loans. There are many recommendations in the Budget which I fear will not be implemented fully due to scarcity of resources. I do not know whether we will get the expected revenue for 2015. The Government revenue in the first four months of 2014 has dropped by Rs. 30 billion from the target of Rs.141 billion which could have a direct impact on the countrys development targets.

The three white elephants, namely, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Sri Lanka Transport Board and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and nearly 247 other public enterprises are running at a loss, in billions. How

1329 1330

can you prepare a Budget when these institutions run at a loss? Almost all the public enterprises which incurred losses in billions must be scrapped or given to the private sector.

The Hon. DEW Gunasekara as the Chairman of the COPE has done an excellent job and referred to the public enterprises which are running at a loss. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has incurred an estimated loss of Rs. 8.3 billion on the procurement of petroleum products, due to its inefficiency. Again, it has also overpaid US Dollars 2,060 to foreign companies due to inclusion of the premium of US Dollars 54 twice, in the Agreement entered into with the said Company.

The Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation has made an advance payment of Rs. 2,791,215 in the year 2011 to a contractor without entering into an agreement for the construction of six fuel tanks. However, no construction has been carried out and the institution has so far been able to recover only Rs. 1 million. The operating expenditure of certain institutions has been significantly high due to an excess number of employees. For example, Sri Lanka Telecom has a staff of nearly 8,000 whereas the actual requirement is only 6,000. Mihin Lanka has incurred losses in billions from the time of inception. The COPE examined the accounts of Mihin Lanka and has recommended scrapping it or giving it to the SriLankan Airlines. But, this has not been done so far.

When India gained its Independence, the famous Socialist Leader, namely, J.B. Kripalani said, What we want now is not any 'isms' - socialism, capitalism or communism, - but an efficient government.

In Sri Lanka, economic development took its downward trend with the nationalization of estates. What the Government should do is to confine its work to run the Government efficiently and should not start doing any business. Business transactions should be left with the private sector. The Government must take some drastic steps as regards the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board and those must be completely privatized as the Government cannot continue to suffer heavy losses incurred in billions annually.

Sir, the Tamil National Alliance has not asked for a separation at any time. It wants a permanent solution to the ethnic question under a united Sri Lanka.

A former Minister of Finance, Ronnie de Mel, once said that you cannot prepare a good Budget if there is an ethnic problem. Before 1956, we did not have any Sinhala-Tamil problems. Only in 1917, there was Muslim-Sinhala trouble and leaders like D.S. Senanayake and others were jailed and Sir Ponnambalam Ramanthan had

to go to the UK and get them released. But, the problem between the Tamils and the Sinhalese started when S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike introduced the Sinhala Only Act. He promised to bring the Sinhala Only Act within 24 hours. When this Act was passed, political leaders like Peter Keuneman, Colvin R. De Silva and G.G. Ponnambalam criticized the act of Mr. Bandaranaike stating that it would lead to a division of the country. And, Colvin R. de Silva said, "If you want to have one language, there will be two nations. If there are two languages, there will be one nation". G.G. Ponnambalam said it would lead to parting of ways. The Sinhala Only Act made the Tamils second class citizens and it humiliated them.

When the Tamils started protesting against the Sinhala Only Act, many problems started. In 1956, 1958, 1961, 1977 and 1983, there were pogroms. That was mainly due to the Sinhala Only Act. Until this Act was passed, no one spoke of a separation. It was the late Mr. Bandaranaike who laid the foundation stone for the minorities to think of a separation. Some national leaders here are now criticizing the TNA stating that they are asking for a separation, but the TNA has not asked for a separation.

With regard to the problem of resettlement in Valigamam North, the following number of persons have registered themselves in the Divisional Secretary's Office, Tellippalai for resettlement. They have to be resettled soon in their own lands. Palai Veemankaman North - 1,502; Palai Veemankaman South - 1,518; Kadduvan - 631; Kadduvan West- 733; Varuthalaivillan - 1,063; Kurumpasiddy East - 1,848; Vasavilan East - 944; Vasavilan West - 1,450; KKS West - 663; KKS Centre - 1,097; KKS South - 571; Thenmylai - 775; Kurumpasiddy - 654; Myliddy North - 3,271; Thayiddy East - 699; Mayiladuthurai South - 745; Thayiddy North - 859; Thayiddy South - 1,608; Mayiladuthurai North - 1,521; Palaly South - 1,232; Palaly East - 1,806; Palaly North - 1,652; Palaly North West - 611; Palaly West - 817. A total of 28,270 persons have to be resettled in Valigamam North.

In Valallai North, 250 families have to be resettled. About 1,200 families consisting of 6,000 persons were chased away from Sampur, which was declared a High Security Zone. They will have to be resettled early in their own lands.

The local authorities find it very difficult to dispose the garbage collected by them. They dump them in a particular place and it will lead to environmental pollution. I suggest that the garbage collected be burnt or incinerated. In Singapore, they do this. A paltry sum of Rs. 5,000 is paid as allowances monthly to the members of local authorities. This is hardly sufficient. I suggest that allowance be increased to Rs. 15,000 per member.

1331 1332

I also suggest that schools be opened at 9.00 a.m. and closed at 4.30 p.m. This will allow the teachers to complete the syllabus. There must be radical changes in the teaching at the universities. We are now manufacturing unemployable graduates. They cannot get jobs anywhere. There should be a change in the curriculum in the universities where technical and vocational training should be given to all students.

We have got a jumbo Cabinet consisting of 75 Ministers and 30 Deputy Ministers. This is a criminal wastage of Public funds. A small Cabinet of 20 Ministers with 20 Deputy Ministers will be ample for Sri Lanka to manage the Government.

The cancer of corruption and bribery has seeped into all sections of the Government. Corruption has taken place in the Health Ministry. Japan has donated Rs. 770 million to buy CT scanners and dialysis equipment, mainly for the North Central Province where 1,000 farmers and families have been severely affected by kidney disease. Only Rs. 300 million has been used to buy six CT scanners and 50 dialysis machines. The balance, a massive sum of Rs. 470 million, apparently, has gone into the pockets of officials or politicians. What the country now needs is economic development. For that, we must invite foreign direct investment and not resort to massive loans from China. China has not given even one cent free to Sri Lanka. I understand that Sri Lanka was a colony of China about four centuries ago.

We want the diaspora to develop the North and the East with their earnings. If the Government has no objection, several members of the diaspora are prepared to develop the North and the East. There is no law and order in this country. In an English newspaper editorial it was stated that there is criminalization of politicians and politization of criminals. Criminals and thugs have the support of the politicians in whatever they do. For instance, recently the Chairman of the Bandarawela Urban Council went to the Bandarawela Police to make a complaint. The supporters of the Government went to the Police Station and assaulted the Chairman in the presence of the police officers but the police did not take any steps to stop them from assaulting the Chairman.

We must repeal the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution and bring back the Seventeenth Amendment to ensure the independence of the Judiciary, the Attorney-General's Department, the Police Commission, the Elections Commission and the Comission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.

The estate workers must be paid a monthly wage. The wage increases to be paid will not cushion the impact of the cost of living. According to the Central Bank, the minimum salary needed for a family is Rs. 47,000.
