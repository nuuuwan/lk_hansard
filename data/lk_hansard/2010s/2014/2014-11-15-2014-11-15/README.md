The Supreme Court ordered his Government, "By 10.30 a.m. tomorrow, submit the list of the thousand odd black currency account holders in Swiss banks". They submitted. Their Elections Commissioner is very powerful. That is honesty. So, do not ask me how to curb that. I know you are an honest man, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara.

University of Moratuwa produces Urban Planners and Postgraduate Planners as well. I think your Ministry must work closely with the University of Moratuwa and get good Urban Planners for every municipality, urban council and the key development centres in the local authorities in this country, because we are reaching a new stage. There are experts in planning; they would plan the city; they would plan the services and the investment zones. Otherwise, everything is done under the sole right and discretion of the Chairman and later on, you will have to break everything if a road has to be constructed or if you need to build a market.

Now, places like Mumbai and other cities in the world, are going in for municipal bonds. Why cannot the municipalities raise bonds without coming and begging daily from the Government Treasury? They have assets and the banks will give bonds. This is a new concept you will have to bring in. . . idling. , bonds issue , funds raise - [Interruption.] . . CHOGM . , . CHOGM . .

Even our Prophet Muhammed Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam insisted on health. Even the azab or pain in the Kabur or grave will increase if you do not observe cleanliness in life. You must have a healthy and clean life. The Holy Prophet has stressed that visiting a patient is an obligatory function on all Muslims. , , , !" .

.

Today, we have advanced in the health sector tremendously.

Two significant features that stand out in a welfare State are, education and health. Ceylon, as it was then called, attained the status of a welfare State much long before our neighbours, namely India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, did. To steer ahead the health vehicle in this country, we have a dynamic Minister in the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena and equally, an able lieutenant, my good Friend - Deputy Minister - seated by my side, the Hon. Lalith Dissanayake. So, everything is moving in the right direction, I should say .

Then, Hon. Minister, I have taken up with you the matter of the Colombo South Hospital, Kalubowila. There, the main problem is, . Teaching Hospital , . 2,500 . 5,000 . . . . . I have always been insisting that this hospital is well run by Dr. Asela Gunawardena, Director and the Deputy Directors, Dr. Madhubhashini Karunaratne, Dr. Lionel Muhandiram, and Dr. Dharshani Abeysekara. They are doing a very good job of work. Sir, the other day, I said that the Merchant Ward of the National Hospital, Colombo is always full up and the people who want and who can

afford to enter the paying wards there are unable to get admission there. Therefore, the Colombo South Hospital becomes very important. People from Colombo to Avissawella and from Wellawatte, Bambalapitiya up to Kalutara on the other side come to that hospital for medical healthcare. Therefore, making available all the facilities and opening up a few paying wards in that new building will be of great help to patients. That would ease the congestion at the National Hospital.

Then, there is the development of the Base Hospital in Puttalam. Even when President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited Puttalam recently, they insisted that that hospital must be further developed and upgraded. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Hon. Minister of Economic Development, has given Rs. 2 lakhs for a maternity clinic at Karaitivu, North of Puttalam.

In Islamic history also, Sir, medicine takes its pride of place. We know about Abdullah Ibn-Sina, whose books are even translated into English and many other languages. The medical system of the western world is basically introduced on the teachings of Abdullah Ibn-Sina.

Then, Sir, moving on to indigenous medicine, as His Excellency the President says, that area must be developed. We know that our able Minister, the Hon. Salinda Dissanayake, and the Deputy Minister, the Hon. C.P.D. Bandaranaike, are doing a good job of work. , , .

Therefore, will the Minister advise; 1. the new proposed Ward System for Colombo District, how many Wards are there and very specifically for the Colombo Municipal Council areas; 2. what is going to be the voter base and how is it divided to each Ward; 3. advice the new Ward base allocation; and

4. how many voters per Ward is used for the demarcation? Please advise the full list of Wards for Colombo District? Advise per Electorate. 5. advise for the rest of the country on a per District/ per Electorate basis.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I thank you for giving me time to raise this very important matter and I am happy that the Hon. Minister himself is there to respond.

Sir, there is a general feeling that the present electoral system has been amended and a new system of Proportional Representation as well as First-Past-the-Post or the Ward System has been introduced. But, in the same process, it has not been made public as to what the system prevailing is at this moment.

In the Colombo Municipal Council area, there were 54 wards under the old system. I have been informed, through the Commissioner of Elections, that it has increased to 81, but we, as Members of Parliament of the Colombo District and I, as the Chief Organizer of the United National Party for Colombo North, have not been briefed of the 15 electorates and the Wards of the Colombo Municipal Council. We want to know how many there are effectively. So, Hon. Minister, I would like you to brief this House on that and to make it public as to what the electoral process is and how you intend to take it forward. Firstly, has it already been signed and made into law? You mentioned this previously as well. Has the President signed this and finished off? Then, would the next election be held on the new system we have proposed and talking about at this particular moment?

Sir, there is confusion among the voters. It is even more confusing for the politicians, especially for those at the ward level because they do not know whether they have got to cover the entire area once again because you all have mentioned that there can be a postponement. So, I would appreciate if you would inform us basically on these areas .

Now, the Colombo District has 1.5 million voters. Going on the basis that this is the number of registered voters - about another 100,000 have been deprived of their voting rights owing to the fact that it is open only for a month per year for registration purposes - you are talking of at least 1.5 million voters. What is the base that is used for demarcation by the Delimitation Committee or how many voters are there per ward? I would greatly appreciate if that could be explained. In Colombo, how would it be as it is a huge geographical area to cover?

For example, the Avissawella Electorate, which is almost one-third of the entire Colombo District, how does that area get demarcated according to this Ward System? Likewise, the Moneragala Electorate where the population is not more than six lakhs, but the extent of land is huge. So, how does the Delimitation Commission demarcate that area according to the Ward System? Why is it that you are very stealthily keeping this matter with the Ministry, or is it with the Election Commission? Every time we ask this question, unofficial information comes and your Government is very clever in deceiving not only the voters, but also the political parties. So, Hon. Minister, I would greatly appreciate your knowledge in this particular field.

2195 2196

2014 15

Then, Hon. Minister, would you tell us how many voters will be allocated per ward and when will this be made public? We were given a window of opportunity to go through this process just about nine months ago, but that did not ensure the right of representation in a multiracial, multireligious constituency such as the one I represent, the Colombo North. We did not get an opportunity to intercede with these people. So, I would like to know whether the list is still open; whether there is a right of intervention and if not, whether we could go before the court.

Sir, I am informed that 6,500 voters make one ward. If that is the case, and if there are more who are not registered as voters, how does that particular issue get resolved? According to our estimates, Electorates like Colombo North and Colombo Central have about 8,000 to 10,000 voters and there are 2,000 to 3,000 persons who are not registered as voters. So, when this system is brought in, again, there will be a segment of population that needs to be considered even though they are not voters. On the other hand, you have the reduced wards owing to the fact that you think only the registered voters are living in this particular electorate. So, I would respectfully submit that you take into consideration not only the registered voters, but also the people who are not registered. This can be easily done according to the statistics available with the Divisional Secretariat.

Then, the next issue is, this system deprives women representation. In the old system, there was about 40 per cent of women representation in the nomination list, but this is absent in the Ward System. Sir, women representation in the nomination list is something which is found to be desirable - whether they are elected or not is a different matter - and it paved the way for a lot of new people to come into the political strata. But, with this process, you are now eliminating the minimum number of women representation in the nomination list. I believe 40 per cent is too much, but at least 20 to 25 per cent needs to be brought in. How does the Hon. Minister bridge the gap between the two - the minimum nomination that is called for and the true representation that would come from that particular process? - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, you will not learn much in speaking from there. I would like you to respond to this particular issue because the politicians, not only from the United National Party but also from the governing Party, are still in darkness as to how they have got to fashion their political future. I would appreciate if you could respond on that particular area.

When the Ward System comes into play and the nomination list does not state the minimum number of women representation, how are you going to fill that particular list? Also, the younger generation would face a similar situation, a mix-and-match situation. I know you will basically respond by saying, It is up to the political parties. Our political culture is such that it is still male-

dominated. So, on that basis, how could you basically give an opportunity of a level playing field for women candidates?

Then, the next issue is, even though I represent the Colombo District, there are remote areas as well. For example, the Avissawella Electorate, the place from which the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena comes, is a remote area. That area does not get desirable representation from a rural perspective. Even though it is in the Colombo District, if you think that this is an urbanized area and neglect its rural factor, then, that is going to be a compounding problem once again. Hon. Minister, I am sure you have fashioned the system very much to suit the Eastern territory, of which, you have a good knowledge. I am sure that will certainly be helpful from an outstation perspective. But, in the urbanized districts such as Colombo, Kalutara, and maybe Gampaha to a very great extent, this will not be helpful.

The next question I would like to ask you is, why is the electoral register not kept open on a regular basis? Why is it restricted to only one month of the year? You open the electoral register on the 1st of June and close it by the 30th. You can make representations thereafter. Instead of having an open register, when in the modern world everything is computerized, why is it that you want to go to the Stone Age? This will definitely be important in the Ward System. The minority groups are moving very dramatically in the Colombo District. We find that there is a heavy inflow of Muslims and Tamils into certain areas such as Kotte, which I represented before Colombo North, Colombo Central and Kolonnawa. These people have representations where they keep selling their goods. When that happens, you basically have a concentration of one ethnic group in a particular area. If this happens in a Ward System, how are you going to break that off? Because, concentration of one ethnic or one religious group would not be very harmonious to our multicultural, multireligious society. So, how are you going to overcome this particular problem? You are basically saying that you cannot count in a polling station because of the fact that you would be able to see how the voting is done at that particular place. In a Ward System, you directly go for that. If you are accepting that, which has been brought in by His Excellency the Presidents "Mahinda Chintana", then why are you depriving the Election Commissioner from having the count at the polling stations? Do you get what I mean? If the Election Commissioner is rejecting the count in the polling stations, then it does not make sense at all in the process that is going on. So, that is another question that will have to be answered.

Then, in areas like the Jaffna District, which was once a war-torn area but now a peaceful area - despite the presence of the army, they are coming back to normal life - how are you going to apply the Ward System? Has the Delimitation Commission gone into those areas? I cannot

2197 2198

believe it because the electoral register had almost 895,000 voters in the Jaffna District and now it has come down to 594,000. So, though your people have this register open for about a month, I do not think they have done a good physical verification of the population in the Jaffna District. So, how will it be done? Will it be on a guess estimate or will it be on the past information that you are going to bring in the Ward System into play? These are the questions that will have to be answered.

The other matter is about the money allocation. At the moment, you allocate money to a council. That council will in future allocate the money to the ward members who are elected because it will be just a matter of Yes and No . You can safely say, This is my ward" like in the past. If that is the case, assuming it is the Colombo Municipal Council, which has almost Rs.10 to 11 billion, how is the money allocated? Is it on the whims and fancies of the council or is it at the behest of the Mayor or is it the finance committee that will proportionately divide it among the ward members? These are matters that would come up when practically implementing this system.

Just about a month ago, the Hon. Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils brought in an amendment to this Act that if, by chance, a Mayor or a Chairman loses a ward, he is permitted to carry on, on the same basis without having himself dislodged or removed. This was done only about a month ago. So, that is, after five or six years this particular election law came into play.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah) That is only for the existing members. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Only for the existing members? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is like the present one. You are bringing in amendments only for the existing ones; the existing President and existing local members et cetera. That is also an anomaly in the system. You cannot bring in an

amendment - [Interruption.] So, prospectively, you have rectified that error and only given a comfort factor for them for this particular period. It would not be

retrospectively going on, where anybody who lost out has any right to come back. Is that right? Then, from the next election which is on the ward system, this problem will not come about.

So, on that particular basis, I would like to talk about the money allocation. This is another concern that they are having, because today, nobody is investing money in a particular area not knowing what his proper ward is. I am sure, as politicians who want to serve their people, they would like to put their money in the best way where their ward should come in. This dilemma is basically creating confusion and the electors are not getting the due service that is expected of them. So, Hon. Minister, I am sure it is up to you to ensure and convince us as to how best that we have got to go forward. This system is certainly acceptable. It is a good system to go forward. It is a very close nexus between the voter and the elector. If that is the case, there will be certain drawbacks which I just mentioned to you. I would like that clarified and if there is any rectification, let us do that. Depoliticize the system. Open the electoral system on a 365-day basis.

The next matter is with regard to the issue of identify

cards. Even in Colombo - [Interruption.]

All I could say is, please ensure that we have this system looked into and rectified, so that we could move forward on this particular basis. Hon. Minister, you mentioned about the Presidential system. I take this opportunity to ask you this question because you are very eager and I appreciate your sense of eagerness. Where is the Supreme Court opinion that was submitted? You do

not have a Supreme Court - [Interruption.] No. Today, the Hon. Speaker, when asked about the Supreme Court opinion, stated that he has still not got it. What type of banana republic are we living in? We are asking the Hon. Minister concerned who the presidential nominee is. There is no election in place. Now, the President sends a request -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. Your time is over. Now, you are taking the time allotted to the Government side.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am sure the Hon. Minister will not mind because his answer would be very brief.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No. Before that, the Hon. Azwer is going to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Is that so? Please give me two more minutes, Sir.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is wrong.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am trying to help the staff of Parliament, Sir, because if we do not go beyond 6.30 p.m., the poor staff will not get their allowance. Otherwise, this could have been finished in two minutes. I feel sorry for them because we move Adjournment Motions. At least let them get their allowance. So, I am trying to take it beyond 6.30 p.m. Please ensure that we are given additional time, if required. Even if it is 6.31, let us give that benefit to the staff.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is not a part of the electoral system, Sir. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, I think it is not only in your interest, but in the interests of all the MPs. Hon. Azwer, you carry on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Today, I should say to my good Friend that your mike is off and my mike is on. This is the problem with the UNP. Your mike is still off, my mike is on and I am speaking. This is the malady that the UNP is suffering from, today.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Azwer, please wait. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, can you wind up your speech in one minute?

2201 2202

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I have already started, Sir. I am on my feet.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you can wind up your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, on that basis, Hon. Minister, I truly ask from you - after all you are an active Member in the Cabinet - to get the Supreme Court opinion communicated to this Supreme Body. This is not a Pradeshiya Sabha; this is not the CMC; this is Parliament. So, if we do not know what the 10 Judges of the Supreme Court have stated there, that is absolutely wrong. Even you are puzzled. - [Interruption.] His Excellency is one; Parliament is another. The President has to be fully represented in Parliament.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, please wind up. The Hon. Azwer is here.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, Hon. Minister, please ensure that there is a responsibility on your part.

[6.20 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) " ? ."

Sir, he is making statements in this House, which is against the Standing Orders; he is making a critical assessment of the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court is the most powerful, as far as the legal system is concerned. Ten Judges of the Supreme Court have given an opinion. Basically, it is an opinion. Therefore, Sir, this is not something that the President had referred to the Supreme Court like any other Bill. If there is a violation of any Constitutional provision, he refers a Bill to the Supreme Court. When the judgment is received, the Speaker announces that to the House. But, this is quite different. So, they must not speak desperately about the Supreme Court. But, I want to challenge and tell them this. They said that whatever the views expressed by the Supreme Court, they would go to court. Have they not gone to court still? What is pushing them back? Still, they have not had the courage to go to court and they are just getting up and blaming the others.

Sir, as far as this Adjournment Motion is concerned - I must also confess that I have no quarrel with my Friend in supporting this - I must say that what has happened today is a little presumptuous. The Government has already decided on the Ward System. This is also a malady oozing out of the presidential system introduced to the country by President J.R. Jayewardene because the Proportional Representation System was brought into the electoral system of Parliament and local bodies by his amendment. Therefore, whom are they blaming? The UNP is looking up and spitting on themselves. That is what is happening today in this country.

Sir, I think the Local Government plays a very important role in the political setup of this country. It is the cradle from which all politicians catapult and graduate into national politics. I recall, Sir, certain names like the late Hon. A.E. Goonasinha, the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and the late Sir Razik Fareed, who had their first stint in politics in the Local Government. They came into politics through the wards of the Colombo Municipal Council. I also recall, Sir, the name of one barrister, the Hon. Cassim Ismail from Galle, who was residing at the office of the Ceylon Muslim League. He is the first barrister who got elected from the Hultsdorp Ward or the New Bazaar Ward at that time. But, he could not serve long because all the people from the area came and talked to him about dustbins and other matters. So, being a barrister, he respectfully resigned and returned to his profession.

Sir, some more great names come to my mind like the late Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera, Dr. Doric de Souza, my political guru, the late Hon. Robert Gunawardena, the uncle of the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, the late Hon. Anil Moonesinghe, the late Hon. Bernard Soysa, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed, the late Hon. (Dr.) W.D. de Silva, who was called Dadibidi Silva, the late Hon. V.A. Sugathadasa, the late Hon. M. Vincent Perera, Prof. H.A. de S. Gunasekara, one of the cleverest economists in this country and also Prof. Osmund Jayaratne. Some of them came to Parliament through the Colombo Municipal Council.

Sir, for all purposes, I think this Motion is good. But, I say that you cannot do it on presumptions because first, you have to have a Delimitation Commission appointed to demarcate every ward under local bodies and other municipal councils. Therefore, Sir, it has to be done after the establishment of a Delimitation Commission.

Finally, I want to make a request from the Hon. Minister at this time. Puttalam is a very important town. Earlier, it was governed by a Development Board headed by Mr. H.S. Ismail and others. Now, Mr. K.A. Baiz, who has been the Chairman of the Puttalam Urban Council for a long time, is doing a very good job of work and that Urban Council has qualified to become a

2203 2204

2014 15

Municipal Council again. I hope you would also do something to raise the standard of the Eravur Urban Council. Thank you, Sir.
