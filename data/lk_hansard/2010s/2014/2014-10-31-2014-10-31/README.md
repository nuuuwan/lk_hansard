Sir, some of the MPs belonging to the TNA are spreading false rumours. Recently, there had been a meeting where the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah had made a speech. He has said in the course of his speech that the deeds distributed in the Northern Province by His Excellency the President were mainly given to the Sinhalese people. Nearly 20,000 deeds have been

1117 1118

[ .. . ]

2014 31

distributed under the patronage of His Excellency the President. I would say that 99.9 per cent of the deeds were given to the members of the Tamil community. But, this has been distorted by the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah when he made a speech recently, in Colombo. In fact, I was informed by the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees that a false statement had been made by this Member that these deeds have been given only to the Sinhalese people. There are no Sinhalese people amounting to that number in that area; only members of the Tamil community are there. Therefore, I believe that the people of the area are quite aware as to what happened and to whom those deeds were given. So, I do not think that the TNA's efforts to mislead the public will be successful.

[10.55 a.m.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I do not agree with the statements made by the Hon. Minster, W.D.J. Senewiratne, because he is compelled to say the good side of the Budget rather than criticize it. That is obvious. You, Hon. Minister, say that the Budget is good and from this side we say, No, it is not so; it is not as beneficial as it is made out to be.

Sir, the annual Budget is a cornerstone of Parliamentary democracy. It is very important. I am talking of a macro situation. The Budget today has become a political promissory document with the work of the annual Budget done by the Government Gazette beforehand. That is what we see. It is a very unfortunate situation. This Government has failed for the last 10 years to fulfil the main promise they made. That is, the loud promise to abolish the Executive Presidency. Every time the President says, "We are going to abolish, we are going to abolish but it never happened for the last 10 years. This is what the people must understand when promises are made. How is the Government going to find all that money to give what has been promised in this Budget? Like every Budget presented in the last couple of years, in this Budget too, various promises have been made. It is impossible to believe.

The Government is already in a huge pit of economic debt and it does not even know how much they owe nationally or internationally. There are so much of debts that are involved. There is a huge deficit between income and expenditure. That is common knowledge; there is nothing new in it. They cannot print notes without any corresponding increase in the national productivity, for it will be disastrous to the economy with a high inflation. That is the state of the economy today. If that is being done, they cannot meet the expenditure. But, productivity is stagnating. If you borrow, it will have to be repaid.

That is the most important thing we have to have in mind. But, how are we going to repay? Ultimately, it will be by taxing the people to meet this situation. Again, the burden will be cast on the people of this country if you are unable to repay the borrowings.

The Government, should understand that economic growth alone does not contribute to the welfare of the people or reduce the cost of living. You talk of a growth of 7 or 8 per cent. But, that is not the yardstick to measure the welfare of the people or the reduction in the cost of living. All handouts promised - even if they are given - will only benefit the people temporarily. These are temporary benefits that the people will receive and on the whole economy, there will be no impact. What really contributes to the wellbeing of the people is good governance and that is what is lacking in this country at the moment. Therefore, the people are complaining. All problems faced by the people of this country are because of misgovernance. Today, we can see various strikes taking place and various assaults. All those happen as a result of misgovernance. The Budget does not promise good governance. We do not see statements made to that effect. The Rule of Law is the foundation of good governance. Are all citizens treated equally before the law today? Certainly, no. Only the ordinary people are subjected to the law. This is why people, on many occasions, have taken the law into their own hands. That is why we see demonstrations and strikes. All those happen as a result of that.

Sir, there is something that we can learn from India. The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi has made a statement and stressed for "Minimum Government and Maximum Governance". So, this is the motto that Prime Minister Modi is following. Therefore, we should have new directions towards good governance to achieve real democracy for the people. That is what is lacking in this country. It is also said that the Rule of Law is one side of the coin while transparency and accountability is the other side of the coin. Now, we do not have any of them. That is what is lacking in this country today. These are very important issues but unfortunately there is no emphasis on them.

The fallout of misgovernance in Sri Lanka has led to the disintegration of all social and economic departments of this country. As a result, now nepotism, corruption, waste and impunity have replaced transparency and accountability. I do not want to elaborate on that. In all transactions that are taking place such as awarding of contracts and awarding of other purchases, this is what has happened. The Government has democratized corruption in Sri Lanka. The Governments own people are coming out with enormous corruption. Our so-called Dharmadveepa has been reduced to a paradise land of gambling and drugs. Once Sri Lanka was known as the Muthu Ataya of the Indian Ocean but today we are now the Kudu Ataya of the Indian Ocean. That is how people refer to Sri Lanka.

There are so many areas which we can speak of, which has gone wrong. I do not want to go into all of those. But, I think it is necessary to mention about a few of those departments. Take, for example, the Public Service. The efficiency of the Public Service has dropped drastically during the last few years. That is a very well-known fact. One of the reasons is the increasing politicization. The Hon. Minister cannot deny what is happening in all those offices starting from the Ministry downwards. Then, political appointments are made, which means recruits do not have the required standards. Exams are held but ultimately the people who are chosen are not the best people. Then, there is corruption and lack of commitments because of political backing.

The Public Servants today are servants of their political masters, not of the people. We saw what happened at the Training Centre of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority when our Members of Parliament went in to do an investigation. They were assaulted and their vehicles were damaged. I do not want to talk more of that.

Look at the Judiciary. Justice in the country has been tainted with political colouring with the appointment of judges to the courts. That is a well-known fact and I think the Government cannot get behind that. The Government wants judges packed in the judiciary supporting their cause. This is a very unfortunate situation.

There was a serious controversy recently with regard to the appointments to the Court of Appeal. Senior judges with merit and experience on the Bench were overlooked with officers from the Department of the Attorney-General being appointed.

Supreme Court appointments made unilaterally by the President are not tested as to whether they comply with accepted judicial standards. These are some of the complaints that come from the Judiciary.

The Bar Association called it a "profound contempt" shown by the Executive President for the independence of the judiciary. One such example was, as we can remember, how the 43rd lady Chief Justice was chased out by the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

for trying to be independent. So, corruption and blatant favouritism that pervades the law enforcement and statutory institutions available to the general public for redress of their grievances, make a mockery of the criminal judicial system in this country.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Perumal Rajathurai to take the Chair.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Salinda Dissanayake - Minister of Indigenous Medicine) I propose that the Hon. Perumal Rajathurai do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, .

, , .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. PERUMAL RAJATHURAI took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) People clearly see themselves as not being equal before the law. People attacking police officers and surrounding police stations are some of the instances where they have demonstrated their desperation. With regard to the police force, the complete subordination of the Sri Lanka Police establishment to political command of the ruling elite cannot be contested. That is a well-known fact. The Ministry of Law and Order is an eyewash, a mere cosmetic to the political farce. The police force is just like the courthouse, which now exists only in theory. It is not an independent police force working for the betterment and welfare of the people.

Take the Fisheries Industry, which is facing a grave crisis. The grievances remaining to be addressed are the fuel subsidies which have not been given as promised; boats and fishing gear being expensive; excessive insurance premium; navigational instrument systems - GPS - being sold by the Ministry to fishermen three times the market price. These are complaints coming from that sector.

Sri Lanka, the second biggest fish exporter to the European Union, which buys 60 per cent of the local catch has shown a red sign for Lankan fish due to illegal harvesting practices. A three-month extension has been given to fulfil the obligations to prevent illegal practices. The main culprits are the large deep-sea vessels prominent among which are Chinese vessels which have been given permission by the Government to operate under the Sri Lankan Flag. The Minister tries to place the fault on the small fishing boats but the European Union

1123 1124

sources have confirmed the involvement of large vessels. Any ban will be disastrous to the industry and the 30,000 who are directly employed in the fishing industry would ultimately turn out to be beggars.

Sir, let me speak about the foreign affairs. It is very interesting. Today, we see foreign affairs as a family service and not as a foreign service. This is a very sad situation. Gone are the days when the External Affairs Ministry conducted affairs of the nation with integrity, intelligence and finesse by well-versed people in the intricate art of diplomacy. Do we get that now? Very unfortunately, no. A majority of the top diplomatic representations today are made by political appointees as Heads of Missions. I got to know that one of those who had been appointed had passed only the GCE Ordinary Level Examination. So, can they perform that duty? A few able diplomats have been sacked, assaulted or chased and transferred to the Ministry pool. This is a very unfortunate situation. No wonder we are losing all diplomatic confrontations and seeking to find scapegoats for the failures.

The UNHRC Resolution against Sri Lanka on Reconciliation and Accountability and the recent lifting of the ban on the LTTE by the European Criminal Court are clear failures of our foreign diplomacy. The Government, either by intent for its own future propaganda purposes and other hidden benefits, or sheer incompetence, is allowing the LTTE to stand on its feet once again. Instead of putting the blame on the Opposition, the Government has to bear the responsibility for that.

The Government has virtually abandoned decades of non-aligned policies and become a virtual satellite of China. The Government has alienated the United States and Europe. Today, Sri Lanka has lost the status it had once as a respected country among civilized nations. Little Sri Lanka may soon find itself in the crossfire of international politics with China on one side and India, United States, and Japan on the other.

Regarding the education system in this country, it is undebatably in a terrible mess. C.W.W Kannangaras vision of free education has been impaired. We have seen the deterioration from time to time. Young parents are unable to find schools to admit their children because there are no schools in the area or there is no room for admission. The upkeep of the schools that are functioning are met by the contributions collected from the poor parents. The Government pays only the salaries of teachers. The parents are fed up with the Governments treatment of schools. There is no forward policy in education. We do not have a long term National Education Policy and the National Education System itself is faulty. Learning patterns, curriculum and student attitudes need a change. The Ministry should take this

matter very seriously. No one seems to be responsible and there are accountability problems from top to bottom. At the same time, we see that there is no complete and proper teacher training. The gap between teachers and students are widening due to lack of proper training programmes for teachers, suitable for the present day schools. We must have a disciplined education for which education needs to be depoliticized.

There is deep concern among parents about the insecurity of their childrens education in the direction of higher education. There are no set standards for the monitoring and accreditation of private universities, which matter is entrusted to the Ministers son, very unfortunately. Sir, education has to be depoliticized, taken out of the hands of politicians and given to educationalists. Our educational system is not geared to face the challenges of contemporary realities. The Government proposes to give 50,000 jobs in the State sector, but cannot predict jobs in the private sector. The reason is that the private sector has, for long, complained that the graduates sent out by the State universities are unemployable. The university courses, regretfully, are not entirely employment-oriented. In the near future, we will have thousands of graduates passing out of State universities without jobs. It is the fault of the Government, which for so many years, we have failed to act with a vision and purpose. The Government has to take responsibility for this dismal situation.

Now, look at the agricultural sector. Agriculture, the heart of our culture and civilization, has been turned into an agri-business by transnational million-dollar companies working in collusion with local politicians. The end-result will be our proud farmers will soon become beggars because they will have no place in such circumstances. Their industry productivity and exports have fallen. The high production cost is one of the main reasons. The unproductive labour laws, low budget allocations for investments in research and development, and inability to develop markets for key exports have led to falling exports, as unable to compete internationally.

Failure to prevent Sri Lanka as a cheap dumping ground has pushed many local manufacturers into bankruptcy. That is a very serious problem. We see many local industries winding up or closing down because they cannot afford to compete with some of the dumping that is taking place, which are coming more particularly, from China.

Moreover, Sir, when considering the recent Budget Proposal made by the President to increase the EPF up to 14 per cent, the industrialists will find it extremely difficult to go on with their industries. I propose that the Government should bear the additional 2 per cent, and not to put the burden on the industries. Anyway, these are matters for thought, because we can see that the industrial policy that the UNP Government adopted has been

1125 1126

2014 31

dismissed, and now imports are coming in without any standard being looked into. This is why the Government is inviting Foreign Direct Investments - FDIs - and wanting people like Packer to open casinos in Sri Lanka, and build a Port City, which virtually will be a pleasure city of gambling, drugs, and other vices. This is a very sad situation. This is not the economic development, or the way that people would like to live in Sri Lanka; they want to make Sri Lanka a Dhamma Deepa. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

. . . . .

[11.15 a.m]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, this year marks the fifth consecutive year of single-digit inflation, and we are now able to borrow in international capital markets at rates that many crisis-ridden countries cannot achieve. For instance, countries like Greece and Portugal, their credit ratings have dipped so much; their borrowings in international capital markets are in such a difficult situation. Such is our fiscal consolidation and towards that end, we must congratulate our Treasury officials and the Central Bank in managing the fiscal consolidation targets admirably.

We are witnessing a far-ranging public infrastructure drive and are seen to be strengthening the countrys prospects for attracting a new wave of foreign investment, while we position ourselves for becoming a strong regional economic hub. Yet, Mr. Presiding Member, I must hasten to mention that there is a growing sense of frustration that the economy has not fully harnessed its post-war dividends and is performing less than what it is capable of.

The two key indicators of stability of an economy are inflation in the domestic front and the current account balance of payments on the external front. Ever since 2012, when a major stabilization package was implemented, significant progress has been achieved in containing inflation and improving the current account deficit. Inflation has been brought down to below five per cent and the current account deficit has declined below three per cent. Yet, Mr. Presiding Member, much remains to be done. The fundamental aspect of Sri Lankas higher growth trajectory has been the domestic demand financed with external debt. It is no secret that it is having an inevitable impact on the structure of the supply side of the economy. This is particularly evident in the balance between the tradable and non-tradable sectors. The non-tradable sector evidently has been driving growth with greater State involvement in many of these sectors such as construction, utilities and many service sectors.

Let us not forget that the unintended consequence of this is that it is perhaps also keeping the private sector less engaged in our post-war development efforts. Though there was a focused policy on encouraging private sector to borrow and raise levels of investment and economic participation, the response has been not very encouraging. We need to do more to engage the private sector and create a policy environment that is perceived as truly pro-business. Let us not think that our export competitiveness could be improved by being able to adjust the exchange rates alone.

There exists long-ignored impediments to growth; developing a skilled and flexible workforce; a consistent, predicable and cohesive policy framework to drive exports or attract Foreign Direct Investment to high-tech knowledge driven sectors, an efficient cost-effective bureaucracy to remodel public spending and transparent and effective institutional and governance mechanisms to support overall development efforts. Let us not forget that we have much more to learn from our Asian neighbours in many of these areas, best practices and to avoid wrong policy path, if we are to achieve the dream of being the "Wonder of Asia" in the years to come.

So far, the country has not seen any notable successes in drawing investments into manufacturing or high value services for export. Most of the Foreign Direct Investments are related only to leisure and mixed development projects that bring little skills upgrading or technology transfer.

With regard to the donor profile, much has changed during the past 10 years of this regime. As a result of reaching a greater level of per capita income and subsequent classification as a lower-middle income country, we no longer qualify to certain forms of concessional financing from multilateral donors such as ADB and the World Bank.

1127 1128

We have also had to suffer cut-backs on financing from western bilateral donors for political reasons, to say the least. Today, of our total foreign financial commitments, China accounts for 42 per cent, followed by Japan, 25 per cent and India, 14.5 per cent and also Korea to a considerable extent. Thus, more than 85 per cent of Sri Lankas post-2005 external development finance has originated from Asia. It is a notable feature now that while our relationship with traditional donors have become somewhat strained, there has been greater reliance on aid from non-traditional development partners, especially China and India. It is observed that the aid from traditional donors to Asia has been declining while the volume of development co-operation from non-OECD Development Assistance Committee Members has been increasing. Asian aid providers such as China, India and South Korea are now visible across the world and these Asian giants have changed the nature of international corporation relationship, referring to themselves as "South-South Co-operation Partners" rather than donors. The sources of Foreign Direct Investment too are dominated by Asia with India, China, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore and United Arab Emirates being the largest investors in Sri Lanka.

On the issue of whether the measures announced in the Budget would have a negative impact, particularly on the better macroeconomic conditions that have been achieved, which I mentioned at the outset, we need to look at whether expansionary measures such as the increase in Public Service emoluments, Rs. 120 billion, and subsidies, Rs. 60 billion, will increase aggregate demand. There is bound to be upward pressure on prices, as these are not linked to productivity improvements.

Domestic consumption has a high import component in Sri Lanka. As it is in all small countries, this will mean that the increase in aggregate demand generated by the Budget is very likely to exert some pressure in the balance of payments. The reduction in tariffs on motor vehicles to generate additional Government revenue will also have a negative impact on the external resources of the country.

It is time now that we also revisit our "Five Hub Plus Tourism" concept to see the achievements and introduce some changes by looking at past performance. Of course, the concept was formulated with the aim of developing industries which are consistent with taking advantage of the countrys geographic location in terms of its proximity to major international shipping lanes and the Indian Subcontinent. However, should we not reflect on making interventions, let alone resourcing such interventions to facilitate structurally across six vastly different hubs appears to be a daunting challenge? This is more so, as each sector needs different factor endowments and infrastructure requirements. Focusing on a fewer,

perhaps one or two, closely-related sectors, as done by most of the East Asian countries, may be a prudent path to follow. A more streamlined approach would not only help minimize the investment outlay in bringing factor endowments up to the required level, but also ease the coordination interventions by freezing up more Government resources to be concentrated in a particular thrust sector.

Let me also invite your attention, Sir, to the fact that now it is likely that interest rates could rise as credit demand picks up once again. For the Government, it is going to be a delicate trade off. Sri Lanka is increasingly dependent on foreign investor demand for its Treasury Bills and Bonds to finance its fiscal deficit. If interest rates reduce further and consequently, the yields on Treasury Bonds, it would make these Bonds less attractive to foreign investors. If it falls to a level where the spread between the return on Treasury Bonds and the return on Sri Lankas Sovereign Bonds is quite slim, foreign investors would consider the elevated currency risk and sell off their investments or at least, avoid future investments on rupee-denominated Treasury Bills and Bonds. This could adversely impact on the Governments ongoing and much needed capital-raising efforts.

Sir, another factor which may influence the edging up of interest rates would be the drawing down of the extraordinary monetary measures in the United States, namely, tapering of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve. This, coupled with sustained recovery in output in the US Economy, could push up global interest rates and consequently, raise the international borrowing costs for Sri Lanka as well. Ironically, the US Federal Reserve yesterday announced the end of the programme of quantitative easing, which pumped trillions of dollars into the US Economy. With the Chinese, Japanese and South Korean economies slowing down, this announcement of withdrawal of the programme of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve is bound to negatively impact on some Asian economies.

Sir, I thought I should mention these matters because the hard-earned fiscal consolidation that we were able to achieve during the past ten years and particularly, after 2009 when we were able to conclude the war with the peace dividends and the expected growth which has now brought our country to the -income group, we would rather be wise in focusing on the expected external shocks that can reverse this trend that we have seen.

[6.18 p.m]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the name of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa will go down in history as the "Father of Technical Education in Sri Lanka". There is no doubt about that. When he addressed the 62nd General Assembly of the United Nations in 2007, he outlined this concept for the first time. At that Assembly he said, The 'Mahinda Chintana Ten-year Development Vision' includes continuous, qualitative upgrading of education and health programmes in all areas, livelihood initiatives for low income groups, and broad social welfare programmes covering the poor and disadvantaged of the society, and those specially aimed at children and women.

In this respect, he goes to the North, the South, and the East. The other day we were with him in the Trincomalee District. He opened several Mahindodaya technical laboratories. Not only that, Sir, he opened several language laboratories and technological laboratories in Jaffna. What is most significant is that the Jaffna Tamil children - boys and girls - are learning Tamil, Sinhalese, and English in one language laboratory. That is the advantage he has given to the people of this country. So, they will be qualified in all these three languages in time to come.

An article in the "Daily News" states, "Equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, the new laboratories include a science laboratory, mathematics laboratory, language laboratory, distance education unit and an information and communication laboratory. These have been built spending around Rs. 15 million for each unit.

The Government initiated the Mahindodaya technical laboratories programme to develop 1,000 secondary schools with modern amenities with the aim of providing equal educational opportunities for children in all areas by enhancing facilities in schools. The aim of this programme is to get rid of the "Popular Schools" concept and build schools with developed facilities in all areas".

I was with His Excellency the President at the Al Hijra Vidyalaya, Thambalagamuwa, when he said that he

1239 1240

will send all Muslims, particularly poor Muslims, to perform the Haj pilgrimage. He did not say that he will use State funds. The UNP, specially, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and another Member said yesterday, Why do you not send people to Buddhagaya? There is no doubt that they can go to Buddhagaya. They can go to other places, Catholic areas, everywhere, but it is their own money. " . " "" .

What a great thing, Sir! The Muslims are overjoyed because over and over again, some Muslims goes to Mecca because they have the money. But, a man who does not have the money cannot go You know that in Sinhalese villages where Muslims are living, 50 60 . Quota system . . . .

The President goes into the aspects of all religions and helps the people. So, some people went and complained to him. There are some who have performed Haj more than 25 times, and there are others who cannot go even once. So, it is a great thing that has been done by the Head of State.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. Hon. Deputy Minister has to reply.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Muslim community is thankful to the President. [.. 6.22] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mohan Lal Grero - Deputy Minister of Education) . . 334 72 .
