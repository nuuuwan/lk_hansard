, , . . . , , . [3.40 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity given to participate in this Debate.

Two Orders have been made under the Strategic Development Projects Act by the Hon. Minister of Investment Promotion published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1847/36 and No. 1847/37 and have been placed for approval before this Parliament.

The Hon. Minister who preceded me complained bitterly that the ordinary people of this country are being misled by the Opposition. He said that there are no hidden agendas. He emphatically said that there is no gambling enterprise, no casino in these projects but that

1555 1556

the Opposition has misled not only the ordinary people but even the Venerable Mahanayaka Theros and induced them to write a letter asking that these Orders be amended. I do not think the Hon. Minister should devalue the intelligence of the Venerable Mahanayake Theros. Several Members in the Government ranks themselves consciously kept away from participating when a Division was called for last evening. One Member of the Government, the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero quite decisively voted against the approval of these two Orders. Is it the Hon. Ministers position that he also has been misled by the Opposition? Why is it? Ask yourself, "why"? Leave aside what the Opposition says; leave aside the people you say have been misled; are you not able to convince even Members in your ranks, Members who support every other effort of the Government? You are unable to convince them that this does not include a gambling enterprise.

Now, this is what the Orders state. I quote:

"The above Strategic Development Project shall be called and known as a 'the Project to establish and operate an Integrated Super Luxury Tourist Resort which consists.... high-end shopping malls, high quality residencies and office spaces/service spaces .... ' ".

What these services are, we do not know.

"...with associated facilities..."

Both Orders have the words, service spaces with associated facilities.

The Opposition and the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya moved that this be clarified very clearly and be made known to the country. If, as you say, all this anxiety is unfounded, the anxieties of the Venerable Mahanayake Theros are unfounded, the anxieties of your own Government Members are unfounded, why could the Orders specifically not exclude those enterprises, which most intelligent people in this country including several in your ranks know to be "associated facilities", are the services you mentioned that will occupy those service spaces, in these two projects? That is why for the first time perhaps there have been so many abstentions from the Government and even a vote against.

This country has a rich tradition. It is a home of at least four great religions, not just one or two but four great religions of this world. What does Buddhism say about gambling? In the Sutta Pitaka, in the Sigalovada Sutta of Digha Nikaya, Buddha explains. "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in indulging in gambling: (1) the winner begets hate; (2) the loser grieves for lost wealth; (3) loss of wealth; (4) his word is not relied upon in a court of law; (5) he is despised by his friends and associates; (6) he is not sought after for matrimony, for people would say he is a gambler and is not fit to look after a wife".

"What are the six channels for dissipating wealth which he does not pursue? (a) indulgence in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessness; (b) sauntering in streets at unseemly hours; (c) frequenting theatrical shows; (d) indulgence in gambling which causes heedlessness; (e) association with evil companions; and (f) the habit of idleness".

It is not only Buddhism that has so much to say about gambling, intoxication and debauchery. All of these associated activities may be included in the two Orders that are being debated.

The Rig-Veda from the Hindu scriptures 10:34:13 has this to say: Play not with dice; no, cultivate thy own land. Enjoy the gain, and deem that wealth sufficient. It says, Do not play with the dice. You work with your own hands. Earn, that wealth deem it sufficient.

The Bhagavad Gita arose from the epic Mahabharat. That whole epic is founded on how kingdoms were lost as a result of gambling; not only the kingdom but even the wife was pawned and lost and it led to this great war that resulted in brothers killing each other.

Take the other religious scriptures. In the Quran, Chapter 5, Verses 90 and 91, states: O you who believe, intoxicants, and gambling, and the altars of idols, and the games of chance are abominations of the devil; you shall avoid them, that you may succeed. The devil wants to provoke animosity and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling, and to distract you from remembering God, and from obscuring the Contact Prayers. Will you then refrain?"

I am glad that at least the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress has desisted from voting for these Orders and stayed away, but they should have had the guts to come into the Chamber and vote against this as did the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero. Bold, he was yesterday, stood by his principles, understood his scriptures, understood the injunctions of his religion and was willing to be counted even as one person in the midst of so many. I am saddened that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress does not have the spine to stand for what they believe; to stand for their own scripture.

I referred to three religious teachings. I am a Christian. We abhor gambling. We are taught not to participate in games of chance; that we must work with our hands; that we must do an honest job of work and earn a living only out of the sweat of our brow and not to engage in games of chance. It is not only that. Even the irreligious can take this to heart. A recent study done by Professor John Weltle of the University at Buffalo Research Institute on Addictions shows clearly that gambling is the second-most destructive addiction after drug addiction and casino habits is the third biggest reason for family breakdown. We see this all the time;

1557 1558

[ .. ]

2014 25

how families go to ruin when the breadwinner earns a little money and gambles it away. A gambler never wins. It is a myth that through gambling you can win. It entices you; it keeps you and it lures you to spend more; to invest more. It is always the agency that wins; it is the enterprise that wins; it is the owners of the gambling dens who always win. They never make a loss. So, they prey on the weakness of the people. They prey on the avariciousness of people, who think that they can make a quick buck this way and that is a grave sin according to any religious teaching and even thinking areligiously, looking at what these vices do to family life, to people in their own life; and if one is to be responsible, one will keep all of that away.

You cannot say that you are bringing in foreign investment and therefore whatever that investment does, is good. This is just like gambling itself - the lure of money. You think you are gaining but eventually it is this country, it is the people of this country who will lose. Those who come with this investment of US Dollars 300 million are not coming to do charity in this country. They are coming with that money to make more money. These persons have been named. These persons are known. The business that they are involved in at present is well-known to the world. That is why the fears have been raised. That is why there is anxiety that has been expressed in the letter thatthe Hon. Joseph Michael Perera tabled, which has been written by the Venerable Mahanayakes. You do not bring a gambler to invest and then assuade the people, try and explain it to the country and say, No, there is not going to be any gambling. They are coming to build hotels and rooms, swimming pools and leisure areas and the health of the country will be better because there will be exercise facilities. No, a gambling enterprise, invests only to run that enterprise. See the kind of people you have attracted; see the kind of people who have offered, whose investment you have already accepted.

So, it is a lure of money. We understand that the Government is cash-strapped. We understand that the economy is doing badly. However much you window-dress the Central Bank Report, in that itself there is enough to show the perilous state the countrys economy is in. Therefore, to keep things afloat, while keeping things afloat, you yourself make some money on the side, line your own pockets, and you are bringing these people in, calling them "investors". They are not investors. They are sharks. They are like the loan sharks. They come with this money only to take away more money from us and this is the danger that has very clearly been realized by all right-thinking people, by the religious sector - all the religions - and by people in your own ranks. Unfortunately, except one, others did not have the backbone to speak against it and vote against it. They were merely hanging around outside in the Lobby. But, that will change. If you see how the voting has been in the last four years on Bills and Orders that have been placed

before this House, how at the beginning - take the Eighteenth Amendment for example - everybody voted, not one person could move. At the time of the impeachment of the Chief Justice, there were abstentions from the Government ranks. And, yesterday we saw the most welcome spectacle of more than 60 people abstaining effectively by staying away and one person actually voting against. Therefore, please see the writing on the wall. If you go on in this way, working against the interests of the country; working against the cultural traditions, the religious underpinnings of this country, very soon you will be out of the door.

Thank you very much. [. . 4.01] .. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake - Minister of Higher Education) , . . .
