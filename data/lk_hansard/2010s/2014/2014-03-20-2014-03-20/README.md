I would like to draw your attention particularly to Sections 5 and 11 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. You have given an Order earlier also that there must be fair and balanced reporting of the proceedings. But, certain newspapers do not follow that. Even the Hon. Leader of the Opposition took up the cudgels on behalf of the Opposition. The Lake House Group of Newspapers such as Dinamina, Daily News, and "Thinakaran" are publishing in full. Also, the Mawbima, Lakbima, Lankadeepa, Rivira, and Ada newspapers.

With regard to the health services, what did His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Finance Minister, say in the Budget Speech - 2014? The "Daily Mirror" of 22nd November, 2013 in its Supplement Mirror Business under the heading, Health Services states, I quote:

" It was also proposed to allocate Rs. 900 million to provide Reverse Osmosis (RO) water purification plants to villages in the North Central Province in which access to quality pipe borne water is not available in order to prevent waterborne diseases.

It has been planned to provide an additional allocation of Rs. 2,000 million in 2014 for the development of cost-effective infrastructure facilities to deal with non-communicable diseases during the 2014-16 Medium Term Budget Framework."

It further goes on to state, Sir, I quote:

" The President proposed to allocate Rs.1,000 million for the accelerated modernization of the two national childrens hospitals as centres of excellence capable of providing the next 10 year paediatric care needs of our country and the related medical research facilities.

It was proposed to increase the annual uniform allowance for nurses, family health workers and other staff by a further Rs. 500-1500 and the on-call duty allowance for paramedical staff by Rs. 150 per month to encourage health sector employees.

He also proposed to increase the risk allowance by R. 50-100 for those in eligible risk categories."

. .

A National Nutrition Action Plan has been launched. The countrys National Nutrition Action Plan was launched by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Friday at Monaragala. The National Coordinator of the NNC, Dr. Lalith Chandradasa said that the Action Plan had been compiled under the guidance of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in line with the National Nutrition Policy declared by the Ministry of Health. The Government has observed that the country has entered a rapid phase of growth and development and, therefore, adequate nutrition is essential for the workforce to be a physically and mentally fit productive human resource to meet the challenges. These are the most enlightened statements made by His Excellency the President with regard to the welfare of the people in this country.

Sir, at this point of time, I also want to draw the attention of the Hon. Minister of Health to another matter. There are various types of private hospitals. We encourage private hospitals, but the average man is unable to go there. Sir, under our insurance scheme, every Parliamentarian including yourself, is insured for Rs. 200,000. But, when we go to a private hospital - I have experienced this myself and the Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa also shared the same view in this regard - we might end up paying Rs. 300,000, Rs. 500,000 or even Rs. 800,000 but we are only entitled to claim Rs. 200,000. Therefore, this insurance scheme must be revised. I have already spoken to the Hon. (Mrs.) Sumedha G. Jayasena, the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and also told Mr. Gamini Senarath, the Chief of Staff at the Presidential Secretariat, who is also the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, that this insurance scheme should be revised and amended.

Although the ordinary people are unable to find money to go to private hospitals, the best medical facilities are available in Government hospitals. The other day, when I visited one of my good friends, Mr.

833 834

2014 20

Mohamed Zavahir, brother of Mohamed Kaleel of the famous Jewel Arts and a brother of Mohamed Hilmi Careem, Mayor of Matale Municipal Council - the Hon. H.M.M. Harees also knows him - he was in a private hospital. I do not want to mention names because it is not nice and ethical. He had to pay millions. Now, he is getting the best of treatment at Ward No. 6 of the National Hospital. The other day in this House, I drew the attention of the Hon. Minister to this fact.

There is the Colombo South Teaching Hospital. New buildings are being built there. I have been agitating for a long time for a private ward to be introduced to this hospital. The Director of the hospital is doing yeoman service in the eradication of dengue fever and other communicable diseases. Every circular issued by the Ministry of Health is being followed to the letter by the Director of the Colombo South Teaching Hospital. Also, I must mention that he has got a dedicated band of nurses, doctors and other staff.

Now, there is a rush at the Bandaranaike Ward and the Merchant Ward of the National Hospital. So, if we can have a paying ward established in the Colombo South Teaching Hospital as well, all the people from Colombo South, or from your area or Avissawella and further, or even from Balangoda can come there and get the best of treatment for a moderate payment with all facilities, sometimes more than in a private hospital.

Then, Sir, there is a problem with regard to leprosy in the country now.
