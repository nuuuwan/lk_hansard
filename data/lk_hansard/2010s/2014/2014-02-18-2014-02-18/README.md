(iii) 2008 14 3 (4) 2014 30 1847/37 .- [ ]

. . Ordered to lie upon the Table.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) , . Under the Strategic Development Projects Act, you must state what the strategic importance is and the projects that they are doing. . The Notification in the Gazette Extraordinary issued on 30th January, 2014 on Strategic Development Projects, Act No. 14 of 2008 refers to high-end shopping malls and high quality residencies and office spaces/service spaces with associated facilities. That is specific.

Now, associated facilities means that you go outside the provisions of the Strategic Development Projects Act; you must define what the associated facilities are.

On the last occasion you said, "casinos". Casinos is a specific one. So, I object to this and we reserve the right to take up this issue with you. Therefore, this cannot be tabled in the House today.

, . , . , . specific projects. ? . . Specifically, . , . , . . , . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , , . . , . , . . What are the "associated facilities"? . . ; . .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . . . . . , . . . . . [ ]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , . Strategic Development Projects Act 3 . Section 3(1) of the Act states, I quote:

3. (1) The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka established by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law, No. 4 of 1978, shall identify in consultation with the relevant line Ministries, any proposed project as a Strategic Development Project.

So, a "project" is very specific. I will take one of these gazettes, Gazette Extraordinary No. 1847/36, which states, I quote:

..establish and operate an Integrated Super Luxury Tourist Resort facility which includes high end shopping malls and high quality residencies and office spaces/ service spaces....."

Those are actually identified projects. When you say "associated facilities", this whole Gazette goes out of the range of this Act. Then, it is just like bringing a piece of paper and saying it is an Order. This is not an Order. You have violated the Act and you are actually breaching Parliamentary Privilege by not even bringing a proper Order. This is what is happening; . This is not a proper Order even to be tabled. It is an insult to the House.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake - Deputy Minister of Health) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) , . . . , . . , , . . ? .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) . , , .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We have acted according to the Act. I resubmit, Hon. Speaker, that we have acted according to the Act. We have presented it to the House according to a provision in the Act. If there are other issues, we can discuss those later at the Party Leaders Meeting, but not the Regulations that we have presented.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, according to Standing Order No. 20 on Public Business, an Order of the Day is a Bill or other matter. This is another matter. This is a Gazette which should be under the law of the country. You cannot bring in a Gazette that stands by itself, which has no law to back it up. It does not come under the Strategic Development Law. No, you are not under that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , , . , . . , ; . , . , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ... . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, strategic facilities can mean anything. It can be recreation; it can be grounds; it is not defined at

all. But, I must say one thing: there are no gay houses there. Gay houses will not be established. I know that. As far as this matter is concerned, it is the normal procedure of the House. I think the Leader of the Opposition is only raising a hoax. The normal procedure is, Parliament accepts the Gazette and then, as the Hon. Leader of the House of Parliament and the Chief Government Whip said, it is taken up for debate. We can debate it and you can ask for whatever you like. You can ask for other houses also. We are not going to give other houses. These are facilities that are provided for the residents, for the people who are coming to live in them. So, this is all in order, Sir. I think we can accept this; the House can accept this.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Speaker - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Thank you. Sir, the Hon. Azwer seems to suggest that you can bring anything under "associated services". He says - [Interruption.] Hon. Speaker, let me finish, please. He says that these are facilities for the residents of these apartment complexes. Let me submit to you, Sir, that over 80 per cent of revenue of this project is going to come from a casino; over 80 per cent. If that is the case, that is the specific project. It must be mentioned in the Gazette specifically. If it is 8 per cent, then that is okay. But, if it is 80 per cent, you cannot not mention that fact. Therefore, I do not think that you can accept this Gazette.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) , , . . . , . , . . .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . . It should be laid before the House. , '' , '' . . [ ] . Plane . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Minister said, "It should be laid before the House". What I am saying is, there is nothing to lay before the House. If you have a Gazette, it must be under the terms of the Strategic Development Projects Act. If it is not under the terms of the Strategic Development Projects Act, it cannot be laid before the House.[Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, this is a good opportunity for me to speak on the land issue.

We saw during the last weekend what was happening in Wanathamulla due to the activities of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. The Government is breaking down houses against the wishes of the people and is going to relocate them. When somebody speaks for those people, you abduct that person and then the people come on to the streets. These are all practice sessions for the great rebellion that you are going to face very soon in this country when people would want to throw you out of Government. The Hon. Anura Dissanayake and the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne spoke very extensively about this issue. So, I do not wish to dwell on this matter any further.

However, there is another issue that we have to talk about. You have, today, brought in a Gazette Notification on Regulations under the Land Acquisition Act for discussion. These Regulations will apply only to 18 projects that you have identified in the Gazette Notification. But, the Ministry of Urban Development, which has, on the other hand, the Ministry of Defence together with it, is using the army today for widening of

807 808

[ ]

2014 18

roads along highways. These small towns or cities do need widening of roads; true. But, how are you handling it? Are you looking at the needs of the people there? Those people who have shops and houses along the roads are given 24 hours' notice and the army personnel go there and, under threat, they just break down their premises. Some of these buildings are broken down in such a manner that only four feet is left of a building which comprised of a shop in the ground floor and a dwelling in the upper floor. So, what are those people going to do in the future? Under any land acquisition act anywhere in the world, any person who loses a business premises is entitled to an alternate premises; any person who loses a home, should be compensated with an alternate house. But, what is happening here? In 24 hours, you just break down these premises and widen the road. The people who go on that road may feel more comfortable, but those who have lived there for generations are thrown out of their homes and lose their businesses. How is it being done? It is not under any law or any regulations under the Land Acquisition Act, but just haphazardly. There was a war and it is called "Gotas War". What are you doing today? This may be under "Gotas law", which is very unfortunate. Then, you talk about the LARC and the Super LARC. But, those - the LARC and the Super LARC - are not available to these people who live along the main roads in this country.

Sir, it is happening not in one place; it is happening everywhere. If you take Dehiowita, they are going to raise the road by four feet. They are building retaining walls on both sides of the road. The wall is built above the entrance to a shop. So, once you build this road, that shop will be down under the road and even for the slightest rain, water will seep into that premises, the part of the shop that is left after this construction. Can the authorities not think and design these in such a manner that the people are affected the least? Development is necessary, but, at the same time, development should take into consideration the needs of the people who are affected by that development. That is true development. Think about it again; look at it again. Do not do it like the "Gotas War"; do it according to the law. That is all I say.

Sir, there is another issue that I wish to point out. That is about the plantation areas. There was a Land Reform Law brought in 1972 - Law No. 1 - by the National State Assembly. It was a land reform law. Generally, all over the world, you have land reform laws which take lands away from the rich and provide to the poor, who are landless. The only country where a Land Reform Law was brought in to acquire lands for the Government was in Sri Lanka. Under this Law, land was acquired and run or "run down" by the Government. Then, when the Law failed, these lands were returned to the private sector and the private companies are running these estates. But, there are consequences faced by the people today. Under the Land Reform Law, every person was given a ceiling of 50 acres of dry, agricultural land and 25 acres of wet,

agricultural land. There was a process of statutory determination to give the 50 acres of land. When the 50 acres were given to a person, the statutory determination required that in addition to the 50 acres, an area not exceeding half an acre surrounding the residence of the owner of such land, any garden surrounding staff quarters or labour lines on such land not in excess of one-eighth of an acre and any area not exceeding half an acre set a part for family burial grounds should also be added to that. So, these were added to the 50 acres that were given as statutory determination. Today, some of these people who got these 50 acres or a family of three to four people which got 150 to 200 acres also got two to five or ten acres extra to accommodate the labourers. In many of these estates, today, the owners of the land, for whom the extra land was provided to accommodate those labourers, workers or the staff, are trying to evict those workers. So, by this, the workers who were brought to this country over 150 years ago, promising them jobs, a land to live on and a house to stay in, are being deprived of whatever they had, not the ownership, but just the chance to live in. This is very unfortunate.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It was done by the British Raj. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It was the British Raj, right. When the Land Reform Law was brought, there was consideration given to these workers by providing them 20 perches or one-eighth of an acre. But, today, the owners are trying to evict them. - [Interruption.] So, the LRC has the responsibility to protect these people, the workers, who are living in these line rooms or who are entitled to actually 20 perches of land each . There are three cases which I wish to point out to this House.

In the Deltota area, there is an estate called Galaha Estate. Of this estate, 40 acres were sold to a private person and this person is, today, asking for Rs. 50,000 per perch for the stretch of land in which the line rooms are built. Maybe, they have to pay Rs. 250,000 for about four or five perches. He has asked them to work for him and he is deducting the money from them. How unreasonable? He got 2.6 acres extra. The original person who got the statutory determination had got 2.6 acres extra. Out of 100 acres, he has sold 40 acres to this person. At least one acre of land is available for the purpose of accommodating the workers, but he is trying to evict them.

The second case is in Haputale, in the Badulla District. There is an estate called Roehampton Estate. The owner of this estate has got 3.1 acres extra to accommodate the workers who were living in that estate. But, today, he has gone to the Department of Labour and

809 810

filed an application for termination of the employees. At the termination inquiry, the Labour Officer who conducted the inquiry has said, The employer has asked for your termination. You will be paid compensation according to the formula and once the compensation is paid, you are no more an employee; you have to move out of the estate. We went and objected. We said, "Termination is a different thing. As far as these people who occupy the land, that is the right that they have acquired under the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of 1972. This owner has been given an extra one eighth of an acre for each worker. They are entitled to live there and they should be allowed to continue to live there". The Labour Officer has now agreed that he will not interfere in the land issue, but only implement the termination issue. So, we are not willing to accept the termination because it might end up in throwing out these workers. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I just want to mention one more case. In Nawalapitiya, there is an estate called Bohil Estate in Baranda Division. This was owned by one Ileyperuma. The father and the mother got 50 acres each and they have sold that property. Two children who were minors in 1973, applied for their entitlement and they were given 100 acres. But, the Land Reform Commission probably did not read the Land Reform Law. They gave 100 acres absolute ownership to these two children and the two children now say that they own the 100 acres and they will throw out the workers. If they gave those 100 acres under the statutory determination to this Illeyperumas children, they should have provided extra land to accommodate the workers who are living there, so that they would not be evicted. These are issues that are being mishandled by the Land Reform Commission, which does not come under the Ministry of Lands and Land Development, but is held by His Excellency the President himself.

Therefore, please look at this issue in a humanitarian manner and see that nobody is evicted from their homes, where they were guaranteed abode right from the time they were brought to this country.

Thank you.
