( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, I can convey your request to the Hon. Minister.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay. The Tsunami disaster fell on Naduvuttu Village in Kinniya in 2004. By then, there was a primary school. Will that also be restored?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Initially, we have constructed one school within a 500-metre radius. From the coastal belt, there is a no-build zone that has been declared. So, whatever school that you are referring to, if you could send your request to the Hon. Minister in writing, he will follow it up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is misusing the time allotted to him. He is discussing about the visits of the President. It is true that according to the Constitution, the President is responsible to Parliament and executes his functions properly. But here, Sir, whatever the Constitution may state, you regulate the Business of the

885 886

House according to the Standing Orders. The Hon. Chief Government Whip pointed out to the House Standing Order No. 78. According to that, you cannot discuss the conduct of the President, acting President, Members of Parliament, judges and that of the Hon. Speaker - although it is not mentioned here - unless upon a Substantive Motion.

, " " . , . " answer . , " . That is also a right of a Minister in this House. So, that principle also must be honoured and accepted. As the Hon. Chief Government Whip pointed out, these type of questions cannot be asked. Supplementary Questions . -[ ] .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to speak on the Regulations made under the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act. I must congratulate the Hon. Minister of Health for introducing these Regulations, a most welcome step to have pictorial warnings printed on cigarette packs. The Hon. Minister has publicly stated, when this effort was taken, how the tobacco industry worked to prevent this becoming a reality. There was some compromise made with regard to the size of the picture on the pack. Yet, at the end, we do have a satisfactory result and I must congratulate the Hon. Minister for not giving in to pressures, but for keeping the health of the nation as a paramount consideration and ensuring that these pictorial warnings are gazetted as Regulations.

If one were to look at the history of this Act, again I must congratulate the Jathika Hela Urumaya, which originally introduced a Bill in Parliament with the prohibition of sale of alcohol and tobacco for persons under a certain age, and when the industries challenged it in the Supreme Court, there were other religious dignitaries also who intervened and supported the effort of the Jathika Hela Urumaya at that time. In fact, a feature that later became part of the Act and was introduced by the then Minister of Health is to prohibit smoking in enclosed public places. That was not there in the original Act, but was introduced subsequent to a recommendation made by the Supreme Court. It is an unprecedented move where the Supreme Court, while exercising its jurisdiction to test the constitutionality of what is contained in the Act, went beyond that and made a recommendation that Parliament could consider introducing a ban on smoking in enclosed public areas. That was brought in as a prohibition and subsequently, it has been enforced as a prohibition of smoking in public places.

As the Chairman of the Authority, Prof. Carlo Fonseka also needs to be congratulated for taking this forward together with the Hon. Minister, who is a health-conscious person seen walking every morning for his own physical fitness. We have a healthy situation where, despite the powerful lobby - that is, the tobacco industry - the Hon. Minister and the authorities have stuck to their task and I think we must move forward further.

The Hon. Member who spoke before me referred to the increase of incidents of women smoking. That is also because of women being particularly targeted in

911 912

[ () ]

2014 19

advertising to say that they can lose weight by smoking. Similarly, we have incidents where young people are targeted. Even in this country, at 1.30 p.m. or 1.45 p.m. when the schools close, it has been found out that there are certain attractive young personalities who stand outside the schools smoking and they are paid by the industry to do that, to give that image, that it is a cool thing for young people to smoke. So, the industry is very sophisticated in using this kind of "real" advertisements to target the youth of this country. I am glad that there are many school children in the Gallery today as we discuss this and, as one voice in this House without any party differences, we affirm that these social evils must be contained, the future generations must not become victims of propaganda of advertisement that mislead them and that when they make choices in life, they should be properly informed. We are not against people having the freedom to choose, but they must have the proper information before they make that choice. It is in that direction that this Regulation is most welcomed, because there is a pictorial warning of the real hazard of smoking so that the person who lays his hands on that pack becomes informed that it is, in fact, injurious to his health; that it is a major cause of cancer and various other diseases and that information is there before he or she makes a responsible choice.

So, without taking any further time, Sir, let me wind up once again congratulating the Hon. Minister and the Authority for this bold and progressive step that has been taken.

Thank you very much. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. P. Dayaratna. You have five minutes. [.. 3.29]
