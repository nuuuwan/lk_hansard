( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Member, give me just half a second to explain. ( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) I know you have been fighting for this for a long time. But, the purpose of that Treaty is lost if the receiving country has not signed it. According to the UN system, it will be applicable only if the both parties have signed the agreement. So, what is the use of Sri Lanka signing it, if Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman are not signing it?

( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) Actually, the International Trade Union Confederation and various other civil organizations are very actively involved in this issue and all these countries have signed it.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) All these countries are sending-countries. But, what I am saying is, even if Sri Lanka is signing it, the purpose is lost if Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman are not signing.

( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) Philippines has originally signed it. Then, Indonesia has signed it.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) If the receiving country is not signing it, we are not bound by that.

( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) My point, Hon. Minister, is that, first we have to set an example. As a sending country, it is our responsibility.

, .

!

. , , . .

! , . A common standard-setting mechanism has to be established at the regional level. Hon. Minister, I want you to take up this matter and give leadership to it. Sometime back, when I went to Pakistan for a tripartite conference, this issue came up and almost all the countries agreed to this. There is a demand for labour in those countries, especially for domestic workers, and we have the labour here. So, why can we not make a demand?

. " . " . . , . . ! . . 189 201 . .

Then, there have been discussions of the Colombo Process. . , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Member, we invited them. We had a discussion with them. For the first SOM Meeting of the Colombo Process, all the NGOs were invited. You are talking about the second meeting, are you not?

1477 1478

2014 12

( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) For the first meeting, they were invited. ( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) But, I do not think the trade unions were invited. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) For the first one, they were invited, but not for the second one.

( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) I do not think they were invited even for the first one because as a migrant workers' trade union, normally we are invited for other discussions. But, for this one, we did not get an invitation. Anyway, if you are processing on that, then it is good.

, . . . . . Colombo Process . You must have collaboration, as I said, with other regional countries and bring about common labour standards, so that all can jointly make a demand.

Hon. Chairman, almost four years to date, on the 10th of December 2010, I was appointed to the newly-created Cabinet portfolio of the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare. Earlier, it was a part of the Ministry of External Affairs. I was then the Deputy Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs, working under the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne, who was the Minister. It is the expectation of every Member of Parliament to end his career as a Cabinet Minister. It was expected that I will be overjoyed, but, I experienced a strange feeling of despondency. I knew nothing of foreign employment, its coverage, depth or responsibilities. My initial reaction was an opt to continue working as the Deputy to the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne, from whom I could learn so much more. But, he advised me against it; that I should accept the challenge and move on. I am deeply grateful for his advice. I finally took the decision to accept, for I knew His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa was earlier the Minister for this portfolio, and could depend on his guidance. Most of all, I was inspired by the message in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future" which offered inspiration for the marginalized migrant workers, especially housemaids.

Four years later, I stand before you, today, to give an account of my work in this Ministry and, invite you to judge me on whether I have fulfilled the vision laid out in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future". I am gratified that the Opposition has given one full, stand-alone session, indicating the importance the Opposition has accorded to foreign employment functions. Every year, at the Committee Stage Discussion, I produce a Performance Report about the activities of the Ministry. Today, too, I am presenting the details of the activities of the fourth year of the Ministry, using the opportunity to give a summary of the past four years.

The Members of this House at todays Discussion have shared their specific concerns, giving details of specific failures and points which need rectification. I am very appreciative of their comments whether they came from the Opposition or the Government Benches. I have carefully noted them, and I, with my officials, will provide solutions for each of them.

I wish to use the time given to me today to discuss policies rather than details pertaining to foreign employment. I may mention that I, a neophyte in foreign employment, was honoured with the appointment as Chair-in-Office of the Colombo Process. The Colombo Process is a grouping of eleven labour-sending countries of Asia, and, has within it, the countries which receive the

1491 1492

largest remittances in the world market of foreign employment. The world remittance market is US Dollars 450 billion a year. The highest is obtained by India, which is US Dollars 70 billion; the next is China which is US Dollars 69 billion; the third highest is the Philippines which is US Dollars 25 billion. Within the ten highest remittance receivers are also Bangladesh with US Dollars 14 billion and Vietnam with US Dollars 10 billion. Sri Lanka earns US Dollars 7 billion. Among the Colombo Process countries, Sri Lanka is one of the lowest in remittances. Population-wise too, she is one of the lowest. Populations of India and China are counted in billions; Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam count in hundreds of millions. Despite Sri Lankas small status in population and remittances in the foreign employment field, I was vested with the responsibility of Chair-in-Office of these eleven countries for two years. This is not bad for a bhaiya from Wellassa, who straddles the foreign employment world, from humble Badulla to the capitals of the eleven labour sending countries of Asia, which earns over 50 per cent of the worlds remittances. I am sure some of the Members in the Opposition, and maybe some of the officials in my own Bureau, must be thinking that a bhaiya from Wellassa is heading this institution or for some people from Colombo, it may be a bit of a comedown. But, this is the responsibility that His Excellency has given me.

There had been three Chairs-in-Office of the Colombo Process before me. They are Philippines, Indonesia and Bangladesh. In their Chairmenship, they held one Senior Officials Meeting - SOM. Already, within one year, I have held two SOMs, attended by senior officials of each of the 11 Colombo Process countries. I have also found funds for the third SOM, which will be held in 2015. There is also a separate activity where the eleven Colombo Process countries meet the senior officials of each of the 27 European Union countries. This is called Asia-European Union Dialogue on Labour Migration. Two had been held earlier in Brussels, Belgium in the years 2008 and 2011. The third was due and the European Union, recognising the outstanding leadership of Sri Lanka in migration dynamics, decided to hold the third Dialogue in Colombo under the Chairmanship of a bhaiya from Badulla. This, two-day event was held in Colombo, last month to celebrate the first year of the current Chairs assumption of responsibility. One of the major hurdles which our employees face, is the lack of a Standard Employment Contract, which the Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam too referred in his speech today. In association with UN Women, this Ministry organized an Asia-Gulf States Regional Dialogue, out of which, the terms of a Standard Employment Contract were developed. This was endorsed by the SOMs, which I referred to earlier, and would be the basis for negotiations on labour terms.

Two international SOMs - Asia-EU Dialogue and UN Conference on Labour Migration - all completed in one year, are not achievements to be sniffed at. One of the main problems faced by Sri Lanka and all the labour-sending countries in Asia is that the Middle East is a buyers market. As such, it could unilaterally determine its own practices and there is no appeal. We have, therefore, developed MoUs and bilateral agreements with a number of countries like UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Italy, and South Korea, to provide a modicum of welfare, support and protection for Sri Lankan workers and promote employment opportunities. Whenever senior officials visit those countries, these MoUs are always used as basic documents for discussion.

International recognition is not lightly given. Though Sri Lanka is small in terms of population and remittances, like in cricket, we are top of the league in foreign employment. There is none so blind, as those who do not wish to see. I wish the UNP and the others in the Opposition, who indulged in carping criticism in these two hours of Discussion, will open their eyes and see, as international actors have done, the outstanding contributions this Ministry has made, now applauded and emulated by the world.

When I was appointed as the Minister of this Ministry, I had no idea about the subject. I immediately convened the senior-most officials in my Ministry for a two-day meeting. I imprisoned them in a hotel in Wadduwa, and the two days were devoted for intense discussions, which went on late into the night. Each participant expressed his/her views frankly, all for the good. The Buddha called them " ". , . workshop .

I was not a warder of this group of persons, but one of them. The meeting had a twofold objective: one, to develop the road map for the future years of the Ministry and the other, for me to learn, to educate myself. We were successful. In respect of the Ministry, we developed a vision, which reads, Sri Lanka to be the best choice for competent human resources for the overseas market. The recognition given to Sri Lanka by our competitors testifies to that. This vision statement gives a grand, panoramic oversight. We reduced this vision into an overall implementable mission, which was to, create efficient and equitable pathways for people to benefit from their skills in overseas employment markets, securing interests of all stakeholders while contributing to economic growth. This was our mission. This four-year period is a testament, to the different stages and activities within them, in the fulfilling of this mission.

Based on the insights provided at the workshop, it was decided that the business of the Ministry and its

1493 1494

[ ]

2014 12

agencies, was labour mobility for foreign employment, thus being an enabler for sustainable development.

We have about 275,000 migrant workers, leaving our shores every year. Of them, 100,000 are housemaids and about 35,000 of them are going out for the first time. When I assumed duties, over 50 per cent of those going abroad were housemaids. We have reduced this to about 33 to 35 per cent right now. But, the point to be noted is that a substantial majority were from the rural areas, which tapped the most poverty-stricken layer of our population. Foreign employment is a mechanism for poverty alleviation. The sole institution responsible for the welfare of migrant workers is the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, called the Bureau. This was an administrative organization, responsible for regulating the labour migration process and adjudicating on their governance. It has obtained ISO 9001-2008 quality Management System Certification as, have done the Ministry and its agencies, the only one to do so in Sri Lanka. But, the Bureau is not an organic body that truly represented the intimate concerns of migrant workers. There was a dire need for such a body, particularly, in the rural areas. This matter was raised by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva in his speech as well.

The main institution of rural administration is the Kachcheri, established by the British in 1798. Recent introductions were the Pradeshiya Sabhas in 1987 and Divisional Secretariats in 1993. Both these were introduced by President Premadasa. It is a pity that his son, who is a good Friend of mine coming from the same alma mater and a distinguished Member of this House, has not been emulative of his father, as he belongs to the wrong party. It does not matter. I wish him a long and distinguished stay in the Opposition.

The Pradeshiya Sabha is an elected body and the Divisional Secretariat is an appointed one. One is manned by elected officials and the other by appointed officials. I have now inserted into the rural administration through the third institution, the Ratviruwo Organization, which attends to the needs of migrant worker returnees and represents migrant workers abroad. It is managed by the migrant workers themselves. It is a self-managing institution.

Last Saturday, we celebrated the first anniversary of the creation of this path-finding organization. The National Committee of which there are 331 Rataviruwo Organizations, one from each Divisional Secretariat, met His Excellency the President. He congratulated them for it had been his dream coming true that a self-managed institution be created for migrant workers. When the time comes for me to leave this blessed Island, as all must do someday, it will be with the satisfaction that I had a hand in introducing a viable, services-oriented, rural institution to be managed by our Rataviruwos. Now, it will be my task to delegate to the Rataviruwo Organization, the

activities undertaken by the Bureau. It is my hope that eventually the 331 Rataviruwo Organizations will manage foreign employment with the Bureau withering away.

To support Rataviruwo Organizations, we are building Migrant Resource Centres. Already, these are operational in Matugama and Tangalle. Three are now being built in Ratnapura, Hali-Ela and Dambulla. Eventually, there will be a Migrant Resource Centre for each district. With the Rataviruwo Organization as the guiding body for migrant workers, and Migrant Resource Centres functioning as knowledge providing bodies, we have established for our migrant workers, a truly path-finding innovative institution.

My Ministry, like the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, is solely devoted to the sourcing and development of human resources. While the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs concentrates on employing them within Sri Lanka, my Ministry deals with getting employment for them outside Sri Lanka. Human resources are a factor of production, the other factors being financial resources and material resources. While financial and material resources are inert and pliable, subject to the wishes of their owners, human resources are different. They are not homogenous. They have diverse ideas, sundry thoughts, manifold approaches, different values, assumptions and prejudices. The job of the management is to fulfil the vision and mission of that particular organization by moulding human resources to that end. I have the responsibility of moulding 275,000 departing migrant workers every year, according to the vision and mission of my Ministry. It is a demanding and exacting task, but at the end, leading to an enjoyable finality of poverty alleviation.

At the early stages, migrant workers were at the lowest end of the employment scale. They were unskilled workers who went abroad either as labourers or untrained housemaids. But, gradually they became semi-skilled and now are the highest contributors of foreign exchange to the country. The figures are startling. I assumed duties in 2011. In 2010, the year before I assumed duties, remittances were US Dollars 4.1 billion. In 2011, it was US Dollars 5.1 billion; in 2012, US Dollars 5.98 billion; in 2013, US Dollars 6.4 billion and we are projecting US Dollars 7 billion for 2014. This means that this year, Rs.900 billion is being injected into the rural economy by one-fourth of our population for better consumption and for improved schooling, health and general welfare. With my assumption of duties, I was given a target of remittances of US Dollars 7 billion for 2016. I achieved it in 2014. The revised target for 2016 is US Dollars 10 billion, and I will achieve it.

Rataviruwos deserve visible State recognition for their contributions towards ensuring macroeconomic stability. Rataviruwo remittances finance Sri Lankas oil imports and leave something more. Their remittances were a

1495 1496

major contribution to our successful war effort. As such, it is an obligation of the State to support and sustain them. This is not a concession, but an entitlement. Accordingly, in this years Budget, a scheme has been mooted to offer pensions to returning Rataviruwos. I have instructed my officials to work out the details and I expect the scheme to be operational in six months.

Similarly, in this years Budget, duty-free concessions to purchase vehicles have been offered. This will cover transport vehicles and other vehicles like three-wheelers, dimo battas et cetera enabling the returning Rataviruwos to engage in small-scale transport business ventures.

Sir, I would like to, with your permission, at this moment table* the rest of my speech and I would urge you to include it in Hansard.

I will take the next 10 minutes to reply to some of the points raised by the Hon. Members in this House in a humanitarian manner. I will not try to reply to the Members who went to the level of mud-slinging using unparliamentary language. I do not intend to reply to such Members because my Ministry is a Ministry which has got the ISO status. So, let me keep it up.

There was a point raised by an Hon. Member of the TNA who was talking about the UN Human Rights Council. Hon. Chairman, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights of Migrants, Mr. Franois Crpeau was in Sri Lanka on the 28th of January, 2013. What did he say? He asked us not to implement the regulation that we have put banning mothers who have children under five years of age going abroad.

: :: Rest of the speech tabled:

As mentioned, Rataviruwos, in the early stage, were recruited for raw muscle power. Since my assumption of duties, I have infused knowledge and technology to them, enabling them to become semi-skilled and skilled. By doing so, they earn higher salaries. An example is the Saudi housemaid. When I assumed duties she was earning Rs.18,000 a month. In four years, she is earning Rs. 34,000 a month. I have been able to almost double their salaries. This was possible by training and an insistence that they obtain the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) qualifications. I may mention that the Sri Lankan local housemaid market has felt a significant impact of the knock on attraction of the overseas market. In Sri Lanka, it is difficult to find a housemaid, and, if available, demand Rs. 18,000-Rs. 25,000 a month, with specified duties and work hours and also a separate room with TV. When I hear complaints of Sri Lankan bourgeois women of uppity housemaids, my heart warms. I have been able to give respect and recognition to a hitherto marginalized, exploited and invisible domestic worker when working in Sri Lanka. I look forward to the day, when a Sri Lankan domestic worker goes to her workplace, driving her Nano car. This happened recently, when a returnee Korean worker came to see me, driving his car. It was not long time ago, when a woman, perhaps wearing a strong perfume, was sniffily asked, Housemaid? It was not long time ago, when a boy, wearing a loud shirt was haughtily remarked Dubai returned? No longer. I am proud to have given recognition, empowerment and dignity to these workers.

This empowerment was provided by training, ensuring each departing domestic worker has skills and knowledge, at least to NVQ3 level. NVQ3 qualifications have been made compulsory for employment as domestic housekeeping assistant in Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Cyprus and Hong Kong. Every housemaid has to undergo a compulsory 22-30 day pre-departure oriented residential programme, covering skills of her work and given a smattering of the host country language. Caregiver training courses were started, specifically targeting the Italian market. These were conducted in 29 Bureau-run centres and 13 private centres. The figures are as follows:

1499 1500

The Bureau has become a major training institution. The addition to the above, it is instrumental in introducing Information Technology to enhance knowledge capacities. A number of IT training centres have been set up. A computer lab was opened at Hali Ela and two multimedia foreign language training cnetres had been opened at Ratmalana and Tangalle. We are changing our focus from merely sending our migrant workers abroad, to training all of them, skilling them before sending them abroad. Training will be a game changer.

The entrepreneurs of the labour market are our labour agents. We have given recognition to their hard work, of finding the migrant workers and taking them through the administrative processes. I introduced a system of giving star grades to them, starting with one star and going up to five. In 2012, the year in which the scheme was inaugurated, no labour agency qualified to get the highest grade of five stars. This year, in the awards given last week, one qualified, with a number getting four stars and less. I have extended the scheme of granting stars to our collaborating agents abroad. Excellence awards were granted to recruitment agents in Dubai, Lebanon, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Oman and the Maldives. By this scheme we were able to build a quality inter-linked labour agent system, tying both the supplier agent in Sri Lanka and the receiver agent abroad.

Labour agents, as well as the Bureau, have been such troubled by the labour recruiting activities by a class called sub-agents. There is much reason to eliminate them from the system. I have been thinking of incorporating the Rataviruwo Organization into the migrant worker recruiting business, thus reducing the unwelcome activities of these sub-agents.

The issue of sub-agents leads me directly to the issues of direct concern to members on both sides of this House, that of complaints of our Rataviruwos working abroad. Before dealing with them, I wish to make some preliminary remarks. As mentioned above, there are about 275,000 migrant workers going abroad every year, of them about 100,000 are women, 35,000 of them for the first time. Foreign employment is a circular activity. It is estimated that there is a stock of 1.7 million migrant workers of which about a million are women, mostly housemaids. In 2013, there were 11,521 complaints of various types, 2565 from men and 8956 from women. This is less than 1% of our migrant workers. The main complaints are breach of employment contract - 2049, non-payment of agreed wages - 2020, harassments - 7741, sickness - 1561, homicide was just two. The complaints of every individual are of concern, and every complaint to be looked into and remedial action is taken. It would be noticed that sexual harassment is 1741, just 0.1%. So, we need to have a sense of proportion and balance in dealing with these

numbers. I highlight the word dealing as many tend to only just highlight the numbers.

H.E. the President, in the Mahinda Chinthanaya, placed heavy emphasis on the humanitarian aspects of foreign employment. Earlier, the view taken was that migrant workers were just commodities, to be squeezed to extract remittances to ensure macro-economic stability. This has been revised. Under the Mahinda Chinthanaya, migrant workers are human beings who happen to work abroad for their income. As such, this Ministry has developed a slate of programmes which are focused on recognizing migrant workers humanity.

The first was a ban placed, irrespective of the rights of a woman, to mobility of the mothers if they had children less than five years. This ban was imposed by the Cabinet and upheld by the Supreme Court. It was based on the principle that the mother-baby bond, in the critical pre-five year stage, had to be nourished and nurtured, and that a prolonged absence of the mother in this period was inimical to the babys psychological and physical development. As such a Family Background Report has now to be submitted justifying eligibility. I have been thinking that the newly established Rataviruwo Organization too should be consulted, on the FBR.

The second was to create a programme to look after the left behind migrant children. Migrant mothers, in all good faith, appoint respected caregivers to look after her children in her absence. These arrangements sometimes fail. This scheme provides for children to continue in school, overseen by a teacher, given a nutritious meal, provided English and computer classes, till the caregiver arrives at 5.00 p.m., to take the child home. This scheme is worked with the collaboration of the Education, Health and Child and Womens Affairs Ministries. With the extension of the scheme, this activity will be overseen by the Rataviruwo Organization.

The third was the award of scholarships to children of migrant workers, based on their performance at Grade V, 'O' Level and 'A' Level examinations. This was called awards. 3000 children qualified to receive these scholarships and 405 scholarships are already awarded and the rest to be given in the near future.

The fourth was the distribution of school equipment and the provision of financial assistance for children of migrant workers. The number of children who benefited, so far, was 189 for financial assistance, and 287 for school equipment.

The fifth is the Rataviru Darudiri Programme for children of migrant workers to improve their talents of singing, dancing and in the arts. The number of children who had benefited was 1739.

In the initial stages, the concentration was on sending Rataviruwos abroad. There was little concern about their return.

In keeping with the humanizing vision of the Mahinda Chinthanaya, re-entry has been given the highest priority. On a request to the ILO, they convened an international conference, about 3 weeks ago on this subject and I am eagerly awaiting for the report. Pending that, we have taken proactive steps. In association with the Samurdhi Authority we are building houses for Rataviruwos, from their remittances earned while they are abroad. So far, we have completed over 4,000 houses, and a further 6,000 are in various stages of completion. We have started special camps for migrant workers' families and developed an entrepreneurship programme in Kurunegala, Ampara and Badulla. This will be extended to the entire Island. We have attended to the cultural needs of our Rataviruwos. An international talent star programme was launched to great acclaim.

A specter is haunting the UNP, the specter of irrelevance. This debate has shown that the UNP has lost its bearings. Instead of applauding our economic heroes, the Rataviruwos, they took

1501 1502

recourse in petty mudslinging. It will be remembered that it was this same party that moved a no-confidence motion on the Rizana case, when the decision to execute her was taken long before I assumed duties in this Ministry. The UNP is driving forward, looking fixedly in the rear mirror.

The UNP does not realize that upholding labour mobility is the way to go forward. It dissolves generations of fixed, emotional and economic feudal relationships. As a result of labour mobility, a new society is emerging, empowered, modern, and determined to take control of events. H.E. the President Rajapaksa is the inventor of this change. While this historic change is taking place, lubricated by energy giving remittances, the UNP is mouthing empty words, words which Lord Buddha, in the Sigalovadaya Sutta called "". One does not need to condemn the UNP: One can only pity them. This debate shows why.

In concluding this debate, I like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary to the Ministry, Chairmen of the Bureau and the Agency, and all staff working with them. Four years ago, I inherited all this staff, and except for those who left because of retirement, they had all continued with me. I do apologize to them for any moments of short temper, but, as they know, it was quickly forgotten.

I know they are devoted to the vision and mission, culled out in Waddduwa four years ago. They know that they were not working for themselves. They were working for something above themselves and beyond me. They are involved in the noble effort to raise a group of neglected, even a despised part of our society. In this they have succeeded admirably. If I were asked to state in one sentence my achievements, I would only say that I gave dignity to our economic heroes, our Rataviruwos.

Thank you. ( ) (The Chairman) . . 1.00 . , . . 1.00 [ ] .

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The Hon Faiszer Musthapha, please. You have six minutes. [2.45 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Hon. Deputy Chairman, firstly I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Investment Promotion at the Committee Stage Discussions.

As you know, the Ministry of Investment Promotion, under the guidance of the Hon. Minister, we have broadbased our activities. We have looked at large-scale projects which come under the Strategic Development Projects Act and also we have not forgotten the SME sector. We have a twofold approach. We have also not restricted our investments to a certain country or a locality and we have investment promotions in the Middle-East, China, the US and India which have shown dividends.

Although the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is making certain allegations, he has to concede one fact. That is, if you take the total number of investments made in the country from 1977 onwards, the FDIs that we have achieved during the tenure of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa counts to over 65 per cent, consequent to peace being achieved. So, peace has given us dividends.

The BOI has been having a very focused approach under the guidance of my Minister, the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeygunawardena. Also, the Chairman of the BOI has been very progressive in his thinking. We have introduced the one stop shop.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The Hon. Ministers name is Abeywardena, not Abeygunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, I am sorry. I thank you for correcting me whereas we have to correct you on your

statistics and your thinking about the economy. You will continue to be only preaching. I made the name wrong but we are proactive. Whatever name I call, my Minister is a proactive and a capable Minister. But, as regards to your contribution, you are only good at slinging mud at the Government with no rationale. Your economics makes no sense of rationale and sometimes you try to bring legal arguments into it. So, I would like to tell you one thing. You will continue to be in the Opposition slinging mud at this Government and preaching matters. Unfortunately, you will never get a day to be in government. You will be continuously preaching because every time you go before the media, you attack the Government. I would appreciate, if a person like you could make constructive criticism. When it comes to economy, law and order or any issue, the Opposition has the right to criticize but it has to be constructive criticism. You all have a thirst for power but you have no rationale. At every single election, economically, socially, morally and legally, the people have been with us. You continuously try to discredit this Government but the mandate of the people has been continuously with the Government. At the next election also, people have already determined that they want His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa elected. Unfortunately, an Economist like you is not being properly used. You are only being used for the purpose of slandering this Government. But, I am sure, if you can contribute with your knowledge, it will be more productive. So, it is very unfortunate that you have opted to do what you are now doing.

Sir, I will continue with my subject. This Ministry has achieved a lot. We worked very hard. If you look at the amount of interest shown towards increasing the FDIs, we are very confident that we would be able to reach greater heights next year. Due to lack of time, I will not deal with that. My Minister will elaborate more on that aspect.

Then, I would like to come to a more important issue. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake mentioned about the reference made by His Excellency the President. The consultative jurisdiction is vested with His Excellency the President. He made use of that consultative jurisdiction, referred the issue to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court, in response, made a determination that His Excellency the President, in terms of the Constitution has the right to contest for the third time. But, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said that the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva just made a statement in this regard. That is not correct. Unfortunately, Sir, the Opposition forgets to read the constitutional provisions. Sir, the consultative provisions were invoked in terms of the Constitution; The President referred the matter to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court referred it back to His Excellency the President, and the President informed the House through the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva. Therefore, we have followed the correct consultative process.

1543 1544

Unfortunately the Opposition, even when we have followed the proper procedure in the law which deals with the consultative process in the Supreme Court, is seeking to discredit the Government.

Once again, I would like to say that we are on the right track and the economy is on the right track. Sir, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva has participated in many of the Consultative Committee Meetings of the Ministry of Investment Promotion and he has given his input on various issues. While stating so, I say that this Ministry would definitely be able to attain greater FDIs during the coming years.

Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva. Order, please! The Hon. Perumal Rajathurai will now take the Chair.

, .

, , .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. PERUMAL RAJATHURAI took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, you may start your speech now. [2.51 p.m.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, thank you very much for this opportunity. It is always a pleasure to speak after my Friend, the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, President's Counsel. I always give him the respect that is due. He went on a long harangue against me. [Interruption.] But, I shall not do so. I will try to restrict myself to the subject at hand. Since he said that I participated in the Consultative Committees, I would like to take a few minutes at the start to tell you what has happened to the Consultative Committee.

In addition to the direct investment amounting to US dollars 887 million in 2013, the BOI companies also received foreign loans amounting to US dollars 505 million, thereby increasing the FDI received by BOI companies including loans, from US dollars 1,279 million in 2012 to US dollars 1,391 million in 2013.

I further quote:

What type of political structure is most supportive of economic freedom? The answer is limited government designed to protect the rights of minorities and promote political action based on agreement. Elections and majoritarian democracy are not enough. They must be buttressed with constraints on the power of the executive, constitutional protection of individual rights, decentralization of government action, and rule of law.

Sir, I am not going to make a political speech, but I want to read four passages from a very important paper. This is an academic paper. This is written by two of Sri Lankas most distinguished economists. I will read it quickly.

. . ( ) ( . . - , ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala - Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development) What is the name of the author? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Prema-chandra Athukorala, Arndt-Corden Department of Economics, College of Asia and the Pacific Australian National University, Canberra, Australia and Sisira Jayasuriya, Department of Economics, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. If you look at these two economists contribution to the literature on trade and

investment in Sri Lanka and the region, you will find that they have dozens of publications in their name. This particular publication that I am going to table, Sir, is in the Asian Economic Papers 12.2 published by the Earth Institute of Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT. I wish to read the section on prospects and challenges for Sri Lankas economy. They are not politicians. Let me read it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) We are not prepared to have a fully open economy. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay.

Sir, I am talking about an academic paper. Under the title, Prospects and challenges on page 23 of this paper, they have stated, I quote:

After showing remarkable resilience during decades of war and conflict the Sri Lankan economy has failed to capitalize on the window of opportunity presented by the end of the military conflict. Sri Lankas tale of missed opportunities continues. We have provided a brief narrative of the outcome of the governments attempt to follow the military victory with an economic strategy rooted in the nationalist-populist ideology of the 1960s and 1970s. It has, as was predictable and inevitable, ended in failure. Policies based on the past paradigm of inward-oriented, state-centered and -directed economic development do not offer a viable long-term solution to the huge challenges facing Sri Lanka, a small, capital- and resource-poor country. These policies, as we described earlier, failed not only in terms of economic growth but also contributed to the political alienation of minorities leading to violent ethnic conflicts by allowing political patronage to influence access to employment and public infrastructure.

I do not think anybody in this House can disagree with what Athukorala and Jayasuriya are saying. This further states, I quote:

It would be a tragedy if Sri Lanka were to forget the bitter lessons of the past.

Have we not heard that before that it would be a tragedy if we forget the bitter lessons of the past? I quote further:

It has already paid a heavy price for past missed opportunities. It is no longer the pioneering, liberalizing country of the last 1970s. It is now forced to compete for foreign investment and export markets with the giant labor-rich economies of China and India as well as with countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. Further, it faces a global economy that is in deeper trouble than at any time since the 1930s. Sri Lanka can benefit from continuing growth in the Asian region, but only if can articulate and implement a development strategy that enables it to leverage its comparative advantages, attract investments, and participate in international production networks to generate productive mass employment. That requires fundamental reforms to policy and governance structures.

Sir, he is talking about creating productive mass employment. The difference between productive mass

1549 1550

[ () ]

2014 12

employment and the mass employment created by a budget by giving 50,000 jobs here or 50,000 jobs there is very different. The fundamental causes for generating productive mass employment are so different from what the Minister of Finance can extricate from the budget and pay people's salaries. There is a fundamental difference.

I quote:

" But such changes will encounter resistance from powerful political economy forces. Political power, including control over the security forces, has been concentrated to an unprecedented degree in a small group around the President and his immediate family; this is also the case with state finances; where control over the majority of government spending is directly in the hands of the President and his close family group. Macroeconomic pressures can, and, to some extent, already have produced some shifts in economic policy as the political elite manoeuvres to maintain economic stability without letting go of their political power and control over state resources that are the basis for rent extraction and political patronage.

"The basis for rent extraction and political patronage". Right? Please note that these are not local politicians or international politicians. These are academic economists, two of the greatest academic economists that this country has produced.

I further quote:

"But, particularly in the current environment of global economic instability and shocks, sustainable long-term growth requires a political regime whose commitment to fundamental economic and political reforms will be credible and sustained. With the situation in Sri Lanka increasingly exhibiting striking parallels with the Marcos regime in the Philippines and the final phase of the Suharto regime in Indonesia, the likelihood of a fundamental change in economic policy and governance under the present regime appears slim indeed".

Sir, in the last paragraph of page 24, they state, I quote:

"The policy reforms initiated in 1977 and sustained over the next three decades produced far-reaching changes in the structure and performance of the Sri Lankan economy, though the country suffered from political turbulence and civil war for much of the period".

They agree.

"But, the conflicts prevented the economy from capturing the full benefits of reintegrating with the global economy; political instability led to policy instability, massive war financing generated macroeconomic instability, and heightened risk perceptions dampened investor confidence".

. With all these bad incidents that took place in Sri Lanka for the last 30 years, before 2009, they state, I quote:

Nevertheless, trade liberalization enabled the country to capitalize on its comparative advantage in labour-intensive activities. Despite political conflicts and policy uncertainty, this policy configuration ensured handsome profits in labour-intensive export production, which is usually characterized by a short payback period in a labour-abundant economy, and fostered rapid export growth. What the Sri

Lankan experience over the past three decades has clearly demonstrated is that an outward-oriented policy regime,

What does that clearly demonstrate? "An outward-oriented policy regime".

I stress on that, Sir, and I further quote:

... even when severely strained by political and macroeconomic instability, can yield a superior development outcome compared to a closed-economy regime. Viewed from this perspective, recent developments in the policy scene do not augur well for the future of the Sri Lankan economy.

What are these people saying with data? They have volumes of data to back up this claim. Now, I am going to read the conclusion and this is how they end this 25-page long academic paper. I quote:

In highlighting the importance of economic policies, we do not intend to underestimate the need for a political process that addresses the legitimate and deep-seated grievances of the minority Tamil population to ensure a sustainable peace that is essential for economic development. The continued incarceration of thousands, the denial of long-standing demands for regional autonomy and the withdrawal of concessions that had been previously granted, the rejection of any serious attempt to examine allegations of war crimes, and the strident assertion of the Sinhala Buddhist pre-eminence in Sri Lanka have all contributed to a deepening sense among the minority Tamils that they will continue to be treated as second-class citizens despite the rhetoric of reconciliation and equality of treatment. There are already signs of popular dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living, perceived widening of inequalities, and the economic and political privileges of the political elite. As Sri Lankas past history has shown, political stability and social peace will be the first victims of economic stagnation or crisis; they can be averted only if the current direction of both political practice and economic policy are changed sharply, decisively and urgently.

Sir, I read those few paragraphs to articulate the position taken by two of the -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) One is from my electorate. I know him better than you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Very good! .. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) Those are applicable to developed countries, not to countries like Sri Lanka.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, the Hon. Minister says that he knows Professor Athukorala better than me. That is good. So, he respects the man. He will never get up and say, I do not believe this person because he is the Hon. Ministers friend. He

1551 1552

is one of the most celebrated economists of Sri Lanka. Professor Jayasuriya and Athukorala, both are saying one thing. That is, even during difficult times, the economy of Sri Lanka grew at 6, 7 and 8 per cent because we had an open policy of trade that was oriented towards the rest of the world.

Sir, I will give you one last example. When I was having dinner with the acting Chief Executive of Hong Kong, he asked me, Do you know what the export percentage of GDP in Hong Kong is?". I said, No, Sir, I do not". He said, "It is 230 per cent". Sir, I have these two documents, which I have downloaded from the website of the World Bank, both of which, I seek to table*.

Hong Kongs trade percentage of GDP is 230. So, somebody might ask, "How is that possible?" How can export be more than the GDP? That is because Hong Kong Harbour is a trading hub. It is a logistics hub. They import, they export. If you see the Hong Kong Harbour - I am sure all of you have - it is a massive, vast operation. Now, we want to beat Hong Kong; we want to beat Singapore to become the "Wonder of Asia". But, to get there, we have to have the direction right. We cannot have exports to GDP 10 years ago falling from 35 to 15 per cent today. The direction is wrong, Hon. Sir. I will not be critical here, if we went from 30 to 50 per cent. Then, I will say that the direction is right. But, how can we be a hub, Sir, if our car is going in the wrong direction? Therefore, what Professor Athukorala and Jayasuriya are saying together, in unison, must be taken into serious cognizance. You must read this paper. You must understand what they are saying. They are not running for elections. They really do not care whether it is UNP or PA or Chandrika Kumaratunga who is running this country. Who knows? That might be the case in the next two months. - [Interruption.] We do not know. - [Interruption.] Yes, until she abolishes the Executive Presidency in a few months.

While stressing the importance of trying to - [Interruption.] Do not be stuck in the mud. Be free to change your views because at the end of the day what you stand for and what I stand for is the same. That is, to make sure that people of this country: the people of Kotte, the people of Colombo, the people of Matara, the people of Jaffna, the people of Batticaloa will be better off than they are today.

Thank you.
