( ) (The Presiding Member) Please do not shout. Let the Hon. Sampanthan speak. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, you are a senior Member. This is a very solemn occasion.

[2.58 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for the opportunity given to me to say a few words on this Vote of Condolence on the death of the Hon. Festus Perera. I had known him quite well, Sir.

In fact, when I came into Parliament in 1977, the Hon. Festus Perera was also a Member of Parliament and he was the Minister of Fisheries in the J.R. Jayewardene Government. He, I believe, continued in that position under President Premadasa later on. He was a very genial person, a very moderate person who held very moderate views and was a good influence in Parliament, both on his Colleagues in the Government and also with Members of Parliament in the Opposition. He was able to work in a spirit of co-operation with all Members of Parliament, including Members from the Government and also Members from the Opposition.

We, the Members of Parliament from the North and the East were able to work with him because we looked upon him as an honourable person who would endeavour to discharge his duties in a fair and equitable way. It is unfortunate that we have lost him. In fact, he could have been a very useful Member of the House at this point of time, when this country is facing many difficulties. He was replaced in Parliament by his wife who, also, we knew very well. She, again, was a very genial person. I believe Sir, the Hon. Festus Pereras position is now held by his son, the Hon. Niroshan Perera.

We express our sympathies over the passing away of the Hon. Festus Perera and we would like to convey our deepest condolences to all members of his family and I would be grateful, Mr. Presiding Member, if the expression of the sentiments of this House is conveyed to the family.

Thank you.

... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Sir, it is with deep sorrow that I rise to speak a few words about the late Hon. Festus Perera who was a former Minister of Fisheries. In addition to Fisheries, he held the posts of Minister of Pubic Administration and Home Affairs, Minister of Information as well as Minister of Power and Energy. His election as the Chairman of Wennappuwa Town Council made him enter politics and he then became a Parliamentarian which lasted over 30 years.

1195 1196

2014 21

The country has lost an outstanding Parliamentarian and I personally feel the loss of a good Friend. I knew him for a long time. He was a good listener and his doors were open day and night for the public to meet him. His extraordinary quality of not holding any personal grudges against anyone had helped him to earn many friends. He had another rare quality in that he always stood up for what he believed to be right come what may its consequences. Though he had to face several challenges in his political career, he never felt bitter about them. Like all politicians, he endured praise and insult. He was bold enough to accept them, be it victory or defeat, with humility and simplicity. It is said that taller and taller the bamboo grows, the lower and lower it bends. The Hon. Festus Perera had a tall-grown personality with tall-grown human qualities. He would bend down in humility to share human kindness with any person even in the lower strata of life.

The Hon. Festus Perera was a lawyer by profession and was customized to listen to the grievances of the people. As a people's man, he was interested primarily about the welfare of the people. He was a democrat who was dedicated to a democratic way of life. He dedicated his entire lifetime towards the country, stood above ethnic, racial and language barriers and truly represented the aspirations of the people. He won the admiration of all communities, the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims, and was loved by all of them. The best tribute I can pay him is to say: There gone Mr. Honest whose hands were clean and unstained". His demise is a great loss to the nation, and his life is an example to up-and-coming politicians.

Sir, before I could join the other Members of this House in conveying my heartfelt condolence to the members of his grieving family, I fully condemn the way my Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga behaved, because while speaking on the Vote of Condolence, he spoke of kudu and various other activities and presented a Vote of No- Confidence.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You are a responsible Minister. You are part of the kudu Cabinet.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) You cannot do that. It is all wrong. You have come here to speak on the Vote of Condolence, not to criticize or move a Vote of No-Confidence on the Government. It is very unfair.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is the difference between the two Governments.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) I have never taken up matters like this. I feel sorry the way you presented the No-Confidence Motion. You should have spoken only about the late Hon. Festus Perera and the good things he has done and not criticized the Government and presented a No-Confidence Motion. I totally condemn the way you presented it.

Sir, in conclusion, I join the other Hon. Members of this House in conveying my heartfelt condolences to the members of his grieving family.

Thank you. [.. 3.23] . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) , , . . , .

[5.08 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it gives me great satisfaction to say a few words on this occasion in which we remember the life of the Hon. Festus Perera.

1223 1224

[ . ]

2014 21

George S. Patton once said, It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died; rather we should thank God that such men lived.

When the Hon. Festus Perera first became a Minister, I was still in school and I remember him as a colossus, as a school boy. I knew him only from a distance. But, as we know now from history, from 1977 to 2001, he distinguished himself first as a Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, then as a Minister of Fisheries, a Minister of Power and Energy, a Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and subsequently, as a District Minister.

I will not actually speak of his achievements as a politician and a Minister as my Colleagues in this House have already done so this afternoon. But, I would like to just remind the House that yesterday the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the present Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, said that the Hon. Festus Perera was the most successful Minister of Fisheries that this country has ever had.

I will mention a few anecdotes from his life which will be more reflecting on the personality of the Hon. Festus Perera. We heard today how 3,600 families in the Cey-Nor Janapadaya who never owned an inch of land became the recipients of 10 perches of land, making it the largest single settlement in this country. It is very difficult to express the feelings that those people will have when they do not own something and suddenly become the owners. The Hon. Festus Perera knew and empathized with people who did not have.

A former Leader of the Opposition of the Wennappuwa Pradeshiya Sabhawa once said that he never stayed a night in Colombo. He always went to Wennappuwa. I think, Niroshan, this is going to be a very difficult act for you to follow. Why did he do so? Because he loved his people. This same gentleman said that even if he returned at midnight, if there were people waiting to meet him, he never said, Come tomorrow morning. He sat down and listened to what they had to say. Officials have said that even when he was having lunch, if there was an urgent letter that had to be signed and they took it to him, he never said, Come after lunch. He just stopped his lunch and signed that letter. That was the stature of a great personality.

Someone else said to me that he had a unique way of treating his opponents. There had been somebody who was going around criticizing him. This happens in politics and it happens all the time. When it came to the years of the Hon. Festus Perera, he listened but he did not say anything. One day when he was driving his car, he went past a bus halt and noticed that the gentleman who had been criticizing him was standing there. He reversed his vehicle, picked the gentleman up, brought him back to his shop and dropped him in the presence of others. The

crowd there was amazed. This is the stature of a great personality in how he treats his opponents.

I know that the greatest testimony to any parent, whether it is the Hon. Festus Perera or the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera, is always going to be the children. Nishani gave up a career in consultancy in Washington DC and came back to Sri Lanka to take care of her aging father and also to take care of her mother. That is the measure of great children. Niroshan gave up a promising career in engineering in the United States of America and came back to Sri Lanka to walk in the footsteps of his parents. We salute both of them as being worthy children of worthy parents.

I would like to close with these words from the Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi . It states, I quote:

O Divine Master, Grant that I may not so much seek To be consoled as to console; To be understood as to understand; To be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; It is in pardoning that we are pardoned; And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

May his soul rest in peace! May Mrs. Larine Perera, Nishani, Niroshan and particularly the people of the Puttalam District not only be consoled, but continue to celebrate the life of a great personality, Festus Perera.

Thank you.

[5.26 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I rise today in this House to express my deepest sorrow on the passing

away of a very illustrious figure, who adorned the benches of this Parliament for 28 years 10 months and 24 days as an honourable Member in this House. Sir, he was a man of courage; a man of wit and vision; a leader of the fisherfolk and a leader of the common people. At the same time, he was a man of humble qualities, a man of sterling qualities and character; he was a lover of music and a chivalrous sportsman.

The late Hon. Festus Perera conceptualized in his mind the creation of a stadium for the Puttalam District. Finally, it resulted in the creation of Sir Albert F. Peiris Stadium or Kreedanganaya.

After the Hon. M.H.M. Naina Marikar, as there was no Muslim representation in Puttalam, I was appointed in charge of the Puttalam Electorate. At that time I was very close to him. He was a tower of strength to me; he guided me all along and helped me greatly in serving those people in Puttalam. For 15 long years, I was able to spend all my Decentralized Budget for the well-being and development of the people in Puttalam.

, . , "" . , . " " . :

Today, I recall the great service he did to the Muslim community. In 1965, when the Government came into power, the Muslim people found it difficult to go for Haj as there was no foreign exchange available. At that time, along with the Hon. Alhaj M.H. Mohamed, Minister of Labour, Employment and Housing, the Hon. Alhaj M. Falil A. Caffoor and others, we went on deputation to the Hon. Festus Perera, Deputy Minister of Finance, who was at the Treasury office. Alhaj M.I.M. Naleem, the great philanthropist also came with us together with other Muslim leaders. We explained to him that it is a fundamental right of the Muslims in this country to go for Haj. Even during the time of the First World War and the Second World War, people travelled by ships sailing through the dangerous sea to Jeddah Port and performed Haj. So, he readily agreed and for the first time after it was stopped, he convinced Prime Minister, Hon. Dudley Senanayake and allowed on the first occasion, 50 pilgrims to go on pilgrimage to Mecca.

1229 1230

Sir, I never passed the residence of Preethika at Wennappuwa without dropping in. "" , . , he was a lover of people; he was a leader of the fisherfolk and a leader of the common people; he was a practical man. , , . I must also recall that during the time of Ramazan, we fast and when it is time for breaking fast, we stopped at Preethika and the Hon. (Mrs.) Mary Larine Perera makes all the foodstuff for us to break fast. Being a lover of music, he loved the recital of the Holy Quran. I used to take Katheeb M. Jezuli Salahudeen to his house Preethika and the Hon. Festus Perera used to tell me, Please recite a chapter or a verse from the Holy Quran.

There was another great admirer of him, Alhaj M.P.M. Azhar, the former and the founder editor of Navamani, who used to visit with me, his Wennappuwa residence regularly. When I stepped into Puttalam, at the earlier stages there was a team behind him.

We formed a team. People of the calibre of the Hon. Asoka Wadigamangawa, who was Minister of Lands and Land Alienation at that time, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sujatha Dharmawardana, MP, Mr. M.I.B Hafi and various others were in that team. I also remember the first Provincial Council Election at which the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera was elected together with Navis Fernando, Gwen Herath, M.I.B. Hafi and with them, M.H.M. Navavi came from the SLFP.

Sir, the Hon. Festus Perera was almost an emperor of the Puttlam District. I recall the old days in Roman history when, in the cavalry fashion, the emperor came on horseback or on chariot. When Festus came like that, we used to affectionately call him "Ben-Hur" and say, Here comes our Ben-Hur. , . , " , ." . . . 1930 29 . 83 .

Also, the Hon. Festus Perera was very helpful to the fishermen. He was a fighter for their cause. Yesterday, we expressed concern in this House about the sufferings of our own fishermen in the North of this country. Had the Hon. Festus Perera lived, he would have been in the forefront, fighting for their rights. That, he did; I saw it for myself. ,

The late Hon. Festus Perera worked for the development of the fisheries industry in Baththalangunduwa, Gange Wadiya, Kalpitiya and also in other areas like Iralkuli and Serakkuli. Therefore, Sir, he is a man of all seasons. He loved people and the people loved him. That is one of the greatest qualities and characteristics of a great leader, I should say.

He befriended our former Speaker, Hon. M.A. Bakeer Markar. Consequently, he used to visit Beruwala very often and all the Hajiars in China Fort knew him. No function would be held without his presence. Although politicians from Colombo and Galle often visited Beruwala, they would not forget one person and that is, the Hon. Festus Perera of Wennappuwa. Sir, when someone visits the Hadjiars, you know how lavishly they serve buriyani, faluda and watalappan. But, the Hon. Festus Perera had a very characteristic quality in him: he used to bring his food in a small basket, which is called a tiffin carrier, when he visited them. They all knew about it. He was a complete teetotaller.

The Puttalam District had produced some of the greatest and illustrious figures of this country like Sir Albert F. Peries, the Hon. Shirley Corea and the Hon. Hugh Fernando, who became Speakers of this House. The Hon. Festus Perera followed the footsteps of those illustrious figures.

As I said, the Hon. Festus Perera was a man of very amiable qualities. I think he lost at the first election he contested in 1960 and also the subsequent one. Then, he won at every election, increasing his vote strength every time. At the 1977 General Election, he won his seat. At that time, we had the district electoral system and Michael Festus Wenceslaus Perera polled 76,390 votes. Very far behind him were the Hon. Asoka Wadigamangawa, polling 56,696 votes, the late Hon. Harindra Jayanthi Corea, 32,899 votes and James Edward Harold Herat, 27,763 votes. So, the Hon. Festus Perera was a revolutionary; he revolutionized the thinking of the people. I have no time today to illustrate in this House the amount of work he did when he was the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs. He gave the best Pradeshiya Lekam Karyalaya award to Wanathawilluwa at that time. As I told you, whether it be a funeral or any other function, he would not fail to attend. He was a light-hearted man; he was a man of peace and harmony. I have travelled with him to the North: Mannar and to Jaffna.

Sir, he was a very good cyclist. When we cycled on the beach, we could not keep pace with him. . . In Jaffna, he had a good friend, Mr. S.A.C. Mubeen. He enjoyed Mr. Mubeen's hospitality always. , . - advocate -. . He served as Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, Minister of Power and Energy, Minister of Information, Minister of Fisheries and Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs.

We affectionately call the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera "The Mother of Wennappuwa" and we still remember her

in that status. We remember the hospitality she showered on us and all the help and assistance the Hon. Festus Perera gave us. I am sure his worthy and amiable son, the Hon. Niroshan Perera, will carry forward his mission through this House.
