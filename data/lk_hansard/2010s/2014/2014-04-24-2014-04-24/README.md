QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

INTIMIDATION AND ASSAULT ON OPPOSITION MEMBERS DURING INSPECTION TOUR TO MATTALA RAJAPAKSA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND MAGAMPURA MAHINDA RAJAPAKSA PORT

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, let me thank you for providing me this opportunity to make this statement. This statement, Sir, refers to an ugly incident that took place for the first time in the Parliamentary history of Sri Lanka.

On the 17th of April, 2014, five Members of Parliament, namely the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, the Hon. Ajith Mannapperuma, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, the Hon. R. Yogarajan and the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha had made an official visit to the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port after having informed all relevant authorities of their intended visit.

While at these places, a pistol wielding Mayor of Hambantota, Eraj Fernando, led a mob of well over 100 persons who intimidated and threatened these Members of Parliament abusing them in an extremely foul language, too foul to be repeated here, for criticizing these Projects

in Parliament. They also assaulted these Members with stones, sticks and other dangerous objects, which also caused damage to the vehicle they were travelling in.

It is a matter of note that some of these gangs were present inside the premises of the Harbour, which is a high security zone and, in no way, can be described as enraged members of the public, as some have sought to make out. It was also a disturbing feature to see senior police officers idly standing by during the rampage in spite of repeated requests made by the Members of Parliament to bring the situation under control.

As Members of Parliament, they have a right and an obligation to visit and inspect these Projects since they come under the purview of and are financed by the funds provided by Parliament in terms of Chapter XVII of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. More importantly, the action by the persons led by the Mayor of Hambantota, Eraj Fernando, constitutes a serious breach of privilege of both Parliament and these Members, specifically set out in No. 1 of Part A of the Schedule of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. These incidents are in the teeth of the Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles which specifically provide that, I quote: Parliamentarians must be able to carry out their legislative and constitutional functions in accordance with the Constitution, free from unlawful interference.

The Government proudly boasts that the people are now free to travel anywhere in this country. It appears that the peoples Representatives are not even free to visit publicly-funded project sites - leave alone anywhere in the country. It is astounding that the highest officials of the ruling regime have opted to justify this callous attack against democratically elected Members of Parliament rather than to take appropriate action to address the serious breach of law and order. The very fact that the Police stood idly while this attack was taking place amply demonstrates the level of patronage received for this action.

It is a sad reflection of the times when we see a breakdown in law and order during the currency of the Presidents Chairmanship of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting - CHOGM - and you preside in this august Assembly as the Hon. Speaker. You were also the Chairman of the CPU and this took place in the very district that the President and you, Mr. Speaker, represent.

These incidents emphasize the need for the Government to conduct an independent and credible investigation into the breakdown in the law and order and to hold accountable those responsible.

We are reluctantly compelled to take this matter to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the United Nations Human Rights Council. The question is,

1325 1326

2014 24

will the Government appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee to inquire and report on these incidents?

Sir, may I remind you that there was the "Attanagalla Doctrine" then. I think you were also in Parliament at that time. Now, we have the "Medamulana Doctrine". Sir, the question is, where are we heading?

Thank you.

Hon. Speaker, I would like to table* the photographs that were taken during this incident.

. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . III ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Speaker, I would like to first express my appreciation of the sentiments that have already been expressed by the Chair in relation to the events that took place on the 17th of April, 2014 in Hambantota.

Sir, as you are aware, I, as an MP, have contributed to many debates relating to public finance, which I firmly believe is an essential aspect of the sovereignty of the

1335 1336

people. I have raised concerns as to the viability of the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port and have explored means to convert them into viable investments. During debates on these investments, we have been invited by Government MPs to visit and see for ourselves that these investments, are in fact, according to the Government, viable.

Therefore, I together with four other MPs, namely, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, the Hon. R. Yogarajan, the Hon. Ajith Mannapperuma, and the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha chartered a bus and with prior intimation to the Minister of Civil Aviation and the Chairman of the Ports Authority decided to visit the MRIA and Hambantota Port on the 17th, April 2014.

After our visit to the MRIA, several individuals began verbally abusing us and acted in a threatening manner alleging that we have criticized the MRIA and Hambantota Port in Parliament. Criminal force was used on the Hon. Ajith P. Perera by a citizen who can be clearly identified by video recordings now circulating on the internet.

Thereafter, we proceeded to the Hambantota Port after informing several high ranking officers of the Sri Lanka Police including McCarthy Perera, DIG - Tangalle.

After we inspected the Port, a large group which included the UPFA Mayor of Hambantota acted in a violent manner throwing eggs and stones at us and the vehicle we travelled in. The vehicle was damaged. Their accusation against us was that we had visited the Port to thereafter criticize its functioning. The group sought to provoke us into a fight. Needless to say we did not engage. The media persons present were subject to similar abuse and intimidation. I want to pay a tribute to the media. That is the reason why I can read this statement.

An individual brandishing a gun, identified as the Mayor of Hambantota, was running towards our vehicle followed by others causing panic among those in the bus. While we took cover from a possible shooting, the driver and the MSD officers bravely steered the bus away from the Port.

The ASP, HQI - Hambantota and the other police officers present did nothing to prevent the criminal attacks against us. Meanwhile, the Police Media Spokesman initially made a statement suggesting that the incidents had not warranted police intervention.

When it was clear that the vehicle of the HQI - Hambantota was about to overtake us, we sought to flag it down, since we suspected we were being followed. But, the Police vehicle sped off, being unwilling to assist us. Statements were obtained from the MPs but no action has

been taken against the gun wielding thug inside the high security zone in the Port.

The Constitution requires Parliament to exercise full control over public finance. This can only happen if MPs are able to engage in meaningful and informed debate. As Members of Parliament, we have a right and an obligation to visit and inspect these projects since they are financed by funds provided by Parliament and come under the purview of it in terms of Chapter XVII of the Constitution of the Republic .

The attack on us was clearly, among the other things, towards compelling us to vote in favour of the UPFA positions on the MRIA and Hambantota Port and/or to prevent us from exposing serious issues relating to same. This is clear by the attacks that were led by the UPFA Mayor, aided and abetted by the inaction of the Government-controlled police.

Quite apart from the violations of the criminal law, these incidents constitute a serious breach of privileges of both Parliament and these Members, and myself specifically set out in Nos. 1 and 2 of Part A of the Schedule to the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.

I request that appropriate action be taken against the UPFA Mayor of Hambantota, the other individuals who were part of the unlawful assembly acting in furtherance of the said breaches of parliamentary privileges, and the police officers who aided and abetted by their inaction including the police media spokesman, who also demonstrably aided and abetted the breaches by his subsequent interest in attempting to cover up the police inaction and by trifling the criminal acts which took place.

Thank you.

investor. It is for Parliament to debate and determine whether these concessions are granted or not. A gazette cannot be amended. Therefore, what is being debated would decide in terms of the Gazette Notification whether these concessions should be given or refused. Therefore, I respectfully state that a gazette cannot be amended.

The acting Leader of the Opposition or whoever who is trying to act as the Leader must be taught the Standing Orders. If he cannot understand the Standing Orders, let him come to me. . Erskine May .

There is a clear distinction whether it is with regard to a speech or with regard to another matter. But, here my Learned Friend, the Hon. Member Ajith Perera, has not read the Gazette. What is being sought by the Gazette? What is being sought by the Gazette is whether Parliament should grant the concessions which have been sought or not. So, that cannot be amended. You either give the concessions or you do not. - [Interruption.]

Sir, Standing Order No. 38(2) very explicitly states:

Every amendment proposed to a Bill

. shall be examined by the Attorney-General in terms of Article 77 of the Constitution.

There is no Bill before the House. Therefore, you cannot move an amendment. ?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, I would like to mention to this House that piecemeal concessions can be granted. The Hon. Minister of Investment Promotion, by this Gazette, is seeking the concessions which the investor has sought. The supremacy of Parliament is guaranteed because Parliament can reject it. Therefore, the question that you can amend it, does not arise.

To the question asked by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, I would like to state that this Gazette Notification does not deal with casinos. Therefore, the allegation that I, as a Muslim, am promoting casinos, does not arise. I would ask the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera to withdraw that statement. - [Interruption.]

[5.40 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Chairperson, I am glad to speak after the Deputy Minister who said that when the Coal Power Plant in Norachcholai was proposed, there were so many demonstrations against it and still they went ahead and built it. If those protests had stopped, the Coal Power Plant in Norachcholai, maybe financially, we would have been better off today because this Coal Power Plant has broken down 27 times and it is not producing even 60 per cent of the power. This Power Plant has become such a failure that even when you close all the valves, it is working at 30 megawatts because the valves are so defective that they cannot be closed. This is the status of the Norachcholai Power Plant. If you had listened to those who protested and did not implement the Norachcholai Power Plant, we would have been better off today. So, take a cue from that. There are so many protests against these casino projects also. Please stop this, because tomorrow you will regret that you started this and messed it up and you will have -

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne - Minister of Sugar Industry Development) What about the Upper-Kotmale Project? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We did protest. There were reasons. The environmentalists protested against Norachcholai Coal Power Plant. Similarly, we wanted to protect Nuwara Eliya and we did protest against it. But, then, we allowed

1429 1430

2014 24

part of it to be implemented with only one waterfall being barred and nothing more. So, it is not a failure. Today you are able to reach peak performance only because the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya started the Upper-Kotmale Hydropower Project and nothing else.

I am very glad that there are two honest Ministers on your side in this House. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and the Hon. Dilan Perera admitted in this House today that under this Gazette, you have not abolished the operation of casinos in these three projects, but you have only withdrawn the tax concession given to casinos. So, you are still going to implement casinos in these three projects. Do not deny it. To that extent, the UNP has been successful. When you brought the first Gazette Notification in September, we objected; we objected to casinos. But, you have withdrawn only the tax concession given to casinos. The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development is here. He can confirm whether they have banned casinos in these projects by withdrawing or changing the wording in the Gazette or whether they have only withdrawn the tax concessions given to casinos. If you say that the casinos will come with these projects, then, I am sure, tomorrow all religious leaders in this country will get on to the streets to demonstrate against it. In September, as you just said Hon. Minister, it is not because of the UNP, but because all religious leaders opposed casinos you withdrew the original Gazette and reissued it removing the word, Gaming. But, you still intend allowing these three companies to operate casinos in these projects.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena) That is wrong. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Hon. Minister of Investment Promotion can make a categorical statement. - [Interruption.] If you are making a categorical statement that you will not have casinos in these three projects, why are you shy to accept our amendment or bring in it as your own amendment? - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, you and Hon. Faiszer Musthapha

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] are a shame. Do you know that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress - [Interruption.] Madam, please give me time to speak.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Madam, I rise to a point of Order.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The General-Secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the Hon. M.T. Hasen Ali - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Madam, I wish to state that the Hon. Yogarajan has no right to say that I am a shame. As a Member of Parliament, I have the right to speak what I want, and I am not promoting casinos. - [Interruption.] I speak what I want. You have no right to tell me that I am a disgrace to the community.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I am not making any statement in support of casinos. You do not understand the Strategic Development Projects Act. You are speaking without knowing the Act. The Hon. Yogarajan does not know the Act. You are here to play to the gallery. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Madam. This afternoon I met the Hon. M.T. Hasen Ali, the General-Secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. I asked him whether they are going to vote for this casino Bill. He said, No, we have informed the Government that we are going to walk out and we are going to abstain from voting for this Bill". That is because they, as Muslims, think that they should not support a Bill or a Gazette Notification that is going to bring casinos to this country. But, we have the Hon. Azwer and the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion - [Interruption.]

1431 1432

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Yogarajan, you should feel shameful. You have no right to make a comment about my conduct. You are a racist. You have no right to talk about a race or a religion. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You have no right to refer to my race or religion. You are a shame. Hon. Yogarajan, you should feel shameful. [Interruption.] Hon. Yogarajan, you sit down. You have no right to refer to people by race. That is the whole problem.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You resign from the post of Deputy Minister. If you are a proper Muslim, resign from the post. You are going to bring casinos to this country. You should be ashamed. The Muslim Congress is going to abstain from voting. Why are you not going to abstain? Why are you supporting? Are you the Deputy Minister for casinos? Do not become the Deputy Minister for casinos. Please resign. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Yogarajan has chosen to insult my religion. He is the person who betrayed the CWC. People voted for him. He betrayed the Tamil community. He is a shame on the Tamil community. He is a shame on his religion. . CWC .

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) After the Hon. Dilan Perera and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa admitted in this House that these three projects can have casinos but will not have tax concessions, still the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha as the Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion, is willing to support this Bill that is bringing in casinos. It is a shame! I am sure the next time he will be rejected from Colombo. - [Interruption.] So, it is useless talking so much about this casino Bill anymore.

Now, I would like to deal with the issue that we faced last Thursday, just one week ago. We, Members of Parliament proceeded to Hambantota to visit the Mattala Airport and the Magampura Seaport. We found that these two were further failed projects like Norachcholai and the casino projects that you are going to bring in. It is a shame; you have wasted public money on projects that will never take off. But, we are still looking at the money that has been spent, the peoples money, money borrowed in the name of -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order, Hon. Azwer?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) 2006 .

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is not a point of Order. . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I have not finished yet. Do not try to cheat people. You have admitted in this House today that casinos will come in these three projects. So, I am sure, all religious leaders will oppose this.

Thank you.

[6.11 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am privileged to speak after the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera. Firstly, I would

like to state that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the Hon. Vijitha Herath said that it is shameful for me, as a Muslim, to support this Order in the Gazette. I would like to say that I always acted as a Sri Lankan. - [Interruption.] Also, if you say that casino is bad for a Muslim, it is as bad for a Sinhalese or a Tamil. Sir, I would like to state with responsibility that this Order does not deal with casinos.

Sir, the United National Party is suffering from insomnia. I would like to draw your attention to the Betting and Gaming Levy Act, No. 40 of 1988. The Preamble of that Act states, I quote: AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMPOSITION OF AN ANNUAL LEVY ON PERSONS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS OF BOOKMAKER OR GAMING; AND FOR MATTERS CONNECTED THEREWITH OR INCIDENTAL THERETO."

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , () . [ ]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, you may speak. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, the United National Party introduced the vice of casinos to Sri Lanka. In 1988, they brought in the Betting and Gaming Levy Act. On one side, they said it was illegal; on the other, they started collecting revenue by way of a levy. But, in 2013, the UPFA Government, under His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, increased that levy to Rs. 100 million to reduce the ill effects of this vice.

This Gazette Notification has nothing to do with casinos. The United National Party and the JVP are trying to use this as a political platform. This Government has brought this Order under the Strategic Development Projects Act. I am compelled to educate the United National Party on the Strategic Development Projects

1443 1444

Act. The Strategic Development Projects Act deals with a project which is valuable to the national economy, and the Minister of Investment Promotion, under the Act, has no power to deal with casinos. He has to decide on the merits of the project. This project has been identified under the Strategic Development Projects Act as a mixed development. So, I wish to state with responsibility that mud is thrown at the Government by the United National Party and the JVP; they are trying to take political advantage by stating that this project refers to casinos.

I concede that the earlier Gazette Notification with regard to the Waterfront Development Project and the other projects referred to concessions given under the Betting and Gaming Levy Act. However, after consideration of the public interest, this Government took the decision not to give any concessions under the Betting and Gaming Levy Act. Therefore, it has to be very clearly stated in this House that this mudslinging, this allegation that the Government is promoting casinos through this project, which brings in US Dollars 1.1 billion, is false.

You all are aware that there are casinos operating in this country. - [Interruption.] May I be permitted to say this. Casinos were brought in by the United National Party under the Betting and Gaming Levy Act, No. 40 of 1988. On the one hand, the United National Party said it is illegal and on the other, they started collecting revenue by way of a levy. However, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought in the Casino Business (Regulation) Act to regulate this industry and to bring it under a certain regulatory framework for the betterment of this country. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, if you, as a Buddhist, say that Buddhism permits casinos, you should feel shameful.

The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Hon. Vijitha Herath and the Hon. R. Yogarajan tried to give this a racist outlook and bring it up on communal lines, referring to my actions as a Muslim. I would like to express my sentiments as a Muslim. - [Interruption.] I have never been to a casino; I will never go to a casino and I am against casinos. But, as the Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion, I have to look at the economy and at mixed development. This mixed development is for the betterment of this country. Therefore, one has to look -

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, one has to look at the Strategic Development Projects Act and take into consideration its ambit. There is no reference to casinos in this Gazette Notification. So, one cannot point a finger at this -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, can you please conclude?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Yes, Sir, I will conclude by saying that the Opposition is using this -
