Hon. Deputy Chairman, I would like to bring to your kind notice Section 3 (3)(b) of the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of 1972 . It states, I quote:

(b) any garden surrounding staff quarters or labour lines on such land, not in excess of one-eighth of an acre in extent for every family resident in such quarters or lines;

That means, land is to be alienated not in excess of one-eighth of an acre for every family resident in such lines.

According to these provisions in the Land Reform Law which was enacted on the 26th of August, 1972, it was presumed that one-eighth of an acre was registered for every worker family resident.

. 20 perches , . .

Therefore, Sir, it is clear that the worker families in plantation areas have not been granted land which is legally due to them. , 20 perches

. The Government authorities and the civil societies are highly sympathetic towards the present situation of the plantation community. So, why do you not at least consider this land issue very seriously now and give what is due to them legally, as spelt out in the Land Reform Law of 1972? Then, the question of getting permission from the plantation companies when allocating lands to plantation workers does not arise.

, . . , . , . 20 . , , , .

Sir, I would like to quote from the Budget Speech of 22nd November, 2010, which highlights the fact that there are 650,000 cases pending before our courts. The President has stated that Rs. 400 million will be committed for the administration of justice with the initial provision of Rs. 150 million in 2011.The Ministry of Justice will set up 60 new courts as part of this programme, and temporary courts with retired judges will be set up for a period of two years to reduce, and if possible, to eradicate the backlog of cases.

In the Budget Speech of 2010, his Excellency the President stated, I quote:

Hon. Speaker, people are not born poor. Poverty is man-made. A prolonged delay in legal disputes is one such cause for poverty. There are approximately 650,000 unsettled legal cases before our judiciary pending justice. As a result, people spend valuable time and money. They cannot put lands with disputes for productive use. Therefore, I propose to implement a 3-year accelerated project to facilitate the effective administration of justice from 2011. Rupees four hundred million will be committed for this project with an initial provision of Rs. 150 million in 2011.

Sir, I would like to bring an important matter to the notice of the Hon. Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms. According to the statistics given by the Prison Headquarters, the total number of LTTE members in jail as at 19th November, 2014 is around 200. But, that cannot be accepted. There are more than 400 of them; the figure is between 400 and 500. Then, with regard to the total number of LTTE members who had been released, the answer given was that the Prison Headquarters do not keep statistics of them. It is very strange that a Government department does not keep a record of prisoners who were released. Then again, with regard to the total number of LTTE members who had been rehabilitated, they say that those particulars are with the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation. The best part of this is the reply given with regard to the total number of LTTE members who had been granted special pardon. The answer is, "No"; nobody. Then, I cannot understand how Karuna could be here. Who pardoned him? It is very strange, very peculiar. What type of administration is Sri Lanka having? I think this has to be answered mainly by the President, and partly, the duty lies with the Minister of Justice also. So, the answer says, No. Therefore, I want an answer for the question, if they have not been pardoned, how can a convict be inside this House? You have to answer that.

Also, I have information on direct admissions of unconvicted prisoners by institutions from 2007 to 2011. All the names of prisons are given in this Table, but under the Boossa Remand Prison, for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, no figures are given. So, according to this, there are no prisoners in the Boossa Remand Prison. In the same manner, even with regard to direct admissions of convicted prisoners by institutions from 2007 to 2011, under the Boossa Remand Prison, nothing is stated. Why are you hiding this information? I can prove that you are hiding it. The "Sunday Observer.lk" on 9th October, 2011, under the heading "Rehabilitation, resettlement of ex-LTTEers, a success" published excerpts of the interview it had with the

3155 3156

[ . ]

2014 21

Commissioner General of Rehabilitation, Major General Chandana Rajaguru. At that interview, he says, In Boossa, there are about 1,000 people under detention and they come to these centres from time to time. So, in the year 2011, it is clear that you had prisoners in Boossa. But, the records of the Department of Prisons state that there was nobody. At that interview in 2011, the then Commissioner General of Rehabilitation revealed that 1,000 people were there.

Now, Sir, I will quote from an article titled Turning Former LTTE Personnel into Sri Lankan Citizens? by Michael Roberts. In that, he states,

A foreign INGO official who had some interaction with the military once indicated to me in mid-2010 that the Army considered about 15-20 per cent of this mass to be hardline LTTE. The implication was that they could be incorrigible and in need of strict supervision if not prosecution in some instances. The answers provided by Rajaguru enable one to conjecture that many of these hardliners and staunch followers would have been incarcerated at Boossa in the south rather than elsewhere.

Therefore, it clearly proves that the people who got into the bus with white flags, and the missing people are all at Boossa. So, the Government must release the names of the people who are at the Boossa Prison. They have their families; they all are anxiously awaiting the release of their loved ones. They are not widows.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up your speech now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, give me just a few seconds. I am very sad today because I think my good Friend, the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, is either sick or unhappy, because he is not disturbing us. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. You have 10 minutes. [5.11 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, I cannot understand the mentality of a proprietor of a press, who is saying that I am not well. - [Interruption.] I am very well.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Saravanapavan, what is your point of Order? . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, he cannot refer to me in Parliament, as a proprietor. He should say "Member of Parliament". - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) He did not refer to you. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, you carry on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he has a sick mind. That is why he is calling the others sick.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Get on to the subject, please. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, Sir, I must give him something back. I must bring to your kind notice, Sir, that if he speaks in Parliament today, tomorrow the "Sudar Oli" or the "Uthayan" publishes only his speech. That contravenes the provisions of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act and the Standing Orders. Passes are given to the press to report the proceedings of the House in a balanced and accurate way. He monopolizes the newspapers and indicates to the public or the readers at large that he is the only person who has spoken in Parliament. How ridiculous!

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What is the point of Order? Sir, he is disturbing me. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. Hon. Saravanapavan, what is your point of Order?

3157 3158

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, those newspapers carry speeches of every Member. Maybe, not his. - [Interruption.] He cannot give false information here.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order, Hon. Saravanapavan. Hon. Azwer, you carry on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I have already taken this up as a matter of Privilege. Because of the regard I have for my Friend, I haven not persisted on that matter of Privilege. But, hereafter, I will do so and get justice done to all the othernMembers of Parliament. Even the Leader of the Opposition, the other day blamed his maamas or his own newspaper, perhaps, the Daily Mirror, that the backbenchers' speeches were not properly reported in the newspaper. In a way, I agree with him.

Sir, today, what is happening? History is replete with stories of betrayals. From time to time, there had been betrayers born into this world. They had not only betrayed kings, rulers, prime ministers and presidents, but even religious leaders. Sir, as you know, Jesus Christ was betrayed by Judas for a mere 30 gold coins or Ducats, as they call. Then, Lord Buddha was betrayed by Devadatta. , , , . , .

Also, to our Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, there was another kind of Judas. He was called Abu Jahl. At that time, Sir, in the Meccan society, there were monied people; there were merchants and traders. They did not want the rise of Prophet Muhammad. They did not want peace; the message of Islam being spread. So, they conspired, and conspired. What has happened to Abu Jahl? Even today, Sir, this is happening. It is not a new phenomenon. Until yesterday the General-Secretary of the SLFP was here in Parliament. He never said anything about dooshanaya, bheeshanaya, or pavul wadaya of this Government. Today, he gets on to the platform of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and others and calls this Government "corrupt".

, "?" . . [5.42 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I must at the very outset thank the Members from both sides of the House who participated in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of my Ministry. The matter of administration of justice, certain components of which comes under the direct purview of my Ministry, had been subjected to some criticism today by certain Members in the House. Though the seriousness of the subject of Discussion has been diverted by events that were happening outside the House and some digressed on to that event that was taking place outside, involving some Members of the House itself, I felt that we must try to be more specific on the subject that is being discussed today.

First of all, the Hon. Vijitha Herath representing the JVP, made a very scathing attack on certain issues. Particularly, I must make it very clear because the Constitution and the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court deals with a variety of different aspects of that jurisdiction. It can be called a "determination", or it can be called a "judgment" as in Article 127 of the Constitution. Articles 121, 122, 123, 125 and also 126, calls it a "determination".

Then there is another issue that has been the subject of discussion for the past several days in the media as well as in this House: the opinion referred to in Article 129 (1), under which the presidential reference has been made to the Supreme Court. All of these are made by the Supreme Court in the exercise of its several jurisdictions. Here, it is explicit that whether its description is "determination", "judgment", "opinion" or "decision", the conclusion is all the same though there are different

3167 3168

labels to the concept. Therefore, it must be very clearly understood that the opinion of the Supreme Court given under Article 129 (1) of the Constitution has exactly the same authority as a judgment handed down by the Court in litigation between parties. There is no difference, whatsoever, in terms of the degree of authority. The reality is that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is invoked, and it can be exercised in a variety of ways: original, appellate, revisionary, in fundamental rights applications and in terms of Article 129(1). Nomenclature could differ, but the degree of authority cannot be differentiated, depending on the nature of the jurisdiction. I must make it very clear in this regard, because this matter was raised by the Hon. Vijitha Herath and I want to make that subject very specific.

As to the other issues that have been dealt today, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera who is a regular participant in the Discussion relating to the subject of my Ministry, has once again raised certain issues pertaining to the Sri Lanka Law College. I must say that some degree of controversy has arisen relating to certain issues, but those matters are still under consideration and discussion and I cannot discuss or divulge details right away. But, the fact is that for the Bachelor of Laws Degree of a recognized university, which has a three-year course, where students have studied a minimum of 12 core subjects would be admitted and, of course, they had been allowed to sit the preliminary examination in October, 2014, except the persons who had graduated from the University of Wolverhampton. They have been required to follow the lectures in the preliminary year in 2015 and to sit the preliminary examination in October, 2015 as the overall inadequacies of the said university LLB Degree programme had been gone into, and some relief has been given to them. Of course, also a minimum 75 per cent attendance at lectures is an important stipulation that has been brought about.

I must also say that the Law graduates from the University of Colombo, the Open University of Sri Lanka, the University of Peradeniya and the University of Jaffna will be required to follow the entire course of lectures conducted for final year students at the Law College, prior to sitting the Attorneys-at-Law Final Examination in October. We have dealt with these issues.

I must also give some details of the numbers involved when it comes to Law College, because people have to appreciate the extreme difficulty that we undergo when it comes to space for the conduct of lectures for students. There is another novel feature that has been introduced. That is, the conduct of all internal examinations by an independent examination division chaired by the Director, Examinations which had been created and especially appointed for this purpose. The examination in April, 2014 for 872 students, in addition to paper marking, was conducted within the Law College and this assures greater transparency in exam results in addition to the results being issued expeditiously.

Then, I must also say the students intake to the Sri Lanka Law College for the period 1st January, 2014 to 31st August, 2014 was 436 through the Sri Lanka Law College Entrance Examination and the LLB students. Such is the number that we can cater for lectures within the limited space that is available in the Law College premises.

The Entrance Examination for the year 2015 was conducted on the 6th of September, 2014 by the Commissioner-General of Examinations.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

Whereupon THE HON. HUNAIS FAROOK left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, you may continue, please. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Chairman, I was referring to the difficulties we face at the Sri Lanka Law College of which you, yourself is a distinguished alumnus. This time, the number of candidates who sat for the Entrance Examination was 3,571. We felt that certain issues relating to the rules of admission to the Sri Lanka Law College, have to be discussed in the future in order to bring them in line with the required stipulations to be placed before Parliament.

I must also refer to certain other functions of my Ministry. Particularly, when it comes to child protection - it is an issue which came up for discussion yesterday in one of the Committee Rooms of Parliament as well, where we formed a separate Childrens Caucus - there is a concept of creating child-friendly courts which has been established with the assistance of the UNICEF. This is to expedite the processing and disposal of cases of child abuse and to prevent the secondary victimization of victims of child abuse. This has been going on as a project under the purview of my Ministry. We have brought in the Attorney-Generals Department, the Police Department and the Ministry of Health also within the purview of this programme. This has resulted in expediting the processing and disposal of cases of child abuse within one year from the date of complaint to the police. This has had immense success and, I am sure, this

3169 3170

can be further improved by working on certain other issues of concern which relates to courts refurbishment. We also intend to have a workshop on determining the minimum age of criminal responsibility; right now the age remains at 10. There are proposals to raise the age of criminal responsibility, so that we can bring ourselves in line with international standards.

We have also taken steps to set up a web-based case tracking system with the help of the University of Colombo, for the Attorney-Generals Department. Recently, that matter was also concluded. In our activities, we have another important aspect which has not gained much publicity. That is, the National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force, which operates under the purview of our Ministry. This National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force is a national coordinating body to advise and monitor activities to be implemented in combating human trafficking in Sri Lanka. We have established a shelter for women victims of human trafficking, which was an achievement during the course of the last year. This Task Force is also taking action to develop an Annual Action Plan, together with what we have achieved in drafting the Standard Operating Procedures developed by the Task Force to increase identification, referrals and protection of victims of human trafficking, which has been approved by the Cabinet as well.

Apart from these issues, it is important for me to mention that we have been able to make vast improvements to the court infrastructure, particularly new buildings. We have been able to complete a new Court Complex in Batticaloa, which is to be shortly declared open. Then, we have also declared open buildings in Samanthurai and Pottuvil and several other buildings have also been completed. We did so in Hingurakgoda also. There is a court that has now been completed in Kalpitiya, which was unfortunately functioning in a Buddhist Temple. It was a circuit court, but now it would be converted into a permanent court. Then, several other court houses are in the process of being built. The Wattala Court Complex and the Homagama Court Complex are being developed at a multimillion-rupee cost. The Galle Court Complex which is one of your own initiatives, Sir, is also taking shape. I am told that you have had a meeting today with our officials relating to the acquisition of land to expand the land area available, so that you can build a proper lawyers complex to support the large court complex. We have also begun work on a similar project for Matara as well, almost at the same scale, so that they too would benefit by the infrastructure programmes of the Ministry. Also, there are several other infrastructure projects that are now underway.

There was a particular reference by the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara about the International Arbitration Centre, which we have now completed doing all the necessary

refurbishment needed at the 26th Floor of the World Trade Centre. Though the infrastructure is complete, the process to have the company incorporated has taken some time. Therefore, the official opening of this new International Arbitration Centre has been delayed but hopefully, before the dawn of the new year, we should be able to declare that open so that one of the important flagship projects of this Ministry would become functional within the course of this year.

Having mentioned that, I must also say that the allegation of the tender being awarded without calling for competent bids, is totally wrong. This has been a limited tender that was called on the instructions of the Cabinet. The Cabinet Paper was presented in that regard and based on that, the tender was awarded to the ultimate bidder. The work has now been completed though there are certain disputes relating to payment, because of which the project site has still not been handed over. However, we wish to declare it open so that this important facility which had been promised by His Excellency the President in his Budget Speech in 2011, will become a reality.

Then, I must also refer to the important changes or the advances that we have achieved in the Government Analysts Department which provides analytical, advisory and consultancy services in the fields of forensic and food sciences to our courts of law, as well as the law enforcement agencies and other institutions. I must say that several new facilities have now made the task of the Government Analysts Department a very pleasant exercise for those who are working there. Several pieces of legislation such as the Food and Drugs Act, National Environmental Act, Excise Ordinance, National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act, Cosmetics, Devices and Drugs Act, Control of Pesticides Act, Firearms Ordinance, Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Explosives Act, Offensive Weapons Act, Motor Traffic Act, Criminal Procedure Code, Civil Procedure Code and the Evidence Ordinance, all of which, require services to be delivered in order to ascertain the analytical advice pertaining to the substances that are submitted for analysis by the Department. One important feature is that in May 2013, this Department was shifted to a new building equipped with state-of-the-art technology and all modern facilities at Pelawatta, Battaramulla, including a DNA laboratory which has now become functional. In the functioning of this laboratory, certain shortcomings had been observed but we will have them corrected so that all those small inadequacies will be met.

There is also an initiative to set up a cybercrime laboratory with Korean assistance, which will become a reality soon and that too will be part of the Government Analysts Department. These are some of the functions of my Ministry. I have no time to refer to the entire gamut of activities that we are engaged in.

There was some reference made by the Hon. Ajith P. Perera and perhaps the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in their speeches today. They referred to the delay in the amendments that we sought to bring to the Civil Procedure Code in order to expeditiously and efficiently facilitate the disposal of cases within our court system. I must specifically say that this piece of legislation finally has now been approved by the Cabinet and it is before the Cabinet Subcommittee on Legislation and, hopefully at the next Session, possibly after the Presidential Election when Parliament is re-summoned, we should be able to have that passed so that the long delay in our court system, particularly in the civil courts of the country could be minimized.

Having said that, I do not want to speak at length. So, I once again thank all the speakers who have contributed to the Debate from both sides of the House and, particularly, I must thank my Secretary, Kamalini de Silva as well as the other officials who have been assisting me to conduct the affairs of this Ministry during the past year.

Thank you. [.. 6.03] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera - Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms) , , , . . . , .

Gross Borrowing Requirement and Budget Deficit - 2015 :

The gross borrowing limit for 2015 as per the Appropriation Bill was Rs. 1,340 billon.

The gross borrowing limit recorded in the 2015 Budget Speech, after the proposals, is Rs. 1,780 billion

Hence, there is an increase of Rs. 356 billion in the gross borrowing limit.

Of this, Rs. 170 billion is for the issuance of bonds for the balance sheet restructuring of State-owned enterprises, which will not have an impact on the Government's day-to-day expenditures.

Another Rs. 80 billion has been set aside as contingent provisions to deal with any revenue shortfall.

Hence, these increases in the gross borrowing limit in 2015, which is prepared in accounting format, will not have any impact on the Budget Deficit, which is prepared in Economic Format.
