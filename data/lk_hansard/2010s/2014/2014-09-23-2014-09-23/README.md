( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. P. Dayaratna. [5.33 p.m.]

. ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. P. Dayaratna - Minister of Food Security) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to speak about the Construction Industry Development Bill at a time it is presented in Parliament by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, the Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities to be passed into law - amidst so many representations that were made by so many institutions - a situation that we all have been anxiously waiting for. As we all know, the formulation of the Construction Industry Development Bill commenced as early as 1995. Its intended purpose was the conversion of the apex body, the Institute for Construction Training and Development - ICTAD - to a statutory authority. ICTAD was established under the Industrial Corporation Act, No. 49 of 1957 to attend, inter alia, to functions relating to development and regulation of construction industry, development of the status of contractors, consultants, human resource personnel, and the construction process itself as well as improvement in technology. However, unfortunately, it did not have the necessary legal authority to implement some of the more important activities.

323 324

2014 23

Projects, it is said, are the cutting edge of development. Projects are undertaken on a results-oriented basis to achieve planned results within allocated budgeted resources and within fixed targets and time frames. Success of projects depends largely on carrying out the constituent task in a proper sequence and deploying resources to the best advantage. However, many projects appear to suffer from inadequacies, both with regard to project formulation as well as implementation, resulting in large overruns in cost and time, affecting the very viability of projects and acting as a drag on the economy. It is true that time and cost overruns in projects, in an environment of uncertainty, inadequate funding, delays in land acquisition, problems arising out of legal issues and general escalation of costs cannot be eliminated altogether. But, true enough these can be contained, controlled or minimized by adopting suitable corrective measures. However, the absence of a national policy, a national advisory council and a construction development authority to direct, guide and regulate the industry was felt strongly. These issues will be overcome by passing this Bill into law in this House today. The creation of a development fund for the construction industry, among other things, will strengthen the industry and also extend a helping hand to the small-scale contractors, the self-employed, the technicians and the craftsmen.

The Bill will introduce several system improvements and create awareness among ministries, departments and public-sector enterprises about the need to complete projects within fixed times and approved costs. These changes would provide a far more effective and transparent system in good governance. It will also result in large savings to the nation by reducing the incidents of disputes in contracts and enhancing better cooperation among the participating parties. It will also inculcate a greater sense of responsibility leading to speedy execution of projects. The management of contracts with sound planning and good networking of the related inter-linked activities would help the owner as well as the contractor in keeping a good control of the implementation of projects on a day-to-day basis and keeping the project always on track. The maintenance of a register or a directory of professionals, contractors, property developers, importers, and suppliers of building materials and heavy construction equipment will be a boon to all industry-involved personnel as well as the general public in a big way.

The Bill has been discussed in depth and in various fora and has been submitted for the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers on several occasions. On each such occasion, either it was returned to the subject Minister to make

suitable amendments or it could not be proceeded with due to dissolution of Parliament. However, the present Bill, which is before the House now, has been approved

by the Cabinet of Ministers with only two amendments, and those were submitted by me. With these amendments, all stakeholders in the construction industry will be included and it will fulfil all the requirements of the construction industry. I am happy that the Bill is before the House for approval even at this late juncture, when all stakeholders in the construction industry are eagerly awaiting the speedy implementation of the Act by the Government. In a salutary stance, all relevant professionals who are stakeholders of the construction industry have been included in the National Advisory Council on Construction and they will, in turn, look into construction-related matters and draw up suitable policies to address any issue in the future.

The inclusion of the Institute of Incorporated Engineers Sri Lanka as a Member in the Board of Management of the Construction Industry Development Authority will make a valuable contribution to the development of the construction industry. It will also provide measures to improve the well-being of industry-related professionals, manufacturers, suppliers, contractors and craftsmen. Some of their members hold high positions of responsibility even as successful entrepreneurs in manufacturing, supplying, construction and in training of craftsmen. As a Chartered Engineer cum Senior Minister myself, who has been in charge of many engineering-related Ministries including Mahaweli Development, Irrigation, Power and Energy, Petroleum Industries, I am glad to witness that key engineering institutions led by the Institution of Incorporated Engineers, Sri Lanka Institute of Architects and so on, handle different roles and responsibilities and are all included in the Board of Management of the Construction Industry Development Authority.

This situation developed as an outcome of various discussions held with several Ministers of construction to justify the inclusion of all these institutions in the Board of Management of the Construction Industry Development Authority. The subject was taken up at a Parliamentary Consultative Committee Meeting held as early as 21st of October, 2009 by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the then Minister in charge of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development.

The Construction Industry Development Bill fills a long-standing vacuum and is a sine quo non in todays context for the development of the construction industry in Sri Lanka. The Act will assist in the regulation, formulation and standardization of activities of the construction industry. The Act will also protect the local construction industry by registering contractors, property developers and by maintaining a directory of importers, manufacturers of construction material and heavy construction machinery and equipment and by registering qualified personnel. Among the salient features of the Authority, is the adoption of a mechanism for settlement of disputes through conciliation, mediation and through

325 326

the right to refer for adjudication, when necessary, thereby saving unnecessary expenditure on litigation and avoiding delays in implementation. In short, the Act creates a national policy, introduces a National Advisory Council, sets up a Construction Industry Development Authority and creates a Construction Industry Development Fund and an Appeal Board to dispense matters expeditiously. Since the Construction Industry Development Bill fulfils all aspects of development of the construction industry in Sri Lanka, I request all Members of this House to give your fullest support and consent to pass this Bill in Parliament today.

Thank you.
