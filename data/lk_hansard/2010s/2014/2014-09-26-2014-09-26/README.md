. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Yes. May I know who is responsible for resettling these people?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Ministry responsible for resettlement is, in fact, the Ministry of Resettlement. But, you have asked a Question that should be answered by the Minister of Defence and Urban Development. So, it should be addressed to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development in order to get an answer. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The second Supplementary Question, please. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The Question is for the Hon. Minister of Resettlement and not for the Hon. Minister of Defence.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I agree, Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, that a Question directed to the Minister of Resettlement should be answered by the Minister of Resettlement. If you are asking a Question in relation to defence, you should address it to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) How can it be a defence issue? This Question is with regard to the people who have been prevented from going into their own lands for the last 25 years. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) For 30 years, we had the LTTE insurgency. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, you must reduce 25 from 30 first. It is only now that people can go and resettle because the LTTE was going at them also. Not only that, there were so many armed groups in the North who were going at each other.- [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Are you going to resettle these people? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We are going to resettle the people. I will give you the assurance that they would be resettled. I gave the answer, but you have some other problems with regard to the airport that comes under a different Ministry. - Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, is this your third Supplementary Question?

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The whole area is not necessary for the expansion of the airport.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Member, will you ask the question from the Ministry of Civil Aviation or the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development in relation to that?- [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I think people will forcibly go and resettle in their own lands.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We have resettled thousands of families. You cannot deny that.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much.

The allegations are misleading and erroneous because they are not realized losses but are mark-to-market unrealized losses arising from variations in the stock market. Unrealized losses or gains do not increase or decrease the benefits distributed to the members.

In conclusion, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to state that from the EPF money, 92 per cent is invested in Government Securities, 6 per cent is in the stock market and 2 per cent is in the corporate debentures and short-term Government Securities.

Investment is always risky. Even crossing the road on a yellow line is risky and coming into "Sirikotha" is also risky. That is a fundamental law of nature. But, you all know that it is the risk that generates profits.

Look at the private sector. They do invest their private-owned money. Do all of them succeed? See how the stocks and shares are traded in the stock market purely on speculations. That is the rule applicable to money invested anywhere in the world.

The UNP introduced the open market economy. They took a major risk and it was not only them but the entire country had to pay the heavy price and even now we are paying for it. It is not a few pennies like in the case of the EPF, but they have ruined the entire country, its culture, religion, values and what not. That is the result of just blindly following privatization without any control or restrictions to preserve the identity of our nation.

Mahatma Gandhi also felt that he would not mind opening the windows but not the doors, so that new wind will flow in but one would not get flown out.

Talking about shares and realized or unrealized losses or profits, one must argue like economists, bankers, financial experts and statesmen, and employ and reconcile logical and rational thinking, things that one would have learnt at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Minister, the problem with this is in Sri Lanka, a private investor cannot be taken before a court for manipulation. In COPE also, I asked from the authorities about this and they said the law must be regulated in the future. In other countries that is the factual situation.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I think that should be tested only in the Supreme Court of this country where you seek redress over an element of

fraud in connection with public funds. You should make that effort if you are serious about the allegation that you are making. I do not know this subject; you know the subject.

. -Select Committee - . . This is what is alleged. Nobody is saying that they have robbed, but there are allegations of mass-scale robbery.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Is the Public Accounts Committee not sufficient for that?

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) At the Public Accounts Committee, we have still not finished the 2010 accounts. We have not got the 2011 accounts; we have not got the 2012 accounts and we have not got the 2013 accounts. I think there is a sense of urgency, Hon. Minister; that sense of urgency must be acted upon and it must result in a Parliamentary Select Committee.

Madam Chairperson, I propose that we look into ways as to how we could immediately and urgently appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee to go into all these allegations, the gamut of operations of the share market and bond market transactions of the EPF. Do not forget, Hon. Minister, the bond market transaction manipulations are actually much worse than the stock market manipulations, which cannot be seen. It is not the interest that you get but it is playing the yield curve, and the yield curve play is dependent upon the interest rates when it goes up and down. There are a lot of conflicts of interest and the conflicts of interest is what is causing the problem.

Thank you very much.
