. , commissions . . I am a member of the Parliamentary Council, and I also give my assent for the appointments made by the Council, which is headed by the Hon. Speaker along with the Hon. Prime Minister and, of course, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and his nominee - but they never turned up and they are the people who could negate the convention.

Now, taking into consideration the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Justice D.J. de Balapatabendi is the Chairman appointed by the Council. He is a Justice; he is an honourable man. Then, Justice L.K. Wimalachandra, who is a Judge and Mr. Jayantha Wickramaratne are the other members. So, these people have an unblemished character; maintain their self-respect and they have a status in this society. They did not accept these posts in order to get vilified and insulted by - . .

981 982

, . , . . , Commission .

What does the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act, No.19 of 1994 say? Members of Parliament cannot remove them according to their whims and fancies. You just cannot throw mud at them and remove them. It is a very responsible post.

. . ; ; .

Sections (5) (a) and (b) of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act states, I quote:

(5) (a) A member of the Commission shall not be removed from office except by an order of the President made after an address of Parliament supported by a majority of the total number of Members of Parliament (including those not present) has been presented to the President for such removal on the ground of proved misconduct or incapacity:

Provided however that no resolution for the presentation of such an address shall be entertained by the Speaker or placed on the Order Paper of Parliament, unless notice of such resolution is signed by not less than one-third of the total number of Members of Parliament and sets out full particulars of the alleged misconduct or incapacity.

(b) The procedure for the presentation and passing of an address of Parliament for the removal of a Judge of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal shall apply in all respects to the presentation and passing of an address of Parliament for the removal of a member of the Commission."

Therefore, Sir, what have we come to? This country has people of great character, ability and as I said, they value their individual life. They have not just come and occupied these positions. I am a member of this Council. The Parliamentary Council has appointed the Human Rights Commission, the Finance Commission and so on. We give our assent in the Parliamentary Council to appoint the Chief Justice and the other Judges of the Supreme Court. We give our assent to appoint members to the Public Service Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and the Members of the Judicial Service Commission. We give our assent for the appointment of Judges of the Court of Appeal, the Auditor-General, the Attorney-General and also the Secretary-General of Parliament. The Secretary-General of Parliament is nodding in consent of what I am saying. Then, we give our assent to appoint the members of the Police Commission too. Now, they are all well guarded by the Constitution. They cannot be humiliated like this. I am ashamed, as a Member of this Parliament,

that they have chosen this august Assembly, the highest body, to vilify these people.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, now please wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, give me one more minute. My Friend, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister of Industry and Commerce, is doing a great job of work. Never in history has a Minister entered into so many trade and commercial agreements with almost all the friendly countries of the world.

Then, Sir, see the ethnicity and harmony the President has built up. The article written by Udeni Chandrasiri which appears under the "Provincial News" on page 5 of "The Island" newspaper of 22nd May, 2014 states, I quote:

"A friendship across the ethnic divide Tamil teenage runaway ends up in Sinhala friend's home"

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please, wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will finish, Sir. This is reported in todays The Island" newspaper. Sir, a Tamil boy who ran away from his home in Mullaitivu in Jaffna has come to a house in Homagama, where one of his Sinhala friends, Dulsara, lives with his parents, Malini and Gamini Tilakasiri. Then, Rerushan, the Tamil boy had stayed with them for four days.

The news item states, I quote:

He had boarded the bus and travelled looking for the name board of Mahinda Rajapaska Vidyalaya.

He has read the name board which was in Tamil as well and has come to Homagama and found his friend's house there. All this is being done by the Government for our future.

Thank you very much.
