Hon. Chairman, the Auditor-Generals Report of 2011 highlighted several discrepancies concerning administrative and investment matters in the Employees' Provident Fund. But, it seems that the Government has not taken serious note of it. The increase in the employer contribution to the Provident Fund by 2 per cent has to be considered as a device to bridge the Government Budget Deficit.

Further, in his Report, the Auditor-General highlights several instances where monies had been recovered and not credited to the individual accounts. Thus, many who are eligible to draw this money after 55 years have been deprived of getting it and many beneficiaries have also died without getting a cent. The JEDB, the SLSPC and the Elkaduwa Plantation alone have to pay EPF, ETF and service gratuity from 2001 to 2012 to the tune of approximately Rs. 1,840 million, 1840

. I hope the Hon. Minister would remember that he announced at the NLAC meeting that the plantation management has undertaken to cut trees and pay up the dues to the EPF from monies received by the sale of those trees. Sir, I would like to know from the Hon. Minister how much money he had recovered from the sale of trees and the amount deposited in individual EPF accounts of employees.

In addition to that, the Ceylon Transport Board has to pay approximately Rs. 3,882 million to the EPF. All these sectors are managed by your Government, and His Excellency the President as Minister of Finance and Planning, pointed out in his Budget Speech that lease agreements of loss-making companies, which have not paid their dues, will be cancelled. So, what is His

Excellency the President going to do in respect of the Government-managed estates, which have not paid even the EPF for more than 15 years and which have not put the State-managed plantations in perfect order, being a model to others? Is it proper for the Government to preach something that it does not practise, to others?

Then, Article 23 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, "Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment". But, in reality, it is not so. The ILO propagates decent work, but unfair labour practices are committed often, taking advantage of the Government policy. Out of the total workforce of approximately 8.05 million in our country, 62 per cent represents the informal economic sector, which include garments, building construction, agriculture, fisheries et cetera. The workers in informal economic sectors like the garment sector, live under precarious working conditions especially in workplaces in the Free Trade Zones. This large workforce is deprived of all statutory entitlements: overtime payments, leave, holidays, EPF, ETF, other social benefits and the right to organize. Sri Lanka adopted the ILO Conventions No. 87 and 98, but the freedom of association and freedom to organize and federate are curtailed in most of the sectors.

With regard to the extension of collective agreement, , , . . , . , .

Sir, if we take outsourcing, there is a very serious situation in the country, which the entire House should take note of. In other words, there is outsourcing or subcontracting of work to manpower agencies by some of the employers for personal gain, thus denying the workers their legitimate rights such as superannuation benefits, permanency, employment injury benefits et cetera.

Employers hire contract labour repeatedly on a short-term basis, which helps termination of workers easily. Besides, there is total absence of trade union rights in this process. The workers are not permitted to join Trade Unions and as such there is no possibility of collective bargaining. A large number of workers are being affected due to this process.

Sir, according to the Brazilian Labour Law, companies that outsource part of their activities to other companies

have to show some responsibility for the labour rights of workers of subcontracted firms. Also, outsourcing firms are strictly required to ensure decent work conditions, dismissal protections and other legal guarantees.

The most surprising aspect is that a proposal was unanimously adopted by the NLAC concerning outsourcing and the Hon. Minister submitted a Cabinet Memorandum two years ago to that effect. But, no decision has yet been taken by the Cabinet with regard to a very important issue affecting thousands of workers who are deprived of their legitimate rights. I would like to know whether this is the proud policy of Adambara Thaththas Chinthanaya. Thousands of workers have very badly been affected. So, I request the Hon. Minister to take serious note of it. There should be a decision on that. Please follow the Brazilian example and learn from their experience. A large number of outsourced workers are denied of their rights. They do not know who their employer is because they have been contracted and subcontracted endlessly. Everywhere, even at most of the leading hospitals, the workers have been recruited through employment agencies, in other words, through brokers. We want them directly employed by your employers. They should know their employers and they should also enjoy their rights. A large amount of earnings of the country is being brought by the informal sector. So, why are workers in the informal sectors are being deprived of their rights?

Then, I come to indexation of wages. According to Section 20 (2)(b) and (c) of the Wages Boards Ordinance, the Commissioner of Labour is required to ascertain and publish the cost of living index variation in the Government Gazette. The Colombo Consumer Price Index was published in the Government Gazette monthly from 1952 up to April 2008, the variation was Rs. 2 per point. In May 2008, a new Index was introduced, but it is not published in the Gazette now. Thus, the Trade Unions find it impossible to bargain without this Index, which forms the yardstick in wage negotiations, especially in the collective agreements. This is one of the priority areas which have been discussed in the NLAC for a long time. The decisions taken at the NLAC are not being implemented. Hon. Minister, with your all experience - you were a trade union leader and also the president of my union at one time - you can look into this matter. We appreciate that you, who was a trade union leader, have been given a very important position and we would like to see these important issues are addressed on a priority basis.

Finally, I must mention that this Budget, instead of helping the workers, has cheated them and shattered their hopes and aspirations. I hope the Ministry will take prompt action, at least, to eradicate the outsourcing menace and help a large number of workers.

Why are you borrowing money from the Chinese Exim Bank and banks in other countries? Do what India is doing. Pay Rs. 10,000 to a Government servant. You all are corrupt people. This is peoples money that you have taken. This is what has happened to our country.

Then, Sir, I refer to the Central Bank's investment on Greece Bonds.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) All right, Sir. How much has the Central Bank invested in Greece Bonds? The face value is Euros 49,900,700 billion. Who authorized this? Did the Cabinet approve this? Did the Government approve it? Who approved it? Did the Central Bank Governor himself do this? Have you not taken any action? Greece is a corrupt country in Europe. I ask you, "Whose money is this"? This is why people are suffering. Due to the high cost of living, 90 per cent of the people are suffering. They have to pay for this.

How much have you paid forthe Hedging Agreement? The Governor of the Central Bank says that he does not know anything about the Hedging Agreement. The Hon. Fowzie says that it is the Central Bank. The Hon. G.L. Peiris says, "We are holding an inquiry and the Cabinet will appoint a subcommittee". Where is the report? What happened to it? What are you talking? This country belongs to the people, to us. Someday, we will die. Hon. Ministers, Hon. Members, ask your own conscience. I do

not want to - [Interruption.] - I will not die. I will work for the country. I will be happy. I am a healthy man. I feel sorry for you.

Sir, these Chinese contracts -

( ) (The Chairman) Can you conclude, Hon. Member?

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Look at India. India is going to become a mighty power in the world within the next 15 years. Do you think that India will just keep quiet?

[3.04 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I refer to the 2015 National Budget Proposals submitted by His Excellency the President, as the Minister of Finance and Planning and wish to place my comments and views for your esteemed consideration.

It appears that while preparing this Budget, the Hon. Minister had not paid sufficient concern to the livelihood development and rehabilitation of the people in the Northern Province, who were seriously affected by a three-decade long war. It is with much regret I wish to point out that the same ignorance is being reflected in the Economic Development Ministrys allocation too.

Development of a region does not mean or end only with the development of infrastructure facilities such as roads, electricity, water, communication et cetera. Instead, much concern must be given to the development of the

livelihood of the people living there. It is necessary to think about the sustainable solutions to uplift the living standards of the people in the region. If so, attention must be given to develop the basic sectors like agriculture, industry, service, education, health, human resources et cetera. Sufficient investments or capital expenses must be made in such sectors and proper plans must be made to get the best benefits from such investments.

From the Economic Development Ministrys estimated investment expenditure of Rs. 21.60 billion meant for the development of the emerging regions, only a meagre sum of Rs. 2.4 billion has been allocated for the Northern Province, which is less than half of the fund allocated in the year 2014. Further, only a meagre sum of Rs. 1.8 billion is allocated for the development of the Eastern Province, which is the lowest allocation among the regions. However, it is notable that higher allocations compared to last year have been made to most of the other regions of the country.

A similar situation has been observed in the 2015 Budget Proposals for the capital expenditure allocations to the Northern Provincial Council. Only a sum of Rs. 5.3 billion has been allocated for the capital expenditure of the Northern Provincial Council, which is approximately Rs. 700 million less than the fund allocated in the year 2014. These type of lower allocations of funds to the Northern Province could seriously affect the sustainable development of the region.

I wish to point out a few issues pertaining to the details of the people living below the poverty line. This is clearly indicated in the Report "Poverty Headcount Ratio Brief", published by the Department of Census and Statistics and the Ministry of Finance and Planning. According to that Report, Mannar has 20.1 per cent, Mullaitivu has 28.8 per cent, Kilinochchi has 12.7 per cent, and Batticaloa has 19.4 per cent. But, overall it is 6.7 per cent. From these figures, one could easily see that only these four areas have the highest poverty line. That, means these districts are not on par with the other districts. They are very much below in their income earnings; not only in income earnings but also all other economic conditions that are required is much less. That is why I am insisting that these districts should have been allocated more and also their living standards must be raised to be equal with other districts.

Hence, the Ministry of Economic Development has the responsibility and commitment to uplift the living standards of the people who live below the poverty line. But, the Ministry has failed to estimate the appropriate funds to be allocated among the regions and, therefore, equal and uniform development cannot be expected among regions, which may be harmful to the national reconciliation issues. I repeat, it may be harmful to the national reconciliation issues.

2014 05

Sir, it is appropriate to point out another issue pertaining to the allocation of the Ministry of Economic Development. It is to be noted that the allocation made for the year 2014 is revised during the year and accordingly, allocation and expenditures are reduced for certain programmes. For example, although a sum of Rs. 3 billion had been allocated for the North and the East Local Services Improvement Project, the amount has been reduced by Rs. 200 million to Rs. 2.8 billion.

Similarly, the sum of Rs. 2,101 million allocated under the Indian Governments Housing Scheme is reduced to Rs. 2,050 million. These type of reductions may definitely lead to the adversity of development projects and also will consume more time for their completion.

As far as the North is concerned, an illusion is spread all over to show that development work is being carried out in its full swing. Any person who can scrutinize the development projects in the Northern Province could easily find out that more sustainable and result-oriented efforts have to be made with such development projects, failing which all efforts will be just an eyewash. It will become a futile practice actually.

In 1983, nearly 1,300 small and medium-sized production-based industries were functioning in the Jaffna Peninsula. Most of them were closed down during the period of the war but even after five years after the end of the war, no proper arrangements have been made to restore those closed-down industries. Today, only less than 200 industries are in operation in the Jaffna Peninsula. Similarly, more attention must be given to sectors like agriculture, fisheries, et cetera.

The Northern Province has all the resources within its territory. As long as the fisheries sector is concerned, in 1983, the Northern Province contributed nearly 40 per cent to the gross marine fisheries harvest in Sri Lanka. But, according to the latest report in 2013, that Province is contributing only a meagre fraction of 13.3 per cent to the national marine fisheries products.

The reason for this backdrop is in consequence of not providing sufficient facilities to the Northern fishermen. Today, 20 fishery harbours are found in Sri Lanka, but not even a single fishery harbour is found in the Northern Province. The only two fishery harbours that were in the North, Mailiddy and Talaimannar, were taken over by the army as high security zones. Since then, the Government has not allowed those two harbours for fishermens use and also have not constructed any new harbours instead. All these affect the livelihood of the fisheries community in the Northern Province.

Now, everyone is talking about 8 per cent growth. But, if the 1,300 industries that were there in Jaffna in 1983 is restored and even if the 40 per cent of the fisheries growth is there, this 8 per cent would still come

down. So, I think the Hon. Minister of Economic Development has to concentrate more on these developments.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, the other day, the Hon. Minister of Fisheries told that the Nachchikuda Velankanni Fishery Harbour will be built very soon. I want to find out this from you. Although Rs. 6,200 million has been allocated to the Northern Provincial Council, they have only spent about 5 or 6 per cent of it. Why is that?

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I will give you some explanation on that. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) So, I earnestly request the Hon. Minister of Economic Development to pay attention to this. After 2009, the investments made in the Northern Province is not tangible. I have already mentioned various other sectors where there is an improvement but it is not so with the livelihood. Therefore, it has to be considered favourably. I also want to point out this fact. I think the EPDP Member, the Hon. Chandrakumar Murugesu, mentioned on the 31st of October, about the spendings by the Northern Provincial Council. I have the figures in my hand. He mentioned that education was allocated Rs. 277 million. But, no, it is Rs. 259 million. Out of that, Rs. 81 million has been paid and work worth Rs. 20 million has been completed and is ready for payment: 60 per cent of the work has been completed and they are waiting for the bills; 40 per cent of work is in progress which will completed by December. These figures are there in their Financial Progress Report.

Sir, the allocation of Rs. 1,035 million made for agriculture is not with the Provincial Ministry of Agriculture. Out of that, Rs. 690 million is for Iranaimadu Smallholder Irrigation and Livelihood Development Project and Rs. 800 million has been allocated for Jaffna-Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Those funds are with the Ministry of Local Government. The Ministry has to release the funds after the project is approved. It is a project fund. Therefore, the Provincial Ministry of Agriculture was given only Rs. 157 million. Out of that, Rs. 60 million has been paid and Rs. 30 million is for pending bills. Work worth Rs. 57 million is in progress and will be completed by 31st of December.

541 542

Although Rs. 81 million is mentioned under fisheries, it is not for fisheries alone. It is for fisheries, transport and rural development. For fresh water fishing, fisheries has been given Rs. 15 million. Unfortunately the tanks did not have water and it is only now that the tanks are getting filled up. Therefore, they could not start the project with that Rs. 15 million and now they are going to start it by allocating Rs. 7 million for fresh water fishing, another Rs. 7 million for procurement and Rs. 1 million for training.

In the same manner, out of Rs. 20 million allocated for transport, they are going to spend Rs. 3 million for the Mannar Bus Stand which is now under construction; Rs. 3 million is for Nelliyadi Bus Stand; Rs. 13 million is to build up 55 bus halts in the Northern Province and the balance Rs. 1 million is to build up an additional bus halt in Mannar.

Also, out of Rs. 46 million allocated for rural development, they have spent Rs. 10 million and the balance of Rs. 36 million is for development and procurement purposes. They are almost in the completion of work. For the health sector, they have got Rs. 210 million. As of today, Rs. 123 million has already been paid. They have got Rs. 87 million in hand and they are awaiting for the bills for procurement et cetera.

Also, CMs PSDG was allocated Rs.179 million and out of that, Rs. 15 million is held up by the Finance Commission. It is not released yet. So, this is the present situation in Jaffna. They cannot go ahead immediately. The reason for the delay is, I should say, bureaucratic battle. They have already spent 75 per cent of the total allocation and the balance will be spent before the end of this year. Therefore, I must say that a wrong picture has been given to the public. The Provincial Councils are doing their job amidst various obstacles.

Hon. Azwer, I want you to listen to this. They have enough obstacles. You must comment on that and people like you must find a way to bridge it. It is not coming through. The Buildings Department should work. In the case of the Northern Provincial Council, the Chief Minister and the Ministers are prepared to take any work forward. But, for every effort that they make, there is a delay or the Centre is trying to divert it. Sometimes, the signature from the Governor is delayed or sometimes they may be instructed from the Centre. There is much power given with the Concurrent List. But, others do not support it. So, one has to study all those matters before accusing the Northern Provincial Council.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, when I visited Jaffna, I visited you in the "Uthayan" Office and renewed my friendship with all the editors and others.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Yes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Ah, that is coexistence. That is, showing a hand of friendship. Do you not admit that?

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I know what you mean. In the same manner, the Provincial Council Ministers and everyone is prepared to work together.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, please give me just one minute. Everyone is prepared to work together for the betterment of the people in the area. Therefore, I urge that the Chief Minister and other Ministers must be allowed to work freely without any disturbance and they must be given power properly.

Thank you. [.. 3.21]

543 544

[ . ]

2014 05

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, I have extracted these figures from the Budget Estimates.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) I am sorry, that is not a point of Order. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, he cannot - ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) You can speak only if the Hon. Minister allows you to speak. That is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) . . , 25.17 . , . , .

Hon. Deputy Chairman, I am happy to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development for 2015. Our Government was faced with new challenges five years ago. After ending the three-decade long terror, there was a need to demine most of the war-torn areas. Resettlement programmes had to be carried out on a massive scale. Infrastructure had to be carried out to enable resettlement in their places of origin. Transport had to be facilitated. Above all, the resettled people had to be provided with shelter and means of livelihood to restart their economic activities. Basic agricultural tools, tractors, seeds for sowing, fertilizers, fishing gear and soft loans had to be provided to them. Keeping this in mind, various programmes were launched by the Government to meet these challenges in the Northern Province, collectively known as Wadakkin Wasantham. This programme was formulated under the patronage of the Presidential Task Force for the North under the Minster of Economic Development headed by the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa.

A three-way approach was articulated by the Presidential Task Force under the "Wadakkin Wasantham"

Programme. The first approach was the facilitation of relief, humanitarian assistance and resettlement of a large number of displaced persons and also rehabilitation of the entire infrastructure. All those have been planned on order of priority. The second approach was to support the returnees with livelihood assistance to recommence their economic activities, which is known as "Early Recovery Process" - ERP. The third approach was the development of major infrastructure.

, , , . . . , . , . . , . .

Today, we are able to breathe with a sense of achievement and pride because within this short span of five years, our Government, - under the vision of His Excellency President Manhinda Rajapaksa and under the energetic guidance of the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa - has not only resettled the displaced civilians as fast as possible but also constructed buildings, roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and provided all other basic infrastructure facilities. The fact that the Government has successfully completed the facilitation of relief, humanitarian assistance and resettlement of displaced people is testimony to the Governments sincere commitment in the implementation of the Wadakkin Wasantham programme. In the years 2013 and 2014 alone, the Government has spent Rs. 14,314 million under this programme.

The development initiative of our Government is not confined to resettlement and infrastructure development only. "Valvin Eluchchi" - "Divi Neguma" - Programme is another mega initiative carried out by the Ministry of Economic Development. Today, there are about 130,000 "Valvin Eluchchi" beneficiary families in the Northern Province including about 102,000 Samurdhi recipients. I have already made a request to His Excellency the President and the Hon. Minister of Economic Development at the special DCC meeting held in Jaffna on the 13th of last month, to review and increase the Samurdhi recipients in the North to 125,000.

The TNA Parliamentarians were on the forefront of legal action against the "Valvin Eluchchi" Act when it

545 546

was presented to Parliament in 2012. If the Government did not pass it with a two-thirds majority in Parliament, today, it would not be applicable to the Northern Province because it had not got the approval of the Northern Provincial Council as requested by the Supreme Court. In that case, about 130,000 families, in the North, would be suffering today without the "Valvin Eluchchi" benefits. Further, about 2,000 officers involved in implementing this Programme in the North, including Samurdhi officials and managers, would be without employment today.

The North-East Local Services Improvement Project - NELSIP - is another major programme carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Economic Development, but the implementation of the Project is carried out by the Northern Provincial Council and the local authorities. Out of about Rs. 3,660 million earmarked for the development of North, already about Rs. 3,000 million worth of work has been completed from 2012 onwards.

About three months ago, the Chairman of Velanai Pradeshiya Sabha, which is not under the control of the TNA, brought to the notice of the Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council, who is also the Provincial Minister of Local Government about irregularities committed by a contract engineer who was carrying out the NELSIP - "Nagara Eluchchi" - "Pura Neguma" Project in the North. He has also handed over supporting documents to his secretary, but they had not taken any action in this regard. Only recently when the Governor was notified of his irregularities, he has suspended the engineers service and started investigations into all the allegations. The TNA spokesperson has stated in a press briefing as well as in Parliament that the engineer attached to the NELSIP and the administrators of the Northern Provincial Council were involved in corrupt practice and action needs to be taken against them.

The NELSIP programme is being implemented by the Local Government Ministry of the Northern Provincial Council and the Local Authorities. A majority of the local bodies in the North is under the TNA administration. If there was corrupt practice in the NELSIP programme, the TNA Chairmen of the Pradeshiya Sabhas should have brought it to the notice of the Chief Minister whereas the Chairman of the Velanai Pradeshiya Sabha has reported it. Why has the Chief Minister not taken any action on the complaint made by the Chairman of Velanai Pradeshiya Sabha in his report?

About three months ago, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa invited the Chief Ministers of Northern and Eastern Provinces and all the Chairmen of the Pradeshiya Sabhas of these two provinces to discuss about US Dollars 106 million worth programmes to be carried out by local bodies of these two provinces. The Australian

acting High Commissioner too was present at this meeting as the Australian Government was giving US Dollars 20.3 million as a grant towards this programme. A notable absentee at this meeting was the Chief Minister of the Northern Province.

The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa has repeatedly invited the Chief Minister and the Ministers of the Northern Provincial Council to meet him to discuss about the needs of the province. He had even offered to come to Jaffna to meet and discuss with them. They have not responded to his request. Instead, they have been making false allegations that the Ministry of Economic Development is holding back the allocations due to the Council without releasing. The TNA spokesperson has also made such an allegation in this House. But, the same Chief Minister, other Ministers and the Council Chairman have got their brand new vehicles imported though the Ministry of Economic Development.

The TNA will go around the world saying that the Government is not doing anything for the Northern Provincial Council. But, when they are invited to take part in meetings to discuss about programmes to be carried out by them, they do not participate. They are used to poli-tricking for their survival.

Before I conclude, Sir, I wish to thank the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development, for the courageous initiatives taken by him for developing the war-torn Northern and Eastern Provinces. I also thank his officials for the support and cooperation extended in this regard. Thank you.

, , tourist arrivals .

I would like to reply to the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. As per the definition of the United Nations World Tourism Organization - UNWTO, "a tourist" is a visitor who stays at least one night in a collective or private accommodation in a country visited. The Department of Immigration and Emigration of Sri Lanka counts tourists as per this definition. In 2013, there were 27,600 hotel rooms in Sri Lanka. This has increased up to 28,002 by October this year. In 2013, the average duration of stay in Sri Lanka was 8.56 days and the average expenditure of a tourist was US Dollars 156.24 per day. By 31st October 2014, the average duration of stay is around 10.2 days and the average expenditure of a tourist has increased up to US Dollars 162.4. The average income earned per tourist in 2013 was US Dollars 1,334 and in 2014, it is US Dollars 1,624.

Now, I would like to compare our statistics with the Maldives. In 2013, there were 1.125 million tourist arrivals in Maldives. Tourist earnings in 2013 was US Dollars 2,031 million and expenditure per day was US Dollars 1,805. Therefore, Sri Lanka's tourist earnings is almost on par with the Maldives now.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Deputy Minister, can I ask a question?

565 566

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Is the tourist earnings in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, the same?

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) In 2013, there were 1.125 million tourist arrivals in the Maldives. It is almost the same in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is on par with the Maldives.

"That would have eased the presently experiencing fiscal burden to a large extent. Economic growth led by free markets is the key to reduce poverty as evident in Indias post-liberalization phase started in 1991, according to a recent book, Why Growth Matters authored by Professors Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya. Following the pro-market reforms in India, economic growth accelerated recording an average GDP growth rate of 6.9 percent during the decade ending 2002-03 and 7.9 percent....... It is 8 per cent in such a big country. I quote:

.........during the decade ending 2012-13. The authors argue that Indias growth spur lifted many millions out of poverty. The poverty ratio fell down from over 50 per cent in the early 1990s to 20 per cent by now in India. According to Bhagwati and Panagariya, economic growth reduces poverty, illiteracy, and ill-health through two channels. First, growth 'pulls up' people into gainful employment while also raising real wages throughout the economy. Growth, thus, helps eradicate poverty in a sustainable fashion while also equipping people to better access education and health. Second, economic growth provides rising tax revenues that allow the government to allocate additional finances for social services such as education, health, and subsidies to the poor."

. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The literacy rate is 91 per cent. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) It has been high for a long time; 91 per cent. So, they are asking us to take it to 99 per cent - [Interruption.] That is a poor country and there is a huge population in that country. This is a small country. We can develop it at any time. We have the geographical location and everything.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Open Economy.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That is the best thing. You ask your Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. He would agree with me that an open economy is the best

system and you have been given more than 20 years to change it. Have you changed it? You are the only person in the Government who said, It should change- [Interruption.] But, you are a minority in that Government. Everyone else believes that open economy is the solution for the betterment of this country. You are a minority and you are just one person who is living in the open economy era and refusing to adopt it - [Interruption.] But, you are in the Government. You are there for 20 years, but you are refusing to adopt it. I do not know why. Then, you should get away from the Government and have your own policy, but you do not do that. You do not do that for your own benefit. The Article further states, I quote:

"Having liberalized the Sri Lankan economy way back in 1977,..."

. :

"....... much earlier than India, the country has failed to sustain high economic growth. The annual average GDP growth remained around 6.5 percent during 2004-2013. Following the cessation of the prolonged conflict, GDP growth rate rose from 3.5 percent in 2009 to 8.0 percent in 2010 and to 8.2 percent..."

. . , :

"....... in 2011 due to increased availability to resources, productivity improvements and pent up demand. However, the growth momentum could not be sustained for long, and the growth rate came down to 6.3 per cent in 2012 and 7.3 percent in 2013 reflecting the normal trend. The lack of coherent macroeconomic policy strategies, except the first wave of economic reforms..." That was built by the UNP in 1977. It further states, I quote:

"......... implemented in the initial years of liberalization, has been the most prominent impediment that constrained DP growth over the years.

[5.56 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member for giving me the opportunity to speak at this Discussion. Unfortunately, the Hon. Minister is not here. I wanted to refer to an issue that I took up at the Consultative Committee of this Ministry about two years ago. It was a situation like Koslanda. In Dansinan Estate in Pundalu Oya, several houses had been damaged and the floors had gone in due to soil erosion. I took this up at the Consultative Committee and requested that these people be moved out and new houses be built for them. The Hon. Minister was willing to listen, but there was a Deputy Minister who spoke this morning during the Vote of his own Ministry who said, "There is nothing like that. I will look after these people. Following the tragedy in Koslanda, these people in Dunsinan Estate have been moved to a club

595 596

2014 05

building close to the estate because of the danger of these houses collapsing. Sir, this type of negligent behaviour has caused the tragedy in Koslanda. We all know that in 2005 and 2011, warnings were given to the Divisional Secretary and to the Manager of the Estate, but both of them failed to address the situation by moving these people out. That means that there is no mechanism in place to address the issue. When the NBRO or any other organization gives a report, then immediately there should be action taken.

Today, we have a Ministry for disaster management. The Disaster Management Ministry, in addition to assisting people when they meet disasters, is also supposed to plan action for prevention of disasters. At the moment, attention has been drawn to attend to the housing needs of the plantation people because there was a disaster in Koslanda and we have lost more than 100 lives. Now, to reduce the impact of this disaster, the Government is trying to say that the number of dead is in the region of 30. When this incident occurred, we saw that all people in this country rallied to assist the victims of this disaster. We saw on TV certain media institutions collecting various kinds of material to be distributed among these people; we saw people from different walks of life - the rich and the poor, people belonging to different communities and religions - flocking to assist these people. This showed how compassionate our people are. They broke the barriers of ethnicity, language, and religion. We always talk here about different communities, their needs, discrimination and other things. But, when the public react, they do not react according to the background or the ethnicity of a person, which was a positive thing that came out during the Koslanda incident and that, I think, we should appreciate.

At the same time, learning a lesson from Koslanda, there are several areas that have to be attended to immediately. I can mention a few here. They are, Dunsinane Estate in Pundaluoya, Park Estate in Kandapola, New Peacock Estate in Pussellawa and Uduwara Estate in Hali Ela. In all these areas, people have been temporarily displaced due to fear of landslides. These have to be attended to immediately.

The Government has allocated for next year, Rs. 2 billion for housing and sanitation. It has promised 50,000 houses in the next three years. These 50,000 houses in three years is a standard formula that has come from the "Mahinda Chintana" in 2005, but no action has been taken to implement these housing schemes. People are talking about why we should not have upstair houses or upstair line rooms in the estates. Flats are for the urban population. The plantation workers are agricultural workers. You would not build flats in a village. You would give them separate houses - single storey or two storeyed - but simple single houses. Like that, the estate worker, also being an agricultural worker, deserves separate houses.

The Ministry of Economic Development is implementing so many programmes in the villages for livelihood development. It is also having the Divi Neguma Programme and we heard a Member of Parliament saying that he is distributing 400,000 tea plants and the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne spoke of so many other plants being distributed in villages to improve the livelihood of the villagers.

Yogarajan) The livelihood programmes of the Ministry of Economic Development has mentioned the distribution of plants, helping people to grow vegetables, trees and all that. You cannot implement these in the plantations because our people do not have land. They have only a line room. They have, maybe, 10 - 20 feet behind the line room or in front of the line room, where they build a kitchen or a toilet and that is it. These agricultural workers who have the capacity and aptitude to grow plants and trees are unable to grow anything because they have no land. This is why to whoever we speak, whether we agree or not on many other things, we always tell that the people in the plantations are today looking up to receiving separate houses with a small land area. They also expect to be issued proper documents of ownership for the lands and houses that they would receive.

There are a large number of youth in the plantations who do not wish to work in estates because of the kind of slave labour, they believe, is prevalent in the estates. Their older parents or ancestors did not mind working in such circumstances, but today the children of plantation workers with some access to education are against or not willing to work in the estates as labourers, because they are treated in a mean manner. As such, what do they do? They move to the cities. They do temporary jobs. They work in hotels, in boutiques, and in houses. They do jobs that they would not do in front of their families. But, when they go back home, they dress well and go as if they are doing jobs in an office in Colombo. These

597 598

people are actually working in small boutiques, hotels and in other places. Unlike their parents, who had formal jobs with EPF and ETF, these young people are working on a temporary basis. They earn a few thousands and they spend it. They have no permanency. They have no EPF; they have no ETF. There is no social security for these people. So, these young people have to be encouraged to remain in their estate areas, but opportunities have to be provided for them to involve themselves in self-employment. Employment opportunities in estates are limited today. Further, the youth are not willing to take those jobs. The only thing they can do is to have self-employment. The Hon. Douglas Devananda, Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, who has the Industrial Development Board - IDB - under him, can do some work in relation to these areas, maybe with some additional funding from the Divi Neguma Programme.

Every estate has its own needs. Every person in the estate maybe needs bread, needs a tailor, needs a person to repair their three-wheelers, needs a welder, needs a carpenter, et cetera. Those are all needs of the people living in the estates. So, at least initially to provide with the needs of the people who live in estates, micro industries have to be started in estates where land is available. If the know-how can be provided by the IDB and the Divi Neguma Programme can provide the funding, this will be an ideal set-up for these youth to improve their living standards for the future.

The plantation youth are hardworking and they are willing to learn, but they lack education. Education in the estates is improving today. But, in the past, education in the estate school was of a lower standard. They are unable to compete on equal terms with the other youth who apply for jobs. Their lack of knowledge of Sinhala is also an inhibition. So, they are coming to the city and working in the informal sector doing mean jobs such as in tea boutiques, in small grocery shops and other places. But, if they can be provided with opportunities to manufacture something in their own area, to provide the services to their own people, then, that would be a very positive move.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only one minute left. You have to conclude your speech within one minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Estate Workers' Housing Co-operative Societies today have more than Rs. 2 billion in their accounts. These monies are managed and used by the estate management. The Manager of the estate is the Chairman

of the Co-operative Society and the Welfare Officer is the Secretary of that Society. So, these funds are managed by them. The Divi Neguma plans to have a bank of its own. Village societies or CBOs in villages can become members of this Divi Neguma Bank. The Estate Workers Housing Co-operative Society should also be incorporated into it so that the estate worker is also mainstreamed in this manner.

Sir, I wish to make only one more point. That is regarding private sector salaries. In the Budget Proposals, a minimum salary of Rs. 10,000 has been recommended to the private sector. In the private sector today, less than Rs. 10,000 is paid maybe, for a few office-type jobs. Even the people who work in boutiques or in hotels - who the Hon. Minister mentioned - are paid more than Rs. 15,000.

( ) (The Chairman) Thank you very much, Hon. Member. Can you conclude now?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will conclude, Sir. This Rs. 10,000 means, for 25 days work; Rs. 400 is paid per day. A plantation worker today is drawing Rs. 620 as salary per day including the incentive. So, to recommend a minimum salary of Rs. 400, is unfair by the plantation worker. If the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning wanted to suggest a wage increase for the private sector worker, it should have been a percentage of maybe 20 or 25 per cent - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, we are running out of time. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It should have been a percentage increase of maybe 20 or 25 per cent instead of fixing it at Rs.10,000.

Thank you.
