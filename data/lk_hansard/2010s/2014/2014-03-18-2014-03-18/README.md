[5.03 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam Chair, this is a very simple Resolution moved in this House but the Opposition is seeking to make a mountain out of a molehill. But, one redeeming feature is, nobody opposed this. The Resolution states, I quote:

This Parliament further resolves that the Chairman of the Human Rights Commission be paid an allowance corresponding to the current market price of 225 litres of petrol or diesel monthly in respect of the official vehicle allocated to him and that such allowances as were determined by this Resolution be substituted for the fuel allowances....

This is a simple Resolution, as I said before.

Anyway, there were a lot of other views expressed in this House. There was mudslinging, calling the Members of the Human Rights Commission, "puppets" - rookada. I feel very sorry about that. The Hon. Vijitha Herath who was at one time, the Minister of Cultural Affairs and National Heritage called these Members, "puppets" - rookada. What a sorry state of affairs! We wholeheartedly condemn that statement.

Madam, look at the members who were appointed very recently, on 18th February, 2014. These were the Members appointed by the Parliamentary Council, in accordance with the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, under Article 41A. The Commissions to which Members should be appointed are: the Election Commission, the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, the Finance Commission and the Delimitation Commission. In addition to these, the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court, the President and Judges of the Court of Appeal, the Members of the Judicial Service Commission, other than the Chairman, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration - Ombudsman - and the Secretary-General of Parliament, also should be appointed.

Madam, the Parliament and the country should note one matter. According to the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Members of the Parliamentary Council are: the Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition and a nominee of the Prime Minister, who shall be a Member of Parliament, and by virtue of this provision, I have been appointed to the Council. Then, there is another member to be appointed. That is, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition who shall be a Member of Parliament. It is very clearly stated in the Constitution that the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Speaker and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition must attend the Meetings of the Parliamentary Council. It has gone on record that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition or his nominee never attended the Meetings of the Council. The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, a Member who represents the Tamil community, went public and said that he did not attend meetings because the Leader of the Opposition did not want him to do so. So, that is a violation of the Constitution, I should say, because you cannot appoint anybody else according to the Constitution. Some people are blaming the Government saying that the commissions have not been appointed, whereas the Parliamentary Council, under the chairmanship of the Hon. Speaker of Parliament, has appointed all the members to the Commissions prescribed under Schedule I and II of Article 41A of the Constitution.

Then, look at the Members who have been appointed to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. Great people such as Judges, legal luminaries, people with great academic qualifications like Mrs. Jezima Ismail have been appointed. Justice Priyantha R.P. Perera has been appointed as the Chairman of the Commission. Before that, he has served as the Acting Commissioner of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and then enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court. He has served in the Attorney-Generals Department for a long time as a Crown Counsel, a Senior Crown Counsel and also as the Deputy Solicitor-General.

Madam, he has also served in many other capacities. He is a great legal luminary accepted by the whole country.

Then, the other Commissioner who has been appointed to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is Mrs. Jezima Ismail. She obtained her BA Degree from the University of Ceylon in 1955 and MA in Education from the University of McGill in 1966. Her MA thesis was Formal and Informal Education for Inter-Communal Harmony and Understanding. She has also obtained a Diploma in TEFL from the University of Sydney in 1972. Mrs. Jezima Ismail has 32 years of service in the teaching career. She was a former Principal of the Muslim Ladies' College, Colombo 4, which is a prestigious school. She was nominated as one of 500 influential Muslims in the world. Please note this point, and she has been elected as a Member of the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. Madam, I do not want to read their CVs. Therefore, I table* all these documents.

I think it should be included in Hansard, so that people will know the calibre of the people appointed, they are of the highest standards. They are not rookada. They are great people, enlightened people and educated people.

Then, Mr. T.E. Anandarajah, a former Inspector-General of Police, has been appointed as a Commissioner to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. He has served in so many capacities. He has served as an Assistant Superintendent, a Superintendent and a Senior Superintendent in Police Districts and Divisions in Elpitiya, Monaragala , Jaffna, Kelaniya, Colombo, Tangalle and Trincomalee.

In addition to police administration, Mr. T.E. Anandarajah has investigated into several hundreds of complaints against police, mostly complaints of human rights violations. He is a person who knows about the violation of human rights of people and who has heard these cases. Such a person is one of the Members who has been appointed. Therefore, it is very indignant to call them rookada, because they have contributed their mite largely to the community and to the country.

The other person who has been appointed as a Commissioner to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is Dr. Bernard de Zoysa. He has obtained the degree of MBBS from the University of Ceylon in 1961. He has also obtained FCGP in Sri Lanka. He started his career as a District Medical Officer and served several government hospitals in the country. He established a clinic and nursing home at Nugegoda in 1981 and served as its Chairman and Managing Director. Dr. Zoysa also serves as a Senior Consultant Family Physician. He has held various positions in several organizations. He was the President and Treasurer of Independent Medical Practitioners' Association. What more do you want? He was also a former Member of the Public Service Commission.

Then, with regard to the violation of human rights, now what has happened? This must be made very clear. This must be told to the country and also to the international community. A National Plan of Action Committee was appointed to implement the Recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.

Madam, I table* the document titled "Taking Forward the National Plan of Action to Implement the

Recommendations of the Lessons Learnt & Reconciliation Commission".

This document states, "May 2009 - end of terrorism in Sri Lanka. May 2010 - Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission appointed". From 2009 to 2010, within one year the Commission was appointed, whereas in other countries they have taken 10 to 15 years to appoint commissions of this nature but those commission reports have not been still released. In November 2011, the LLRC completed its Report and it was tabled in the Parliament of Sri Lanka in December 2011. It was given to us and we came to know of the recommendations. In May 2012, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed the Secretary to the President to monitor the implementation of the LLRC Recommendations.

Madam, it must be recorded that we, in Parliament, should appreciate the services rendered by the Secretary to the President, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga. He is a public officer of repute who is internationally known. He has contributed largely for the success of the implementation process. In July 2012, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the National Plan of Action to implement 91 Recommendations of the LLRC. By July 2013, the Government has quickly and speedily taken action. Please note this. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the addition of 53 recommendations to the National Plan of Action - NPoA.

Then, Madam, the National Plan of Action contains a total 144 recommendations. They are the International Humanitarian Law Issues -7 Recommendations; Human Rights - 54 Recommendations; Land Return & Resettlement - 24 recommendations; Restitution/ Compensatory Relief - 9 recommendations; Reconciliation - 50 recommendations. Recommendations are individually or collectively implemented by 26 line ministries.

The whole Cabinet and all the Ministries are involved in implementing these proposals. This National Plan of Action further states, I quote:

IHL and HR Issues - Progress

Commission of Inquiry to investigate alleged abductions or disappearances of persons resident in the North and East.

Census on deaths/injuries to persons or property damages due to conflicts since 1982.

Inter-Ministerial Working Group continues to verify cases on alleged disappearances submitted by WGEID. Since Jan, 2012 GoSL has transmitted responses on 842 cases to the Working Group.

Then, it goes on to state, I quote:

"Army Courts of Inquiry into (a) allegations with regard to civilian casualties;

547 548

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

That is progress.

......(b) allegation of summary executions of captured persons.

Collaboration between GoSL and ICRC on matters relating to alleged disappearances.

Investigation into deaths of 05 students in Trincomalee

Non-Summary Inquiry commenced in Sept, 2013. Evidence of 14 witnesses concluded. Next date of inquiry on March 06, 2014.

Investigation into deaths of Aid workers of ACF in Muttur

Team of prosecutors reviewing material available. Criminal Investigation Department is conducting further investigations.

Access to information on detainees and facilitating NoKs to locate their family members.

Collaboration between GoSL and ICRC on matters relating to remaining 188 detainees, including spot visits.

Rehabilitation of Ex-Combatants

All 594 LTTE Child Combatants have been rehabilitated and reunited with their families within one year.

Not only that, those people who were rehabilitated - the grown up girls and boys - were given in marriage. I think even the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa attended so many such wedding ceremonies held in the North, the arrangements of which were made by the Government. Again, the National Plan of Action further states, I quote:

11,872 ex-combatants have been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. Only 171 remain in rehabilitation following legal proceedings.

Sir, we had a programme called " ". Under that, those ex-combatants had been brought from the North by train and taken to the Southern Province. These are all people who took up arms, who were misled - the Tigers. Those youth have been rehabilitated now. This is the good work that is being carried out by the Government of Sri Lanka under the able guidance and leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Then, the National Plan of Action further states, I quote:

Access to secondary, tertiary education and vocational and skills training provided.

Land Issues - Progress

Special Circular issued by the Land Commissioner General to facilitate resolution of land issues in North and East.

Land release - 20,001 acres of private land and 5,740 acres of state land in the North and East formerly used by the military have been

released.

High Security Zones which prevailed during the conflict period no longer exist.

Note that, "no longer exist".

Military cantonments remain in place to ensure national security in identified locations.

Appointment of 4th Land Commission

(Previous Land Commissions in 1926,1935 and 1985)

Then, the National Plan of Action talks about Restoration of Civil Administration. Now, let us look at that. There is peace in the North because the President has won the war and we democratically held an election in the Northern Province. People voted at that election and Mr. Vigneswaran, former justice, was democratically elected as the Chief Minister. Now, he writes to Geneva. He has been given power to administer the North. All the powers have been given; there is no interference whatsoever. The Government is spending billions of rupees for the development of the North. Roads, highways, hospitals, schools, tertiary schools and grand stadiums for people to play cricket are being built. One matter must be told to the LTTE diaspora: the children whom you misled are now travelling to Colombo in order to play cricket. That is the peaceful atmosphere those children, the students and everybody are enjoying. It is a fantastic scene to see boys and girls cycling to schools in the morning as they did long ago in the Jaffna Peninsula.

Then, under Restoration of Civil Administration, the National Plan of Action states, I quote:

Military presence in the Northern Province:

Substantial reduction in the area occupied by the security forces.

Number of security barricades, road blocks and checkpoints in the North and East reduced by 99%.

Madam, I table* this National Plan of Action along with all the maps, which give security forces deployment, and a chart giving a comparison of the reduction of army strengths from 2008 to 2013.

Lastly, that Plan of Action states under Institutional Strengthening - Progress, I quote:

"Elections to the Northern Provincial Council."

That, I have already mentioned. Mr. Vigneswaran, the Chief Minister, has no right to write to Geneva. What is

549 550

[ ... ]

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

2014 18

Geneva? Geneva is not your master; the people in the Northern Province who voted for you are your masters. Now, Mr. Vigneswaran is asking for justice or a commission to be appointed in order to inquire into the human rights violation by the forces, whereas there are also the widows and orphans of the members of the armed forces. Those members of the armed forces were killed during the operations. What about their human rights? Who is going to ask for those? We are asking for those. The Plan of Action further states, I quote:

"Separate Ministry for law and order

Strengthening of the Official Languages Commission"

I think the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara is doing a wonderful job of work. He is going to have a big seminar and they have given us a note today to study, to bring about reconciliation through education imparted both in Sinhala and Tamil.

The Plan of Action then states, I quote:

"Fully functional Courts in many parts of the Northern Province with the exclusive use of the Tamil language"

I repeat, "Fully functional Courts in many parts of the Northern Province within the exclusive use of the Tamil language". In those days, what did the LTTE do? How can the TNA forget about that? They had kangaroo courts; they had summary dismissals or execution of people. They had kangaroo courts on their own and people who wanted to travel to those areas had to pay taxes.

Then, human rights were denied to the Muslims of the Eastern Province. In Kattankudi, people who were praying were shot and mercilessly butchered. Also, in Aranthalawa, young bhikkus - samaneras - were butchered. About 240 small children like flowers, who were travelling to schools, were taken forcibly at Kebithigollewa and cut into pieces. You are aware of that. What about the human rights of those children and their parents? They are crying. .

Then, the Plan of Action continues to state, I quote:

"Establishment of Court houses in areas where the judicial system had been at a standstill"

There was no judicial system whatsoever in the Jaffna Peninsula for 30 years when the Tigers unleashed their terror. But now, this democratically-elected Government has established courthouses in the areas, where the judicial system had been at a standstill.

Madam, not only that. Now, look at this e-mail dated 18th March, 2014 sent to Mr. Ajantha Gunasekara by Mr. Chandima Wickramasinghe, Senior Assistant Secretary to the President, which states, I quote:

"The Northern Province has recorded a Provincial GDP (PDGP) growth rate of 23.6 per cent in 2013 contributing 4.3 per cent to the National Economy up from 3.7 per cent in 2011 while the Eastern Province registered the second growth of 26.6 per cent in the PGDP with an increase in its GDP share to 6.9 in 2013 from 5.8 per cent in 2011.

Unemployment rates have declined significantly in the Northern ....in the post-conflict phase."

Now, a lot of people, about 100,000 graduates from the Northern Province and Tamil-speaking graduates,Tamils, Muslims and even Sinhalese, from the Eastern Province have been given employment under the "Mahinda Chintana".

Madam, the e-mail further goes on to state, I quote:

"This is illustrated by the fact that the unemployment rate in the Northern Province has declined from 6.1 per cent to 5.2 per cent, and in the Eastern Province from 15.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent in the period 2005-2012........ Food ratios for Northern and Eastern Provinces have declined from 59 per cent to 44.8 per cent and 57 per cent to 55 per cent respectively."

This is the position.

Then, see what happened the day before yesterday. An OIC, a very young police officer dedicated and committed to serve the country; to see that law and order is properly maintained in the Colombo District, lost his life. 2014.03.17 '' : "OIC

* 451

*

* 1500 ... "

? Who did this? This Chief Inspector, Prasad Siriwardena, has been promoted posthumously to the rank of Superintendent of Police. We salute the Inspector-General of Police for that gesture - for promoting him posthumously . His young wife and the children are crying. What about their human rights?

What about the human rights of Alfred Duraiappah and Neelan Tiruchelvam, two great leaders of the Tamil community? What about the human rights of Lalith Athulath Mudali and R. Premadasa? What about the human rights of Rajiv Gandhi of India? Who will look into the violation of their human rights? That is why I moved a Motion in this House calling upon the Government to appoint a commission or a committee of inquiry to go into the violations of human rights committed by the LTTE and certain misguided Tamils there.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, now wind up please.

551 552

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Madam. This Government has united everybody and meted out justice to all alike. We, particularly the President, wants to see that justice is meted out to all the people in the country, whether they are from the South, North, East, West or from the Centre.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

[5.24 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Madam for giving me this opportunity. Let me start by saying that we support and totally accept that this increase should take place. We have no problem at all. It is not only 225 litres but even if a bowser is given, it does not matter as long as the human rights are safeguarded in this country. It is a sorry state of affairs. What is Rs. 40,000 when we have hundreds of people who died over the last couple of months? Where is the justification? Where is the redress for these people? That is the question.

We have got an ideal opportunity now because today the buzzword spoken all over is "human rights". We can reflect on some of the past activities by the present administration and see how we can ensure that such things do not happen, so that the image of Sri Lanka does not get tarnished in Geneva at the forthcoming election.

Madam Presiding Member, all I want to basically state is that, if the independent commissions that were established long ago were ensured independence, the issue would have been solved. There would not have been an issue to fight about if a true sense of independence prevailed. Today, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption is under the President, the Human Rights Commission is under the President, every single State entity has become politicized. People have lost confidence in the system. So, it is the politicization process, the lack of confidence and the erosion of confidence that has led to this belief.

At this particular moment, the lack of independence of the Independent Police Commission is one of the biggest drawbacks. Just before I came here, at the High Posts Committee we had Major-General Mallawarachchi, the Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Order, who was questioned. In his own opinion, there were certain

drawbacks that had taken place and the erosion of confidence has led to the violence that is prevalent today. The belief is that the police are in a more of a Godfather-type of operation and this has led to the commotion that is going on. I will not labour very much on the independent commissions because this is spoken about day in and day out. They are brazenly being intruded into by the Government simply for their existence, and to ensure that all their past and present sins are swept under the carpet. If these commissions are independent, many of the problems that are prevalent today will not be there.

Look at the situation in Geneva. The very reason why Geneva has become such a hotbed is because the Government has not been able to fulfil its own promises; not because of anything else. I am not a great expert in the area of human rights. But, I have a common sense that displays that if the implementation of the provisions of the Constitution takes place in a proper manner, none of these problems would exist. Since the end of the war to date, we have had a peaceful environment for five years. But, have the peace dividends gone down to the people? In 2009, it was nobody else but the External Affairs Minister, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, who said that we would take certain measures to buttress the erosion of confidence and ensure that a new culture is brought in. This promise was solemnly given by the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe and the relevant people to Geneva in 2009. Since then, the international community has been looking at the statement of the Government. This is not a frivolous statement made by a Minister. The Minister uttered this on behalf of the country, which is our motherland. Owing to the fact that there has been non-implementation, this key issue on human rights is being taken up in Geneva today.

Likewise, who is the person who responded to the Indian Prime Minister and said on five instances, we will ensure - now that the war is over - that human rights are improved and also the Thirteen Plus considered, so that the people get the benefit that they deserve, the devolution that they deserve. But, it was retracted. Likewise, who engaged with the UN Commission at that particular moment? The Darusman Report had an interaction on the Government. These are the faults that have taken place in the system and now they cannot retract themselves out of it.

Now, I am informed that yesterday, the External Affairs Minister informed the Government Members that the situation is not all that healthy. We, the Members of the Opposition, do not like that situation because this is our country, this is not only the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys country. Therefore, it is the bounden duty of the Government to disclose as to where they have gone off the mark. They were cocky just about three or four months ago, said that out of the 47 members they will

553 554

2014 18

have an astounding victory. Today they are lagging behind where they think that 26 members will vote against, 13 members will vote for and the rest will abstain. It behoves on the Government to explain the mismanagement that has taken place. You have an External Affairs Minister who is more out of the country than in the country. His job is visiting countries. So, he must be able to extract the reciprocity required for the country.

Madam Chairperson, at this particular moment, all I want to say is that we have done mistakes and owing to the sense of arrogance and ignorance, today we are leading ourselves into further problems. The ramifications have still not been felt by the Government. Only now, you see some sparks flying off and suddenly Geneva is becoming a lethal weapon. Four or five months ago, they were talking of an electric chair.

, . . . . , . .

. 1989 ? ? . , . , ? , . , .

I was talking about the independent commissions and human rights. So, now that the promises have been made, the Government must ensure that they are fulfilled; if not, this type of problems will be there.

Let me highlight the financial benefits that would have been accrued to the country if our human rights had been in proper order. For example, take the Labour GSP. This was something which I strove for. When I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs from 2001 to 2004, we laboured, we toiled and we managed to get the Labour GSP for our country and that Labour GSP brought a duty advantage of 11.5 per cent to the country. This was spoken of by the the Joint Apparel Association Forum - JAAF, all the Chambers in the country and the fisheries institutions; they said that they got a benefit of about US Dollars 1.2 billion owing to the reduction of taxes. In todays context, that would have been about US Dollars 1.6 billion which is 220 billion rupees.

22,000 . Labour GSP , 22,000 . . 8 . 22,000 . . 2010 . , . , . , - 11, 1/2 duty rebate - 22,000 , ? . . . .

, . , . , -

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , 15 ? , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) LLRC . The LLRC was the best way to overcome the problem because it was an internal investigation done by the Government. The Cabinet basically endorsed the LLRC Report and ensured that it would be implemented to the letter. But, today what has happened is, they are unable to fulfil the promises that they made.

555 556

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

The LLRC Report is clear-cut and acceptable. We, as the Opposition, also paid a lot of respect to it and hoped that the Government would be able to find faults through that internal investigation and do certain things because during aberration of peace, an aberration of human rights could take place in certain areas. But, today, the gross ignorance of trying to cover up all that has led to disbelief and the Government has opened its doors and windows for international scrutiny. There is no necessity for any external intrusion into a local affair. But, what has happened today? Owing to the promises that have been uttered by a senseless and directionless Government, we have basically got to pay the price. So, we, as the Opposition Members and countrymen, would also like to see the Government making a responsible statement in this regard.

What is the statement that the Government gives on the Crimea problem? This is an ideal situation for the Minister of External Affairs and the Government to come forward and display their external policy. Something that has basically not happened in our country or any country, should not happen in another country. The situation in Crimea is like the Indian Army coming to Jaffna and getting everybody to have a vote saying that they have got to get involved to support India, and then India saying that Sri Lankas Northern part has to be with the Indian Government. So, the Government must come forward and spell out their policies. This is the ideal opportunity for that. You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds and mismanage the situation at this particular moment.

Look at the benefits that you could basically get by implementing the Constitution as it is. The Constitution that has been displayed has its faults but the very aspect of acceptance of the international community has its benefits. From 2001 to 2004, there was the Ceasefire Agreement that was signed. With this Agreement, there were certain resultant flaws and the ramifications were, the loans given at half per cent concessionary rates for the last 13 years were grants, not loans. Today, the reason why the Government has been able to spend billions of rupees on the construction of roads and bridges in the Eastern Province and the Jaffna area is simply because the United National Party signed the Ceasefire Agreement and the peace dividends come in through the loans given at low rates to the country. But, today has the Government been able to achieve any such grants though

there is no war in this country? No. That is why I call upon the Government to ensure that these mechanisms are put in place. You must have a Minister of External Affairs who is able to tell, This is the way. We must take advantage of the foreign situation with a domestic interest in mind. But, what we have done is, we are basically closing off the situation.

You are fighting with India on one side and basically annoying America on the other. The European Union that was giving all the benefits to us has unnecessarily been made enemies. Japan, which has been giving billions of rupees to us has been isolated by saying, You are not giving the funds required at the time we want. Then, you go after commercial loans and today, you have led yourselves into a debt trap.

Now, human rights is a key factor. Whether we like or not, we must remember that little Sri Lanka is inside the world.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Madam. On that particular basis, we must realize that our international policy has to be in line with the domestic interest at heart. So, human rights plays a pivotal role in that particular context.
