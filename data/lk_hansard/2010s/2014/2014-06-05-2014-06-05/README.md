What are the functions of the Sri Lanka Customs? Preventive directorate is the main law enforcement arm of the Sri Lanka Customs having surveillance over the Port of Colombo, other seaports, Bandaranaike International Airport, Free Trade Zones, Export Processing Zones, examination yards, inland clearance depots, water fronts and the territorial waters, waterways and all other operational areas of Customs. Of course, we have to add Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port as well into this group.

Then, the major functions of the Sri Lanka Customs are:

1. Prevent all smuggling, commercial frauds and drug offences.

2. Receive information, detection of fraud, seizure of

395 396

uncustomed goods, conduct investigations and inquiries and prosecution of cases.

3. Ensure the collection of due State revenue.

4. Safeguard socio economy, cultural and ecological/ environmental interest of the nation and enforcement of laws and regulations in this area.

5. Surveillance of seaport of Colombo, other seaports, Bandaranaike International Airport.

6. Control of vessels movement and border operations.

7. Disposal of goods forfeited by all the branches of Sri Lanka Customs.

In the rich history of the Sri Lanka Customs, we have had Sub Preventive Offices around the country, not only in the Southern part, but also in the Northern and the Eastern areas of the country. But, due to the civil war that prevailed in the country for almost 30 years, the activities of Sub Preventive Offices in the Jaffna Peninsula and the Sub Preventive Office at Mannar were suspended. But, after the civil war ended, the Department has taken measures to reopen a Sub Preventive Office at Jaffna. After the reopening of the Jaffna Sub Preventive Office, we were able to conduct investigations and inquiries into many smuggling activities between Sri Lanka and South India.

, , . . [5.59 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today we are speaking about the laws brought to this House to give effect to the Proposals made in the last Budget. In the last Budget, the Government stated that they would be simplifying the Customs Duties and facilitating a simple way of imports for production and trade. Item No. 6 titled, Customs Import Duty, of the Taxation Proposals of the Budget Speech 2014 states, I quote:

A four band tariff structure presently in place is further consolidated aligned with simplicity to facilitate production and trade

They also gave us the four bands which are as follows: Essential inputs, not manufactured locally - 0 per cent Customs Duty and 3,376 items are covered under this; Raw materials and semi raw materials - 7.5 per cent Customs Duty; Intermediate goods - 15 per cent Customs Duty and End user products - 25 per cent Customs Duty.

When you read this, it looks so simple and structured and it would be welcome and accepted by any world trade organization, as a policy of a liberalized trading economy. In 1977, Sri Lanka was the first to introduce the liberalized trading economy. But, over the years, after 1999, several other levies have been introduced and the so-called liberalized trading regime has been destroyed. We always say that Customs Duties have been reduced and also tell the international community, the World Trade Organization and the IMF that we have a very low tax regime for income. But, we have shifted all taxes to indirect forms of taxes, which burden not only the rich but even the poor in this country. This is the issue. This is the policy of the Government which we feel is harming the ordinary man, and he is today waking up to rebel against this Government.

Other than Customs Duty, what are the other taxes you impose? On exports, there is duty; that is a small amount, just about Rs. 30 million; then, you have Value Added Tax on imports, which brings in Rs. 108 million; Nation Building Tax brings in Rs. 15 million; Port and Airport Development Levy brings in another Rs. 65

million; Cess Levy on Import and Cess Levy on Export brings in Rs. 29 million, and Special Commodity Levy, which keeps changing every other month, affecting the day-to-day living conditions of the people because that is levied on food items and day-to-day utilities of the people, which brings in Rs. 14 million.

Then, you have the Excise Duty which is imposed on local and imported products. Excise duty is imposed on vehicles, alcohol, and on cigarettes and this brings in Rs. 128 billion. So, all these levies which are about 85 per cent of the total taxes collected by this Government are other than Customs levies, though we speak today about Customs revenue. So, why is all this being done? The Government is doing all this because they have expanded their expenditure so much and to meet the expenditure, they need more revenue. So, they are squeezing the common man through indirect levies and by raising these funds. How is this being spent?

If we think about the government in India, they have said, less government and better governance. The Prime Minister of India has got over 300 seats in the 543-Member Lok Sabha. To rule 1,200 million people, they have only 46 Ministers whereas in Sri Lanka with just 20 million people which is one-sixtieth of Indias population, we have two-and- a-half times, that is 107 Ministers. This is the difficulty. So, to keep that going, they have to impose more and more taxes on people and burden them so that the Government could be run with more government and no governance where even law and order, the most vital issue that a government should control, is going haywire. People who run around with guns are not even questioned; people who just shoot down people go scot-free; people who attack tourists, kill them, and rape women are still outside. They can remain free for three years before international pressure could come in and then they could be brought to book. So, we have to think of the realities. In addition to running this Government with 107 Ministers, the Government is also becoming very exorbitant. It is spending monies on the so-called prestige projects, which cannot generate enough revenue to pay the loans or to pay even the interest component of the loans that have been raised. They call it development. But, is it development or is it diversion of the ordinary mans money into so-called prestige projects because they do bring back certain gains to those who proposed these projects? If you are spending Rs. 100 million, you are getting a personal benefit. Is it not because of that that you are spending millions, not in rupees, but in dollars on these projects?

There are three projects that have arisen or have shown out as misspent monies. They are: the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port and the Norachcholai Coal Power Plant. We accept that we have to move into thermal power using coal because that is the cheapest form of electricity generation. But, at the same time, it has effects on the environment. Taking a balanced view -

maybe we sacrificed part of the environment for the purpose of cheap energy and went for coal power plants. Fine, if a decision has been made - [Interruption.] No, it is even worse then, because when we went to Norachcholai, they said that the base power production is coal because it costs only Rs. 8 or Rs. 8 plus. They also said that they are using coal because it is cheaper than using other fossil fuels, because we have exhausted our hydraulic power sources -[Interruption.] That is a dream. We will wait and see. We have to talk about the realities. In that case, you should have waited for gas to come in the next three years without starting these coal power plants and then you would have had a power cut. Then, it would have made it easier for us to cut power to your Government and bring us back to Government, because in 2001, when you all had the power-cuts, you all were thrown out of Government. -[Interruption.] That is right. We made it up. Within six months, we removed the power-cuts that you had imposed and now you are continuing with that policy of giving 100 per cent power for 24 hours of the day. So, you did fail. We corrected it and gave it back to you. Now, you are okay. But, if you bring back power-cuts, you will lose your power. That, you must remember.

Hon. Minister, you say that you would have waited for gas. But, your Government did not wait for gas, they went for a coal power plant. You proposed a Chinese coal power plant in Norachcholai to be coming in three phases. Phase I, you started four years ago in 2011. When you started production, it failed on several occasions. How did it fail? It failed because the condenser was not technically withstanding the power generation. So, when it failed on several occasions, you should have checked as to why this particular condenser is breaking down. In Phase I, if you used a particular condenser and found it faulty, when you buy the next two generators for Phase II and III, you have to think whether you should buy the same thing or buy something different. But, what did you do? You went and bought the same thing for Phase II and III. We do not know how soon it is going to collapse. Once that happens, what is going to happen to this investment? So, there has been some reason for you to choose the same machine for Phase II and III also. So, we can see behind the screen what has taken place, for you to buy the same condenser for Phase II and III.

Thank you.
