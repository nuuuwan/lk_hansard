( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am raising this point of Order under Standing Order No. 20. On the 21st of November, 2013, the Budget Speech was read out by the President of the country as Minister of Finance and Planning. There were certain matters proposed in that particular Budget. I want to know whether those have been legislated because any tax has to be effected before the 1st of April, 2014. At the moment, the Order Paper does not show anything of that sort to be brought up before the end of this Session and the next Parliamentary Session starts on the 8th of April. Therefore, I, as an accountant and an MP, who had brought in certain legislations on behalf of the country, would like to know -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You cannot raise that matter under Standing Order No. 20.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am raising it - correct me if I am wrong - under Public Business, under which I think all Business of the House is basically executed. So, I do not see any work being done -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I am sorry, I cannot allow this matter to taken up under Standing Order No. 20.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am referring to a matter of great importance. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You can take it up at the Party Leaders Meeting. We can come to a decision on that at the Party Leaders Meeting.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Kumara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the matter I raised under Public Business is of national importance because the tax year starts on the 1st of April. So, if you do not have it done before that, your Budget Proposals will be invalid and ultra vires. So, we, as a responsible Opposition, have brought that to your attention.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, I know, Hon. Member, but as per the prevailing Standing Orders, I cannot allow you to raise it at this moment. You can take it up at the Party Leaders Meeting and then come to a decision.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition says that I have the right to bring that matter up as it is of national importance at the moment. It has to be done before the 1st of April.

. We have been agreeing to whatever request the Opposition has made. The Opposition does not want to have this Debate soon after the defeat they are going to face on the 29th of this month. I can understand the reality; that is the fact. You do not want it soon after the defeat.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , . . . . , . . . . . . . . , - we will agree to two days in May to take this up. There is no problem.

? ? . . , , ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My Hon. Friend gets very perturbed when questions are asked as to what went on at the Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business. I want him to recollect his memory on what happened on the 6th of March when we discussed this. We all - the Hon. John Amaratunga, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and myself - asked for a two-day Debate. At that time what you said was that you are unable to give it. The normal customary procedure is, when a Vote of No-Confidence is brought in, it has to be the first Item on the Order Paper. But, that did not take

place. Then, at that particular moment, we opposed and said, "if you do not give two days this week, please ensure that we get two days next week". Now, they have arbitrarily put this in and are asking us to respond to that. So, we rejected it on the basis that we get two full days. Next year they will say, "Out of 52 Sitting days, we will give you three full days and the rest is closed".

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It needs to be corrected. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Leader of the Opposition has answered and clarified the matter. Thank you very much.
