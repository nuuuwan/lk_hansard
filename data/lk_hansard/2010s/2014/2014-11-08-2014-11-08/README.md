Member should not make this type of comment in the House. - [Interruption.] He is commenting on the personal conduct of a Member of Parliament. There were so many instances we have observed when Members of Parliament had fallen asleep. So, what is this? You are wasting your time.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The Cost of Living Allowance of Rs. 2,200 will be added to Rs.7,800 that is already being paid, so that the amount will be increased to Rs. 10,000. The interim allowance will be given immediately and all these allowances that have been promised in the Budget will be paid from 1st of July, 2015. So, there is no confusion.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Hon. Minister, my question is regarding the pensioners.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The Cost of Living Allowance of Rs. 2,200 will not be given to the pensioners. It will be given only to the Public servants who are in service.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Will the Public servants be getting that Rs. 2,200 from January, 2015?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) That will be effective from 1st of January, 2015, but the payment might be made from the 1st of July, 2015. In lieu of the increases that have been announced in the Budget, as an interim payment, the pensioners will be getting Rs. 2,500 and the Public servants will be getting Rs. 3,000.

833 834

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Thank you.

2,500 , 3,000 , 2,500 . . . , . paysheets 3,000 . -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) The Budget is still under discussion. You have to vote for it and get it passed. Once it is passed only, it will become effective. Until then, nobody can take action on it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Unfortunately, Government officers cannot get the salary increase of Rs. 3,000 from this month because paysheets have already been prepared. - [Interruption.] That is okay, I understand that. But, the problem is, they cannot get the interim allowance of Rs. 3,000 for this month. They can get it only next month with the arrears. That is a separate matter, Hon. Minister, but I state this for your information.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Yes, Sir. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) With regard to recruitments in the Provincial Council of the Eastern Province, I hope they will consider what you said in this House. This matter does not directly come under us although I am the Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs. You were querying as to whether the interim allowance of Rs. 3,000 for Public

Servants would be included in the salary for the month of November. Yes, that will be included; the interim allowance of Rs. 3,000 will be paid from the month of November itself along with the salary. Instructions have already been given to this effect.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I think you are aware that we held a separate examination for officers of the Administrative Service. Thereby, we were able to recruit 42 officers. That was also in order to fill up the vacancies which have been there owing to the lack of officers to work in Tamil.

Also, there was a suggestion to lower the standard or the marks and recruit more officers to the Public Service as Administrative Assistants. But, that was not approved by the Cabinet for the reason that that might result in lowering the quality of the officers who are recruited for the Public Service. So, because of that, we did not want to lower the standard or the marks and then recruit people. But, in view of the fact that there is an enhancement in the educational standard of the area, I think we would be able to recruit the required number.

Then, certain submissions were made regarding the delimitation of certain AGA Divisions and also regarding certain other requirements like the district boundary between Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. Those matters will receive our attention. I should say that there is a Delimitation Report that had been prepared by the National Delimitation Commission, which functioned for about two years. They had visited various areas, listened to various representations made by interested, knowledgeable people and Public Servants and after that, they had prepared a Report. Now, we have handed over that Report to His Excellency the President. The President, in fact, appointed a committee of three members to go into that Report. Once they finalize it, I believe, we would be able to implement it. I am sure the deficiencies that were highlighted in regard to the areas in Kilinochchi and the Northern Province have also been considered in that Report. So, I believe that once His Excellency the President approves it, we might be able to implement it.

, that the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran also made similar representations. She also said that there are certain officers who have been appointed from the Sinhalese community and that it is not conducive. But, I should say that the policy of the Government is to appoint these officers irrespective of their community or nationality. There are Sinhalese officers who have been appointed to the North and Tamil officers who have been appointed to the South.

I should say that recently I had the opportunity of meeting all the Divisional Secretaries of the Northern Province. Those people are very keen to come to the South and work. They say, "We must mix up. We must learn the culture, the language and the system of work that prevails in the South. So, we are prepared to come to the South. I think that is the policy which should be followed. It may be that we have certain teething problems at the beginning. Those problems, I hope, we can solve as time goes on.

behalf of Sri Lanka and get Sri Lankas voice heard at the Geneva meetings that were going on. But what happened? Before long, he was sacked and brought back to Colombo.

Likewise, you had the High Commissioner, Dr. Chris Nonis, appointed completely from the private sector, an able person who proved, over the passage of time, that he was able to withstand the external pressures that came about on to him. Unfortunately, the more successful they become, the quicker is their exit from the Ministry of External Affairs. Although there is a Minister, there is a Deputy Minister who is sometimes more able than the Minister himself. He is more often the acting Minister rather than the Deputy Minister. As a result, you have a Member of Parliament appointed to look after the External Affairs. His job is basically to probe into all the affairs in that and if the ambassadors do not work well, even to slap them to get them out. So, that is the type of hilarious attitude that exists. - [Interruption.] Do you want to know? Then, you will get up and say that I am naming the person. His seat is just about a couple of yards away from you but he is not there at the moment. These are the type of people who are ruining not only the diplomacy that is existing even in a faint manner but also the entire trust that was placed on the diplomatic service. These types of heinous crimes are going unchecked. As a matter of fact, before too long, you will find a report being tabled by the Minister of External Affairs revealing -I am not trying to be humorous- that the High Commissioner Chris Nonis slapped himself. This is the type of things that are going on there.

Therefore, we would like to ask the Hon. Deputy Minister, who is an able young man, who is able to stand in the shoes of the External Affairs Minister who is more overseas than in the shores here, whether he is able to say what you all have done. As a matter of fact, even you, Hon Deputy Minister, should be able to explain to us as to what has gone on in the case of the High Commissioner Chris Nonis. People are stony silent. Your Ministers get worried even at the mention of the name of Nonis because there is a very pivotal point revolving around the Executive. These are the MPs who are basically trying to ruin the good name of Sri Lanka.

Hon. Deputy Minister, I would greatly appreciate if you will tell us as to how you are going to depoliticize the Foreign Service. Bring in the professionalism that was there during the days of Mr. Romesh Jayasinghe and Ambassadors like Mr. T.D.S.A. Dissanayake. At this particular moment, I want a very careful answer from you.

Hon. Deputy Minister, my question to you on behalf of the United National Party is, "How are you going to reduce the number of political appointments?" Make political appointments but appoint the very best like Dayan Jayatilleka and Chris Nonis and maintain the 80 :

POLITICIZATION OF MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [6.29 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I appreciate the opportunity given to me to move this Adjournment Motion. I move,

"Why has the Ministry of External Affairs been so politicized, breaking all FR and AR, allocating funds whimsically to Embassies for projects, thus devaluing efficacy of this very important Ministry.

I propose that immediate steps be taken to remedy these deficiencies in the Ministry".

Sir, the most important thing that is visible is the politicization of the Ministry External Affairs. After all, it is the Ministry of External Affairs that plays a very important role in reflecting the Sri Lankan policies that are internally generated for external use. It should be basically pushed by the Ministry of External Affairs. But, we find now that there is high politicization in this Ministry.

If I may recall, and it was answered in Parliament a couple of days ago, that 73 per cent of the diplomatic appointments are politicized. We are not apposed to political appointments. There have been some excellent appointments that have been made. But, the problem is that they are a minute fraction of the politicization process.

A classic example is Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka. He certainly was superlative in doing what he had to do.

When there was a strong diplomatic pressure on Sri Lanka, he was able to withstand that pressure, fight on

20 ratio or even 65 : 35. Now, do not try to say that during the time of the UNP also, there were about 70 per cent political appointments and 30 per cent diplomatic appointments. Yes, but it should be 70 per cent career diplomats and 30 per cent political appointments. So, get it corrected.

Next, Sir, is the role that the Ministry of External Affairs is expected to play. The Ministry of External Affairs is expected to execute and perform the role that is internally required to safeguard the country from the external forces that are there. It has always got to be a win-win process. After all, the most important thing is that there is no confrontational diplomacy, where you are "friends to all and enemies to none". But, you all are pursuing a policy of "enemies to all and friends to none". That is the problem. You are basically maintaining a diplomatic process with the most alien people who do not assist in the external policies that are required for Sri Lanka. A classic case is India, one of our best friends, who is always there at a time of need. But, what do you do? You have a confrontational approach to India. If you look at what happened during the last couple of months or the last couple of years, you have been stealthily lying to the Indian Government. Even if there have been business processes with India, you basically have the most difficult process creating problems with India.

Look at the Chinese invasion. You are making a Chinese Port here; you have Chinese submarines coming in here. But, when India is just a couple of miles away from here, you all are unable to respond to the questions raised. If I am not wrong, according to what I read in the newspapers, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, who is really on fire, getting India moving from all corners is basically asking, Sri Lanka, what are you doing? You have a close friend such as us to help at any given moment. Why are you having such things there?. But, the Government of Sri Lanka has been stony silent on this. Be open! What have you done? You opened the Chinese Port. These are coming even without your knowledge and when India, our closest friend, asks "What is on?", you all are very silent on these issues.

Then, with regard to the responses that you have given, whether it is the normal process of diplomacy, even if it is a LLRC process, activities in Geneva, or the real process that is being pursued for requirement of certain aid, trade or whatever, you all have not been basically upfront with India. Now they are building houses. You get their money and then tell them, "We will decide on whom to give". The properties of innocent people in the North and the East have been vandalized for 30 years during the war and now they are breathing a sigh of relief. Even then, it is politicized through the Rajapaksa regime. So, Hon. Deputy Minister, I would like to have an answer for this. We want to know as to how you are going

to depoliticize this. If India, as a friend in need, is giving us funding, ensure that a depoliticized process is carried out so that the people's suffering is reduced and the political compulsion to give this on a political basis is reduced.

Hon. Deputy Minister, I would also like to ask as to what role has been played by Sri Lanka regarding the lifting of the proscription on the LTTE by the European Union? There was a big hue and cry that there was no legal representation by the Government when the European Court of Justice gave the order against the business of Sri Lanka. We want the proscription to remain until they are found fault with. But, what has the diplomatic mission done? You have an Embassy there to look after the interests of Sri Lanka, and not the interests of certain MPs who just go there on holiday. The Mission is there to reflect the diplomacy that is required of Sri Lanka. So, tell me who the lawyers were, who appeared for the Government of Sri Lanka under the instructions of the Embassy in Geneva to ensure that the proscription goes on? From what we read in the newspapers and after speaking to the ambassadors of the European Union, we are appalled to learn the lack of professionalism that has been displayed there. Nobody has come forward.

There was a very vague, nebulous statement made by the Minister of External Affairs to say that it was not the intention of the Government to come forward and it was only to help the outsiders and the people who were interested. Who else is more interested than the Sri Lankan Government to look after interests of Sri Lanka? If you are not able to go directly, at least ensure that the people who have migrated there step in and help the Sri Lankans who are having dual passports there. So, these are vague and nebulous statements, which have an ulterior motive. Is it because you are having KP here without handing him over to India? That is another example where we have an anti-Indian policy. KP is wanted by India but you all are not giving him. As a result of the decision made by the European Union Court, the monies that have been basically held back will be released and KP will get it. Are those going to be used for your consumption? That is the question that is being posed by many people who know what is really going on behind the scenes.

So, Hon. Deputy Minister, I would greatly appreciate if you could give honest, truthful answers to Parliament, to the questions that we are asking. There are three or four months to appeal against that court decision. Have you, even at this particular moment, appealed against the lifting of the LTTE proscription? If you are unable and incompetent, please tell us. We are willing to come forward as the Opposition. The Bar Association came forward and said, If you all are unable to respond, we will do so. We will represent the Government. Even that, I do not see happening.

The Labour GSP was lost because you all did not intercede with the relevant people. There was an easy access to that. They were making life so much easy for you all; they were trying to accommodate you all in order to ensure that the Labour GSP remained. But, you all just said, No need. You had arrogant people. The Governor of the Central Bank said, We do not need this. The 11.5 per cent tax advantage that was there for Sri Lanka is not necessary. We are rich enough. So, we had lost out Rs. 182 billion in the year 2012 and almost Rs. 195 billion in the year 2013!

Hon. Deputy Minister, why is the Ministry of External Affairs so incompetent? Why is it so politicized? Why are you all having a person who just does not know what diplomacy is, running the Ministry of External Affairs? These are questions that are being asked by the general public and sometimes, they even blaggard us, the Opposition, asking why we do not put pressure on the Government. So, here we are, asking you as to what is going on.

Therefore, Sir, what we would basically like to know is, as the Sri Lankan Government, how -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, are you going to take the full 15 minutes allotted to your side or does the Seconder of the Motion want to speak?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, Sir, he will only second the Motion. So, I will take the full time. How many minutes more are available, Sir?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have three more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Sir. So, on that particular issue, I would like to get a truthful answer from the Government once again to ensure us that it is going in the correct way.

Then, against Channel 4, there was no legal action. When it was brought up, we told the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, the Minister at that time, and subsequently, to the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Come forward. If you are unable to do so as the Government, tell us. We will, as the Opposition, go forward and ask why Sri Lanka's name is being tainted. But, nothing was done. Then, when it came up in Geneva, you gave vague, nebulous answers and skimpy excuses once again, which only helped us to

lose the vote on the Resolution against Sri Lanka. We lost simply because you all were not prepared, you all were not willing to take the truth out to the world.

So, Hon. Deputy Minister, all we want at this particular moment is for you to ensure that this confrontational system of diplomacy is changed to a more friendly, more professional approach, as is expected. - [Interruption.] If you are unable to do so, it would be in a situation like what the economy has fallen into today. The economy is absolutely in tatters. Before too long, in any case, your Government will be thrown out of power. If there would be a Presidential Election, the President would change and you would have a Government led by the United National Party. Then, we would ensure that such things are corrected and put into proper order. So, all we want at this particular moment is to stop the politicization process and for you to table Dr. P.B. Jayasunderas document on this particular reconstruction of our High Commission in Geneva costing Rs. 17 million, which was given to some person known to be an LTTE sympathizer and which was repeatedly confirmed by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa in this House. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs clearly mentioned in this House that he is not involved in that and the legal department -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Azwer, he is going to wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have only a couple of minutes available.

Sir, I am telling with all responsibility that the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa mentioned in this House - yes, after checking with the Ministry of External Affairs - that it had been given to an LTTE sympathizer and as a result, what the Government had been dabbling in with such

1017 1018

people. So, there was a report on that; Ms. Tamara Kunanayakam referred this matter to Dr. P.B. Jayasundera through the Ministry of External Affairs and copy of that report is with us. I would like you to officially table that document in Parliament so that it would be there for the public to probe and through that, we would be able to say what action needs to be taken against the people who had given this contract to an LTTE sympathizer.

This is what is expected of the Ministry of External Affairs: ensure that you have a legal representation before the Court of Justice of the European Union so that the LTTE proscription remains and that Sri Lanka's good name is protected. Do not outsource our embassy activities. In America, you have given such activities to three companies. Patton Boggs is one of them. In India, you have outsourced; in the United Kingdom, you have done that. So, if you outsource your activities, why do you need ambassadors? Why do you need the Ministry of External Affairs? - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, please give me one more minute. - [Interruption.] Sir, people like jackasses on your right are the ones who will ruin the country. - [Interruption.] So, do not listen to this type of people.

All what we want is to ensure that this country is put on a proper footing. If you are unable to, if you are incompetent, please leave that to us. We, the Opposition, will come into Government and ensure that we discharge our responsibilities. - [Interruption.]

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Then, the Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam to second the Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Karuppaiah Velayudam) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I take pleasure in seconding the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

[6.45 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the accusation levelled by this Adjournment Motion is, "Why has the Ministry of External Affairs been so politicized"? I do not accept this at all. Before going into detail, I would like to give the clarifications in point form. This accusation is not accepted and I would like to show the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake that the Government is following the "Mahinda Chintana", the vision of the President. He gave his vision in 2005 when he was first elected as President and again in 2010, when he was elected for the second time, he spelt out our non-aligned policy, which we are following and that is very clear.

Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, I have to mention these because we are still in Sri Lanka. In 1978, there were only 34 Missions representing Sri Lanka and in 1994, 41 Missions, which was an increase of only seven Missions during those 17 years. We had recruited 57 officers for the whole 17 years. Then, from 1994 to 2014, the Missions have increased to 67 from the earlier 41. Thereby, we have increased Missions by 26 and had recruited 60 officials within seven years from 1994 to 2007 through a proper Foreign Service Exam.

I do not want to go into detail as to how the officials of the Foreign Service were recruited after the exams, how they were interviewed and recruited after the interviews up to 1994. But, I can tell you that from 1978 to 1994, there were 83 non-Sri Lanka Foreign Service - SLFS - Ambassadors who served this country. Below the category of Ambassadors, there were 78 to serve in the 41 Missions. So, you can imagine how politicized it was. Obviously, politicization was to implement the vision or the mission of the Presidents at that time. Probably, you know what the late Hon. A.C.S. Hameed was called, whether he was in Sri Lanka at all and how the then Deputy Minister functioned. All that is immaterial. But, I would like to mention that there were altogether 161 officials in 41 Missions up to 1994.

Now, we have Ambassadors such as Mr. Gamini Rajapakse, Mr. H.R. Piyasiri, Mr. Pradip Jayawardene serving and we also had the late Mr. Asitha Perera. - [Interruption.] These are people who have been there as Ambassadors. Just because they are there, we cannot say - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. H.R. Piyasiri is from the UNP. What do you know?

1019 1020

2014 08

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I am just saying that these are capable people who are still serving in the Foreign Service as Ambassadors.

From 1992 to 1994, the Deputy Leader of the UNP, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, himself was also an ambassador; again, an act of politicization. He led 17 Members and crossed over to this Government.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) And, went back. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) You know what best he is now doing to his Party. Then, there were Ambassadors like Mr. Daham Wimalasena, ex-MPs like Mr. B. Sirisena Cooray, Mr. Don Edwin Tillekeratne, Mr. P.B.G. Kalugalla, Mr. S.W. Alawatuwala and Mr. C. Rajadurai. These are some of the famous names which I like to mention. During the present UNP Leaders time, there were Ambassadors like Mr. Mangala Moonesinghe, Mr. A.R. Munsoor, Mr. U.B. Wijekoon, Mr. Rupa Karunatilleke, an uncle of the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka; Mr. Ariya B. Rekawa and the former beauty queen, the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake. They did a very good job, I do not disagree with that at all. But, this is how the Foreign Service had been politicized earlier. We never disagreed with their appointments. They all went through the Parliamentary procedure; appeared before the Committee on High Posts and were examined. Even the ambassadors who are now serving abroad have appeared before the Committee on High Posts and were examined. We do not send anybody who does not get through that Committee. If there are any issues against them we deal with those.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, what about Mr. Lakshman Hulugalle? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is not an ambassador. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes, he is not an ambassador.

Therefore, at the outset, the Government categorically denies the allegations contained in the Motion that the Ministry of External Affairs breaks all ARs and FRs when allocating funds to embassies and projects. If I am to mention about funding, from 2005, we had been allocated Rs. 4.4 billion and we spent only Rs. 4.2 billion. Last year, because of the CHOGM, we had been allocated

Rs. 10 billion and we spent below that like earlier. We did not exceed the amount allocated to our Ministry.

Also, I wish to remind the Hon. Member, that the power of appointments of the Heads of Mission of Sri Lanka is the sole prerogative of the President of Sri Lanka as per Article 33 (c) of the Constitution. It had been so before also, done in the same manner. In this context it should be borne in mind that every appointee of Heads of Missions should earn the personal confidence of the appointing authority, that is the President of the Republic, which is reflected in the Letter of Credence that they carry to the Heads of the State of the receiving State. Notwithstanding this provision, a salutary practice that is in place enables the Parliament, through the Committee on High Posts in which there is a significant representation of the Opposition Members, to exercise a vetting role on the nominees of the President.

Therefore, if the Opposition has any issue regarding the appointment of ambassadors, they should raise it at the Committee on High Posts which has the power to block any objectionable appointment. To date, no nominee has been rejected by the Committee.

Sri Lanka, currently has 67 Missions and Posts abroad including High Commissions, Embassies, Permanent Missions to the UN in New York and Geneva, Consulates-General and Consulates. Of the 67 Missions and Posts, not less than 12 Missions have been opened by the present Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa since 2006. However, there has been no corresponding increase in the cadre strength in the Sri Lanka Foreign Service to staff these Missions.

This is not to say that the Ministry has not taken action to recruit officers to the Sri Lanka Foreign Service since 2006. In fact, it is only during the administration of President Rajapaksa that an Open Competitive Examination has been held regularly to recruit officers to Grade III of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service. We have appointed nearly 60 from 2006 to date through exams. Even this year we have conducted exams and we hope to increase the number through a proper system without politicization.

Ten officers in 2007, 11 officers in 2009, 14 officers in 2012 and 25 officers in 2013 were recruited, totalling 60 officers, in the last 7 years, whereas as I mentioned earlier, during the 17-year period 1977- 1994, only 57 officers had been recruited. This year too, an open competitive examination was conducted by the Department of Examinations to recruit another batch of officers to the Foreign Service. Appointment of officers will be made by the Public Service Commission based on the results of the written examination and the marks secured at the interview by the candidates.

One has also to bear in mind that although vacancies do exist in the cadre if the Foreign Service, it is neither judicious nor feasible to fill all such vacancies in one go.

1021 1022

From the management point of view, it is not desirable to do so, as this would impede the regular intake of officers in the foreseeable future due to vacancies created by officers leaving the Service on retirement or for other reasons.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I have asked you to table P.B. Jayasundera's Report. Are you reading from that or -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I have to give you facts, my dear Hon. Member because if I do not give you facts -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have asked you to table P.B. Jayasunderas Report. Please table that Report as well.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I do not have P.B. Jayasunderas Report. But, I am telling you, these are the facts. I must say that our officials are functioning very competently and following our Presidents - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why are you protecting the LTTE sympathizers? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Why are you trying to deprive a Tamil person of his right to win a contract by calling him an LTTE sympathizer, when he is not convicted? - [Interruption.] You cannot call an ordinary person an LTTE sympathizer. -[Interruption.] Any Tamil person should be able to win a contract and do any work in this country or abroad. -[Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, please do not disturb him. Hon. Deputy Minister, you have only four minutes left.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, I do not want to waste my time. - [Interruption.] I do not want to deprive people of their

rights the way the United National Party is telling, just because they are Tamils. We do not deprive anybody of their rights based on their race.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Are you telling so because elections are around the corner? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) No way. - [Interruption.] Definitely not. - [Interruption.] Regarding the allegations - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, please allow the Hon. Deputy Minister to wind up. Hon. Deputy Minister, you have one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Regarding the allegations that the Ministry is violating FRs and ARs, I would like to state with utmost responsibility and quite categorically that the Ministry of External Affairs adheres to all Government rules and regulations, including Financial Regulations and the Establishments Code. The Ministry accounts are not only subject to audit by the Internal Audit Division of the Ministry, but of all Missions abroad. Regular audit inspections of Missions abroad are carried out by the Audit-Generals Department, whose reports are presented to the Committee on Public Accounts.

Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you can raise this issue at the Committee on Public Accounts. You should raise issues pertaining to accounts at that forum and not waste the valuable time of this House by bringing up issues related to accounts here.

Thank you very much.
