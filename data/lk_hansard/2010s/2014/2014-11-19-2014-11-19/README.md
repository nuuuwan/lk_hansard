( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. You have 20 minutes. [12.14 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Chairman, I am pleased to contribute to this Discussion and make some comments, particularly on the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration.

We know that this country has been divided on many matters and one important matter on which it has been divided is the issue of language. We have, to some extent after a long history of disunity, been able to correct that position constitutionally by recognizing both the Sinhala and the Tamil languages as National Languages. I think that is something laudable this Assembly has done over a

2679 2680

period of time. During the colonial period, because of the acceptance of the English Language, the Sinhala-speaking people were terribly disadvantaged. After Independence or in the post-Independent era, with the adoption of the Sinhala Only language policy, the Tamil people were terribly disadvantaged. We went from one mistake made by our colonial masters to making another by our national leaders at that time, as a result of which this country has been kept divided in many ways. We have now constitutionally corrected that position. But, on the ground, there is little visible evidence of an improvement. Even if we check a small thing like the name board of a CTB bus, which carries the name of the route it plys on, sometimes we find that it is not given in all three languages, complying with the Official Languages policy. Even when we go to police stations to make complaints, the Tamil-speaking people, particularly, cannot lodge their complaints in the Tamil Language for want of Tamil-speaking officers in our police stations.

I go to the Thimbirigasyaya Divisional Secretariat for District Development Committee Meetings and those are conducted completely in the Sinhala Language. There is an assumption that everybody needs to understand the Sinhala Language, but I think we have a Constitutional duty to provide the Tamil-speaking people, who are in considerable numbers in the City of Colombo, the privilege of being catered to in their mother tongue. Parliament is a good example of equality, where any Member of Parliament could listen to whatever that is being said in any language he or she wishes to. Therefore, even in the conduct of meetings of the Government, we should provide simultaneous interpretation in the Tamil Language.

To collect its revenue from all the citizens, whether it be from telephones, mobile phones or electricity bills, the Government has found a way to communicate with them. Our electricity bill comes to us in English, Sinhala, and Tamil. When it comes to collection of revenue, we treat everybody equally, but when it comes to exercising the rights of the citizens, the Government fails in its duty to fulfil the obligations it has under the Constitution and through the Official Languages policy. So, what is it down to? It is down to a lack of political will to implement this. It is the political will that is needed to fully implement the National Languages policy.

There are 19 Recommendations in the LLRC Report pertaining to National Languages, to Social Integration and to Reconciliation. There are 19 different, separate and distinct Recommendations in the LLRC Report. Out of those 19, we find that there is poor progress on 53 per cent, and it has been recognized as something that needs to be dealt with, but there is poor progress. There is 16 per cent on which there is no progress and there is about 31 per cent with partial progress.

If I were to give you an example, we see that as of January 2014, - the statistics have not been updated -

there were 2,326 Tamil-speaking officers in the Police Service. Out of the many thousands and thousands, as a percentage it is still a very small fraction. We know that the Government in 2014 recruited 150 Tamil-speaking police officers. That is a right step and a progressive step that was announced. We know that out of 408 police stations, only 157 have a Tamil-speaking ability, which is less than one-third. The police stations must have this ability. The police station is a place where you have access to the executive in seeing that your rights are safeguarded. I know that there have been dominant Tamil-speaking areas in which police stations have not had a Tamil-speaking ability. There were as much as nine at the beginning of the year and I must state that there has been some improvement in that. But, I would like the Hon. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration to address this problem, particularly in Thandikulam in the Vavuniya District, Sampur in Trincomalee District and Bogawantalawa in the Nuwara Eliya District, to ensure that there is a Tamil-speaking ability within the police station, so that the needs of the citizens could be met in the language of requirement.

I would have been really pleased if the Hon. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration was in the House because I have a question to pose to him. The Constitution provides for the singing of the National Anthem both in Sinhala and Tamil Languages. But, we observe that even to date, the National Anthem of this country is not being sung in the Tamil Language at Government functions or even at national events. I want to know if the Hon. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration supports this view of his Government. If he does not support this view, I want to know what he is doing to fully implement the Constitution of the country where the Tamil-speaking people will be able to, with pride, sing our National Anthem in Tamil. One verse in our National Anthem states, I quote: " "

It speaks about all of us being the children of one mother. What is nationality after all? Today, you get a sperm from Europe, you get an egg from Africa, you rent a womb in Asia and a child is born. I would like to know what the nationality of that child is. Is that child a European? Is that child an African? Is that child an Asian or is that child a Sinhalese or a Tamil? Science has advanced and we call that child a test tube baby. Nationality is created by our environment and our National Anthem is absolutely right when it says that we are the children of one mother. That is why I would like to know from the Hon. Minister why this Government is not implementing the policy on the National Anthem, so that every Sri Lankan can sing the National Anthem with great pride and with great emotion because this is the land of our birth. Mother Lanka is the land of our birth and everybody must be able to stand up and with pride sing our National Anthem. Why are we depriving part of our citizens in doing that?

2681 2682

South Africa, after a long history of fighting white rule and apartheid; when Nelson Mandela walked out of the prison that day, he said I have forgiven my captors for we are one people; when the new South African National Anthem was adopted, it was adopted in a manner that it could be sung in the four main languages of South Africa every time it is sung so that the Zulu people could sing it in the other languages and others of those languages could sing it in Zulu.

What a day it will be when the Sinhala people are able to sing one verse of the National Anthem in the Tamil Language and the Tamil people are able to sing one verse of the National Anthem in the Sinhala Language. That is the Sri Lanka that we want to build. We want to build a united Sri Lanka. That is why the United National Party was born. It was born so that every section of this country could march forward under one banner as Sri Lankans so that the world we have to gain, we will gain as Sri Lankans; that everybody born to this soil belongs to this soil. That was the vision of the founding father of this country, the Hon. D.S. Senanayake, when he brought all the different communities of this country together, and the name of our Party was proposed by a Tamil-speaking gentleman and seconded by a Muslim gentleman. That is the heritage that the United National Party has. That is the Sri Lanka that we want to continue to build in the future.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, the Recommendation 9.257 of the LLRC Report states that public universities must have ethnically-mixed populations and have access to courses in all three languages. Now, I am glad that the Hon. Minister of Higher Education is also in the Chamber. I know that it is practically not possible for us to provide every course in all three languages. It is not a practical possibility. But, today with the advancement of Information and Communications Technology, and because we are discussing in this House, Information and Communications Technology as well, it is now possible that these courses are all available to people in the language of their request. It is possible to do so through simultaneous translation even though every course cannot be in all three languages. So, I would draw your attention to this because these are all little steps in building a common, strong edifice; in building a common, strong, one country.

Recommendation 9.241 of the LLRC Report talks about having action plans at local level, divisional level and community level and having targets, and those targets to be monitored by the citizens of the country. Now, these things in the LLRC Report have really not been done. I am a citizen. I do not know these action plans. I do not know these targets and therefore as citizens, we cannot monitor these targets. So, I ask again that rather than making blanket statements in this House, that the LLRC Reports Recommendations be followed and implemented by the Government, -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Does the House agree to give a few minutes to the Hon. Member to conclude his speech?

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman. I will wind up in four minutes. Therefore, it is important that the citizens of this country receive the opportunity of both knowing the goals and also being able to monitor, particularly, on national languages, on social integration and on reconciliation.

Sir, my final point is this. As I look at the year that passed, I look at this year not so much in terms of the country being more socially integrated; I look at this year with some measure of sadness, for the Muslim community of this country, in one way or the other, was made to feel second-class citizens in their own country. It created a cleavage that did not exist for the last 100 years. This cleavage did not exist for the last 100 years. It is really with sadness that we looked at the incidents in Aluthgama and Beruwala; something that should have never happened. But, it happened. The Governments inability to resolve the economic and material needs of the population gives rise to such cleavages and it helps people to create enmities; enimities that thrive. The UNP completely rejects what happened in Aluthgama and in Beruwala. Muslims were attacked, not just their homes and mosques but even their businesses. There was a build-up to it in the previous year when Muslim businesses, even in the commercial capital of the country, were being targeted. This is very unfortunate. I, myself, went down to Aluthgama and Beruwala within a few hours of this incident and I was shocked to see what had happened. On the YouTube, you can see what had happened there. One of the things that you will see is, as the perpetrators were going around destroying the community there, the security forces were basically turning a blind eye at that situation. The perpetrators have still not been brought to justice. This is the problem that we face. The perpetrators are protected by high officials in this Government.

In April this year, I, along with my fellow Members of Parliament, went to see the port in Magampura and also the airport in Mattala. We were confronted by a pistol-wielding individual, whom I first thought was some kind of a hired assassin. After a while, once we had fled the scene, we discovered that he was the Mayor of Hambantota. Perpetrators are not brought to justice; they do not answer. Therefore, we are building a culture of impunity. The perpetrators in Beruwala and Aluthgama must be brought to justice. I know that the SLFP does not

2683 2684

support what happened in Beruwala and Aluthgama. I know that, because it is a historical party. What happened there is not the true face of the Sinhala people or the true face of Buddhism. The Sinhala people are compassionate and tolerant people. Therefore, we need to protect the true face of the Sinhala people and of Buddhism. We must bring the perpetrators to justice. Those who have a strong concern for truth must act and therefore, I call upon the Government to act, even at this stage, particularly to safeguard the rights of the Muslim community. Thank you very much.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Madam, I wish to speak a few words on the Votes of the Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development.

The EPF issue of the JEDB and the SLSPC was explained by the Hon. Minister. He said that they are going to harvest 20,000 trees and from that they are going to pay the EPF and the ETF. This has been told to us for the last two years, but nothing has happened. The Minister of Finance and Planning, His Excellency the President has referred to this matter in his Budget Speech. He has said, "Whoever who has to pay EPF or income tax can borrow at the rate of 6 per cent for a period of five years from the Government". I request the Hon. Minister of State Resources and Enterprise Development to take this loan, settle the EPF in the JEDB and the SLSPC and then when he harvests the timber, he could pay back the Government. By doing that, he will relieve thousands of workers who have already retired, but who have not got their gratuity payments. There are some workers who have died and, up to now, their gratuity payments or EPF and ETF have not been paid. So, there is a proposal already made by His Excellency the President. Why should the Hon. Minister of State Resources and Enterprise Development not make use of this proposal for settling the EPF and the ETF, so that even his directors will be safe from being prosecuted by courts and sometimes even being put into cells in the courts. So, this is a matter of urgency, which I request the Hon. Minister to attend to.

In addition, there is constantly an issue of late payment of salaries in the JEDB and the SLSPC. There has been a practice of salaries being paid on or before the 10th of every month. But, on many occasions this gets delayed. There is also a convention that whatever the Employers Federation of Ceylon accepts under the Collective Agreement, it will be followed by the SLSPC and the JEDB. This year, the Deepavali advance paid to the estate workers was Rs. 5,000 by the private companies. But, the JEDB and the SLSPC paid only Rs. 3,500. This is unfair because today the cost of everything has gone up. The people need to celebrate their festival. They are always suffering because in the JEDB and the SLSPC estates, work is given only for 12 to 15 days per month. They get half the salary that they are entitled to. Under the Collective Agreement, the workers are guaranteed 25 days of work. But, the JEDB and the SLSPC estates provide only 12 to 15 days of work. Under these circumstances, their day-to-day life is affected. So, at least during a festival, they should get their full advance, so that they can celebrate it.

I am glad to speak after the Hon. Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, but unfortunately he is leaving the Chamber. He talked about equal amount of funds being allocated to all the religions and said that about Rs. 90 million has been allocated for Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs. During the Select Committee discussions, I did not raise it but the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam, who is on your side, raised it and asked the amount of money given to the Estate Hindu Temples. An official said that they have 100 temples at the rate of Rs. 100,000.

This adds up only to Rs. 10 million. Maybe, they would have spent twice that amount in the North and the East. I hear from the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs that last year they got only Rs. 10 million as Capital Expenditure and this year they have got Rs. 30 million. You can show the world that you are treating all religions equally. But, when you release funds, if you are going to be fair, you must release those to all the religions in an equal manner.

The Hon. Prabha Ganesan is present here. Once, he made a proposal to rename a street in Wellawatte as, "Tamil Sangam Veethi, but this Government did not allow him to do so. He is a Deputy Minister in the Government now. It is now called, Sangam Veethi. What Sangam?

( ) (The Hon. Prabha Ganesan) There is no street called, Sangam Veethi. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Why is there only Sangam? That does not mean anything. You proposed that name in good faith. You did

2767 2768

it in good faith. - [Interruption.] Because the Tamil Sangam is located on that street, you thought that it fit to rename that street as, Tamil Sangam Veethi. But, what happened? Due to the pressure from the Sinhala Government, you think that until they have a "Sinhala Sangam" and a "Sinhala Sangam Road", you should not ask for a "Tamil Sangam Road". This is an unfair compromise made under pressure. People like you, who serve in this Government, just forget that you also have rights in this country and you succumb to pressure, which is unfortunate and unacceptable.

Then, whenever I refer to the promise made by the President in Trincomalee to send poor people on Haj pilgrimage, the Hon. Azwer gives the impression that all of them are going to get. Now, we are on the subject of religious affairs. - [Interruption.] Okay. So, like giving funds for people to go on Hajj - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please do not disturb me. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) , ? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, he is distorting what His Excellency the President has said.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, no. - [Interruption.] It is not true. - [Interruption.] It is a fact.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is not a point of Order, Hon. Azwer. .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Madam Chair, that is not a point of Order. -[Interruption.] Okay, forget that. Whether it was true or false, we will leave it.- [Interruption.] Right. - [Interruption.] That is what I am coming to, Hon. Azwer. He said that in Trincomalee to mislead the Muslim people.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Not at all.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Why does he not say the same thing to the Hindu people? Every year in January, there are people who go to Sabarimalai in India. There are many Ministers here who go to the Thirupathy Temple. So, why do you not promote the Hindus also to go on pilgrimage to India by giving those poor people who want to go to Sabarimalai every year with some free tickets or provide special flights by Mihin Air to Trivandrum? Why do you not do that?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) For what? People who have money will go. If you do not know -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You do not know that.- [Interruption.] You sit down. , . ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Like that, there are Christians who go to the Holy Land.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) So, what is wrong? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Give them also an opportunity to go there. Help the poor Christians and Catholics also to go on pilgrimage to their places of worship.

So, do not make these promises at public meetings just to hoodwink people. The Hon. Minister for National Languages and Social Integration is a person who is normally in the House, but it is unfortunate that on the day that his Ministry is being discussed, he is not here.

In 2004, during the UNP regime, there was a proposal to have people with a knowledge of both Sinhala and Tamil and Sinhala languages at the front desk in every Public office, to assist a person who does not know Sinhala, because the Public Service does not have enough Tamil people to work with. So, the person in the front

2769 2770

[ . ]

2014 19

desk was to receive the application or the request of the citizen who comes to that Public office, take him into the office, and assist him to deal with the Government officials in that office, so that the hindrance caused by a less number of Tamil officers being available in Public offices, is addressed.

Then, when the UNP Government was dissolved, that proposal dropped off. But, in 2005, the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was good enough to accept that proposal and appointed communication facilitators. This was done in all areas in the upcountry where the Indian origin people live. The original proposal sent to the Cabinet was for 2,500 persons to be appointed. The Cabinet accepted the proposal to appoint 2,500 persons, who knew both Tamil and Sinhala languages to serve at the front desk in every Public office like Police Stations, Divisional Secretariats, Labour Offices and places where the public has to deal with the Government. But, the Cabinet also said that it cannot all be done at once; that they would appoint 500 in 2006 and 500 each year for four other years making it 2,500. When the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake was the Minister for Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development, he made the first appointments. Though we thought all of them would be Tamils, there were Sinhalese who knew Tamil. Therefore, they appointed 187 Sinhalese and 313 Tamils to these positions. This was a very progressive move and in a lot of Public offices, people were able to obtain their services when they knew only Tamil though most officers in those offices knew only Sinhala.

Subsequently, there were appointments made to the teaching profession. And, over 200 of these Tamil facilitators left the service to become teachers which was considered a better profession. So, there were vacancies, and applications were called. Nearly, 9,000 applications were received. At that time, the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam who was the then Deputy Minister for Estate Infrastructure said, If I appoint 250 people, the other 9,000 who applied will get angry with me, so I will not make those appointments. So, those vacancies are still not filled. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister for National Languages and Social Integration to take up this issue, because it is more relevant to him, and get these 2,500 appointments again so that the Public Service, which should be available to any citizen in his own language is available to him, at least temporarily, through a front desk until we are able to match the population ratio to the Public Service in the future.

One more issue I wish to make here is that there is a Translators' Service, which comes under the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. All these officers in the Government Translators' Service are graduates. They are trained in translations. They know more than one language very competently and they have been absorbed into the Government Translators' Service. But, this Translators' Service is not receiving the full

attention of the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs because they have hundreds of thousands of staff. So, I believe that if this Translators' Service is brought under the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration, which is supposed to implement the national language provision in the Constitution, which is a right of the people, then it will be more effective. So, I request the Hon. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration to put up a Cabinet Paper, negotiate with the Government and bring in the Government Translators' Service under the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration, so that this function of translation will be more effective under this Ministry.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

, () , . Whereupon THE HON. (MRS.) SRIYANI WIJEWICKRAMA left the Chair, and THE HON. JANAKA BANDARA took the Chair. [5.47 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Sir, I would like to, during this Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget Debate, - as we consider the work of several Ministries which have been brought together - register appreciation of the work done by a few of these Ministries, but I must also express the hope that they will be able to do more in the future and be provided with the necessary funding for this purpose. It is a pity that we have so many Ministries that very many have to be considered in a job lot as it were, but I shall take advantage of this to suggest the coordination that might make the work of some of these Ministries more effective, whereas at the moment, they seem to be floundering in isolation and do not work together in a way that might make their impact more productive.

I would like to concentrate most on the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration, which has so important a role to play. I must commend the dedication of the Minister and the Secretary, and I would assume that he is delighted now that the work he has been doing has been recognized by the President, who has actually now given him the services of a Deputy Minister, who I hope he finds extremely useful in taking forward his work. I am also happy that the new Deputy Minister comes from the Central Province, because with regard to social integration, it is perhaps the Tamil community

2771 2772

there that needs the most effort to be deployed by the State.

I should note too that in that area it would be useful if the Government moved swiftly on an excellent idea that had been mooted by the Ministry of Education, namely the establishment of multilingual schools in all areas, so that children of different communities could study together. I believe this should be promoted in each division and such schools made centres of excellence, with children not only being able to go to the same school, but also being able to study in the same class. For this purpose, it would of course be necessary to ensure that English medium education was available in all these schools. But, this would not be a difficult matter if the Ministry of Education is more efficient and followed the example of the training programmes we set in place when English medium was first introduced way back in 200, when Dr. Tara de Mel was the Secretary of the Ministry and did so much innovative work.

In this regard, the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration should take the initiative. As the Member who spoke before me suggested that the Ministry has a big role to play and it is not doing enough to impose the vision of social integration that was and should be, which is an essential part of the Presidents vision. The Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration must encourage the Ministry of Education to move swiftly. In the past few months, the Minister has put forward several suggestions - admirable ones - to the Ministry of Education, but I am sorry that at yesterdays Consultative Committee Meeting, he granted that several months have already been wasted and then thought that we should waste just one month more, but we have no time to waste.

I think what he was doing was perhaps one of the best uses of the system of Consultative Committees we have, which are otherwise not very productive. I am pleased that finally the Hon. Speaker has decided to look at the Standing Orders of Parliament and has summoned a meeting of the Committee on Standing Orders, which he neglected to do for four years in a shocking display of contempt for Parliament that should not have come from the very top.

But, given the vast responsibilities of the larger Ministry of Education, it is the Ministry of National Languages that must push more effectively, and also develop programmes for the better delivery of language courses throughout the country. Setting in place Language Course Centres in very Division, using voluntary labour where possible but also providing facilities for paid classes, would be a step in the right direction.

Sir, as the speaker before me said, unless we give the facility to the people to work in the language they are

used to, the public service will not be effective. That is something that we suggested just an hour ago in the Committee on Public Enterprises when the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration was present because one of its functions is to provide a more effective and efficient service.

In particular in the North and East, and in the Central Province, such Centres could also prepare students for the teaching of languages. The great complaint of the Ministry of Education, when we ask why the teaching of second and third languages is so bad in rural schools, is that there is an absence of teachers. But, for 50 years they have failed to actually overcome that deficiency. In particular, the deficiency is true of primary teachers, but unfortunately the Ministry has not recognized that when there is no foundation, it is impossible for students to catch up given the way our syllabuses are constructed and the Ministry failed to take advantage of the innovation we introduced when I chaired the Academic Affairs Board of the National Committee of Education to suggest that every year language competency should reach a foundation without which teachers should not be allowed to teach higher levels since languages are a cumulative skill. Unfortunately, there has been no attempt to think outside the box to ensure the production of more language teachers. Here again, the Ministry of National Languages, which has a very dedicated staff, should take the lead in suggesting innovative solutions. I am sure that even if the Ministry does not receive funds for such activities through its own Budget, it can prepare project proposals that will receive ample funding for so laudable a purpose.

Another area in which the Ministry could do more for social integration is through collaboration with Ministries in charge of leisure activities. I believe much is being done now in the field of sports, and I hope the Ministry of Education takes seriously the commitment of His Excellency the President of ensuring that sports is made compulsory for all students. At present, this is a privilege enjoyed only in schools that are centres of excellence anyway, but this should be extended to all schools, especially those in rural areas.

Though I believe the Ministry of Sports is doing its best in this regard, the same is not true with regard to cultural activities, which should also be in place in all schools. I hope the Minister will ensure that the Ministry of Education makes cultural activities also compulsory. There must be programmes to encourage creativity and to bring students together, instead of the concentration on competition, which is largely about individuals which is how the Ministry works on cultural activities in schools now. Here again, the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration should work together with the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and the Ministry of Education to put in place programmes that ensure that our young people grow up with greater experience of our

2773 2774

[ ]

2014 19

common cultural heritage, and how it should bind us together.

In this regard, Sir, I should speak a few words on the work of the Ministry of National Heritage. Here again, I must commend the commitment of the Minister, whose pluralistic vision is remarkable. But, unfortunately his vision is not always fulfilled. I should note that there are problems in that, when what used to be a single Ministry was divided up, not enough thought was given to principles. It would make sense for the Ministry of National Heritage to be about the past and about how that can guide us to a peaceful and pluralistic future, while the Ministry of Cultural Affairs should be about the present, and should work on creative activity. Unfortunately, I believe there is no clarity about where the Museums and the Central Cultural Fund belong.

This is the more to be regretted because of the contribution these could make to social integration. I should draw attention in this respect to the Museum at Kataragama, which showcases how all communities and religions are associated, and I should commend the former Director, Prof. Sudharshan Seneviratne, for his excellent work in this regard. But it should be added that inspiration for that came from his Excellency the President, who was also in the forefront of ensuring that the Northern kovils were included when UNESCO patronage was sought for our archaeological heritage in that area.

But, without mechanisms to take that vision forward and because of the backward attitude of some officials, we are in danger of letting the North become the plaything of sectarian interests, in contrast to the framework His Excellency promoted some years back.

I hope, therefore, that the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration will take the lead in ensuring consultations in this regard, and the development of a programme to take things forward more effectively.

In congratulating the various Ministries on what has been achieved, I believe it is also necessary to request that more be done, with much greater coherence, so as to better fulfil the mandate that was conferred on this Ministry.

[6.08 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I have a duty to perform initially. When I was the Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, I appointed a Committee on Muslim Law, for the codification and modification of the Muslim Law. One person who helped me at that time was Mr. S.H.M. Mahroof, President's Counsel from Kandy. He has passed away and I express my condolences to his family.

The other person is Mr. U.L.M. Haldeen, who was my Assistant Director at the Ministry of Muslim Religious

and Cultural Affairs. He is the person who first suggested the creation of a Wakf House, which could house the Wakf Board, the Haj Committee, the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Board and all the other committees, which come under the purview of that Ministry. He has also passed away and I say "Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajioon".

Sir, I am very thankful at this moment to the Muslim Womens Research and Action Forum, which has published a well-documented book titled Women Claiming Rights and Spaces, Activism to Reform Muslim Personal Law in Sri Lanka. The whole Report of the Sahabdeen Committee has been published in that book. Since there is no time to read it out, Sir, I would table* that book so that the Hon. Members can make use of it.

However, I will quote the starting paragraph of that Report.

After deliberations in more than a hundred sittings spread over a period of 18 months and after studying carefully the vast variety of materials made available to it, the following recommendations for the amendment of the Waqf Act and the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act were made.

So, these are the progressive legislations that we brought in earlier and I think the Government must now pay its attention to the proper implementation of the provisions of that Report.

Sir, I would also like to draw attention to the appointment of Moulavi teachers to teach Islam and Arabic, not only in Muslim Schools, but even in Sinhala and Tamil Schools, where there is a substantial number of Muslim students. Sir, initially, I led a delegation comprising of Mrs. Jezima Ismail, my former Secretary S.H.M. Jameel and other educationists to meet His Excellency the President. Then, an interview was held and people were selected. Only 106 were initially appointed. There are more vacancies and I hope that the Ministry of Education would take a keen interest to appoint the others as well.

Then, Sir, I must turn to the .

He did a great service to the Muslim education in this country. He knew every Prime Minister and every Minister of Education very well. So, I have suggested the issue of a commemorative stamp on his behalf, which the Hon. Jeewan Kumaranatunga agreed, and I am certain that it will be done.

NVQ NVQ PROVISION OF NVQ AND DEGREE LEVEL COMPUTER EDUCATION AT NENASALA CENTRES [6.31 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Madam, I move,

"The first Nenasala was started by His Excellency the President in 2005. We were internationally acclaimed for taking information technology to the grassroots by establishing 900 Nenasala Centres in the plantation areas with a view to broadening rural information technology education. The thousandth Nenasala is scheduled to be opened by HE the President in December.

Information technology literacy in Sri Lanka has increased to 45 % this year. Sri Lanka was awarded the prestigious "Bill Gates Education" access award by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation at a selection from among 140 countries recognizing the success of the "e-Nansala" library programme.

The budgetary proposal of His Excellency the President for 2015 to allocate Rs.1,000 billion to establish fully-equipped Nenasala Centre in each Grama Niladhari Division in 2015 to connect the villages with the national endeavour of building a knowledge-based economy in 2020 is greatly appreciated.

Therefore, I move in this House that it is prudent to make arrangements to provide NVQ and degree level education to students receiving computer education through Nenasala Centres."

The Hon. (Mrs.) Malani Fonseka will second this Motion now, and thereafter, I will make my speech.
