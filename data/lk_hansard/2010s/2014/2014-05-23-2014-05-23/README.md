Hon. Deputy Speaker, there is another matter that I would like to bring to the notice of the House. On the 31st of May last year, the then Prime Minister of Thailand, Yingluck Shinawatra, addressed this House. The Leader of the House and I, both got up and thanked her.

According to what has happened recently, even after having won an election, not only has she been debarred from contesting, but the Government has been removed; a military government has come in and she has been detained in a military facility.

As a person whom this House has invited to come and address, we have all the right to ask that she be released. After all, her's is a family which has come to this country to ensure that the Upasampada Ceremony between Thailand and Sri Lanka is observed. She came last year in respect of that.

We can insist and we should insist that she be released and the interim government be put back, and free and fair elections be held. You cannot just let them come, take over governments and throw the others away. We are not for that and certainly, she as a person who came to this House and commanded the respect of both the Government and the Opposition. I would get up here and

say that we have all the right to demand that she be released and free and fair elections be held in Thailand.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I rise in this House today to express my deepest sorrow on behalf of

the Muslim community on a great figure who has left the world, leaving behind an indelible mark in the history of this legislature and the country.

I recall with nostalgic memory the Hon. Berty Premalal Dissanayakes services to the Muslim community in Rajarata including both Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. When the Mohideen Jumma Mosque was being built in the Anuradhapura town which was a modern building in the style of the great Cordoba architecture in Spain and Al-Medina-al-Munawwara in the Holy City of the Prophet, it was the Hon. Berty Premalal Dissanayake who gave all assistance. He was such a beneficial person. Even today the Chief Trustee of this Mosque, Alhaj M.S.M Fowsi who owns the Zam Zam Stores in the Anuradhapura town speaks so high of him. Also, Sir, he helped in the development of the Zahira College in Anuradhapura. There are several other Muslim schools in Kalawewa, Mihintale, Medawachchiya, Horawpatana and Kekirawa, which mostly benefited through his benevolence.

Rajarata has seen some of the greatest leaders of this country like the late Hon. Maithripala Senanayake. He had been acting as Prime Minister 19 times in this country. It is a record which cannot be broken so easily. Then, we had the late Hon. K.B. Ratnayake, who served as a distinguished Speaker of Parliament. These two gentlemen brought about a great revival to Rajarata. They both helped bridge the gaps between people of the North and the South. They both were educated in Jaffna and they spoke the Tamil language very fluently. Following their footsteps, the Hon. Berty Premalal Dissanayake also helped the Muslim and the Tamil communities. I know, Sir, he always carried in his memory the thoughts of the "Dutugamunu-Elara" battle. Though Dutugamunu fought a battle with Elara, Dutugamunu revered the memories of Ellalan or Elara. Likewise, the Hon. Berty Premalal Dissanayake also harped no ill-will with other communities; he never wanted to hurt other communities.

Sir, I have this book with me, " " by Thiruvalluvar, the greatest classical poet. Whenever we visited the Chief Minister's residence, his beloved wife, Mrs. Jayani Tissera Dissanayake entertained us with great hospitality. When I first met Duminda at his home, he was a tiny tot. Even today I call him "Putha" affectionately. This is what "Thirukkural" states about "" - :

"

."

" , ."

So, to what estimation should we pay tribute to the great qualities of hospitality of that great man, the Hon.

Berty Premalal Dissanayake? I must express my deep sense of gratitude to him because when I was the Minister of Muslim Affairs, we organized the National Meelad-un-Nabi celebration and earlier a programme for the 1400th year of the revelation of the Holy Quran and celebration Hijra in Anuradhapura, and he was very helpful to us in making those events a success. At that time, the late Hon. K.B. Ratnayake was the most senior politician but Mr. Berty Premalal Dissanayake was able to feed our people and help our people. He brought about great rejuvenation even in the lives of the Muslim community in Rajarata. Therefore, I would like to express in this august Assembly our deepest condolences on behalf of the Muslim community. He served in this House for 10 years and 01 month. He was a colourful figure. May he attain Nibbana!

Thank you. [.. 6.25] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Duminda Dissanayake - Minister of Education Services) , , , . 28 . , , .
