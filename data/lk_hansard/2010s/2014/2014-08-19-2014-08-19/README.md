QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO DISAPPEARANCES OF PERSONS

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, in answer to a Question asked by me under Standing Order No. 23 (2), the Hon. G.L. Peiris,

557 558

[ ]

2014 19

Minister of External Affairs stated that the Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Disappearances and Missing Persons had informed His Excellency the President that in view of the large numbers of representations that had been made to the Commission and the complex legal issues that have arisen as a result, it was necessary to seek legal advice from persons especially knowledgeable in this field.

I would like to ask the Government, firstly, what are these complex legal issues that have arisen and the relevant fields? I am sure the Commissioners would have written to His Excellency the President and informed him as to what the issues are, before the Panel was selected. Secondly, will those who have made representations to the Commission be informed of the complex legal issues and be given an opportunity to make representations regarding these issues?

According to the Answer given, the complex legal issues have come about as a result of the representations made to the Commission. Then, those who made the representations should also be able to address the Commission on these complex legal issues.

Thirdly, will the Attorney-General as the principal Legal Officer of the Government also be informed of these complex legal issues, and be given an opportunity to express his views regarding the issues that have allegedly arisen? That is the role of the Attorney-General.

Thank you.

Hon. Speaker, we have all agreed that one of the principal reasons for delay in civil cases is the complicated and detailed procedure that has to be followed particularly in cases like partition cases. I know many Members on both sides of the House, who, in several debates, have been alluding to the need for our Ministry to take some action regarding certain important changes to be brought into the Civil Procedure Code. That does not simply apply only to the partition cases, but generally in the field of civil procedure we felt it is time now that we introduce some reforms.

As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court, under the guidance of His Lordship the Chief Justice, has already taken some action on their own in introducing electronic filing, particularly as a pilot project when it comes to Fundamental Rights cases. The Hon. Member who appears very often in Fundamental Rights cases will certainly appreciate that. This procedure will be

introduced probably by next month or even before that. This is what I heard from His Lordship the Chief Justice that in the area of Fundamental Rights, the pilot project to allow petitioners to file their petitions and also to receive other documents by the court registry through electronic filing is to be introduced very shortly. Together with that, there is also another pilot project that is to be implemented in the Matara Civil Appellate High Court where the Civil Appellate High Court will also be introducing electronic filing as a pilot project, which has been supported by the Department of Information Technology of the University of Ruhuna and that too is to be shortly launched.

While these two pilot projects are going to introduce some substantial changes in the filing procedure, particularly resorting to electronic filing, what is more important is to have the necessary changes introduced in the substantive law itself, the Civil Procedure Code. Therefore, we have already prepared the draft Bill. The Hon. Ajith P. Perera has raised the issue relating to the delay in enacting this law several times in our Consultative Committee. As a matter of fact, this has already gone before the Cabinet Sub-Committee, after approval by the Cabinet. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Legislation will be summoned very shortly in order to consider the final draft that has been submitted by the Cabinet to the Sub-Committee, so that it will be vetted through that process and be brought back to the Cabinet and after that be gazetted, so that we can debate it shortly in the House. I hope I could try and introduce that at least before the Budget session this time, because this is a matter that has been pending ever since I took over this Ministry. This has been one of my principal projects, which I promised in two Budget Debates before the one which we will be taking up in November this year. So, I have very strictly told officials in my Ministry to somehow get this through the Cabinet Sub-Committee, so that we can have it enacted at least before the December vacation this year. Let us hope that we will have sufficient time before we adjourn the House for the Budget Debate, so that we can take it up and have it enacted.

Now, Sir, I would like to deal with some of the principal features of the amendments that we propose to introduce. When it comes to Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code we propose to repeal the existing Section and introduce a new Section where we will require the parties to include an electronic mail address to which service of any process, notice and any other relevant information may be served by a registered attorney. This is a paradigm change in our legal sphere because in keeping with the new technological advances and changes in this area, we are already too late when we consider the changes that are taking place in other jurisdictions elsewhere, even in the region and beyond the region. Therefore, this will be one of the features, but I will not go into too many details because of the time constraint.

567 568

Then, also, the most important area relates to the creation of a separate judicial office as a pre-trial judge. There is provision to be made.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please. . , [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you may continue.

( )

(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am glad that you are in the Chair at the time when we are discussing these few important changes that we propose to introduce to the Civil Procedure Code. You, yourself having been an active practitioner will appreciate the need for these changes which are very timely. As I stated, the new judicial office as a pre-trial judge will be in the hierarchy of our judicial service. The Judicial Service Commission, wherever it deems necessary, will nominate a judicial officer in respect of a judicial district as a pre-trial judge of a district court of that judicial district. He is empowered to take several steps in order to try and conclude matters, wherever necessary or wherever found appropriate, without going into trial. Here, the service process, as I told you, through electronic mail would be expedited. Then, there is also an entirely new chapter which will be introduced giving details of what the pre-trial would be and at the expiration of time allowed for filing of the defendants answer, where a replication is permitted on the last year of the time allowed for filing of that replication, and the court shall set a date not earlier than three weeks and not exceeding two months from such date for pre-trial hearing to be commenced. Several details are given there. We would then also make it compulsory that within three months from the commencement of such hearing, unless the pre-trial judge is prevented from doing so for reasons to be recorded by him, no adjournment in excess of four weeks may be granted except in exceptional circumstances; that he will be expected to conclude the hearing within three months from the commencement of the pre-trial hearings.

There several steps involved in this: ascertaining jurisdictional issues and elucidating matters in dispute; enabling the parties to amend the pleadings if the pleadings are defective; obtaining admission of facts and documents which will avoid unnecessary proof and delay; consolidating two or more pending cases; identifying the number of witnesses based on admissibility and relevancy inclusive of expert witnesses; appointing a court expert, wherever necessary; assisting the parties to arrive at an adjustment, settlement, compromise or other agreement with regard to the matter in issue, and for that purpose, suggest terms of settlement which, in his view, are reasonable; ascertaining and recording of any other matters which would be helpful in the speedy disposal of the action and to take all steps and make all such orders that may appear to him to be necessary or desirable for the expeditious and inexpensive disposal of the action. So, this is what the trial judge could do.

So, that particular chapter will have extensive details. As soon as we are able to gazette these new amendments, we will be having a Consultative Committee Meeting where the Hon. Members could participate and discuss the issues further. If it needs to be fine-tuned, that will be done in keeping with suggestions that may arise from them.

Then, the other important change that we will introduce is regarding affidavit evidence. Now, we are introducing a new Section 151 (A) where the court may, on its own motion, or at the request of one of the parties to the action, order that an affidavit be substituted for an oral examination-in-chief of a witness and direct the party calling such witness to tender such affidavit on a date fixed by court, which date shall be at least ten days prior to the date of trial, to enable the opposite party to prepare for the trial. In tendering such affidavit, any documents that are referred to could also be tendered along with the affidavit to the Registrar of Court with a proof of service of a copy of the affidavit and copies of documents to the opposite party. Of course, as we know, Hon. Deputy Speaker, in the type of adversarial proceedings that we are accustomed to, it might occur to the trial judge that justice would be better served by oral evidence being led. So, that power will be retained by him to - if he finds in his opinion that oral evidence should be led, in appropriate circumstances - permit the leading of oral evidence in addition to the evidence contained in the affidavit. That power is also given to the trial judge.

Then, if at all the affidavit contains matters of hearsay or matters that can be scandalous and prejudicial to the other party, the judge will also be vested with the power to delete such matters and proceed with the rest of the matters in the affidavit. These are just a few salient features I thought I will refer to in the proposed amendments.

Then, of course, the most important thing which several Hon. Members have also previously taken up is

569 570

[ ]

2014 19

that in case of a death of a party to a case, substitution becomes a prolonged process and results in unnecessary delay in our courts system. Here, we propose to introduce the need for a party to nominate a nominator-party by a memorandum filed under Section 27, which we will be introducing, where they shall nominate at least one person and not more than three persons, in order of preference, to be his legal representative for the purposes of the action in the event of his death pending the final determination of the action.

So, this will be another groundbreaking change, particularly when it comes to these matters because then the whole unnecessary process of having to substitute a person in place of a dead party to a case will not be necessary because automatically the person who has been nominated to succeed him will be substituted by the court itself. The legal representative mentioned shall subscribe his or their signatures to the memorandum. Of course, their signifying consent is necessary and it has to be also witnessed by an attorney.

Similarly, we also propose to have some other important changes. When producing official documents, we deem it important for us to make it unnecessary that to adduce proof of any document, which is ex facie, an original document or a certified copy issued by a public office, a body established by law or statute, a public corporation, provincial council, a provincial ministry or local authority unless the authority of such document is impeached by the opposing party for reasons to be recorded and for such reasons the court may require proof to be adduced. That is another important feature so that we will not waste the time of court in having to call official witnesses to prove documents, which ex facie, appear to be an official document.

The other important point which several members who are in the profession are aware of, which needs to be changed is when we make a public officer a party. Where a Public officer is made a party to any action in his official capacity, we propose to introduce some changes, that such officer shall be referred to by his official designation only and not by his name, and it shall accordingly be sufficient to describe such Public officer in the caption simply referring to the office itself. So, there again this unnecessary substitution will not occur whenever a Public officer retries or get transferred. So, these type of changes are also quite timely. Then, no action shall be dismissed on account of any omission, defect or irregularity in regard to the name, designation, description or address of such party, if the court is satisfied that such party has been sufficiently identified and described and the other party has not been misled or prejudiced by such omission, defect or irregularity. These are matters of technicality that have affected our courts system and therefore, this is another important change that we will be introducing very shortly.

Then, Sir, where an action is filed in respect of an act or omission done in his official capacity by a Public

officer who has thereafter ceased to hold such office, such application may be made and proceeded with against his successor for the time being in such office, such successor being made defendant by reference to his official designation only in terms of subsection (2) So, that is also being done in order to prevent some of these unnecessary delays which occur as a result of having to substitute names either of parties or of officials who are named in petitions and plaints that are brought before our civil courts. So, it is to be amended in this fashion. These are some of the principal features I alluded to, the details of which will be known once we are able to get this passed at the Cabinet Subcommittee and have it gazetted shortly.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I do not want to take much of your time, but I would appreciate if the Hon. Members would suggest in this Debate, whatever changes necessary to be included that may be helpful for us in the future.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) What is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Follow the correct Parliamentary practice. You are one of the senior Members of this House. As to what the

point of Order is, should be asked by the Chair, not by you. You must understand that.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, several UNP Members are present at the meeting of the Consultative Committees on Defence and Urban Development; Highways, Ports and Shipping; Law and Order; and Finance and Planning where His Excellency the President is also present. This Member is saying that he is addressing an empty House. Yes, he is addressing his own empty benches. What is he talking? He has nothing to talk today. If you have nothing to talk, sit down. What is the subject you are talking about?

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Kiriella, you carry on with your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . 2 , . :

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

... . . [5.53 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Presiding Member, the House is pleased to give its approval to the Regulations under the Partition Law, so ably presented and lucidly explained to the House by the Minister of Justice.

The Hon. Rauff Hakeem is a very capable person. He has developed the fine art of sailing the waters without rocking the boat. That is his capability and for that, we admire him because whatever it is, he stands for a united Sri Lanka and for peace for all. That is admirable because that is a quality of a good Musalman too. I know, whatever land disputes or other disputes that he has to face from time to time, as I told you, he will not rock the boat at any time; I can assure that to this House. The Muslim community has so much of love and affection for him as they do for us also. The future of the Muslim community depends a lot on the performance of the Hon. Rauff Hakeem in the political arena.

Sir, regarding the survey of land, I am reminded of a great person from Thun Koralaya. Our Friend, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, the Hon. Y.G. Padmasiri spoke before me. His predecessor, the Hon. U.L.M. Farook from the Ruwanwella Electorate was very interested in solving the problems of the landless peasants in Thun Koralaya. He took great pain to help those people to survey particular lands and to equitably and justifiably divide it among them. He has been fighting for it with the Government Agents and other Government agencies.

Sir, I am happy to announce in this House that tomorrow there will be a felicitation ceremony for the Hon. U.L.M. Farook who was once our dear Colleague and also a State Minister of Transport.

Sir, you are a great Sinhalese. I admire you and I would like to remind you of people of the calibre of the Hon. C.A.S. Marikkar who was first called, "Sinhala Marikkar". He was followed by the Hon. U.L.M. Farook who is now known as "Sinhala Farook" by the people of Thun Koralaya and by others as well. Over 90 per cent of the Sinhala population in his electorate and the Kegalle District voted for the Hon. U.L.M. Farook to Parliament. This is very admirable and that is why we have the greatest admiration for the majority community. So, it is in the Eastern Province; the Muslims there are doing very well with the Tamils. That is a subject I will deal with later on.

Sir, under the chairmanship of our distinguished Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, this function will be held tomorrow at the BMICH and a book more appropriately titled, " " will also be launched. Sir, it will not be out of context for me to expect you and the other Members of this House to come to the BMICH and honour this great gentleman because he is a symbol of national unity.

Then, Sir, when speaking about the survey of land, my mind goes direct to Gaza, to the Palestinians. Time and time again I have told this House that the land lost by the Palestinians or usurped by the Israeli Zionists must be surveyed and given back to them, and this is the

627 628

struggle in Palestine today. The UN and other international agencies are not only refusing to survey the land that belongs to the Muslims but they are also, day and night, killing small children - babies and elders. They are butchered by the greatest world butcher, called "America" by any other country; this must be stopped. Where is the world's conscience?

The other day, I moved an Adjournment Motion in this House against the attack on Gaza by the Israelis. I am ashamed to say that not a single UNP or TNA Member was here to support it, or to support the Palestinian cause, at least; to stop the Israelis brutally killing these Palestinians in the land that belongs to them.

Today, they go to Uva. They asked from the people whether they have lands or not; whether that has been surveyed or not. Is this what they are doing with the Muslim votes? Now, a little while ago, our Friend, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe spoke in this House. He was talking about the Slave Island Housing Scheme. Go there and see. People are very happy. If the people of Slave Island swallowed the dead rope given by the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, they will be on the roads today. But, now, very beautiful houses - condominiums are being built like private condominiums - by Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his wisdom, led by our great Leader, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa When you pass through Dematagoda Road over the overhead bridge, you can see on the right side, a beautiful condominium belonging to private persons, and also far beyond you can see where the people evacuated from Slave Island and Dematagoda are given decent flats. Even some of my relatives are there. They were earlier living in slums and it is a shame to call us a nation. Even Dr. N.M. Perera - I admire him and his politics - tried as the Mayor of Colombo to do away with these shanties, but he was not able to do that. This Government, under President Mahinda Rajapaksa and ably chartered by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, under whose purview the UDA comes, is building beautiful houses to give a fair and decent life to the people, so that they can live like others, as human beings in this country.

Our Leader headed the Sri Lankan-Palestinian Solidarity Movement from the beginning until he became the President and the co-chairmanship is being held by the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne and our former Minister and my friend, the Hon. Imtiaz Bakeer Markar. I must remind as to what will happen to the people of the Uva Province if the UNP comes into power.

; . ? ,

. . ... . , "! " . ". , " . . ? . . In the cinema gallery circle, Sir, he is called One Shot. "" ; . , " . ?" . . . ? ? . .

We condemn the unnecessary problems created in Alutgama and the mayhem caused there. But, now what has happened? The Government has to bear the brunt, spending money. Again, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the staff of the UDA have gone there to rebuild the houses in double-quick time, making use of the labour of the soldiers of this country. Sir, after the war, the soldiers are gainfully employed, I must say. The Vice-President of Vietnam who came to Sri Lanka said, "After the Vietnam War, the people who fought against us in America are begging on the roads".

Sir, one million US Dollars had been donated by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa to the Palestinian people. I have a document in my hand with a photo of our President being bestowed the "Star of Palestine". He visited Palestine. There is only one leader in the world - mark my words - whose name has been given to a road in Ramallah, Palatine: "H.E. Mahinda Rajapaksa Road". That is how those people have held our Leader in great respect the Muslim countries too support him. , . , ; . I am also reminded about a land dispute in Karumalai Oottru in Trincomalee District China Bay. 400 . . China Bay " " . . . .

Mr. Azwer, I have ordered those people that if some damage has been caused to the Karumalai Ootru Mosque, to repair it".

That is also what the Governor of the Eastern Province, Rear Admiral Mohan Wijewickrama, and Major Lal Perera, who is in charge of the regiment in Trincomalee, told me. Therefore, Sir, we are very happy. There can be mistakes; it is humanly impossible to stop every mistake. But what one must understand is that when something happens, how the President feels about it. He immediately orders that it be looked into because he does not want to get his name smeared by some of those who try to mislead the entire world by spreading false rumors.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) .

Sir, the other day, I met His Excellency Zuhair M.H. Dar Zeid, the Ambassador of Palestine in Sri Lanka and handed over to him a copy - he wanted a copy - of the Hansard containing the Motion I moved in Parliament regarding the attack on Gaza strip, condemning the Israeli Zionists attack. He was very pleased, Sir. He paid a good compliment to the President and said that he must continue. This is what all the other Ambassadors have said.

Sir, the highest honour accorded by the State of Palestine the "Star of Palestine" was bestowed on President Mahinda Rajapaksa by Palestinian President Mohammed Abbas recently, for the Presidents unrelenting support since 1975 for the Palestinian struggle for nationhood. In a citation made at the ceremony President Abbas stated that the Palestinian nation and people respect and appreciate the unstinted, unwavering support extended by President Mahinda Rajapaksa over the years for the Palestinian cause. The Sri Lankan President was the first member and first Chair of the Palestinian Solidarity Movement and as President, he unfailingly invoked the Palestinian cause each time he addressed the UN General Assembly, a gesture respected immensely by the people of Palestine.

Sir, I was present thrice with our President at the United Nations and it was so pleasing to hear him invoking the Palestinian cause. Even the Arab leaders forgot to do that when they took the podium at the UN, but our President always spoke on behalf of Palestine. I am particularly thankful to my honourable Friend, the Deputy Minister of Health, Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, for espousing the cause of the Palestinians and also welcoming the fine gesture of the President to donate that sum of money to the people of Palestine.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I have one more thing to say. The "Daily News" of 6th June, 2014 reported "Over 18,000 acres released to Jaffna civilians", as being said by Army Media Spokesman, Brigadier Ruwan Wanigasooriya, which I table*.

I also want to say one last word, Sir. The other day, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, the leader of the TNA, was speaking about lands, the landless and surveying of lands of the Tamil population in the North and the East, but he did not speak a single word about the Muslims. , .
