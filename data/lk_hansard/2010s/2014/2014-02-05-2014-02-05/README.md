( ) (The Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne) . . . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! I wish to announce that this House cordially welcomes the Parliamentary Delegation from Russia led by the Hon. Sergey Zheleznjak, Deputy Speaker of the Russian State of Duma, now present in the Speakers Gallery. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I am very happy that the Russian Members of Parliament are here to see the miracle of Asia, how they perform; and when the Airline is making losses, how arbitrary actions further increase. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Is that your third Supplementary Question? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No, Hon. Deputy Speaker. That was only a reflection on the statement that you made. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Do you want me to ask the third Supplementary Question? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)This does not happen in Russia. They allow democracy to reign. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, it happens in Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . [ ] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay, now raise the third Supplementary Question. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) . . rose. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I really must protest against the abuse of Parliament for a purpose like that when foreign dignitaries are here; to make a comment like that which is derogatory of this institution. It is not simply derogatory of a party or a government to denigrate this House in the immediate presence of visiting dignitaries from a foreign country, which I think, is unworthy both of the Hon. Member and of the dignity that is inherent in this august Assembly. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It must be expunged. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Any Member of this House can express his views on any matter regardless of who comes here. We have no intention of casting any remarks either on the Republic of Russia or on the Delegation and there was no reference

461 462

made here, which was derogatory of this House. I think the Hon. Member only referred to the performance of the SriLankan Airlines, which as it is, I feel is certainly not a derogatory remark for this House, to exercise its financial control, to ask what happened. And, in passing, when honourable Foreign Delegations are here, there are welcome remarks made. So, why do you not allow the Hon. Member to finish his welcome remarks on the Russian Delegation and then ask the question? - [Interruption.] You cannot stop him halfway and then say that he has insulted. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Taking over from the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I want to quote the Standing Orders. According to Standing Order Nos. 28 and 29, the question about Russia is not relevant at all because you have not asked a question on that in your original Question. Therefore, Sir, I move that it must be expunged. It is derogatory all right of a friendly country, of a great country. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Your point has been noted. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you may raise your third Supplementary Question. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . . , Aeroflot . [ ] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . .

We are talking today about the National Institute of Business Management. But, without talking much about it, I am going to use this opportunity to actually talk about

the management of the economy, and particularly the management of the financial sector and the banking sector.

In the Budget Speech that was delivered by the Minister of Finance on the 21st of November, 2013, he has said, and I will quote from page 23, paragraph No. 43.1 which states, I quote:

"Considering Central Bank's responsibilities and the recent trends in the economy, I propose to increase its capital to Rs. 50 billion. At present our country has 58 Finance Companies, out of which only 20 have an asset base over Rs. 20 billion. Some of them are owned by banks. Therefore, I propose that any finance company which is a a subsidiary company owned by a main company, be absorbed by the main company to consolidate their operations. I also propose that banks ........" And, he goes on. Then, he says, I quote:

"I propose to encourage development banks to merge and I also propose to improve the Credit Information Bureau to facilitate both banks and customers."

So, I would like to say, right at the outset, we are not opposed to the principle of consolidation in the financial sector. I think this is long overdue. We are actually surprised that the Government has taken so long to come to the place where they have realized that the financial sector should be consolidated. But, I would also like to make the point that this consolidation is forced upon by the Government because there is a developing crisis in the financial sector. Now, this developing crisis in the financial sector has resulted or is a creation of the policies that the Government itself has been following.

We know the number of finance companies that were there in the year 2006 and we know that the number of finance companies, according to the Budget Speech, has gone up to 58 as at the end of 2013. As recent as November 2013, finance company licences were actually given by the Government. So, the Government has proliferated finance companies and given these licences and then suddenly woken up and realized that it has a crisis in its hand and therefore, it wants to consolidate them and it is forcing these finance companies, basically to merge either with its parent corporation or to merge with each other. So, this is a creation of the Government itself.

We know that in 2009, there were eight non-bank financial institutions which were in trouble. They had liquidity problems; they had a lack of capital. They were badly managed. Then, in 2013, we know that CIFL, a finance company got into trouble and it had financial difficulties. We know that the depositors of CIFL are waiting for relief. We know that when the eight companies, including Golden Key Company, failed previously those depositors are still waiting for relief. What have they put? They have put their lives' savings in these companies. They have put their lives' earnings in these; sometimes withdrawing their EPF and ETF

535 536

2014 05

deposits, they put money in these companies, so that in their retirement that they could live reasonably. But, that dream has been shattered. Some sold their houses or their pieces of land and put that money in these companies. Elderly people put all their deposits in these companies. But, these dreams have been shattered.

Now, the question I want to ask is: why did the Government give so many finance company licences over the past few years, knowing fully well that this sector is unstable and this sector would need to be consolidated? If you look at the banks, we know the banking system. The strengths of it are: it has a systemic resilience, it is adequately capitalized and is profitable, and it has a high level of depositor confidence. But, then, there are weaknesses also in the banking sector. There are four banks with two-thirds of the market share.

Then, there is a more recent phenomena. To add to these four banks, you have four so-called private banks which have also become State-influenced - if I may be too harsh in using the words, State-controlled. Therefore, these eight banks, which are heavily influenced by the State, are about 75 per cent of the market share or the asset share in the industry. So, we have a situation which is very unhealthy. It is resulting in directed lending; it is resulting in artificial interest rates. Therefore, we have seen that lending to SOEs have increased quite a lot in recent years. I must particularly single out the Hatton National Bank, where 25 per cent of its lending today is to SOEs - State Owned Enterprises. I have no problem or any issue if this is the decision of the Board and the decision of the management of these companies.

Today, we are talking about the National Institute of Business Management. One of the cardinal principles in managing a business is to have a separation between the Board of Directors and the senior management. I have to record with sadness that this principle of governance, often codified in a Code of Governance in the Banking Sector, is being violated today even in the banking sector among our premier banks in this country. Unfortunately, it has been done with the blessings of the Central Bank. Unfortunately, Bank Chairpersons - whom I will refrain from naming - sitting in those chairs in private banks are holding management meetings, not board meetings, but management meetings going to several layers of the management. The Chairpersons of the bank, not the Chief Executive Officers of the bank are holding management meetings. When we see an erosion, it is time to move before the sector gets into a problem. Even big banks, private banks, commercial banks, HNB, DFCC, NDB - we have to protect these big banks, because they are our national assets. The Central Bank is no longer just approving names of people for the boards of these banks and basically seeing whether these people are fit and proper. The Central Bank is indirectly selecting the directors of these bank boards. This is what is unfortunate. When that independence breaks; when that

principle or management and governance breaks down, it will not be too long before this very priced sector of this economy, the banking sector, will soon deteriorate to levels even below the finance company sector. So, we have to protect this sector. We know that there are opportunities for banking, particularly in the post-conflict period, when we have to lend across the economic spectrum. But, the threats are the problem. The main threat is, continuously the Government is trying to take control. When I say "Government" here, let me be specific - for politicians to take control. What do politicians know about management? This is a different science. Management is another science. We have to recognize that there are specialists and we must give them the independence to operate.

We know that the Central Bank has not adequately supervised these institutions. We know that some years ago, because of the inadequate supervision, the Seylan Bank was in trouble. We know more recently the finance companies have been in trouble. There is a huge Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions in the Central Bank. What have they been doing? Even in the CIFL case, they gave CIFL basically an approval saying that it was in order, that they could go and raise deposits and capital, and a few months later the finance company was in great trouble and faced great problems. So, what does the Central Bank do?

On the 17th of January, 2014, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka gave a master plan on the consolidation of the financial sector. Now, let me be very clear here. Even while we agree on the principle of consolidation, we disagree on the way in which the Central Bank seeks to consolidate this industry. We disagree because we do not think that in business decisions, the best decision-makers sit in the Government, in the Central Bank or in Ministries. We believe that the shareholders of these institutions must decide how their institutions must merge and with whom they should merge. We believe that the directors appointed by the shareholders should have the independence to make that decision. We also believe that the senior management of those institutions must have a say, not some bureaucrat or some governor of the Central Bank deciding as to who should merge with whom. That is the danger in this plan that has been put forward. When you have such a good sector, why do you want to unnecessarily interfere with it because it spells danger and ten years from today, we may have to unravel some of those decisions that are being made after this industry and the financial sector go through a very difficult period. That is why I have chosen to speak about this issue today because right at the beginning of this process, we need to make sure that it strengthens consolidation rather than it weakens. We have reasons to fear. When we look at the transactions on the stock market over the past two years; when we look at, even today, a finance company which has a net asset value of 14 per cent is trading on the stock market at Rs. 450. It is just like going to the market and

537 538

getting an egg. If the price of an egg is Rs. 15 and when you go to the market and if someone turns around and suddenly tells you the price of that egg is Rs. 600, you obviously know that there is something wrong. It is an impossibility. But, we know that in one particular company, the net asset value is Rs. 14.14 in September 2013, but it is trading at Rs. 450. So, there is something wrong.

I do not want to divert into the stock market today, but we know that two previous chairpersons of the Securities Exchange Commission of this country resigned in the space of nine months because they knew something was wrong; they knew there was fraud. They knew that the national wealth of the country was moving into the hands of a few people in a stock market play using the EPF, and they moved out for that reason. That is why we have a suspicion that if this consolidation process is directed by the same people, that these finance companies will fall into the hands of unscrupulous people and weaken the Sri Lankan economy further. That is what we are trying to protect by this. We also know that they have announced that there should be a development bank. I want to ask the question, "What do you mean by development?" We have DFCC, we have NDB. Why do we need merge them together? Is it the decision of those shareholders? Is it the decision of the Board of Directors of the senior management? No, it is the decision of the Central Bank. What is the point in putting them together? Today a customer will call the National Development Bank and say, "I need Rs. 100 million; I need it for 10 years; I want to know what the rate of interest is". Once he finds that out, he makes his next telephone call. He calls the DFCC Bank. He says, I need Rs. 100 million; I need that for 10 years. I want to know the interest rate; I want to know the conditions under which you will lend. What will happen in the future when these two things are put together? You will be reducing competition. Not only that, you are creating a long-term lender who becomes a monopoly lender in the country. Why should we create monopolies when we can have an economy run efficiently through competition? This will create a monopoly and we are opposed to monopolies. But, if there is to be a monopoly, then that monopoly has to be a State owned monopoly. We have a duopoly situation anyway: Peoples Bank and Bank of Ceylon. They own nearly 50 per cent of the banking assets of this country. So, why do we need to create another State monopoly? It would be even worse if it is a private monopoly. It does not make any sense on the point of view of the borrower, the industrialists who are going to borrow long-term funds, to merge these two companies together.

Mergers and acquisitions work on the principle that if you have one plus one, you get three, not two. If one plus one is two, you might as well leave the institutions separately. It works on the principle that there is some

kind of synergy. What is the synergy? What is the synergy in putting DFCC and NDB together? There is no synergy. They are very like-minded banks with limited branch networks. There is no synergy. I must say to the credit of the Finance Minister that when he made the Budget Speech, he did not specifically say that those banks need to merge. But, unfortunately, the Governor of the Central Bank has become very explicit in saying that they want to merge those two banks and we are wondering why they are actually trying to merge these two banks. So, why are they doing this consolidation? If you look at the weaknesses in the banking system, there is Government ownership and Government control. That is not going to lessen. That is going to increase in the economy if you go through this process. Then, you think that there are high overheads. They say that the overheads might come down. That is just a dream because when you merge two institutions, you cannot have two CEOs, you cannot have two treasurers, you cannot have two financial controllers, you cannot have two marketing heads and you cannot have two auditors. You can have only one. But, the Central Bank, in a political move, not in a business move, has said that there will be no redundancies. So, if there are no redundancies, why are you merging? You are going to have two Boards of Directors in these banks; 10 is going to become 20. Then, you will have two CEOs in each and two treasurers in each. This is just to fool the workers in these institutions. Naturally, there will be redundancies. They will have to eventually go. That is what is actually going to happen. It is not going to solve the problem. Interest rates are not going to come down just because you put these banks together. That is why we are opposed to this.

The other big issue facing the Banking Sector is the problem of high cost borrowing. The high cost borrowing problem is - I was talking to a young man; I will tell that story now.

Madam, I want to bring to your notice the book titled, Road Map 2014 presented by Dr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the indefatigable Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. What do the foreign dignitaries who visited this country say? Many international observers commented positively on Sri Lankas developments. What does Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director of IMF say? In this book, he states, I quote: I commend the authorities for delivering strong growth, low inflation, fiscal consolidation, and a strengthening of the external accounts as well as on the ambitious growth and development objectives laid out in the Mahinda Chintana.

Referring to CHOGM, Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of Australia opens out his heart and states, I quote: Sri Lankas willingness to host this Commonwealth shows its commitment to democratic pluralism and freedom based on law and ought to reassure all its citizens that just as today is better than yesterday, tomorrow will be better than today. Then, Reza Hossaini, Sri Lanka Country Representative, UNICEF states, I quote:

Sri Lanka has an excellent record on bringing children aged 5 - 14 years into school, following seven decades of universal free primary and secondary education.

, , , - estates - . . , . , .

Dr. Firdosi Mehta, Sri Lanka Country Representative, WHO states, I quote: The efforts by Sri Lanka to develop the health sector are highly commendable. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Madam.

I must quote these because the country should know this; the world should know this.

Prof. Peter A. Bruck, Chairman, World Summit Awards states, I quote: President Mahinda Rajapaksa has shown maturity of wisdom in taking the country towards the high goal of making Sri Lanka a country of peace and a regional knowledge hub.

Madam, I want to emphasize this within the limited time available to me. I have a book here about the supply of water to the Northern Province. I will deal with only that aspect. In almost all the villages, major water schemes have been inaugurated. His Excellency the President has visited there; the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa together with our energetic Minister, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena visited there.

Now, I want to ask this question. North is being provided with all the facilities. The whole world is very much thankful for it. They are wondering how this is happening. But, what is Mr. C.V. Vigneswaran, the Chief Minister of the Northern Province, doing? He is passing Resolutions asking the Human Rights Commission to intervene and find out about human rights violations of the Government. I ask the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva: "Why are you not taking into account the 72,000 people who were driven away within four hours in one night from Jaffna? Where are your human rights? Why is the UNHRC in Geneva not inquiring or investigating into it?"

When people were praying in Kattankudi, which is the Hon. Hisbullahs village, they were killed by the LTTE. Now, there is a new mosque which is being built

595 596

under the direction of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This must be told to the international community; where is the human rights? Muslims in Eravur, Alingipothana and Palliyagodella were also killed by the LTTE. Madam, what about the samanera bhikkus who were murdered cold-bloodedly in your area in Aranthalawa? Then, Kebithigollewa - ( ) (The Presiding Member)Hon. Member, please, wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, I will conclude my speech.

I request that the world community, the UNHRC in Geneva, to bring in a motion appointing a special commission to investigate into the atrocities committed by the LTTE against the Muslim community and also against the Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese were also driven away from Jaffna.

I thank my Friend, the Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura for bringing in this Adjournment Motion as we were able to place these facts before the House. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Shantha Bandara) , .
