Yogarajan) While one of the Members of your Government, a backbencher, brings in a Private Members Bill to this House asking that the number of Cabinet Ministers be restricted to 30 and the Deputy Ministers be restricted to 31, you are increasing the number of Ministers beyond 100. What a shame! This, Hon. Azwer will not understand; the Hon. Hisbullah will not understand because for them, everything is athiuththama The Hon. Hisbullah was talking about -

, . ! [] ! . . -

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) . . . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I did not say that he spoke racially. I said that he was talking about racial amity. But, there is no racial amity in this country today. Hon. Hisbullah, please check from the people in Dambulla what is happening to the mosque there. All the shops around the mosque have been demolished the day before yesterday. They are waiting for a night one of these days to demolish the mosque in Dambulla. By whom? Your Government. Your Government under the Urban Development Authority is trying to do that. Already the temple of the Hindus has been demolished; flattened. Tomorrow or the day after,

they are going to do it to the mosque in Dambulla. Then, you please get up and speak here.

! . !

Sir, I wish to speak here about the issue of the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils. The Hon. Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils brought a Bill to amend the Local Authorities Elections Act. Under this Bill, he said that a Delimitation Committee would be appointed. There was a special Consultative Committee meeting. At that special Consultative Committee meeting, we requested that the persons who will be appointed to the Delimitation Commission should be persons without political bias. But, according to The Sunday Times of 28th September, 2014, the Chairman of the National Delimitation Commission, Mr. Jayalath Ravi Dissanayaka had attended a function to support the re-election of Mahinda Rajapaksa as President. This is totally a political function. Maybe Mr. Jayalath Ravi Dissanayake wants to be reappointed to some other committee or commission in the Government; so that he will get personal benefits and for that sake, he goes to this political function and shows his face. How can we rely on the report of this Commission for delimitation of wards in all local authorities in this country? About 4,500 wards are going to be created. Will this be done in a fair manner according to the Act that has already given the criteria under which the delimitation is supposed to be done? But, it is going to be done in a politically biased manner.

We understand that delimitation was taking place not in this commission, but at the Presidential Secretariat in the dining hall of the old Parliament, where organizers of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party were summoned; allies were called, and all the delimitation was done on the advice of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. That report was sent to Mr. Dissanayake, who was attending a political function of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He would just endorse it and then the Hon. Minister would bring it here. When this Bill came to Parliament, the Hon. Minister promised that within six months the delimitation will be completed. It is over two years but it is still not complete, and it has not come back to Parliament for approval. This is the state that we are left in. So, how can we rely on a delimitation that has been done by a person who is present in the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys re-election campaign for Mahinda Rajapaksa? This is the question we have to ask here.

I wish to table* the news item that was published in "The Sunday Times of 28th September, 2014 under the caption Top public officials violate ethics; join UPFA campaign for inclusion in the Hansard.

I have already written a letter to the Hon. Minister for Local Government and Provincial Councils in this regard. I also table* the letter that I have written to the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah with a heading Unethical politically biased behaviour of Mr. Jayalath Dissanayake, Chairman, the Delimitation Committee, Local Government bodies to be included in the Hansard.

So, it is a shame that you do things of this nature. The delimitation of wards is not for one election. It is going to exist for a long period. As you are in Government today, for you to do it in a biased manner is totally unfair.

One of your allies who was summoned to the dining hall of the Presidential Secretariat told me that a senior Minister in this Government who was present there said, "Divide contiguous areas where minorities live, divide it among two different adjoining areas where major communities are living, so that these people cannot be directly elected".

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, what is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Member is casting aspersions on those gentlemen. There was no commission appointed inside the dining hall and there is no commission appointed for the Presidential Election, Sir. He is casting aspersions and speculating. You cannot allow speculative speeches to be made in this Parliament. All that is rubbish. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. R. Yogarajan, please continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, there is no point of Order in that. What I am saying is, this is how this Government has functioned. -[Interruption.] I request the Hon. Minister who is in the House now to reject the recommendations of Mr. Jayalath Dissanayake who has been bias. That will be the right thing for him to do. He has not replied to my letter about

the Chairman of the Delimitation Commission attending the function of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. I hope he would do so when he makes his speech .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah) That is a private matter. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is not a private matter. Hon. Minister, you said at the Consultative Committee that you will appoint non-political persons to this Commission, but this person is politically inclined. If he wants President Mahinda Rajapaksa to be re-elected you cannot call him an unbiased person. This is very unfair. Hon. Minister, it is a shame that you get up to defend this man who has acted in such an indecent manner as the Chairman of the Delimitation Commission.

Hon. Minister, the people in the upcountry have a very long grievance about the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas we have. In the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha, the population is 200,000; Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha has another 200,000. You are bringing laws; you are doing delimitation of wards; you are changing the electoral systems. Why can you not create more Pradeshiya Sabhas for these people? In the Badulla District, within Passara there are two Pradeshiya Sabhas; in Bandarawela, there are two Pradeshiya Sabhas. Why do you not provide these same facilities to the people in Nuwara Eliya? Is it because you consider the people of Indian origin as aliens or you do not want to give them their rights? Do not shut your mouth and wait. The right thing for you to do would be to create two Pradeshiya Sabhas in Kotmale: one for Pundaluoya, one for Kotmale. Then, two Pradeshiya Sabhas in Walapane: one for Ragala and one for Walapane and two Pradeshiya Sabhas in Hanguranketha, if you please. The Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha has to be divided into three: one for Nuwara Eliya, one for Nanuoya, and one for Agarapathana. The Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha also has to be divided into three: one for Ambagamuwa, one for Maskeliya, and one for Hatton. Further, Hatton is a very large town, a major town in the up-country. It should be upgraded to a municipal council. You have created a municipal council in the Eastern Province where your son has become the Mayor. Similarly, why do you not consider creating a municipal council in Hatton? It deserves a municipal council, Hon. Minister. So, please do what is necessary for the people in the up-country. I do not know why this is being neglected.

Hon. Minister, I raised this issue at the Consultative Committee that Section 35 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, No. 15 of 1987 discriminates against people who live in plantations because the Pradeshiya Sabha funds cannot be used for development work inside an estate since it is

787 788

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

considered as private property. This has hampered the development that takes place through Pradeshiya Sabhas. We have had an example of a Pradeshiya Sabha in the Kandy District, the Uda Palatha Pradeshiya Sabha, being dissolved because they had built some roads within the Peacock Estate in Pussellawa. Similarly, I have reports that in the Seethawaka Pradeshiya Sabha, our Members are unable to use the funds of the Pradeshiya Sabha to do work within the estates in the Avissawella area, which is very unfair. So, we request the Hon. Minister to bring in an amendment to remove the restriction on the use of funds of the Pradeshiya Sabhas for doing development work within estates.

Thank you. [.. 5.15]
