Sri Lanka with regard to the service industry. There is foreign investment coming in two sectors: the service industry and the manufacturing industry. There is an interest towards investing in the service industry in Sri Lanka. So, it will not have an impediment on the economy. The fact remains that there is an interest towards FDIs coming to Sri Lanka. Today, the focus is more towards the service industry. So, there will not be any impediment.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ,- ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do not want to disturb the Hon. Member but I must say that the Hon. Azwer raised a very important issue. The issue he raised is that there is a reference made in this Motion by the Hon. Members who have signed from the United National Party - not by those who have not signed - to friendly countries, namely, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan who are members of the SAARC. They are friendly countries. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition will agree with me that these wordings are unfriendly and not in accordance with Parliamentary practice. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is very clear that the Hon. Members are trying to raise points of Order to take away the Hon. Ravi Karunanayakes time. Therefore, kindly reduce it from the Governments time and do not take it from our time. That is all.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Members, please bear in mind that you all have got to speak very carefully when you make speeches referring to countries that are friendly to this nation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is hilarious that the Hon. Chief Government Whip is raising such a point at this particular moment because he was the one who approved this No-Confidence Motion to be taken after three months from the date it was submitted. At that time, did he not see that these names were there? We have mentioned those names to protect Sri Lankas integrity. Today India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and even the Maldives are under threat owing to the insecure actions taken by the Government of Sri Lanka. What do you mean by "wordings are unfriendly"? What about the written promises given to India which have not been fulfilled so

far by the Government? Now, you could see the "Modi Wave" that has taken place. The first person to congratulate him was our President. I am happy that the President of Sri Lanka has realized, even at this late date, that India is an indispensable country in the peace process and in the way forward for Sri Lanka. If you basically want to make good friends, the first thing we say is, hand over KP - the sixth paragraph of our Motion is about him - to India at least now, to prove your bona fides.

Vasudeva Nanayakkara dealt with that issue in a particular way. But, look at the ingenuity of the principal Opposition party in bringing this Motion at a time like this.

When the issue relating to the Gazette Notification seeking to give tax and duty concessions to investors in a recreation and hospitality facility was debated, the contention of the Opposition was that this was to permit the setting up of casino businesses in this country. There were a large number of Government Members and even Cabinet Ministers who kept away from voting with the Government. They did not vote against it; at least, one did. But, then we had our independence, we had our democratic right to, at least, keep away from Parliament. Through that, the Opposition was able to create this general perception in the country that there was a growing dissension. What an ingenuous attempt this is by the Opposition today to have brought this Motion? It is almost definite that tomorrow all of us are going to vote against the Motion, which we will do in order to protect the Government because this is a very frivolous, totally baseless allegation that they are trying to bring about. But then, by doing this, the ingenuity of the Opposition is exposed in that the slight advantage they had on the previous occasion is totally negated. This has to be properly borne in mind. Let me also place certain facts because this gives an opportunity for the Government, particularly for me, as the Minister of Justice who is expected to try and monitor and supervise the criminal justice system in this country when it comes to drug offences and punishments relating to drug offences.

Here is the record of our Government within this short period. Let me just give you some figures. In 2001, the total number of those who were committed to prison out of drug offences were 27,000 of which 10,560 were related to narcotics and similar type offences. In 2010, the number committed to prison was 31,000, among whom, 13,000 were involved in narcotics and similar type of dangerous drugs. In 2012, those who had been taken into custody because of drug related offences was 47,000. In 2011, it was 42,000 and in 2010, it had been 29,000. There had been a gradual increase in the numbers of people who had been taken into custody and also in the numbers of those who had been convicted for these crimes. Therefore, there is an awareness that has been created.

Sir, the Hon. Prime Ministers name had been very unreasonably dragged into this. We all must, as Sri Lankans in this country, understand that the office of the Prime Minister and its exalted position should not be unnecessarily demeaned, be it by the Opposition or anyone in this country. He is a very senior politician.

I have been a Minister in charge of Port Development and Shipping in this country during the UNP Government. I have got applications by a variety of Ministers, Members of Parliament and others for demurrage waiver, and that is a discretion that has been given to the Minister in charge of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. But, then, it is not always that we started examining, because after containerization came, these detections have become so difficult.

I will show here the world figures with regard to detections. According to international enforcement agencies, only about one-fifth of the global flow of opiates gets intercepted. There are two countries mentioned, one is in the South and Central Asian Region and the other is in the East Asian Region. These are the two main producing countries. I do not want to mention names of the countries because it is diplomatically not a correct thing to do, although the UNP, as an alternate government, has taken the liberty to mention countries in their Motion, which is a very wrong thing to do. Anyway, I do not want to mention the names of the countries, I will only say that one is a South and Central Asian country and the other is an East Asian country. They are the main producing countries of narcotics and the interception rate is only 2 per cent of the total output. This is the problem; this is the global problem.

Containerization has revolutionized international trade. All of us know that. But, it also provides ideal cover for traffickers. So many shipping containers pass through the worlds ports everyday that only a fraction can be inspected. That is a fact. I am telling you because I have been the Minister in charge of the Port Development and Shipping and we know that in order to examine containers, we may have to have almost 100,000 customs officers in the ports, if we are to open every container. Then, if we start opening every container, the exporters are not going to be happy about it and the buyers are also not going to be happy about it, because there will be delays in the ports. So, we have to have a balanced approach to inspection. There has to be definite tip-offs based on which interceptions can be made. Ship owners and even customs officers often just have to take it on trust that what is inside the container is what it says on the cargo documents. That is a fact. Most people who are involved in the shipping business know this for a fact.

More than 420 million containers move around the globe by sea every year, transporting 90 per cent of the worlds cargo. Most carry licit goods, but some are being used to smuggle drugs, weapons and even people. Now, this particular consignment which was detected, the largest consignment we detected - 36 kilos - is what is mentioned in your Motion and this was one of the largest detections. Nobody talks about the fact of detection. They are only talking about this particular letter that has been given. The sheer volume of this international maritime container traffic, the sophisticated and often ingenious concealment methods, along with the diverse routings

671 672

adopted by illicit drug traffickers and other smugglers, invariably makes successful interdiction totally difficult. That is a fact and we must bear it in mind. Therefore, this whole issue is on a premise that the Government has not taken sufficient steps to contain drug trafficking. I have given you figures relating to incarceration of drug offences and the commitment to prison with regard to drug offences.

Now, there are a variety of countries which have introduced capital punishment. In our country, since 1976 we have not carried out capital punishment. This is a matter that always comes up whenever issues relating to drugs are spoken about. The last execution was carried out in the year 1976. There have been cries occasionally to resume executions. In view of this, the Government decided to reinstate capital punishment in 2004, during the UNP regime, for cases of rape, drug trafficking and murder. In spite of this, due to significant opposition to the move, executions were not carried out. No executions have occurred since 1976, although death sentences were handed down continuously by courts for offences of murder and drug trafficking convictions. Sri Lanka supports a global moratorium on executions and has urged other States to do the same. At present, there are 450 inmates who are sentenced to death. At the moment, a Committee appointed by me, headed by Justice G.W. Edirisuriya, is there to consider and make recommendations with regard to commuting the death sentence to life imprisonment, because this has become a serious issue for my Colleague, the Minister, Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera. In fact, during the Budget Debate, I heard him say that almost 65 per cent of the current prisoners in our prisons are there because of drug offences. Therefore, how dare you say that we are not taking sufficient action to contain the drug menace? Indeed, this is a spreading menace which we have to contain. There are difficulties. But then, the law enforcement agencies are at work and they are doing their work. It is very improper and not a focussed Motion that has been brought in this case.

There is this other issue of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Two representatives of the UNODC came recently and met me relating to a request which they made. They wanted to explore the possibility of how Sri Lanka could team up with the international community to battle against maritime trafficking of narcotic drugs.

They made a suggestion. According to UNODC officials, there is large scale smuggling of narcotics, especially heroin using ships across the Indian Ocean. This is happening. This is something that they have properly monitored. When ships carrying narcotics in the high seas are captured, the offenders cannot be punished as there is no jurisdiction vested in any country to try them. This is a problem they have, because if you fly a particular flag of a country, you cannot simply enter the ship into the high seas. This is a problem. You have to get

the permission from the country in which it has been registered. Therefore, captured narcotics are dumped in the sea and the traffickers are allowed to go free. This is a problem that the international community is facing, particularly when it comes to the laws of the sea.

With regard to piracy, there is a model system in operation, where offenders of piracy who are caught in the Indian Ocean are taken to the Seychelles and prosecuted, because there is a multilateral agreement signed to have the Seychelles as a place where they can try piracy. UNODC requested that Sri Lanka consider setting up a mechanism to prosecute narcotic drug traffickers caught in the high seas in Sri Lanka. We are very seriously considering that, because we want to cooperate with the international community and to even allow them to use our courts of law to try drug offenders who are caught in the high seas. That is the amount of cooperation that we are prepared to extend in order to eradicate this menace.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That being the case, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would say that we are quite genuinely and sincerely working towards eradicating this menace from the country. Of course, there are certain other issues - law and order issues - which we have to be very seriously looking at, particularly religious extremism, issues pertaining to intolerance, hate speech, hate crimes, which are now beginning to take root and regarding which already the Government appears to have got some action going, by setting up a separate police unit, but I am not very pleased with that arrangement. Today, I saw that the President has appointed another committee to look into this issue and advise. In that regard, I must salute our Prime Minister. He, in his own electorate when he was faced with such a problem, took to the streets. There is a man who is standing up for these issues and it is such a man that those in the Opposition, on a very frivolous and a totally baseless allegation, are trying to demean.

673 674

The Opposition has to learn. In fact, I told the Hon. Yogarajan a while ago that this is an ingenuous attempt to bring in this Motion at a time when the Opposition on the other Motion pertaining to the Resolutions on the Strategic Development Projects was able to, at least by default, show that there is some displeasure regarding the Government. You are going to lose all that tomorrow and certainly the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress will be with the Government and vote with the Government on this issue, because this is a totally frivolous Motion.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. [.. 5.21]
