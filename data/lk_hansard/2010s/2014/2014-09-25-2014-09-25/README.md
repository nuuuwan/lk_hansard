(a) (i) Yes. Parcels of State lands only in 14 islands in Kalpitiya archipelago have been vested with the Tourism Development Authority for the development of tourism.

(ii) No. The main objective is the formulation of a proposal in collaboration with the people of the area in keeping with the basic plan for Kalpitiya Tourism Development Project. It is accordingly ensured that no fishing family is displaced. New houses, access roads and community hall facilities will be constructed in identified areas in keeping with the basic plan and it will be ensured that no hindrance will be caused to the fishing industry which is the livelihood of the people domiciled in these islands.

(b) (i), (ii) No. Not a single fishing family has lost their ownership of lands or has been displaced and action will be taken in keeping with the Government's land alienation policy to allocate required extents of lands for every fishing family living in these places on a temporary or permanent basis.

(c) (i) Out of the Islands taken over, only two have been alienated on lease to two investors.

(ii) Allocated on annual lease basis for 30 years in keeping with Government's policy on leasing lands for an investment.

(iii) Agreements have been entered into on the basis of valuation of the Valuation Department.

(iii) the reasons for the delay in imposing laws regarding the rights of witnesses; and

the officers responsible for such delay?

(b) If not, why? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Hon. Deputy Speaker, now the time is 2.20 p.m. As regards the time allotted to Questions for Oral Answers, I noticed that usually a disproportionate amount of time is being allotted to some Questions. Time management must be done by the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) That is right. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, in fact, it is unfair because sometimes all of a sudden you talk of the discretion of the Chair and reduce the time allotted to Hon. Members. Even we, Ministers, are being put at a disadvantage due to this. I have some other meeting also. This has now gone on to 2.20 p.m. Time management must be done in some proper way by the Chair. I was observing that some Questions went on for more than 20 minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, as per the Standing Orders, Ministers cannot be curtailed when they are explaining. Today, the Hon. Members who raised the Questions never took a long time. So, there was a difficulty. Those Questions were of importance -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, the Hon. Minister himself can answer. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, the Hon. Minister can answer, certainly.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I can answer; I am not refusing that. But, the Chair must do some time management because when time is disproportionately allotted between Questions, some Hon. Members go on - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We have to discuss about this at the Party Leaders Meeting and they must take a decision.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Anyway, now let me answer this Question.
