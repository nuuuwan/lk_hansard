QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I

THREAT ON PRESIDENT OF BAR ASSOCIATION ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) A complaint has been made in the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station that two suspicious characters with full-face helmets on a motorcycle had followed Mr. Upul Jayasuriya, President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka on his way from Hulftsdorp.

The motorcyclists had followed Mr. Jayasuriya from Hulftsdorp to Galadari Hotel where he had remained for about half an hour and during which period these motorcyclists had remained outside the hotel, notwithstanding the fact that this is a high security area in front of the Presidential Secretariat. Thereafter, Mr. Jayasuriya had proceeded to an office at Sir Earnest de Silva Mawatha, Colombo 7, and had been followed by the same motorcyclists who remained there for two to three hours. The motorcyclists had also been seen talking to two persons in a three-wheeler. The number of the motorcycle was WP UB-4072 and that of the three-wheeler was 207 -5314. Two motorcyclists had also been observing Mr. Jayasuriyas residence both on the 15th and 17th of July, 2014 and a complaint had been made in this regard to the Thalangama Police Station. The authorities, however, failed to trace any details regarding these suspicious persons or even their vehicles.

. , .

Apparently, no details are available in the database of the Department of Motor Traffic in respect of either the motorcycle or the three-wheeler. Surprisingly, however, the details of the vehicles bearing the numbers immediately preceding and immediately following the numbers of these vehicles are available. No explanation has been given for the gap in the numbering. To my knowledge, Hon. Deputy Speaker, certain vehicles are held back if they are connected with special security operations. So, I wonder whether it falls into this category. Otherwise, the names, numbers and the details should be available.

959 960

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

In the meantime, the Attorney-General himself has written to the Inspector-General of Police regarding this incident. This is a matter concerning the President of the Sri Lanka Bar Association, which should have been given the highest priority in its investigation, but nothing has happened. Therefore, I wish to ask the Prime Minister:

(a) What is the present status of the investigations into this incident?

(b) What is the reason for the gap in the numbering of vehicles?

, , SAFETY, SECURITY AND WELL-BEING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN NORTH AND EAST

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a statement on a most grave issue of public importance, relating to the safety, security and well-being of the women and children in the North and the East of the country.

Last week, reports came from a village called "Oori" in Karainagar in Jaffna, that an 11-year old girl had been sexually assaulted over a period of time repeatedly by several navy personnel stationed at the Karainagar Naval Detachment. Police Spokesman is quoted by the AFP News Agency that the girl concerned had made a complaint to the police and that seven navy personnel were arrested and produced before the Magistrate. The

963 964

Police Spokesman had also stated that subsequently it has been discovered that another girl, aged 10, had also suffered the same violation.

Sir, you would agree that this is a heinous crime that needs to be combated immediately; the real perpetrators must be apprehended promptly and legal action taken against them immediately. Also, effective action must be taken to ensure that such incidents do not occur anymore. This is the direct result of the militarization of the North that we have been complaining about consistently and constantly.

The matter that concerns us is the way investigations and legal action have been pursued by the police. When the seven navy personnel were arrested and produced on 18th July, 2014, the Magistrate remanded them and ordered an identification parade to be conducted the next week. However, within hours, all that was changed and a parade was conducted before an acting Judge and the suspects were released on bail. Apparently, the virtual complainant had not been able to identify any of the suspects. This raises the question as to whether the right persons were, in fact, apprehended or whether deliberately some others were arrested and produced.

The other issue is the threat and intimidation faced by the complainants and their families, in addition to the severe trauma undergone by the complainants.

Can the Minister kindly inform this House as to the steps taken in this regard and is he also able to assure this House that immediate steps would be taken to apprehend the real culprits and deal with them according to the law, and also to prevent such despicable incidents in the future?

I thank you, Sir.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, what the Hon. Prime Minister has stated in the House has been merely a reiteration of the several facts that are contained in my Question and which constitute the subject matter of the complaint. The Hon. Prime Minister has not been able to throw any light whatever on action taken by the Government or the

965 966

[ . ]

2014 25

Government authorities to investigate, detect and find out who the persons responsible are and what action the Government will take against them. There were seven persons who were produced at an identification parade and they were not identified by the complainant for the apparent reason that they were not the assailants, they were not the offenders. So, my complaint also is that the persons who were guilty of this offence have, in fact, not been apprehended and were not produced at the parade. The Hon. Prime Ministers Statement does not in any way throw light on that very critical question, as to whether the right persons were arrested and whether the right persons were produced in the parade. If you arrest the wrong persons, they will not be identified. So, here again, do we see an attempt being made by the Government to prevent the truth coming out?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, an Answer has been given by the Hon. Prime Minister to the Question raised by you under Standing Order No. 23 (2) and the matter is pending before the Magistrate's Court. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The matter is pending, but what is happening? The matter could be pending, that is all right. But, as far as the Government is concerned - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, this is not the forum to debate this. So, there cannot be a debate; this cannot be converted into a debate. - [Interruption.]

HEINOUS ATTACKS BY ISRAEL ON GAZA STRIP

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Presiding Member, I move,

The whole world today is stunned, alarmed and bewildered to observe the savage and ruthless military aggression by the Zionist backed Israel on the Palestinian Gaza killing Palestinian with impunity particularly small babies and women, which amounts to 60 per cent of this brutal genocide. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) the death toll has risen to over 500, more than 3000 injured and about 63,000 people had sought sanctuary in the 49 UN shelters in Gaza, and more sadly, it expected this figure to rise daily. For the last sixty years, Israel has blatantly violated human rights of the people of Palestine -in their own homeland- consequently, brazenly flouting several UN resolutions adopted in the past demanding the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories.

Nonetheless, Israel has occupied the Holy Land of Jerusalem which is home to Masjid-al-Aqsa whence Holy Prophet Mohammads Miraj - the ascension to heaven- took place from here.

While most vehemently condemning the brutal and dastardly attack on the people of Gaza Strip in Palestine, this House calls upon the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Countries -OIC- and other international human rights fora to call an immediate halt to this most savage and brutal crime committed on earth in this 21st Century of human civilization and further calls upon to appoint immediately an international committee of inquiry to investigate and report of this barbaric and heinous crime committed by the terrorist forces in the name of a battle.

Sir, this land belongs to the Palestinians. That is recorded in history.

Today, Sir, is a holy day for Muslims the world over. We call it Lailat-ul-Qadr, - the 27th of the holy month of Ramadhan, - the day the Holy Quran was revealed to the Holy Prophet Muhammad. Sir, when we mention about Baithul Muqaddis or Jerusalem, it is mentioned in the Holy Quran, - Sura 15 - Bani-Israel Surah; Verse 1:

This is from a commentary of Allama Muhammed Yusuf Ali.

Now, what is happening in the Gaza Strip - a great blot for the entire human race?

An article written by veteran mediaman, Ameen Izzadeen, under the caption "GAZA: MASSACRE OF CHILDREN BY ZIONIST PHARAOHS" appeared in the "Daily Mirror" of 25th July, 2014 which states, I quote:

The western media underreport the Palestinian suffering. They

hardly mention the Palestinians legitimate right to fight the occupying force and win back their state......

More than 1.8 million Palestinians are living in a 350 square kilometer prison called the Gaza Strip with two gates......

Tens of thousands of Palestinian people who are displaced by and fleeing from the Israeli bombardment of residential area, schools and hospitals tried to enter......

The Palestinian crisis will not end until the US ends its hypocrisy and holds the scales of justice evenly.

We have to ask today in this House "Where is the conscience of the human race?"

In the UN, they speak about human rights day and night, but there are no human rights as far as the Palestinians are concerned. This article states, I quote:

For the Zionists, the Palestinians do not exist. If they exit, they are not people; they are things - things to be wiped out. Two years after Israel occupied much of Palestine, Golda Meir, Israels

1015 1016

hawkish Prime Minister from 1969 to 1974, told Britains Sunday Times in an interview published on June 15th 1969:

'There was no such thing as Palestinians. It was not as though there was a Palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took their country from them. They did not exist.'

This is recorded in a well-edited article appearing in today's Daily Mirror by the veteran international analyst, Ameen Izzadeen.

We came and threw them out. It is a holy land. Actually, Jerusalem belongs to all communities, the Muslims, the Jews and the Christians. This is the Capital of Peace in the world. They have to recognize that. They only wanted to drive the Muslims away from there. It is their land of birth. Just imagine what would have happened if the Tigers took over and drew all of us away from this country? No, that cannot be allowed by any international law.

This article further states, I quote:

Today, the Zionists are the Pharaohs.

21

!

Nay, they are worse than the Pharaoh, for he killed only the first-born boy child while they kill little boys and girls indiscriminately. -

That is being done day and night.

You have access to Al Jazeera. See! The whole world is shedding tears. The blood of Palestinians flow in the desert. They are killing babies. Palestinian babies are the most beautiful ones born on earth. Even our mothers in this country, particularly Sinhalese I should say," , babies , " .

This article goes on to state, I quote:

They derive a perverted pleasure from killing the Palestinian child whom they regard as tomorrows terrorist.

They are targeting the young generation. They do not want Palestinians to be born. What greater racism can you practice in this civilized world!

This further states, I quote:

As the attack on Gaza by Israel continues for the second week,

This is the third week.

. the death toll has risen to more than 750, with one third of the dead being children.

This is the position.

A young Islamic activist, Azam Bakeer Markar writes, I quote: The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said more than 63,000 people had sought sanctuary in the 49 shelters it has opened in Gaza - The number has tripled in the last three days, reflecting the intensity of the conflict and the inordinate threats the fighting is posing to civilians. We call on all sides to exercise maximum restraint and to adhere to obligations under international law to protect civilians and humanitarian workers. Then, Azam is quoting what the President of Venezuela,

Nicolas Maduro, says. I quote:

Palestine doesnt have armed forces; they just have a state thats still being created. So its not a war between two armies. Israel has the worlds most modern weapons and plans it so that, in a very precise way, the missiles reach where they want them to reach. Undoubtedly theyve committed genocide.

This is a dastardly crime on the innocent people of Palestine. Sir, these perpetrators of crime must be tried. They are planning to try our President - a leader of the country who was chosen twice by the people. But, we can assure this House and the world at large that that will never happen. Sir, we very well know that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka-Palestine Solidarity, has led many a battle demanding the withdrawal from the occupied forces from Palestine and to give them back their own land. He even moved a Motion in Parliament when he was the Leader of the Opposition.

Sir, I am also very happy to mention today that our Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa held an Iftar ceremony the other day and he invited all the members of the Sri Lanka-Palestine Solidarity Organization headed by Mr. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar who was the former Minister of Mass Communication and the Hon. Speaker expressed his solidarity with the people of Palestine.

Sir, I remember when I was a school boy at Zahira College, it was our great national leader, Dr. T.B. Jayah who led the Palestinian struggle. He held meetings almost every week at Centre Road in Pettah, which was called at that time, the Palestine Maydan or the Pakistan Maydan. Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Senator S.H.M. Mashoor, Senator M.D. Kitchilan, Bakeer Markars, Barrister A.L.M. Hashim and O.K. Mohideen Sahib, were regular participants. Sir, at that time Mr. Philip Gunawardena, the father of the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena who is now Chief Government Whip, was a Socialist Leader. In 1937, Philip saw the oncoming danger to the Palestinians. He warned the State Council at that time. He said, The imperialist powers are attempting to drive away the people of Palestine from their homeland. We vehemently condemn such a move by the world imperialists. Those were the words of Philip Gunawardena, Sir, in 1937.

1017 1018

I also must mention that in 1970, I met His Eminence Muhammed Amin Al Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Palestine in the company of Secretary-General of the Motamar Al-Alam Al Islami at Al Munthaza Hills in Beirut. Alhaj M.A.M. Abdul Hassen, President of Kal-Eliya Muslim Ladies' College also came with us. Al Haj M.B.M. Mahir, a scholar, has written a book titled, Why Islam?. Under the caption "Baithul Muqaddis in Jerusalem", this is what he states at page 79. I quote:

Mohamed Amin Al Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Palestine and President of the Motamar Al-Alam Al Islami, has sent the

following cable to all Muslim Heads of State.

This happened in 1967. Sir, that was the year which we had the largest Muslim gathering in the ground of the Mardana Mosque. We had dual presidentship at that time. One was Alhaj Dr. Badi-udeen Mohamed who led the Islamic Socialist Front and the other one was Alhaj M.H. Mohamed who led the anti-Marxist Muslim Front. I do not know, but there were lakhs and lakhs of people who overflowed to the Maradana Road. This is what the Grand Mufti said at that time said, again I quote:

Israeli officials are repeatedly declaring their insistence to stay in

Jerusalem and the other lands they have recently occupied.

These great people have predicted it, they have told that much earlier. I quote:

Great danger lurks in these declarations because the Jews have declared their ambitions of establishing their Temple (Haikal Sulaimani) in the place of the Aqsa Mosque. Muslims will never tolerate the Israel rule irrespective of consequences. We appeal to your Islamic zeal and humanitarian justice to do your best to save the Holy Land.

It was not only an Islamic cause, but also a human cause. A human race is going to be erased from the face of this earth.

Then, Sir, Alhaj M.B.M. Mahir had sent a telegram on behalf of the Sri Lankan Muslims at that time to U Thant, Secretary-General of the United Nations. This is what he wrote: We, the Muslim Congress of Ceylon appeal to you to use your good office to arrange for the withdrawal of Jews from Arab Territories and ensure the status of Jerusalem as a Muslim city. Jerusalem must be restored back to the Muslims. This is the demand of the World Muslim Community and also the world human race that they should withdraw from the Arab Territory. All efforts should be taken by individuals and organizations of Sri Lanka".

Then, there is also something to say about Barack Obama, the President of the United States of America, who has become a slave unto Zionist lobbies such as the America Israel Public Affairs Committee - AIPAC. These lobbies fund the campaigns of US Presidential candidates

and prospective and existing lawmakers, who in turn ensure that nearly US Dollars 4 billion is given annually to Israel as military and economic aid.

Therefore, Sir, today, with a saddened heart and tears in eyes we, as human beings, call upon the world community, the UNO and the other international fora and I have particularly mentioned here the OIC countries - the Organization of Islamic Countries - to intervene. What are they doing? They have a powerful bloc of 57 members in the United Nations and almost there are 60 odd Muslim countries in the world. Now, if they can raise a voice unitedly I think all these problems could be settled. The Palestinians will get their land, and there will be a City of Peace again: the Jerusalem. As I told you, in 1967, they bombed and attacked the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Therefore, Sir, we call upon the International Community to intervene. I am very happy to say that our President, when he heard about the catastrophe, immediately rang up Mahmoud Abbas, the President of Palestine and condoled with him about this inhuman massacre and expressed solidarity with him. I think that is timely intervention.

To conclude, I wish you all a peaceful day Lailat-ul-Qadr - 27th of Ramadan - and also wish the Hon. Speaker and the Members of the House and all the staff of the Parliament a peaceful tomorrow and a peaceful Palestine, a peaceful world. Ameen!

Mr. Presiding Member, this is human tragedy. An instant action is required. We need to ask ourselves,

1025 1026

[ ]

2014 25

therefore, why the United Nations and its agencies have failed to fulfil the objectives for which the organization was established in the first instance. I think the answer is that there has been excessive politicization of the United Nations system. What are the cornerstones of the entire system? I would describe the basic values as peace, justice, and harmony. Those are the pillars of the United Nations system. Those are today being undermined because of a selective approach. Different criteria are applied to different situations. These are values which should be applied across the board without discrimination, but we do not see that happening. So, if the United Nations system becomes an instrument for the realization of political objectives, and if the Human Rights Council themselves degenerate into a political instrument, then these are the dismal consequences that arise from such an attitude. We see that clearly in the contrast between the ineffectiveness of the system to deal promptly and adequately with a situation of the magnitude of the Gaza crisis on the one hand, and how they have pursued Sri Lanka relentlessly, on the other. A country which has suffered anguish and pain for 30 long years is today back on its feet. Its economy is growing by more than 7.3 per cent. We are making rapid progress with regard to social development. Nevertheless, it is a sad reality that for three consecutive years, 2012, 2013 and 2014, Sri Lanka has had to grapple with hostile resolutions that have been brought against this country in the Human Rights Council. This means an enormous commitment of energy, resources and time to ward off this challenge when there is much else that demands attention on the part of our country. So, the lack of equity and fairness in dealing with issues is today one of the major problems that we observe with regard to the functioning of the United Nations system; it is disproportionate. There can be nothing more horrendous than the Gaza crisis today and yet the system has not been effective in providing relief and putting an end to the carnage that is taking place. So, that stands in dismal contrast with the persistence, the tenacity which Sri Lanka is being pursued and that is a historical inquiry into what is alleged to have taken place in the past.

I would also like to say, Mr. Presiding Member, that our position in this matter is crystal clear. It has been stated authoritatively on many occasions. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been very much in the forefront of the struggle for the recognition of the legitimate rights and the aspirations of the people of Palestine. He has, on every occasion, when he has addressed the United Nations General Assembly supported that cause with great emphasis.

Our policy is as follows. Sri Lanka supports the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions regarding the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to statehood and the attainment of a two-State solution. Sri Lanka, Mr. Presiding Member, has chaired the United Nations Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the

Occupied Territories since its inception in 1969 and continues to chair this important UN Committee.

Sri Lanka is the only non-Islamic country in the Committee and continues to lead the work as its Chair.

Sri Lanka supports a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue based on the relevant UN resolutions resulting in a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognized borders, side by side, and at peace and with dignity alongside Israel.

The blockade of Gaza that adversely affects essential services, economic activities and infrastructure development must be lifted. The blockade and the issue of increasing settlement activities, which are inimical to a solution, must be addressed to take forward the peace process to reach a mutually acceptable political solution.

It is also worth mentioning, Mr. Presiding Member, that in November 2011, Sri Lanka supported Palestine in its bid for full membership of UNESCO, which Palestine now enjoys. Sri Lanka also supported Palestines bid for non-Member Observer Status in the United Nations in November in 2012. Sri Lanka continues to support Palestines admission to full membership in the United Nations.

Now, the need of the hour, as the speakers before me emphasized, is a ceasefire which will bring this tragic situation to an end. And, for that purpose, we strongly support the Egyptian proposal with regard to a ceasefire. Sri Lanka calls upon the parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint in a bid to hold the violence and ensure a climate conducive to the recommencement of negotiations for a lasting solution to the conflict. We urge the parties to engage at the earliest in direct dialogue, which is the only sustainable path to peace and security in the region. We remain hopeful that since both parties wish to secure the right to life for their peoples, concerted action would be taken towards this end.

The draft Resolution presented to the Council in this regard provides a trajectory in keeping with the ground situation to overcome the challenge to achieve peace and security in the region and it is very much our hope and expectation, Mr. Presiding Member, that all nations will recognize the extreme gravity of the situation and move very swiftly to bring this calamity to an end. I thank you, Mr. Presiding Member.
