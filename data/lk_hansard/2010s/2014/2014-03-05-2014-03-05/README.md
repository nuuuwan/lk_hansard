I really appreciate the work done by the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayake, Deputy Minister of Higher Education who is here. You have allocated billions of rupees for the infrastructure development of the Eastern University, which is going on very well and you have given your fullest moral support to the University as well. I really appreciate all that.

But, as a Parliamentarian from Batticaloa, I got some complaints about the administration of the Eastern University. I do not blame the Minister or the staff of the Ministry for that, because they are giving all the support. We really appreciate that and there is no question about that. But, after we appointed the new Vice-Chancellor two years ago, more than six lecturers have resigned so far and I do not know why. There are some issues taking place in the Eastern University and I have already given a complaint to the Hon. Minister of Higher Education. At the same time, some are taking revenge on some lecturers and I do not know whether they are doing it on personal grounds or academic-wise. But, the academic staff is fed up with the administration. These are some small issues that we have at this University and if you correct those issues, I think within a short period of time you can uplift the standard of the Eastern University in Batticaloa to a very good level.

For example, I would like to draw your attention to one such case: Mr. Thillainathan Sathaananthan is a Lecturer in the Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Healthcare Sciences, Eastern University. He got the appointment as a Lecturer eight years ago. He was appointed as Lecturer in Medical Education and Research at the Faculty of Healthcare Sciences, Eastern University on 3rd of July, 2006. The interview was held at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya as he is one of the pioneer members of the Faculty. He was interviewed by a panel of experts from the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, such as Professor C.D.A. Goonasekera, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya; Professor N.Athuraliya, Director, Medical Education Unit and Professor T.Varagunam, Professor in Medical Education and the most senior Medical Educationist.

Then, if you take his confirmation and promotion, he was confirmed in the post by letter dated 30th March, 2011. During the period when the Competent Authority functioned, by letter dated 30th April, 2011, he was placed on a transitional provision from 18th July, 2009 until the completion of his five-year experience for promotion in terms of Circular 721.07(1)(i) of the University Grants Commission. The evaluation was made by two Professors in the relevant field, namely, Professor P.T. Jayawickramarajah, Professor in Medical Education and Professor M. Selvarajah, Professor in Education. Then, he has many other relevant qualifications also. He has dedicated his life as a Lecturer in Medical Education and

Research for more than eight years and is reading for MPhil in Medical Education at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya. He has published more than 12 research articles in the area of Medical Education and completed the Postgraduate Diploma in Medical Education at PGIM, University of Colombo. He has also completed the Master of Education at the Eastern University and completed Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the Open University. I do not know why they are taking revenge from him. For example, his opportunity for postgraduate foreign training funded by the HETC was blocked. He was denied his routine promotion arbitrarily by the Vice-Chancellor of the Eastern University. A case was filed with the USAB in that regard.

The third issue is sending his personal file purposefully to an irrelevant person in order to get a report on him, one Prof. Susrith Mendis, Professor in Physiology who is not even in the field of Medical Education or in the field of Education. I do not know why they sent it to him.

Then the fourth issue is attaching Mr. Sathaananthan to the Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Eastern University, without giving any reason or a time period. As per the University Act, a post of a lecturer is not a transferable post. That is another important fact. So, he has appealed against the transfer. But, without giving any reply, the Council of the Eastern University called for explanation from him. This is not a simple issue, because he is mentally affected by all this. He was appointed and confirmed in the post eight years ago. Dr. Devarajah and Dr. Pathmanathan were there in the Council then. They confirmed him in the post. I do not know why they are taking revenge from him. Two days ago, a press conference was held by the UTA - University Teachers Association. We do not want to encourage such acts. If you take necessary action against these incidents, I think we can make the Eastern University of Sri Lanka the best university, because all the facilities are there.

I would like to earnestly request the introduction of a Marine Course for this University, especially because most of the people in the district are engaged in the fishing industry. They are doing traditional fishing. They do not know how to increase the catch using modern methods. If we introduce a Marine Course, we can upgrade the fishing industry and also uplift the living standards of the fishing population in the district.

The other thing that we need for this University is a Faculty of Law. It is very easy to establish a Law Faculty as we do not need many buildings or infrastructure. Also, we need a Hotel Management Course to be introduced in this University. His Excellency the President encourages the tourism industry. Today, a lot of tourists are coming

279 280

to the Eastern coast, especially to Pasikudah, Arugam Bay and Nilaveli. Also, there are many hotels run by Sri Lankan businessmen. We really appreciate all that. But, management-wise, there are some issues in the hotel field since they do not have a proper knowledge of hotel management. If you can make arrangements to introduce a Hotel Management Course also to this University, we will really appreciate it. A lot of money has been allocated for the other faculties to construct buildings et cetera. Everything is going on very well in all those aspects. I think in two or three months time, they will finish constructing the hostel also. Thereafter, all students who are staying outside can enjoy that facility as well.

I must also say that I appreciate the work done by the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education, the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayake, Deputy Minister, and in the same way I appreciate the work done by the very experienced Secretary. Whenever I call him, he answers. But, some people complain that their calls are never answered. Even our Minister and the Deputy Minister immediately answer whenever we call them, so that, we have been able to solve a lot of problems not only in the Eastern University of Sri Lanka but also in the North and the East. Therefore, nobody should blame them unnecessarily.

Education is an important sector. If the students are talented enough they can enter a university. Whether he is a Ministers son or the Presidents son, it does not matter. Anybody can enter a university if they are eligible. Even a lot of poor students are now able to have a university education.

, .

.

. We have a University and an Open University there. Then, we have a vocational training centre, a technical college and the SLIATE. I appreciate the Minister, the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayake, because he allocated nearly Rs. 80 million for the new building of the SLIATE for HNDA Course. They are going to complete the construction work of that building within 2-3 months. Many students will get the benefit of it. Not only that, two years ago, we gave more than 3,000 graduate appointments in the Batticaloa District alone and I really appreciate His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Minister of Higher Education for that. ,

[5.50 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, it is a new experience for me to speak when you are in the Chair. You are creating history because the Member who moved the Motion has taken the Chair. This is a new experience in my long career as a Parliamentarian. For whatever expressions you have made from your Seat, you have to give substance to that, while you are presiding. We are very happy about you. As somebody said, whatever the differences we may have politically, I am one person who admired you from the time of the Youth Leagues of the United National Party. You came up the hard way and you always dedicated your services to promote the cause of education.

So, all in all, it is a good day for us. Today we are discussing Education. I am reminded of a saying of our Holy Prophet. He said, I quote:

Talabul ilmi farilathan ala kulli Musliman wa-Muslima

It means, "It is incumbent upon Muslim males and females to educate themselves." He said it is "incumbent". That is what the Holy Prophet said. These Hadees were quoted by no less a person than His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa recently when he was the Chief Guest at the Khairiya Muslim Girls' School in Dematagoda and Fathima Muslim Girls' School in Bandaranaike Mawatha, Hulftsdorp. He quoted this. How nice it is! Whenever the President finds a good saying, maybe from Dhamma Pada, maybe from the Hindu scriptures, maybe from the Holy Quran or Hadees, he does not lose sight to quote them in assemblies when he addresses various communities. The Muslims were very happy about it.

So, Sir, education is a part of our life. As Muslims, we have to educate ourselves. Even the Holy Prophet once said, "Thalbul ilmi ala bisseen" - Go even unto China and gain knowledge". Those days in Arabia, Sir, they did not know how to go to China. Later the Silk Route was opened up. The Holy Prophet meant, Even go up to that place. Go to China and get yourself educated. This is what this Government is attempting to do. In keeping with the great teachers: Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Prophet Muhammed, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and others, this Government is developing education as never done before.

Sir, once, lord Nelson Mandela, the great man who revived the self-respect of the African Black people - he was almost an avatar of a great Saint - said, Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. He said, You can change the world; the destiny; the future; the fate of the world by giving education. This is exactly what this Government under Mahinda Chintana is promoting. Now, look at the objectives of the Mahinda Chintana. One of the objectives of the Mahinda Chintana is to produce educated men and women, and intellectuals.

Here, in my hand is a fine book titled, National Higher Education Strategic Management Plan of Sri Lanka, prepared by the Ministry of Higher Education. I would ask our Friends in the Opposition to read it. The Vision of this is, I quote:

Sri Lanka to be an international hub of excellence in higher education by 2020.

! - - . Then, what is the Mission? The Mission is, I quote:

To delight students, the industry, staff and other stakeholders of the Higher Education System of Sri Lanka by formulating and implementing results-oriented policies & strategies and to deliver results in an effective and efficient manner through a participatory

process to produce the best intellectuals, professionals, researchers and entrepreneurs to produce innovative solutions to make Sri Lanka The Wonder of Asia .

To achieve this, what are the goals that have been explained? The first is, Increased opportunities and access to Higher Education. That is why we are having so many higher educational institutions. There have been international schools and private schools. Are they not producing good students? My children went to a private school and my granddaughter is also going to a private school. I know, Sir, because there are no facilities afforded for higher education in this country, several members of our community are going abroad. They need Rs. 15 - 25 lakhs in order to educate themselves. My Friend, the Hon. Dumindha Silva is here; he used to go right round the town, to all the , and all the shanties. He meets the shanty dwellers and helps them for their children's education by giving them books. These are the good services that the Parliamentarians, the peoples Representatives should do. Then, the second goal is, Converted and new world class universities. The third is, Improved employability and quality of graduates. This is what this Government is doing. How can anybody be against this? If anybody be against these missions and objectives, I should say that they are enemies of Sri Lankan educated class or educating class.

The other goals mentioned here are, "Improved satisfaction of stakeholders; Improved global compatibility, global links and exchanges; Enhanced research, publications and commercialization; Converted Higher Education for attracting investments and foreign exchange".

When you open more universities, you can attract foreign exchange; entrepreneurs will can come and invest here. They can start big industries like in the Eastern Province. See the miracle that is happening there! Earlier, during the day, there were Questions asked about Pasikuda, Nilaveli, and Kuchchaveli. Hotels are coming up there. Even the Hon. Leader of the Opposition agreed that there was a hotel in Pasikuda owned by his father - "Sun & Fun Hotel". We also have gone to that. During the time of the war, like the JVP, they destroyed all those hotels. The other day, we went there to attend the wedding of the daughter of our good Friend, the Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood, the Cabinet Minister. Along with His Excellency the President, we also went to the Golden Lagoon in Batticaloa. How nice it is to visit those areas where vast developments are taking place, as never before in the history of the East.

I know a family who faced much difficulties in sending their daughter to be educated abroad. I think she had to go to Karachi. A lot of our Muslim girls are going to universities in Dhaka. Those days we said, " ." . .

education .

. . Fathima Sarah is the daughter of His Excellency Shah Marikar Bawa who is designated as the first Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. She had to go to Karachi and Mr. Bawa had to bring her back home. With much expenses again, he had to take her to Dubai for the internship. Now, all these difficulties faced by the parents of , can be avoided, if we have established universities here. This is the great service that our Minister, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake is doing. He is a clever man; a hard working man and a man of intellect. I went with him to the South Eastern University in Oluvil and to the Eastern University and the Trincomalee University. We saw how much they liked him. There were problems that were brought to their notice by the students. Our friend, the Secretary, Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawaratne also came with us. He is a capable person who does the best for higher education in this country. Dr. Nawaratne would certainly help the Government and the Ministers to create a Wonder of Asia by uplifting the educational standards of this country. Then, I should not forget my good Friend, the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayake who is seated in front of me. . . . . , .

The Peratugami MP is talking about selling. What is this selling of education"? I cannot understand. .

, . , . The Governor of the Western Province, As-Seyed Alavi Moulana, what a nice man, what a harmless man, what a good man he is! - granddaughter - has been enrolled. She has all the qualifications. If they have all completed the qualifications according to the Act, then what is the problem for anybody? What do they say? These are the people - education . , , , . They destroyed the education and educational buildings in this country in the past.

Then, a special intake of 5,600 students had been proposed for the academic year 2012/2013 and for that, Rs. 4,000 million had been allocated in the Budget, 2013. In that Budget Speech, it was also proposed to provide suitable lands free of charge to well-wishers who wish to build hostel facility for university students.

, , .

After the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake assumed duties at the Ministry of Higher Education, a policy decision was taken to establish a separate division to administer State universities and to regulate non-State universities. Moving forward accordingly, the entire administration of the State universities was assigned to the University Grants Commission and a separate Additional Secretary was appointed to the Ministry of Higher Education to administrate and regularize non-State universities.

I will tell you one thing, Sir. I went to Kerala. In those days and even now, Kerala has a communist regime. There are several universities in Kerala and it is one of the most intellectual States in India. At the fall of a leaf, there was a strike in that State. Then, what happened? As the years passed by, Kerala became very poor in education and higher education. The intelligentsia or the educated class of Kerala decided, "We will not to have any strikes in our State hereafter as we will be the second, the third, the fourth or the last State among the States which are backward in education in the Indian Union". Today, there is no strike at all. In Kerala, whatever the university students would say, whatever they would do, they would settle those issues with their Ministry of

285 286

Higher Education, the Minister of Higher Education, the University Grants Commission, the State Government or the Indian Government. They would not fall victim to the communist people, who wanted a rebellion in their State through destruction of education; the students would not permit those people to act in that manner anymore.

Sir, there is a cry or demand for a Muslim university also in Sri Lanka. Sir Ivor Jennings came here and established a beautiful university in Peradeniya. His daughter came here recently and stayed at the house where Sir Ivor Jennings got married. She said that she wanted to come here more and more and that Peradeniya is a beautiful site, one of the most picturesque sites for a university. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .
