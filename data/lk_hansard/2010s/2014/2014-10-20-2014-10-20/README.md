(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) A foreigner. Those are the three categories. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Would you mind if I just make one clarification? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Okay, you go ahead.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It was in the Bill that, if by chance, the ownership changes midstream, the facilities afforded to that company gets lost out.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, I will explain that. I am coming to all those points. ? . . , Diplomatic Mission. . , a Condominium Parcel situated on or above the fourth floor. , . , . He can buy freehold.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is about a condominium or an apartment. What about the land that is owned by them to build a condominium? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Then, he will get what is called "Freehold". That will be caught up under another section. I will come to that. Let me give you the areas then we can discuss the exemptions. The first is Diplomatic Mission. , Condominium Parcel on or above the fourth floor. , by way of intestacy, gift or testamentary disposition to a next of kin.

, Land transferred to a foreign bank at an auction for debt recovery decree. . , . - . .

. . This is what the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is interested in: A land transferred to a company with a majority foreign shareholding from 1st January, 2013, and the effective date of that if the company has been in active operation in Sri Lanka for not less than 10 years".

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, what is the Clause you are referring to? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is Clause 3 (1) on land transfer exemptions. Let me go on. We have plenty of time. You can ask questions later on.

, Strategic Development Projects: "As may be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and Parliament as prescribed in the Strategic Development Projects Act". For all those questions that you raised, wherever it has been passed by Parliament as a strategic investment to this country in terms of the Strategic Investment Law, they can get that exemption. Now, you asked about the Colombo Port City.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Case by case.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, case by case, because it comes to Parliament as individual cases. We debate it and once it is passed, then they are eligible to get that exemption. So, on a large number of investments, whether it is the Colombo Port City or some important strategic investment, where the question, "Why should they be caught up under this?" would arise, that question is answered by that particular section. , . An entity -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, can I have a clarification on -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, please. Hon. Member, since technical questions are involved - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) In the amendments given by you all, in Clause 3(1)(g)(iii), immediately after line 11, you are basically inserting, "(h) any land, the title of which was transferred to a company referred to in section 2(1)(b), during the period commencing from January 1, 2013 and ending..." . So, that means that any land given before 2013 would basically fall out of this safety net. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Not the safety net; they will get the benefit of the exemption. These laws will apply after 2013.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, the law is with retrospective effect. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, because the earlier Cabinet Paper and the discussions were made in 2013. So, now let me go on.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, may I ask a question? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, what you are saying is, if the land sale was concluded before 1st January, 2013, these laws do not apply.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Exactly.

963 964

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) So, the laws that would apply are the laws that were in effect previous to this law.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) yes, under the Finance Act. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) That means, there has to be a 100 per cent tax on the sale of land?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes. But, by this time, that transaction would have been over.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Correct. For instance, if a land transaction took place in 2012, the Government must be paid a 100 per cent tax on the entire value of that transaction.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, they would have paid that already under the previous law.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Whether they paid or not, they would be liable for 100 per cent tax, is it not?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I think my interpretation is correct because I brought in this law in 2004. Up to now, a person who has got a land outright, that is, freehold title, would have paid that 100 per cent tax before the deed was registered. If some people had dodged that, then of course, they will get caught up because it would not have been registered by that date.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay, thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I will ask you one question. What happens, if it has been bestowed to a Sri Lankan and if he has sold that to a company before 2013, because he has a right to do so?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is, after paying that tax. Before 2013, any transaction which would have transferred the land to a foreigner would have had to pay that 100 per cent tax irrespective of the laws that we are discussing today.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If the ownership is less than 50 per cent, this law does not apply.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Exactly. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) . . , . . . . , -

( ) (The Presiding Member) How many minutes do you need? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I need, at least, another 20 minutes, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay, we will try to manage the time.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) They fall in line. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes. In any case, they all have subsidiary companies. Now, for example if a big blue-chip company has these changes in their share structure, that is not going to affect the subsidiary company that they have. They may have a subsidiary company which deals with buying and selling of lands or building condominiums. That is a subsidiary company. Subsidiary , , .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, can I ask a question? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) What is the position in the case of a subsidiary company that is not listed? The main company is listed and the subsidiary companies are not listed. So, the share transactions only happen with respect to the main company.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, what will happen is, in practical terms, they will register companies. To meet this eventuality, . Otherwise, of course they have to take the risk of getting this matter into the main company. So, the natural thing would be to form subsidiary companies.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) What you are essentially saying is that big conglomerates - because you mentioned the name "John Keells Holdings", let me take that example - have a number of subsidiary companies and associate companies that deal with land related transactions: apartments,

condominiums and so. So, what you are now saying is that those companies will have to be actually broken up from the mother company.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Some are already broken up and others will have to be broken up and be listed.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) If it is listed, then you will have to follow the one year -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is for that listed company alone. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) But, if it is not listed, the share ownership remains. Is that not so?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, once it is in the stock exchange, that will be an independent listing.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) In other words, what you are doing is, you are putting a ceiling of 50 per cent share ownership for all companies that -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) - that are interested in - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Let me finish my question. In other words, what you are saying by this law is, you are putting a ceiling of 49.9 per cent share ownership of foreigners in companies that transact land. That means, whether they are building hotels, shopping complexes or apartments, the maximum share ownership can be 49.9 per cent.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, unless they come under other exemptions. There are a large number of exemptions.

971 972

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Let us not worry about exemptions, Hon. Minister. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not? - [Interruption.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Let us not talk about the exemptions to the rule. Let us talk about the rule.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The rule is very clear. That is, if they are going to the stock market, that will be treated as an independent entity. In that, these rules will apply regarding the shareholdings in respect of that company.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes. If you take a company like John Keells Holdings, it is a listed entity. It is not a privately held company.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, it is a conglomerate. It is not only dealing with land. They are conglomerates.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Correct. So, what I am saying is, companies within the conglomerate that deals with land will have to be removed and listed separately.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is an executive decision for them. They can hive off and start a company or choose to come under this law. That is up to them.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Otherwise, the problem that you spoke of earlier will arise. That means the mother company or the conglomerate or the holding company will be liable in that case.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is up to them. That is a corporate decision.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I just want to clarify. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, you and I both know that will be a corporate decision they will take.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Certainly. I just want to know the Governments position on that.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Minister, you may continue. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I have already dealt with that issue. Now, we come to some of the concerns that have been aired. First, is the question of the Strategic Investment Law.

[2.49 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. The Hon. Member who preceded me was pleased to say that when one points a finger at another person, four fingers point at the very same person.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Nine fingers.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He said nine fingers point at the same person. All of us know what he has been doing with his fingers in recent times and where the imprints have been left. - [Interruption.] So, we will not go further into that, we will let him do all the damage he does and continues to do to the image of the country. This Bill - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We can imagine the damage you have done - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. We will let the people decide that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) They have already decided.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Who is that? Ah! "Jumpers" - [Interruption.]

Hon. Presiding Member, the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Bill that has been presented today, in the first part of the Preamble states, I quote:

.WHEREAS in furtherance of the development policies being promoted by the Government in the backdrop of a globally integrated environment, it is deemed expedient and necessary to ensure the prudent use of land which is a limited resource,..

Now, this ideal is most welcome and the Bill, as a whole or at least in the direction that it moves, is a welcome one. But, there are several inadequacies in this, several shortcomings in this, and I will endeavour to identify some of those in the course of my speech .

The second part of the Preamble talks about the National Policy. It states, I quote:

AND WHEREAS it is the National Policy to regulate the use of lands,..

I want to pause there for a moment. To declare National Policy under the Constitution, particularly that of land, is not left to the Government. If one looks at Appendix II to the Constitution, there should be a National Land Commission, but there is no National Land Commission. This Appendix was brought in 1987, but to date, there is no National Land Commission. The Government is presenting Bills boldly stating that it is the National Policy and states something as a National Policy which is contrary to the provisions in the Constitution, which declares how the National Policy on land use must be formulated. Firstly, there must be a National Land Commission, which is not there. Secondly, it states that once the National Land Commission is established, it would be the responsibility of that Land Commission to formulate the National Policy. So, it is not up to the Cabinet of Ministers who sanction this Bill and presents it through one of their Members to this House. It must be the National Land Commission that must formulate the National Policy on land. So, there is a very serious breach here of the provisions of the Constitution.

Then, it states that this Commission will include representatives of all Provincial Councils in the Island. That is what the Constitution lays down. The Constitution, in 3:4 of Appendix II states, I quote:

In the exercise of the powers devolved on them, the powers shall be exercised by the Provincial Councils having due regard to the national policy formulated by the National Land Commission.

So, the Constitution is quite clear as to who formulates National Policy on land and as to who exercises those powers that are devolved on the Provincial Councils in accordance with the National Policy that has been formulated. Now, the Government is observing this wholly in the breach.

Then, I will come straightaway to what the Hon. Member who spoke before me said. He referred to the 20,000 deeds and permits that were distributed recently in Kilinochchi with much fanfare. The procedure adopted for identifying the recipients on that occasion was wholly opposed to the procedure laid down in the Constitution. That is another one of those instances that we can identify as an intentional violation of the Constitution, which in fact, is an impeachable offence. I identified some provisions as to who can exercise these powers. It is a Provincial Council that can exercise these powers. I read the provisions in the Constitution.- [Interruption.] It must be in accordance with the National Policy on land. But, that policy must be formulated by the National Land Commission and there is no National Land Commission; that has not been appointed. But, it is not only that. The

991 992

procedure that has been laid down with regard to State land comes under No. 1 in Appendix II of the Constitution. I read 3:4 earlier.

The Constitution, under 1:3 of Appendix II states, I quote:

Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province to any citizen or to any organization shall be by the President, on the advice of the relevant Provincial Council, in accordance with the laws governing the matter.

No doubt, it is the President who can alienate State land. The final act of alienation rests entirely with the President, under his hand and with the seal of the Republic, but he does that only on the advice of the relevant Provincial Council in accordance with the laws governing the matter and that is the Constitution which I just read out, a proviso under Appendix II in the Constitution. But, this is being breached and the Hon. Member had the temerity to ask me why we were not present. We were not present at an occasion when the laws of the land were being breached willy-nilly; when the Constitution itself was being breached; when the Provincial Council had nothing to do with picking the recipients or even advising His Excellency as to how this should happen.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this is just like the devil quoting the Scripture. People of the Northern Province have given their rights to persons in the Northern Province, but they are not functioning. The Hon. Vigneswaran is not giving lands to the people.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We know who the devil here is. I am quoting the Constitution. If the Hon. Member does not know that, he should sit down. I am reading the provisions of the

Constitution. I wish the Hon. Minister to reply to this because we are talking about land alienation, land alienation to foreigners. I am broadly, as I said, in agreement with the sentiments in the Bill although there are serious shortcomings, which I will identify. But, we do have a situation where we have a much bigger problem with regard to land alienation to the citizens of this country. There is a problem with regard to land alienation to foreigners. That must be curbed, that must be restricted and we welcome your efforts in that direction. We wish more can be done in this but while you exercise caution with regard to land that can be owned by persons who are not citizens of this country, why do you not follow the laws with regard to alienation of land to your own citizens?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) They have got land. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I just read the provisions of the Constitution. ( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Why are you opposing? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am just saying why I am opposing it. If you sit and listen, you will understand.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) I understand. They have got land. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Minister, if you listen to my speech you will understand why I am opposing. I am not opposed to land being given to the Tamil people, the Sinhala people or the Muslim people. I want land to be given to all the peoples of this country; I want land to be given to all the citizens of this country but I want that to be done in accordance with the law, not at the whim and fancy of somebody. There is a law in this country. I am quoting from the Constitution, the supreme law of the country and you cannot say one word in defence of the accusation that I am making. There was no advice from the Provincial Council. What can you say about that? Do not just sit there and talk what comes to your mouth. If you do not

993 994

[ .. ]

2014 20

understand what I am saying, at least sit and listen quietly. There is a provision that I have just read out that mandates -

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) I understand. You are talking for your own good. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Not my own good. Answer the question. Why can you not answer the question? Has this been followed? [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Sir, I will take him on. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Please allow the Hon. Member to speak.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have cited provisions - [Interruption.] - Yes, you do not care about this. I have cited provisions and I have raised the question. If responsibly, somebody can answer, I will take that answer but not this kind of shouting. All right, Hon. Minister, can you tell us? I will give way to the Hon. Minister.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) My good Friend has raised a question to which he himself knows the answer. If there is any piece of legislation which is ultra vires the Constitution, you had every right -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not talking about this Bill.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not? You just talked about the Bill at hand. If your argument is correct, you should have moved Supreme Court, and then, they would have advised the Hon. Speaker as to what procedure he should follow.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Hon. Minister, -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, you raised the issue, let me answer.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are not answering the question that I have raised.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, having been absolutely silent on this matter, and their leaders participating in discussing the Agenda of this House, he now comes here and says that this is ultra vires the Constitution. This is totally unacceptable.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have raised the question of 20,000 land permits and deeds that were given without the advice of the Provincial Council. Can you give me an answer to that?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, you took up the position that is ultra vires the Constitution, in which case you could have taken this in the proper forum.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have raised another question. Answer my second question. I will give way. Why do you not answer that now? I will give way to you; answer that question. You have no answer.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The same reply obtains. If there is any jot or tittle in this draft Bill to which you object, you should have gone

995 996

to the proper forum. Instead of doing that, once it has passed that stage, you are coming here and complaining about it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no, I am not talking about the Bill. The speaker from the Government side who spoke before me raised this issue about 20,000 land deeds and permits. - [Interruption.] You are conceding now the second issue that I have raised, that those 20,000 deeds and permits have been given unlawfully; there was no exercise of the provisions of the Constitution. - [Interruption.] No, I did not bring it. It was brought from your ranks.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why do you not move with the matter at hand? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It was a Member from the Government side who raised it; so, I am asking the Minister.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You are an educated lawyer. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is immaterial. It was not raised by me. It was raised by a Member of the Government and I am asking in reply to that. He said, I wish you will reply. I am replying to that and raising it and the Minister cannot answer that question. That is the simple position. It is not only those 20,000 deeds and permits -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am not responsible for what you are saying about 20,000 deeds, permits et cetera. There is a different procedure in Parliament for that, we can discuss it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am happy with that answer that you are not responsible for that. I am happy with that answer. Thank you.

Now, it is not only those 20,000 deeds and permits that have been given away wholly unlawfully, we are

concerned about large tracks of land that already belong to the citizenry of this country who have private deeds, and who cannot go back to their land. I did say that there are salutary provisions in this Bill, you are trying to curb the foreigners owning land or bring restrictions in some ways but what about the citizens who have title to their land, who have their deeds and cannot go back to their land? You are a Minister in the Government. You act with collective responsibility of the Cabinet. The Government has repeatedly given assurances that these people can go back and live in these places.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is a very ridiculous situation and we cannot continue with activities of Parliament in this way. My good Friend, the Hon. Member, is raising various issues which are not at all germane to the subject that we are discussing today. We are talking about restricting - [Interruption.] You are talking about the rights of other people. - [Interruption.] Sir, I am not against it. But, this is not the occasion. You have various other mechanisms under which you can raise this issue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is certainly the occasion. When you present a Bill that seeks to curb ownership and other rights of land by foreigners, it is entirely within my rights to raise the other question: "What about the rights of the citizens?" -[Interruption.] All right, if you do not want to answer, that is all right. We know your difficulty, but I am raising the question nevertheless. I realize the difficulty of intelligent Members of Cabinet. [Interruption.] No, I can raise - [Interruption.] I am talking about ownership of lands of the citizens.

There is identified 67,000 acres of land that has not been allowed to be utilized by persons who are owners of that land. Now, that is something that we are more concerned about and I will cite areas in which this continues to happen. In the Trincomalee District, most recently I myself went and saw in two areas: one in Kanguweli, and the other in Tennamarawadi, where people who have cultivated those lands and were displaced, who have come back and started cultivation are being prevented from cultivating their lands. Now, the Government officials are blocking, are taking sides with others and not allowing even the permit holders to cultivate those lands. In the Ampara District, Pottuvil West, Palayadiveddai, Kaninkuva area, again 251 farmers are affected. They were given permits from 1976 onwards. They had been cultivating; most of them are Muslims, and they have continued to cultivate it with short interruptions but from 1996 to 2011, they have cultivated those lands but now they are being prevented. They are being prevented by Government officials.

There is a letter from the Government Agent and from the Divisional Secretary of Lahugala who have said that they cannot cultivate those lands and they have been forcibly stopped from cultivating those lands. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of National Languages and Social Integration) Are any others cultivating those lands? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, nobody else is cultivating those now. But, these people have been stopped from cultivating these lands.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Do they have titles? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, on permits. - [Interruption.] Yes. Why is this happening? Why is it happening in Tennamarawadi? Why is it happening in Kanguweli? Why is it happening in Palayadiveddai where Tamil and Muslim farmers are living? I am ashamed to identify their races but that is what is happening. Farmers are prevented from - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, it is quite possible that there are administrative problems like that which have arisen. But, it is your duty to bring it to the Consultative Committee. Then, the officials who will be there will give an answer. I mean, you are assuming this. I want to say that you are assuming mala fide on the part of the Government. There is no such thing.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, if it is one isolated incident in one part, I will not assume any such Government policy. But, if it is happening from the northern part of the Eastern Province to the southern most part of the Eastern Province and if it is happening only to the Tamil and Muslim farmers, then, I certainly have the right to suspect that there is some kind of policy that is being implemented, and that is why I identified the areas from North to the South of the Eastern Province.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) My dear Friend, please answer this question. Have you raised this matter as a National List MP with the administrative authority?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, we have raised this issue. We have written letters.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, what was the reply? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We have not got any reply. We have raised it but we have not got any reply. I am raising it in Parliament because this is a very serious issue.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, you are raising it for the first time. You have so many other ways: You could have discussed it with the Minister concerned; you could have raised a question in Parliament; you could have raised this in the Consultative Committee. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, I am raising this issue for the first time in Parliament. But, I have a whole file full of letters that have been written. This issue has been raised but there has been no response to that. So, I am asking the question: Is there something that is growing on in stealth, because this is happening not in one place but in several places, particularly in the Eastern Province?"

Now, I will come to the Northern Province. I said in the Northern Province, there were 67,000 acres of land. Most of those are not State lands on permits but are private lands that are held on private deeds and those people are unable to go.

The Hon. Member from Hambantota from the UNP raised the issue of a golf course in some area, somewhere in Monaragala. The same type of golf course is there in the Northern Province also, in Valikamam North. Three hundred and fifty acres of land has been taken for a golf course for security forces when people from seven or eight villages as a whole have not been able to resettle in that area and they are still living in what is called, Welfare Centres, basically in displaced camps. Now,

999 1000

why is this happening? You say, you are doing this to protect the rights of the citizens to own land and that you do not want the rights of the citizens to own land taken away by foreign companies and foreigners. That is a welcome notion. But, what about those who already own lands, already have permits? Merely because they do not belong to one particular community, are they to suffer this ignominy? Are they to suffer this ignominy of living in welfare centres for 24 or 25 years, while the land that they cultivated, land that came from several ancestors of theirs being used for golf courses, tennis courts and swimming pools of the military who claim it to be taken for security purposes? What is the security purpose of having swimming pools and tennis courts there? Now, do you not see a dichotomy here? Do you not see a problem here?

With all of these, you are presenting a Bill on the basis that the rights of the citizens to own land must be protected.

Now, I come to provisions of this Bill. There are some exemptions. I would like to welcome some of these exemptions because there was an issue with regard to transfer of land, even gifts by somebody to their children, if those children had become foreign citizens. Even though the law did not prohibit it, administratively those deeds were not being registered for sometime. That was again a violation of the law but I hope this law now clarifies it because Clause 3 (1)(d) states, any land -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Can I clarify it? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) As you rightly said Hon. Member, there were certain grey areas in the past. One of the objectives of this Bill is to clarify those.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am glad this is clarifying it. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, that is now taken care of.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I welcome that because under this even a gift to a next of kin who maybe a foreigner is exempt from this restriction and we are thankful to the Government for clarifying that and making that transfer possible. But, the issue that I want to raise is with regard to the large latitude that has been given to the lands that have been identified under the Strategic Development Projects Act. This is where there is provision or there is opportunity for large amounts of corruption. If you lay down a particular policy and state the law, the law must be very clear. If you give an authority or a body of persons, it maybe part of the Government or it maybe an administrative machinery, that kind of latitude to decide - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Minister. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Every project under the Strategic Investment Law must be passed by this Parliament. It comes before us. If there is any contravention of the Constitution, existing laws or whatever, you have every right, firstly to seek the judicial remedy. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, that is not what the Bill states. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not? It is covered under the Strategic Investment Law.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will read the provision to you. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, read it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Clause 3(2) of the Bill states, I quote:

The Minister may in consultation with the Minister to whom the subject of lands has been assigned and with the prior written approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, by Order published in the Gazette, exempt any foreign entity engaged in the banking, financial, insurance, maritime, aviation, advanced technology or

1001 1002

[ .. ]

2014 20

infrastructure development project identified as a Strategic Development Project, in terms of the provisions of the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008, from the application of the provisions of section 2.

It says, The Minister may..... What is identified as a Strategic Development Project is presented before Parliament and approval is sought. So, that comes up for debate. But, which of that the two Ministers will exempt from the provisions of Section 2, is left to them.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, let me explain. When we bring in the Strategic Investment Law, we specify in that law the exemptions that are granted. That is not left to any official because at the heart of that strategic investment exercise, is the need to get Cabinet approval to go above any other existing law. That is why we bring it to Parliament.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) On the ground, we have seen grave abuse of these discretionary powers that are being given. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. If you can look at some of the strategic investment laws that we have commonly passed in this House -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This does not say when an industry or enterprise is automatically identified under the Strategic Development Projects Act that it will be exempt from Section 2. It does not say that. It gives to the two Ministers concerned the discretion to identify which of those will be exempted from Section 2 and which will not be. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, every Strategic Investment Law does not carry the same set of exemptions. That depends on the situation.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That, I understand. That is when it comes for approval to Parliament.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Even these exemptions will now be listed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is what you are saying now from the Floor of the House and I welcome that clarification. But, that is not what the Bill says. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The word "may" there does not mean discretion. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, the Bill says may. So, I am saying that that gives the discretion to the Ministers concerned. We have seen how the Urban Development Projects (Special Provisions) Act has been abused. We have seen in the City of Colombo how this is being abused and the law not being followed. We have to look at Bills that are presented and laws that are made in the backdrop of what is happening presently in the country. I can speak about this because that court action is now over. There was an instance when we had to rush to court to stop the UDA demolishing a building. That property had not even been acquired, not even Section 2 notice had been given. They had deeds to those properties. You had bulldozers parked outside. Everyday, I had to plead with the judge to ask that the bulldozers be kept aside. They had to come to some kind of settlement. Otherwise, those houses would be knocked down. That was only four houses out of 48.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You are going on with that. Do you want me to explain? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Whenever we bring in a law, the UDA law or any other law, built into that law and also in the general law, there are remedies that are available and in the very example that you mentioned, you have availed yourself of that remedy.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Under the Urban Development Projects (Special Provisions) Act, the jurisdiction is removed to the Supreme Court and it specifically -

1003 1004

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The problem is, Sir, the Opposition does not use the remedies that are available to them. Then, they come and shout here. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, why do you not listen to what I am saying? Under the Special Provisions law, even the Supreme Court cannot grant interim relief. So, your house will be knocked down first. You are only entitled to compensation after that. So, I am saying, draconian laws like that are being abused. Draconian laws like that are being abused by this Government against its own citizens and then you bring in this Bill and say, foreigners will be now debarred from owning. But, you are providing an avenue under the Strategic Development Projects Act and giving a discretion to that Minister and another Minister to decide which one of those lands will be exempt from this. So, you are opening this to grave abuse. I am saying this most responsibly. I am not about to pronounce on this but the whole country knows the level of corruption in this country today. The whole country knows where that level of corruption is; whether it is at the bottom level where a peon is taking Rs. 50. - [Interruption.]No, no, that is not what is happening in this country; it is the opposite that is happening. The corruption is at the highest level and this is - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Let the Hon. Member speak. Hon. Sumanthiran, you have five minutes left. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) When that is the case, giving further discretions to higher officials and personalities like this will exacerbate the situation and not combat - [Interruption.] All right. If you want to explain the corruption at the highest level, I welcome that. - [Interruption. Ah, "shall" and "may" you have explained.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We have deliberately put the word may- .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not giving way now. Hon. Minister, if you want to explain the corruption at the highest level, yes,

certainly I will give way to you. "May" and "shall" you have already explained.

It is a fact. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, I do not want to put you into grave difficulty in getting you to comment -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you are losing your time. You have got only five more minutes.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Sumanthiran, give me the opportunity.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. I will give the Hon. Minister the opportunity. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You spent some time on the legality of the words shall and may". Did you not? You spent some time on that and several times, you challenged me to say, "Why do you not explain that on the Floor of this House?" .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The honourable Colleague seated next to you knows that well.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Did you not say that? So, now I am accepting your invitation and trying to explain that. Then, you are raising another point.

Sir, I will tell you the reason why we have put shall as against may, of which my distinguished lawyer Friend has made a big issue. That is, since it comes to Parliament and the final discretion is left with Parliament to amend the Strategic Investment Law or any provisions, if they so wish, we have been advised that we should use the word may there and not shall, actually as a sort of concession, as a sort of a gesture to Parliament. That is all. None of those sinister interpretations that you have brought, Hon. Member, is valid. This is simply a legal advice that we have received, that as a courtesy to the House, we should use the word may. So, this shows how every little thing is being converted into a conspiracy theory.

1005 1006

2014 20

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, thank you very much. Now, let the Hon. Member wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Minister says "every little thing." I started with the provisions of the Constitution that are being violated willy-nilly. That is "every little thing" for you, Hon. Minister. - [Interruption.] Disposition of State land, alienation of State land and the provisions contained in the Constitution cannot be dismissed as "every little thing", certainly not by a senior Minister like you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You never used the facilities and the avenues available to you to challenge those things when the Bill came up. Now, you are talking about those here.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not on the challenge of this Bill. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) That is done at the Supreme Court. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, that is the other thing. You make the court independent and we will go and challenge the Bill and have an independent decision. You pack it with your people and expect us to go to court. That, you cannot do. - [Interruption.] Then, you sanctimoniously preach to us to go to court. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You do not expect me to take such an attitude of the Supreme Court of this country, do you? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Of course. What do you mean by "such an attitude"? That is what the people of this country and elsewhere know that court to be.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you are left with two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I will wind up now.

I have cited a few, what I say, "concerns" in this Bill, but, as I said, we welcome the direction in which this Bill is being presented. But, we would like those clarifications done and those discretions given to various people removed so that this corruption, which has reached endemic proportions at the highest levels in this country, can be combated and not made worse. But, more than anything else, we come back to what I started with, in the use, alienation and disposition of State land, there are provisions in the Constitution that are being violated. Please look into that and also if you are really concerned about citizens of this country owning land, having rights over land, do not prevent rightful owners from exercising their ownership rights as you are doing in a massive scale in the Northern Province and in a somewhat large scale in the Eastern Province.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) ... . 16 .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I know that.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is only in the case of foreigners.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I will come to that point. , 45, 50, 55, 60 . . These are foreign funds.

, . . , , round tripping, . . , this is called round tripping.

You can skim money off projects and contracts; take it and deposit it in some hedge fund and that hedge fund then invests in a stock market-listed company in Sri Lanka. So, it is the money that is robbed that comes back on a round trip. . . In todays context, Hon. Minister, this word foreigner is not always a person. hedge funds . -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is legally a person. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) It is legally a person. The Templton Fund is a legal person; it is a legal entity. But, it is a connotation of a foreigner. , . It does not happen like that. Let me explain. These entities, the hedge funds invest everywhere in the stock market. I mean, the Sri Lankan companies are also now investing in other countries. So, you have to look at it in the new context of a foreign person, may not

be a person per se. My point is really not that. My point is that, in terms of these companies that are investing in Sri Lanka - whether it is in retail or whatever it maybe - quite a bit of the time have so-called foreign ownership. So, what I am asking is whether you can make a distinction between capital leases and operational leases. It is up to you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, Hon. Member, you are now talking of ownership. If he does not qualify under these, he is perfectly welcome to get a lease; he can go for a lease. Nobody is prohibiting him from going for a lease.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I know that. I am talking about the need to -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You are talking - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No. We are talking of the 15 per cent tax that needs to be paid up front. That is what we are talking of. The issue here is one of policy inconsistency. .

Mr. Presiding Member, I think since of late, our dear Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama seems to be presenting very progressive pieces of legislation before this House, and every legislation has been accepted by the House.

Today too, he has presented a very progressive legislation in the form of Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Bill. In Sinhala it is, " ( ) " , "

Spokesman having said, I quote:

'The Sri Lanka Army released over 18,000 acres of lands in the Jaffna district since 2009 to the people with the dawn of permanent peace..'

. .

It further states, I quote:

'During the humanitarian operation, the Army had taken over these lands mainly for setting up Army camps. However, after liberating the country from the clutches of the LTTE, the Army had been gradually releasing these lands, on which Army camps were set up' .......

It goes on to state, I quote:

According to him, 18,248 acres of land have been released by the Army so far (4,379 acres in 2009, .

Who says this? All this had been stated by Army Media Spokesman Brigadier Ruwan Wanigasooriya and Army Media Director-General Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera. Sir, I am tabling* this news article.

Tamil United Liberation Front's President V. Anandasangaree. Does the Hon. Sumanthiran know him? He does not know him because he has not even seen Jaffna. Hon. V. Anandasangaree is one of the greatest leaders that that community has seen.

Sir, the article goes on to state, I quote:

".....V. Anandasangaree has warned the Sri Lankan government that the European Union Court's annulment of the EU's ban on the LTTE will be a push to revive the separatist, terrorist outfit in the Northern Province."

. , .

The article further states, I quote:

"The veteran Tamil politician told The New Indian Express ....."

.

".....on Friday: 'Pro-LTTE groups both within the island and overseas have received a shot in the arm, and will now openly propagate the LTTEs cause of separatism and terrorism."

This is what the UNP wanted; this is what the TNA wants.

"The TNA will now up its ante reflecting the LTTE's demands'.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Can I make a clarification with regard to the Krrish Tower Project, Hon. Member? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you need time, I can provide. But, I have very little time.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The statement which you made was incorrect, because 86 per cent has been paid. There is only a balance to be paid and additional time has been asked by the investor, and it has been considered.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, if you had listened to me, I said that they have paid Rs. 4.9 billion and Rs. 640 million -

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I listened to what you said, Hon. Member. The issue here is that you are trying to make a big issue about Krrish Towers.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is a waste of time. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) No, it is not a waste of time. You have to make statements in the correct perspective.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, please ensure that you guide the House. I mentioned that Rs. 4,900 million has been paid and another Rs. 640 million has to be paid, and with the interest it is Rs. 840 million at this moment. That is the factual statement I have made. So, why does this Government not have the courage of conviction to listen to that? Previously, there was a Chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission who had come and revealed to this House that they had money exchanged through them. Now, you deny that if you want. The then Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission mentioned that money was moving from one to the other in order to get extension of time. Only now it is revealed that it has taken one and a half years to pay.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [5.50 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Hon. Presiding Member, firstly, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Bill, especially after the speech made by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. I wish to state that he dealt very little with the Bill, but spoke about other matters. I would like to first deal with the Long Title of the Bill, which states, I quote:

to make provisions to stipulate Restrictions on the Alienation of lands in Sri Lanka to foreigners, foreign companies and certain institutions with foreign shareholding; to specify the circumstances where the exemptions are granted; to impose a Land Lease Tax for leasing of lands to foreigners, foreign companies and certain institutions with foreign shareholding; for the granting of concessions to certain development projects; for the repeal of Part VI of the Finance Act, No. 11 of 1963; and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

Therefore, Hon. Presiding Member, there is a need for the introduction of this Bill.

Sir, I would like to go back to history when the United National Party permitted foreign ownership of land in this country. Then, we saw the abuse of those provisions. Especially, in the tourism sector, foreigners used to buy land, invest in property, build hotels and transactions took place overseas. Also, as the Deputy Minister of

Investment Promotion, I would like to state that when I go through some of the files, I have noted that Government properties have been mortgaged to banks, and foreign nationals have abused the process and left the country. So, there has been abuse of land in this country. Land is a limited resource. Therefore, there is a need for the maximum utilization of this resource. This Government is private sector friendly.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! .

.

, , . Whereupon THE HON. JANAKA BANDARA left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you may continue.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, some of the Members of the Opposition made speeches in this House and tried to say that we are not private sector friendly and that there would be severe repercussions to the economy. I would like to state that this Bill would, in no way, affect the economy. We are a private sector friendly regime. If there are any issues whilst this Bill is in operation, we are willing to look at it through a consultative process and the Ministry of Investment Promotion will be a catalyst in this process. As you know, we need to protect the investments into this country and also ; .

We are a country with a land area of only 25,000 square miles. If property prices become excessive, it will be detrimental to the national economy and we cannot allow foreigners to come to Sri Lanka and create a land bank. You can come to Sri Lanka and make use of our property. You can have a 99-year lease and take dividends from your investment, but you cannot create a land bank in Sri Lanka. Not only in Sri Lanka, in many parts of the world, governments have taken steps to prevent this abuse of buying and selling property. We have also permitted a 99-year lease and with regard to the stock exchange, we have introduced a mechanism to deal with some of the issues which were brought before us.

Therefore, Sir, this Bill is the need of the hour. As you know, Sri Lanka is having a growth rate of over 7 per cent. We have brought in this Bill to protect Sri Lankans and also to prevent the abuse of land in Sri Lanka.

1057 1058

2014 20

Therefore, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I do not need to speak at length. I only want to bring it to the notice of this House, as the Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion, that we will be a catalyst in looking at any issue which the private sector would face with regard to this Bill. But, we are very confident that this Bill would not be an impediment to Foreign Direct Investments to this country. As you know, we have reached our targets and Sri Lanka is a vibrant economy and this Bill will not be a deterrent in any form.

Thank you. [.. 5.55]

My point of Order is this. Just before moving this Item, owing to certain factors, we basically came to an agreement that there will be only one speaker from the Government and one speaker from the Opposition. As a result, we stated that we will accede to the request made. But, after saying that, if there was a change of mind, we will reserve the right to have our two speakers as well. So, this is something that will have an impact on the Budget Debate as well.
