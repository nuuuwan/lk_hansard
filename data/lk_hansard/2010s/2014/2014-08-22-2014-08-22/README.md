FOREIGN TRIPS OF POLITICIANS/PUBLIC SERVANTS : MONEY SPENT BY SRI LANKAN EMBASSIES

(a) Will he state -

(ii) if so, the total amount spent by the relevant Embassies for such expenses for the last six years annually;

(iii) the purpose of making the aforesaid payments;

(iv) whether reasons for such payments are personal or official;

(v) if those are on personal reasons, the persons to whom the payments were made; and

(vi) the dates on which such payments were made and the reasons for payments?

(b) If not, why?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of External Affairs, I answer the Question.

(a) (i) No. The Ministry had issued circular instructions to all Missions not to incur any expenditure to cover the expenses of politicians or Public servants.

(ii) Not applicable.

(iii) Not applicable.

(iv) Not applicable.

(v) Not applicable.

(vi) Not applicable.

(b) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, I am astonished that you gave such an answer. I do not want to reveal the names of our Colleagues in Parliament, whose expenses had been covered up. But, I can say with authority that your Mission in Washington has spent more than US Dollars 2 million, reimbursing expenses of Members of Parliament who had been there. The Mission in Thailand, has spent over US Dollars 200,000. I am wondering whether there is a concealment of information in this House. If you saying such a thing, you have to name it. This is what is called misrepresentation to Parliament. I would greatly appreciate if a more truthful answer is given before we come up with names. At that time, it would be embarrassing for you for saying that expenditure was not incurred.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The Ministry had issued circulars instructing all Missions not to incur any expenditure to cover up the expenses of politicians or Public servants. Still, if there are any exigencies, the embassies do pay. But, those have to be reimbursed by the relevant Ministries or departments. We have not allocated any funds for the payment of expenses of Ministers or Public servants. But, we make advances in cases of exigencies and those are reimbursed on a case-by-case basis.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, my intention to raise the question is this. There is no such allocation for the Ministry to get reimbursed in any area, not on a permanent basis, but to be reimbursed.

I did not say that you absorb it into your Ministry. There should be an allocation to do so. But, there have been such instances.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, whether it is from the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Health or Parliament, when you all go to a country and if there is any exigency, we advance money and then get it reimbursed on the instructions of the relevant Ministry or department. We do not allocate money as such and we have not done it for such reasons.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, in that case, I have to ask from the Hon. Deputy Minister my third Supplementary Question, this way. To the United Kingdom, two Ministers had gone and their entertainment expenditure was borne by the Embassy and that particular Ambassador was unable to take clients out for the simple reason that that had happened. I know it is an ongoing situation. I cannot understand why the Hon. Deputy Minister is saying that it is not happening when an Ambassador does not have US Dollars 1,000 for entertainment of clients in the country that he represents.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, it cannot be so because if it is for the Ministry of External Affairs, we allocate money from Colombo if there is any emergency or any exigencies. But, if it is for any other Ministry, we get prior approval and collect the money from the relevant Ministries. But, they do not use their own funds. If they use their funds, it is up to them. Otherwise, they can get prior approval and spend the funds.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will not reveal the names of my Colleagues. But, owing to the misuse of funds, I will ensure that those are sent to you on a confidential note and I would like an honest answer. If you do not do that, it will be publicized in Parliament.

UMA OYA MULTI-PURPOSE SCHEME ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I am very happy to address the House when you are in the Chair.

I move,

"A mega-development project that is being implemented in the hill country in this era is the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose Scheme. The beginning of this scheme dates back to 1953 and it had not been completed as successive governments had to change the project plans on five occasions.

But, under the Mahinda Chintana Programme of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the dream of that project is becoming a reality. It is moved that this Assembly be informed of the following:

i. The purpose of the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose Scheme

ii. The areas covered by it

iii. The benefits accrued to the people through this scheme"

Sir, I table* the Sinhala and the Tamil versions of this Motion to be included in Hansard.

Sir, this is a very important irrigation scheme that is going to help a large number of people in this country by supplying water and electricity. It will also enable a large number of people to be resettled in the new areas that will be created as a result of this scheme.

Sir, this country is blessed with natural resources: water, forestry, gem, fish and various other natural produces. We should be happy that this Government is taking steps in the right direction in order to complete not only this irrigation scheme but various other schemes as well. These are the praiseworthy irrigational schemes initiated by this Government and carried forward. Of course, we must pay tribute to our able, affable Minister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, under whose leadership, - of course, blessed by His Excellency the President - schemes such as Moragahakanda and Kaluganga Reservoir Project, Yan Oya Project, Diversion of Mahaweli Project, Talpitigala Reservoir Project, Dam Safety and Water Resources Planning Project, Lower Malwathu Oya Multisector Development Project, Deduru Oya Reservoir Project, Kivul Oya Reservoir Development Project, Kubukkan Oya Reservoir Project, Welioya Integrated Development Project, Weheragala

1035 1036

Reservoir Project, Menikganga Reservoir Project, Mahaweli Consolidation Project, Morana Reservoir Project, Kalugal Oya Project, Digili Oya Reservoir Project and Gal Oya Navodaya Project, have been implemented.

Sir, I should add a personal note because when the Gal Oya Scheme was started by the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake, my father-in-law, the late Mr. M.M.A. Sameem was recruited as the first storekeeper of the Gal Oya Valley Irrigation Project.

I think the family of the Hon. P. Dayaratna - who is still with us in Parliament - knows that our family resided there and helped the project in a great way. Also, at this moment, my mind goes back to several years where we had Mr. M. M. Ismail, one of the greatest engineers, well-versed in the irrigation system, was in charge of the Gal Oya Development Project.

Then, Sir, the Rideemaliyadda Integrated Development Project and Rambakan Oya Multi-purpose Irrigation Project are also major schemes meant to develop the country like the well-integrated highway network, not only from Colombo to Hambantota or from Colombo to Katunayake but throughout the country. Hon. R. Yogarajan, you, as a person coming from the Plantation Sector, would appreciate the work undertaken by the Government to construct a highway from Colombo to Kandy, which would ease the traffic to a great extent.

Now, Sir, what is Mahinda Chintana? This is the Mahinda Chintana.. The development of the country and bringing back the pristine glory to our motherland is really the Mahinda Chintana. But, sometimes, the Hon. Members of the Opposition ridicule this because they do not want development in this country; they want destruction. Even yesterday, an Hon. Member brought in an Adjournment Motion. He wanted to take it up early. Our Leader of the House and others present at the Party Leaders Meeting are large-hearted and permitted it to be taken up. Even before such a scheme is drawn up and presented and the relevant sections repealed, they bring in a Motion; they are putting the cart before the horse. But, anyway it was debated. Yesterday, it was told in plain Sinhala language, - identity card - ? . . . . .

Coming back to the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project, Sir, Uma Oya which is one of the major tributaries of the Mahaweli River is the major water source of the Rantambe Reservior. The key objective of the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project is to transfer water from this river to the Lunugamwehera

Reservoir and provide for development projects in the Hambantota District. This Project was first drafted by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau in 1991.

Sir, I must say a word about the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. It is one of the best institutions equipped with knowledgeable people. It is a reservoir of brain - I should say - because they have undertaken several projects successfully and without the aid and assistance of any foreign intelligence or expertise they are able to carry out this project progressively so that the country stands to benefit in a large way.

When the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project proposal was submitted to the Asian Development Bank for financial provisions, it was rejected due to violation of water rights of the people by this trans-basin water diversion and technical inadequacies. When you go for this type of help, sometimes they pick holes so that the aid will not be forthcoming. Then, with the involvement of the Government of Iran - that we must remember - an agreement was signed between the existing Governments of the two countries.

The foundation stone of the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project was laid in Alikota-Ara, Wellawaya, at the auspicious time of 10.00 a.m. on 29th April, 2008 under the patronage of the former Prime Minister, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka - who is a Senior Minister in the House today highly respected by not only the Parliamentarians but people of all segments in the country - and Mr. Meer Rasami, Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance of Iran.

There is a salient feature about this project. Its objectives are very much welcome. There are several objectives of the project including generation of hydropower, irrigation, provision of drinking water, and provision of water for industrial activities providing water for the second international airport at the industrial zone in Hambantota.

The greatest bowler produced in the cricket world, Muttiah Muralitharan, does not consider himself a Tamil, or a Sinhalese or a Muslim. He carries the flag of Sri Lanka whenever he goes all over the world. This is what we should do. This is what the people who have gone to New Delhi also should do. They must learn patriotism from Mrs. Sushma Swaraj and come. The Hon. R. Sampanthan, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan and others must learn that from India. The Indians always say, We are Indians. When India and Pakistan play in cricket matches, the Indians say "Jai Hind" and the Pakistanis say Zindabad. Not a single Indian, whether he be a Hindu, a Muslim, a Keralite or a Kannada, will ever say "Zindabad". They would always say Jai Hind. .

What do these Parliamentarians who have gone to India expect Prime Minister Modi to do? That is high level politics; let them decide. But, they can learn something about patriotism: how we should be patriotic to the country that we are born. We drink the water here; we eat rice and other things produced by the Mother Earth of this country and we will die and be buried here. So, why do you have to go internationally?

Sir, I have a book here well-documented by Mr. M.I.M. Mohideen. He is a well-versed surveyor and the Executive Director of Al-Ceylan Muslim Documentation Centre. In a book, he states, "We are quite aware that the internationalization alone will not bring practical solution to the problems faced by the Muslims in Sri Lanka. He has documented many problems faced by the Muslims and the damages caused to certain places. But, still, he emphasizes the fact that internationalization will not bring any practical solution to the problem faced by the Muslims or, for that matter, the Tamils and the others. It is imperative to work out special programmes and negotiations aimed at providing a durable settlement of our grievances with other communities and the Government, based on the principles of equality and natural justice.

Yesterday, there was a news report in the Sudar Oli stating that Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa has said that some Muslims here are trying to get international support for terrorism. That cannot be allowed. Our great leaders have taught us self-reliance; to rely on the country that you born and the people with whom you are living. We have lived here for centuries in peaceful coexistence with the Sinhalese. Even today, that is happening. Yesterday or the day before, there was a book-launch at the BMICH on the public life of Mr. U.L.M. Farook titled " ".
