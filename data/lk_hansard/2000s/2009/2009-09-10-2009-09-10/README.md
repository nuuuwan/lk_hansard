( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you could just mention the total number of tourists who visited Sri Lanka, their countries and the average number of days they have stayed, that would suffice. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) There are over 20 countries. What are the countries that you need to know about? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you could give me the names of the five countries that have the highest figures, that would suffice because we want to know whether they have stayed for less than 24 hours. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) A person who has stayed here for more than 24 hours is deemed to be a tourist. So, all these are people who were not on transit. They are all tourists. They are not transit tourists but tourists. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, in that case, If you could give me the names of the main countries they have come from, it would be appreciated as it is important. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) The total number of tourists from the UK in the year 1999 was 80,919; in the year 2000, 84,693; in the year 2001, 67,830; in the year 2002, 67, 533; in the year 2003, 93,278- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon Minister, to make it casier for you, just give me the figures for the last year along with the country. That would suffice, Otherwise, you will have to go into ten years. Please give me only figures for the last year. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) The Number of tourist arrivals in 2008 is as follows: from the UK, 81,331; from the Middle East, 16,776; from India, 85,238; from Germany, 30,625 and from France, 10,594. Are there any other countries of which you re-quire the figure, Hon. Member? If you want the average, duration of their stay, I can give it for these countries.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please, I want the figures for the last year.

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) The average duration of stay in days, for 2008 is as follows; UK, 9.8; Eastern Europe, 7.9; the Middle East, 7.6; India, 7.2; France, 9.5; Germany, 10.1. The average for the year 2008 is 9.5 days. In answer to (a) (iii) I have here the figures for the years 1999 to 2008. Shall I read the figures only for 2008? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) In the year 2008, the official tourist receipts were Rs. 37,094 million or US Dollars 319.5 million. The ex-penditure by a tourists per day was US Dollars 76.7 In Answer to (b), in 2008, the number of direct em-ployment was 51,857 and the number of indirect employ-ment was 72,599. In Answer to (c), in the year 2008, the number of rooms in hotels was 14,793 and in supplementary estab-lishments, 5,319. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Minister, after the conclusion of the war, we find that in the Eastern Province very valuable beach-front properties are being forcibly encroached and taken over by very powerful peo-ple. Sometimes even the people who belong to the forces are chasing away the traditional residents of those areas and they are applying for licences to set up hotels. This is what we hear. We will come and give the details. We would like you to tell us about the process to follow because there must be a transparent procedure adopted before giving any permission to set up tourist hotels in the East. We also find that dubious deeds and permits are being produced and innocent people who are living in those areas have been chased. Even the UDA is aware of these things and we would like you to give us and opportunity to debate this matter of these days. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Hon. Member, please give me those details We have a very transparent procedure with regard to land when any-body makes and application for development in the East. If there are any complaints, please forward them and we will look into them.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the second Question is, going on the information given by the Hon. Minister the answers that you gave, Hon, Minister-it shows that last year, in the year 2008, 495,000 tourists have came. The answer that you gave also states that the average stay was 7.9 days. If that is the case, four million rooms have been used in this country. But, there are only 11,000 star-class rooms that are regis-tered in this country. Therefore, how on earth did such an influx of tourists been accommodated in a country that has only 11,000 rooms? ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) If you convert that into rooms nights, we can accommodate-

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is why I took your answer. You said 495,000 tourists came to this country. The average stay is 7.9 days. So that means, four million room nights a year. If you divide that by 11,000 star-class rooms that are there in the country, it does not dwell. So there is some- ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

We have other places - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Absolutely. If you say that the average revenue is US Dollars 76 a day, if you multiply that by four million rooms, you get an exorbitant amount of revenue. I mean, your answers do not deal with the questions that we have asked. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Hon. Member, tourists do not reside only in hotels. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Do they reside in IDP camps? ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

Not in IDP camps. But, they would not only reside in hotels. Also, we can accommodate 500,000 tourists. - [Interruption.] We have capacity for 500,000 tourists.

I know that. During the UNP time, all that was built and no new hotels came up thereafter. So the 500,000 tourists - I am talking on the basis of the answer that you gave which states that 500,000 tourists have come. So that into eight days which is the average stay that you said, is four million a year. Your average income is US Dollars 76. So multiply US Dollars 76 by four million. It is going to be a huge amount. You do not need HSBC or IMF loans in future. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

Hon. Member, you can debate what you want. But, the fact remains that these numbers have been taken from the Department of Immigration and Emigration and I have disclosed the number of hotel rooms available. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, disclosing information and truthful disclosure are two different things. I was given only a couple of seconds to comprehend what you said. But, within that short time I could find that there is a huge dis-tortion between what is told and the truth. There is no debate on it. All we want to say is, if there is a four mil-lion bed occupancy, it is fantastic. But, the hotels have had a occupancy ratio for only about 25 to 30 per cent last year. We do not need to hide that. So, in that case, there is something radically wrong with the answer that you have given. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

There is nothing radically wrong with my answer, Hon. Member. You can debate in any way you want. I have disclosed the number of hotel rooms and I stand by my answer. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Okay. The third Question that I would like to ask is with regard to the Chinese inflow. There are 2,100 per-sons who are employed in the construction work of the Hambantota Port. Are they also treated as tourists ? You said anybody who stays for over 24 hours. Does that mean that the workers who have come for the Hamban-tota port construction are also tourists? ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

Hon. Member, you should know that if you come on a work permit, you are not considered as a tourist. I think you know it. [Interruption.] I think you should know the definite meaning: that if anybody comes as a worker, he is on a work permit.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, you do not need to tell us as to how to interpret it. If you are only sincere to your answer that you give us - ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

I am sincere to my answer. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I guess this basically shows the truth behind the tourist development that takes place. We know the difference between a work permit and a tourist. Anybody who criss-crosses via Katunayake is not a tourist. But, Hon. Minis-ter, now that the answer has revealed this fact, the basic question is, where did these tourists go? They did not come to Sri Lanka. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

They did come to Sri Lanka. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

2385 2386

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] ? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . COPE . I am in full agreement with the Hon. Members including the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake on the need for the COPE to have an extensive jurisdiction on wherever Government funds are invested. It is a paramount requirement if we are to have proper financial discipline in this country. The only hindrance here is - the Hon. Ravi Karunanayke and myself joined the previous Attorney-General at a discussion on the requirement of having an Auditor-Generals Report for an examination of accounts. Now, if we can dispense with that requirement and accept their auditors' reports for examination, because what we need is an examination of accounts along with the conduct and functions of these institutions, then we can bring in greater discipline. I think the Standing Orders should be amended in order to accommodate reports coming from certified auditors because they are under the supervision of the Auditor-General. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

This comes out of the Constitution. The Constitution is supreme. Under Article 148 of the Constitution, you have full powers : public finance has to be controlled through Parliament. So, the Committee that is entrusted to do such work flows from the Constitution. You cannot have this in abstract and take the lacuna in the Standing Orders on the Committee on Public Enterprises to ensure institutions that are taking almost 1 per cent of the GDP -

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

In other words, do you ask me just to throw away the Standing Orders or act contrary to the provisions in the Standing Orders? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

I think the only suggestion, the only solution is to amend the Standing Orders so that we can dispense with the provision regarding the Auditor-Generals Report and go by the audited report and examine the accounts.

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. In fact, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition went into great detail in terms of a case that has already been heard; the due process of law has taken its course and the accused has been convicted. I will come to that aspect during the course of my speech.

Sir, as we all are aware, having remained victims of terrorism for over 27 years, the people of Sri Lanka have just crossed over to a new epoch of peace and development. Encountering the brutal terror of a ruthless enemy in the military front required a great deal of commitment and dedication on the part of all those who were involved in it, from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to the soldiers, facing the obstacles in the political front which surfaced in innumerable guises both locally and internationally required by no small measure, sheer farsightedness and resolve on the part of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Government. I need not emphasize how various forces tried, in vain, to stop the Government in its march to victory. The story is long and now history which is no secret to any of us, anymore. I am making this statement to assess the developments which followed this victory over terrorism and in that backdrop to bring to the attention of this House some challenges unfolding before us. The first daunting task which demanded our priority in the aftermath of the defeat of the terrorists was, as I have told this House before, to provide all the necessary facilities including shelter, food, medical assistance, getting ready new areas for permanent resettlement for the population in the North, numbering approximately 280,000. The task by its very nature, never looked easy. But, it never looked insurmountable either to a Government which had the confidence of its ability to fulfil this undertaking having experience in the East and unwavering commitment to the welfare of the people. We have shown the world the progress achieved between the years 2006 and 2008 in the East in resettling all those civilians who had been displaced due to fighting. The Governments efforts in facing these challenges are evidenced by the comprehensive programmes launched in the aftermath of the defeat of terrorists and the rescuing of all civilians held hostage by them. At that hour, the top priority was to attend to the urgent needs of those who had been displaced. You would recall that the process was monitored at the highest levels of the Government. Many steps were taken swiftly to bring back normalcy to the lives of the displaced. Some of these programmes had been initiated even prior to the defeat of the terrorists. They all have been related to post-conflict reconstruction and resettlement, rehabilitation and reconciliation. As you are aware, as the first step, the displaced were accommodated in welfare centres in Vavuniya, following a registration process which was hurriedly arranged with the exodus of people from the area of conflict. These people were held by the LTTE as a human shield in the No-Fire Zone. That is where His Excellency the President made special mention in his address at the beginning of May and asked everyone to return to the safe-zone of the Government and this call was answered by the people. Their walking into the Government-controlled areas at

[ ]

2401 2402

that time against the resistance of the LTTE proved the faith that the people have on our Government. The Government wanted to ensure a roof over everybodys head, which task was deftly completed. Immediate action was taken to regularize matters relating to their basic needs such as food, water, sanitation and healthcare. There have been no cases of starvation, nor epidemics which stand testimony to the efficacy with which the Government has worked despite many difficulties. These centres have been visited by journalists, both local and international, and also by a number of prominent foreign dignitaries including the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Those who have visited, including the officials of the United Nations, have positively acknowledged the Governments efforts of progress and pledged support to Sri Lanka. In fact, Sri Lanka continues to receive assistance from its friends in the international community who are working with 53 international non-governmental organizations and the UN in providing relief services to the displaced. The Government remains committed to resettling the people and restoring their livelihood in the shortest possible time in their original villages whilst implementing a massive development drive. In fact, providing food amounting to a million packs a day is no mean task for the Government and resettlement, and therefore becomes a priority. In addition to the 59,608 IDPs who have already been resettled in the past few months, another 15,000 from the Jaffna District will soon be resettled in their original homes. One of the impediments to the process of resettlement is the evidence that some terrorist cadres have infiltrated the IDPs and the release of the civilians very correctly depends on a screening process. The worst challenge in this regard, however, is the extensive mining by the terrorists in these areas which were previously held by them. There are eight de-mining organizations currently working in Sri Lanka. Large caches of weapons and ammunition continue to be found. Mine clearance has been accelerated with the security forces and international collaborator teams working together. However, due to opposing philosophies surfacing in the procedure of mine clearance where one school of thought favours first investigating the presence of mines in areas and then de-activating them, and the other favours de-mining without an initial investigative process, the speed of the de-mining has been stymied to an extent. However, the security forces have been delivering a yeoman service in de-mining and therefore, the Government has sought assistance in procuring equipment through the international community. In fact, the Government procured the de-mining equipment and airlifted them in order to ensure rapid clearance of mines. As you are aware, de-mining is a tedious process and it has to be technically handled to the best. But, we have achieved a commendable progress in this regard. In fact, the UNICEF recently acknowledged the Governments efforts in ensuring a secure environment for the people who have been resettled.

Under the family reunification programme, over 5,000 people have been re-united within the IDP relief villages with further releases anticipated in the near future after bona fides and capacities of prospective host families are established. It may also be noted that a number of persons released to host families have returned to the welfare villages re-seeking refuge and the Government will provide adequate refuge and support to them.

While these programmes are ongoing, a number of steps have been taken to reduce overcrowding in the relief villages, ensuring the provision for water, sanitation and pipe-borne water sufficient for 250,000 people. The WFP has stated that sufficient food was reaching the people in these villages, and therefore the incidents of malnutrition have been drastically reduced.

The resettled civilians also have been provided with livelihood support. Infrastructure facilities in these villages have been restored and improvements are being carried out. The Presidential Task Force which is overseeing resettlement, development and security in the Northern Province has taken several steps to stabilize the living standards and income of the people from that region coming under the ongoing programmes for rehabilitation.

The process of political reconciliation has already been initiated with the Local Government Elections in the Jaffna and Vavuniya Districts which have not been held in the last several years or several decades. You would no doubt agree that the pace of addressing issues related to reconciliation has to be determined by the Government since it is best placed to interpret the ground situation which needs to be in tandem with the policies to be implemented. His Excellency the President being cognizant of the need for reconciliation process and having recognized that it is now timely for political proposals to be presented, has sought to engage with the wider polity. We must welcome the Tamil National Alliance coming on board with regard to assisting the Government in its endeavours in bringing normalcy back to the lives of the displaced. It is hoped that the TNA would also become involved in the political process in the near future, which is imperative for reconciliation. The draft proposals of the All Party Representative Committee are presently under consideration.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, various questions have been raised all this time by many parties on the situation of the IDPs and their resettlement. It is imperative to be mindful of the fact that the fallout of the three-decade old conflict is still in existence. The terrorist militancy has completely destroyed a large extent of the North, the rebuilding of which will undoubtedly take time. Let me place on record that the Governments resolution to address all the issues relating to the post-conflict phase, remains intact. However, action towards this end should be taken at a pace determined by the Government of Sri Lanka.

2009 10 2403 2404

All that the Government requires is space and constructive understanding. To be clearer, we need space for progress in our efforts, and constructive engagement from our international friends. Whilst all these efforts are underway, it is regrettably no secret that some critics of Sri Lanka, either as a result of their being misinformed or by their lack of understanding of the ground realities in the country, have been harsh and unfair. In fact, the time and energy they have spent vilifying Sri Lanka could have been well spent in assisting the country to come out of the devastation caused by decades-long bane of terror. It is regrettable that some untenable observations by some sections of these critics only had the potential to polarize the Tamil community from the Government at a time it is painstakingly seeking to follow a path of reconciliation. Sri Lanka was compelled to withstand many a fanciful allegation, particularly towards the end of the conflict. The critics seemed to have easily missed the point that it is a democratically elected government which had to legitimately fight a banned terrorist organization for being responsible for a trail of blood and subjugation of the people through intimidation marking a dark period of this country, while trying to maintain law and order and the fundamental rights of all its citizens. In fact, a good deal of these allegations have been targeting the valiant armed forces in sinister moves to implicate them in the alleged violation of international humanitarian laws. Both in the prosecution of the hostilities against the LTTE as well as in the post-conflict operations catering to the needs of the IDPs, our security forces have exemplified the noble and sublime values of all the great religions and cultures of co-existing peacefully amidst our people. However, a culmination of the sad vicious trend was evidenced most recently in the ludicrous allegation made against our armed forces by Channel 4 television in the UK. The Government has reiterated its strong and unequivocal rejection of the contents of this video footage. That is a con story and scientific proof has been brought up to confirm that the video is a fabrication. The fact remains that the TV channel has not checked the authenticity of the contents or its location. It is also surprising that the supplier of the footage has not come forward to answer any of the questions raised on its authenticity. It is also regrettable that some sections of the international community seem to be giving undue credence to this doctored video, by their calls for an international inquiry. Reputed television networks should conduct themselves ethically and with decorum and not be driven by interest groups seeking to undermine sovereignty of countries. Hon. Deputy Speaker, much interest has been evinced from different quarters in the case of Mr. J.S. Tissainayagam, possibly because he is a journalist. The

Hon. Leader of the Opposition went into great length in order to discuss the case before this House a little while ago. In reply to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I must state that this is a judicial process. When a conviction is made by the High Court of Colombo, are we in a position to discuss the merits of that conviction? The appellate procedures are still open. As we understand, a convict will always have recourse to the appellate procedures in the country. Discussing this matter is sub judice in terms of appellate procedures at this stage and I was wondering the propriety of discussing this issue. Is it because he was a journalist?

Now these are the questions that we have to answer. It is regrettable that the verdict of the court is being portrayed as a threat to freedom of expression in Sri Lanka when an indictment had been filed against him through the normal judicial procedure of this country. The High Court commenced its trial on 9th September 2008 and Mr. Tissainayagam has made a confession disclosing his links with the LTTE. The international community have overlooked that Mr. Tissainayagam has been found guilty of inciting terrorism and related issues. He is not the only one to have been convicted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), but just one of them. Those who have conspired with terrorists in a manner to pose a threat to the security of this country have been convicted earlier, including some members of the security forces. In fact, a senior police officer who is also in detention for alleged links with the LTTE, investigations on which is presently on going, is a case in point. It may be recalled that Tissainayagam was also in detention in the same manner. Those who have expressed concern on the Tissainayagam verdict therefore must realize that due process of law has taken place and no one in this country is above the law, be it a journalist or a member of the security forces. Mr. Tissainayagam can still have recourse to the appellate courts in accordance with Sri Lankas judicial process. The criticism of the judicial action could amount to the disrespect of the laws of this country and to the judiciary of Sri Lanka and I would have been happier if the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was mindful of that fact.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, please give me two more minutes. With regard to the concerns expressed by many interested parties about access issues and the role of the ICRC, it may be noted that the nature of work undertaken by the ICRC as well as other international organizations has changed with Sri Lanka entering a post-conflict era. Due procedures have been laid for genuine assistance from civil society organizations to come and work in Sri Lanka, which are followed by many such organizations. In fact, the UN Resident Coordinator has expressly informed me that access to humanitarian organizations working in the IDP welfare centres is now not an issue of concern. Further, the Government is in discussion with the ICRC in working out a new mandate reflecting the ground realities and the post-conflict scenario.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Government seeks to engage with the international community because we are transparent to the world at large. Despite all the misconceptions formed, Sri Lanka is always open for a wider engagement with the international community. In fact, we are amenable to re-orient our relations according to the unfolding needs on ground for which we expect reciprocity and mutual understanding of our international partners. I have quoted in this House before from His Excellency the Presidents address at the Victory Day Parade on 3rd June, Sir. It states, I quote: As a nation we have to go very far to make our independence complete. Terrorists were able to get the world to bring pressure on us, a free and sovereign State. That was possible because the terrorists had the capability to bring pressure on those governments. Therefore, it is necessary to begin a new era in foreign relations to safeguard my motherland. Having won the freedom of our motherland, we must next establish our freedom and sovereignty internationally. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . Let me also quote from the said speech of His Excellency the President where he paid a warm tribute to Sri Lankas friends. We have also been able to build genuine good relations with the international community. These honest friends have carried out the greatest responsibility towards our freedom and sovereignty in this era. We value very much the assistance we received from all these countries at this moment. Our people who enjoy the satisfaction of freedom together with them must always have in their hearts the friendship extended by these friends. Hon. Deputy Speaker, the call of the hour is for us to shed all differences arrived through erroneous notions, political or otherwise, and to ensure unity amongst us as a nation at this historic juncture. Sri Lanka is at the threshold of an era of peace and harmony, a long-cherished dream, which can certainly be a reality only with that kind of unity and determination. Towards that end, we need our friends and we welcome our friends from all over to join hands with us in our quest for sustainable peace and prosperity for our people. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Hon. Minister, can I have a clarification? You are talking of international friends, cooperation et cetera. May I know why the Foreign Secretary has been refused

visa? Todays newspapers carry headlines on that. Not only the Foreign Secretary but also a Member of Parliament, the Attorney-General and an entourage of the President who were to go to the United Nations have been refused visas. So, where is the friendship? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I must state here, categorically - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

You have destroyed the friendship among the international community. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Hon. Member, have you finished? [Interruption.] - Let me respond to that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I am very happy that you raised this. Again an erroneous statement has appeared in some of the newspapers today. The Foreign Secretary saw me before he left for New York. He is our Permanent Representative to the United Nations. There was no refusal of his visa by the British High Commission in Colombo and also there was no refusal of visa to a Member of Parliament. I must state this categorically. These are two erroneous statements that have come to light. There has also not been any refusal of visas to the Presidents entourage to the United Nations because for one thing, His Excellency the President is not going to the United Nations Assembly this time. Even to the delegation, no refusal has been made. That is my reply to the Hon. Member. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

Thank you very much.

Venerable Presiding Member, we are debating the extension of the state of Emergency which has gone on in this country for so many years, in fact, so many decades and after the commencement of the military confrontation, the Emergency was justified on account of the war. Now, the war has come to an end, but still we have Emergency rule. Emergency rule in any country is regarded as being a very extraordinary measure taken for a limited period of time for a limited purpose. But, in this country, very unfortunately, all successive Governments seem to have decided that an Emergency is required for them to govern the country, which normally should be governed without

an Emergency in keeping with the normal laws of the country and the Constitution of the country. Perhaps, the Emergency is required in this country for the simple reason that we do not have a proper Constitution in this country. We do not have a constitution based upon consensus amongst the different peoples who inhabit this country. It is probably the non - existence of a Constitution, which we all accept as the supreme law of the land, which is the reason for the successive Governments to think that they need to be clothed with the Emergency powers to be in a position to even exercise normal powers of governance. If the present situation continues, I have no doubt this country will indefinitely continue under Emergency rule. Having said that, Venerable Presiding Member, I want to state in this House today the position of the approximately 280,000 people who are being detained presently in various camps in the Vanni. We have insisted that these people must be resettled at the earliest and that they must be fully rehabilitated on the same lands, in the same districts from which they were displaced; they are entitled to go back to the same lands in the same districts from which they were displaced. The Government gave a commitment to India, the UN and the international community that the resettlement of these people on the lands from which they were displaced would be substantially completed to the extent of at least 80 per cent within 180 days. This commitment was made by the Government almost immediately after the war came to an end, which would mean about the third week of May. The months of June, July and August have gone by and now we are in September, which would mean that about 100 days have already lapsed, but in the matter of resettlement, I think I would be correct to state that very little progress has been made. In fact, we had a meeting with His Excellency the President and his staff on Monday, the 7th of this month. In the course of the meeting I mentioned that not even 10 per cent of the displaced people had been resettled in the course of the last three months and a little more. The response of the Government was, they gave us the figures and that amounted to only 8 1/2 per cent. There is no contradiction in regard to the matter. The Government expressed their confidence that they would be able to complete the resettlement programme substantially as mentioned by them within the stipulated time period. I am mentioning these facts because the true position needs to be known by the country; needs to be known by everybody, for us to make a realistic assessment of what needs to be done. We want these people to be resettled; we want their houses to be reconstructed; we want them to be in a position to commence their traditional employment - their farming, their fishing, their animal husbandry. These people who led an honourable life generating their own income, not depending on any Government dole, have today been rendered destitute and I think it is the obligation on the part of the Government

2421 2422

[ . ]

to ensure that these people are afforded every facility and every opportunity to be in a position to recommence the generation of their own income through being employed in their traditional employment. In regard to the camps, I would like to just place on record in this House some reports in regard to its conditions. One report that appeared in the "The Sunday Times" of 6th August, 2009 states, I quote: More than 100,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in Wanni camps are without proper shelter as heavy rains begin to lash the area. Zone two and four of the Menik Farm Camp were the worst affected as the rain water flowing through the camp has made it impossible for the people who are in temporary shelters made of plastic sheets to stay in their tents. They are staying in temporary shelters made of plastic sheets. Another report of 23rd August, 2009, again from "The Sunday Times" states, I quote: So far no steps have been taken to move those living in the worst affected areas out of the camps. Instead, they are being relocated within the camps. The IDPs were compelled to seek shelter in temporary schools have returned to their tents. Unfortunately, the floors and the walls are still soaked from the rains. Meanwhile, the IDPs in zones that had switched from common cooking to individual cooking are unable to cook because of the muddy conditions, and are surviving on biscuits and water provided by humanitarian organizations. Then, another report states, Roofs of tents have been blown away by strong winds. As camps are flooded, vehicles have found it difficult to reach the IDPs with help. Toilet pits are overflowing and whole areas are stinking. Huge concerns over health and sanitation. Tents in Zones 4 and 5 do not have cemented floors. IDPs are forced to sleep on sandy floors, which of course are now too wet to inhabit. All reports concur that tensions within the camps over conditions of internment are rising. This, Presiding Member, is the position in the camps. People are deprived on account of food, on account of medicines, on account of drinking water, on account of proper sanitation and I do not think these persons can continue to remain in these camps indefinitely. It is absolutely imperative that these people must be resettled at the earliest. Amnesty International issued a statement on the 11th of August, calling upon the Government to release these people virtually implying that the Government had no authority under the law to keep these people detained in this way in these camps. In the course of that statement, Amnesty International even referred to the fact that persons rendering service in the camps cannot even talk to the people. The people are being virtually kept there like prisoners. These people cannot even talk with the persons

who go there to render some service. Amnesty International has stated that of the approximately 280,000 persons who are in these camps, 50,000 are children and they are suffering immensely and that the Government must not continue to keep these people but must release them at the earliest. I think two factors must be mentioned. One is, the Government is largely stuck with this position on account of it taking up the position that when fighting was going on in the conflict area, there were only 70,000 people there. The Government persisted in that position but eventually more than 300,000 people came out of that area while the fighting was going on, proving the Governments statement to be completely inaccurate, which not merely shows that the Government has been sending food, medicine and other essentials for only 70,000 people, that the Government was totally unprepared to receive over 300,000 people when they came out. I am also inclined to think that the Government is devoid of resources and does not have the adequate resources to be in a position to implement the resettlement programme expeditiously and efficiently. In fact, I have read some press reports made by important personalities in Government particularly in the defence sector - that a large quantity of weapons were bought to conduct the war, that these weapons were bought on credit and that those loans have got to be repaid; that debt has to be repaid and that is the priority in which the Government cannot default and the Government does not have the resources to carry out the resettlement and rehabilitation programme. Those same persons have mentioned that unless the international community is prepared to help the Government, the Government will find it extremely difficult to be able to implement the resettlement and rehabilitation programme. I do not think, Venerable Presiding Member, that the international community, though willing to help, has yet come forward to offer much help to the Government because I do not think the international community is quite happy with the way in which the Government is conducting and implementing this programme of resettlement and rehabilitation. A Task Force has been appointed comprising largely of military personnel and some civilian officials from outside the North-East. There are about 19 or 20 people of whom only two are Tamils appointed subsequently after the matter was raised. These people do not have any empathy with the IDPs; there is no understanding with the IDPs; they are unable to interact with the IDPs. In fact, they do not interact with the IDPs. The whole thing is being carried on like a mechanical process with a few people getting things done here and there in an ad hoc way. I do not think the requirements of the people in the camps are being adequately addressed by the mechanism that has been set up to deal with this situation and I think that that is one of the reasons why the international community has

2009 10 2423 2424

not thus far come up with very substantial help to the Government to implement this programme. We have not the slightest doubt that they would be willing to do so if they are able to repose confidence in the manner in which this programme is being conducted by the Government. The Government mentioned to us that certain categories of IDPs like public servants, persons above 60 years of age, university students and such other people were being released. We impressed upon the Government when we met with the President that it must also release persons whose relatives or friends are prepared to accommodate them in their homes. We said if that is done, there is a likelihood of the numbers being reduced substantially and these IDPs can move into the houses of relatives and friends who are prepared to accommodate them in their homes. We requested from the Government to publish information in regard to this matter in the newspapers in Jaffna where probably there will be the largest number of people who will be willing to accommodate these persons in their homes and the Government said that they were prepared to implement such an arrangement and that such information will be published in the newspapers in Jaffna. In fact, the Government also seems to have been thinking on the same lines. We do hope that that information will be published and if that information has been published, follow-up action in regard to releasing these IDPs who can be accommodated in the homes of friends and relations will be expedited. Then, that would contribute to the number of persons in the camps being reduced to some extent. We are of the view, Venerable Presiding Member, that simultaneously with the resettlement of the Tamil IDPs in the camps in the Vanni, they must also commence and implement the resettlement of the displaced Muslim people, who are now in Puttalam, in their lands and in their homes in Jaffna. We, in fact, mentioned this to the President and the President was trying to give priority to the resettlement of the Tamils from Vavuniya in their lands, but we are of the view that simultaneously with the resettlement of the Tamils, the resettlement of those Muslim IDPs, who are presently in Puttalam, must also take place in Jaffna. I do not want to be seen as blaming the Government, but I must state very frankly on the Floor of this House that we are not happy with this mechanism which is presently functioning to implement this programme of resettlement and rehabilitation. We, the Members of Parliament representing these people, are unable to go to these camps. We are not consulted in regard to what is happening in these camps. We would like to serve in such a way that we can effectively help in the matter of resettlement of these people. We mentioned that to the President and told him that our Members of Parliament representing these areas must be incorporated in the arrangement that has been set up to deal with this matter. Venerable Presiding Member, we ourselves can be helpful

in the matter of resettlement and rehabilitation. That would certainly be a method by which the present arrangement can be made more efficient and more effective. The President told us that he would consider the matter. He wanted some time to be able to come back to us on this question, but we want to impress that this must be done expeditiously with the monsoon just started. From the reports I have read to you, you will see to what extent the people are already being affected and when the monsoon gets worse in the coming days and weeks - we are now in September - in the months of October and November, the position in these camps is bound to be tremendously bad, terribly bad. Before such a calamity occurs, I think everything possible should be done to try and reduce the number of people in the camps and to resettle people as quickly as it is possible.

Venerable Presiding Member, one other matter the Government mentioned to us is that the main problem in resettling people was the fact that some areas or the areas have to be de-mined. We have given the Government a list of areas where de-mining is not required. I would like to place on record a list of those areas where, in our view, de-mining is not required or if at all, is only very minimally required and we impressed upon the Government that resettlement can commence in these areas where de-mining is not required. There are areas in the Vavuniya North DS Division, Nedunkerny DS Division, Mullaitivu District, Kilinochchi West, Kilinochchi East and in Jaffna where de-mining would be required, according to the information that we have been able to gather, only very minimally. I am tabling* that list to be included in the Hansard, Venerable Presiding Member, for the information of the House. We also discussed with the Government the question of de-mining at some length and asked them to first de-mine smaller areas so that people can settle in those areas and the adjoining areas and then move into the larger areas. The Government has agreed to give effect to some of the suggestions that we had to make in regard to this matter. But, I think de-mining must be expedited and resettlement cannot be indefinitely delayed on the ground of de-mining because the impression is gathering amongst the people at large that de-mining is becoming an excuse for the Government to delay the resettlement programme and that impression must not be allowed to gather strength and become a serious issue.

The other matter that we are concerned about is the screening and weeding out LTTE cadres. I think while at the meeting that we had with the President, I did not get the impression of this matter being given too much importance though there was undoubtedly much concern about security.

[ . ]

I have with me a statement made by the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights. I think the management of human rights by this Ministry is the biggest disaster that this Minister is confronted with and has to handle. Minister Samarasinghe in a statement has in the the "Daily Mirror" of 29th of August, 2009, stated, I quote: The government has reliable information that LTTE cadres have infiltrated the ranks of the IDPs in Vavuniya and utmost care has to be taken in permitting even limited freedom of movement as the risk exists of LTTE cadres posing as civilian IDPs and associating with the general population,.. It further states, I quote: the government has screened and ready to release over 10,000 persons from welfare centres and relief villages who are elderly, some pregnant mothers, lactating mothers with children. We have reliable information that LTTE cadres have infiltrated the ranks of the IDPs. Until the screening process is completed and these elements are identified and apprehended we have to take utmost care in permitting even limited freedom of movement as the risk exists of LTTE cadres posing as civilian IDPs associating with the general population. This is a chance we cannot afford to take. Now, I think this is a rather disingenuous statement on the part of the Minister. There are 280,000 people or thereabouts who are in detention camps, who are suffering; and these people's sufferings did not start just now. They have been suffering for a long time. It must be remembered that non-combatant Tamil civilian population have borne the agony of aerial bombardment, artillery shelling, multi-barrel rocket launch fire and attacks by deep penetration units from about the middle of 2006. For almost the past three years, our people have been bearing this. Of course, they were carried out by the Government forces in the name of fighting the LTTE. But, non-combatant Tamil civilians were the worst affected. Tamil ordinary civilians; men, women and children, human rights and civil society activists, members of the clergy, Government servants and students were all victims. They were killed, they were maimed, and they were displaced and the position became worse as the fighting intensified. Tamil civilians were displaced in their thousands, they were maimed and killed in their scores and hundreds were deprived of food, medicine and shelter. Their suffering in every way multiplied several times over. This happened to non-combatant Tamil civilians and in the final stages of the war against the LTTE it is believed that thousands of Tamil civilians were killed and maimed. Do these people have to suffer even after the decimation of the LTTE, and when they have come to these camps? Can a minister make a statement as irresponsible as the statement made by the Minister? Surely when you want to weed out the LTTE from the camps, you do not have to examine every single person in that camp. There are 280,000 people in that camp. You surely can identify those persons who are not LTTEers very easily. Even if there is some justification in the

belief that there are some LTTEers there, who presently are unarmed in the camps under your control, are you saying that merely because you want to weed out a hundred or two hundred people out of 280,000, you are going to carry on doing that for one year, or for several months? I think the Government can do this screening programme much more expeditiously than what the Minister contemplates in the statement he has made because the Minister thinks in terms of taking his own sweet time in regard to screening these people and identifying the LTTE cadres. These poor people who are there have suffered from middle of the year 2006 - for the last three years - and continue to suffer and I think that would be nothing short of cruelty and down right torture. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Pardon me, how much more time do I have? ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Ten minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I started only at ten minutes to 1.00 o'clock. ( ) (The Presiding Member)

You have 20 minutes more. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I would therefore think that this question of screening and identification must not become an excuse again for the delay in IDPs being released. You must first identify those persons who are not LTTEers. That can be done much more easily. Thousands and thousands of those innocent people who are so identified can be released to their friends and relatives or resettled. I think some people want to keep the LTTE bogey alive because they think that keeping this bogey alive is necessary for their political survival and their political future. These poor, unarmed, non-combatant Tamil civilians cannot be expected to pay the price for the fulfillment of the ambitions of these people. I think quite frankly, the Tamil civilians who are in these camps must be consulted. They

2009 10 2427 2428

must be given the freedom to make an informed choice in regard to what their future should be; whether they would join their friends and relatives or whether they would go back to the lands from which they were displaced and recommence their lives. So, as I said before, Venerable Presiding Member, we want to be involved in this programme because we honestly feel that if we are involved in this programme, the programme can be implemented much more effectively and much more efficiently and I want to make an appeal to the Government and to His Excellency the President on the Floor of this House that the Government must permit the Members of Parliament representing these people from the Jaffna and the Vanni in particular, and from parts of the Eastern Province to be involved in this programme in regard to resettlement. We also mentioned to His Excellency the President that as a democratic party, particularly given the fact that three of our Members of Parliament have been assassinated, that is, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj and the Hon. K. Sivanesan, that we must be provided adequate protection in the pursuit of political activities, particularly in the North-Eastern part of this country. You claim that you want to install democracy, that you are a democratic country, and you are talking about elections that are due probably in the course of the coming months. Given the history that three of our politicians have been assassinated, we must have some assurance from the Government that our Members of Parliament will be able to freely engage in political activity in the North-East and that the Government would ensure our security so that our Members of Parliament will be in a position to freely function in the interests of the people in all the areas in the North-East and engage in political activity. We also mentioned to the Government and the President about the need to disband and disarm all paramilitary groups and recover all their weapons. There is no need any longer for their existence. Maybe at some time the Government may have thought that they would be useful in dealing with the LTTE but that position does not exist any longer and we would therefore urge the Government to ensure that these paramilitary groups are completely disarmed, disbanded and made militarily ineffective. Law and order can be effectively maintained in the North-East only when these paramilitary groups are disbanded. We are not satisfied that they have all been disbanded and disarmed fully though partially the Government may have taken certain steps and we would urge the Government to do that. We would also urge that our people in the North-East have the freedom to carry on their traditional occupation without any impediment. Maybe the Government has lifted restrictions, but there are some restrictions still prevailing in certain areas in the matter of farming, fishing and animal husbandry. So our people should be

able to recommence life and generate their own income in the same manner in which they were able to do before the war commenced. It is necessary not merely in the interest of these people but also in the interest of the economy of this country. We also urge the President and the Government that the armed forces and the military apparatus must go back to the situation prevalent before the commencement of the military conflict. There must be dismantling of checkpoints, mini and major camps and high security zones. They were established only for a purpose and that purpose no longer exists, our people must be able to get back to their lands and live on these lands and carry on their occupation on these lands. Our people have suffered immensely as a result of being deprived of these lands. The presence of the armed forces in large numbers amongst our people is a source of great harassment. It is like living in an open prison with the presence of the armed forces. They are treated like subjects and second class citizens with the Army on your left, on your right, behind you, in front of you, all over, camps and checkpoints, high security zones. Now that the war has come to an end we urge the President and the Government that all these must be dismantled and we must get back to the pre-conflict situation. What is required is brain, not brawn. You must have proper intelligence to be able to discover if anything is going wrong. You cannot do that by a heavy army presence. Our people should have the freedom to live with dignity, the way we traditionally lived. The fact that there was a war for a period of time must not become an excuse to deprive our people of their dignity and their freedom. We impressed upon the Government that there must not be any further mobilization of the armed forces in the North-East and the opening of new army camps, new army cantonments, further mobilization of the armed forces in the North-East can only be seen as an effort by the Government to suppress and oppress the Tamil people, and make them live like subjects and second class citizens in this country which is unacceptable and which will never be accepted. We also brought to the notice of the Government, Venerable Presiding Member, I did so without any desire to raise any controversy that there must not be any effort to promote majoritarian, ethnic or religious interests in the North-East. We have very strong information of the construction of a Buddhist Vihara at the entrance of Elephant Pass and other Buddhist constructions in Kilinochchi, construction of monuments for the military. A large number of civilian buildings and shops have been destroyed in the process of this being done. The cultural hall in the Kilinochchi District had been destroyed, the garden where there were some valuable trees which was regarded as a national park belonging to the Kilinochchi Pradeshiya Sabha has been destroyed and this has been done in order to promote certain activities which are seen as the promotion of majoritarian ethnic and religious interests. We have information that this is happening in Mullaitivu also. Even in parts of the Eastern Province on that new road constructed from

2429 2430

[ . ]

Seruwila to Polonnaruwa people of the majority community are being settled on both sides of the road, on the Trincomale-Anuradhapura road between Mudaliyarkulam and Kitulutu, once again people of the majority community are being settled on both sides of the road. These things are not conducive to the promotion of national reconciliation or the restoration of religious and communal harmony and we were assured by the President that no such activities are taking place other than reconstructing a Buddhist a temple in Kilinochchi. There is no problem in regard to that matter. There was a temple earlier, it can be reconstructed and we were assured by the President that he will not permit any of these things to happen. In fact, the Governor of the Northern Province was present at the conference and the President got him also to give us the assurance that no such things will happen. We would urge the Government to stick to their commitments and ensure that these efforts by some misguided people are not proceeded with. We are not making this claim on the basis of any exclusivity to any area, but on the basis that it is unjust for the State or the armed forces to engage in such activity, particularly in a situation such as the present situation. Is this what the State means by Tamil liberation? Was the LTTE destroyed and defeated to enable the Government or the armed forces to carry out such programmes? That in fact is a position that would be totally unacceptable. Therefore, we would earnestly appeal to the Government to ensure that Government keeps its commitments and that the people would not have to suffer when they go back as a result of these new constructions that have come up in those areas. Some people in the Eastern Province, particularly in the Mutur East area in the Trincomalee District, from Sampur East, Sampur West, Koonitivu, Soodaikuda, Navaratnapuram, Kadatkarachchena and Sampur Kali, in all 1,406 families have yet to be resettled. That is because the area on which they lived has been declared as a high security zone. The LTTE is not there. The LTTE weapons are not there. You do not call us terrorists. Why cannot we go and live there? Even if you are concerned about security only in some part of that area, surely we can meet, discuss and come to some arrangement by which these people can be accommodated in some reasonable way. What are you trying to do? You are taking the farmers from these areas to a place called Pallikudiruppu and trying to give them 20 perches of land. You are taking the fishermen to a place called Ralkuli and trying to give them 20 perches of land. These are persons who owned several acres. These are persons who lived on substantial residential properties. You want to give them just 20 perches of land and ask them to survive. They have refused to go and in fact when they refused to go, some of the security forces have threatened them with assault. They still said that they will not go. So we want the

Government to look at this question of resettlement of these people and to ensure that these people are resettled in an acceptable way, in a way that will enable them to commence their lives once again and lead an honourable, respectable life rather than live like beggars, which is what you are trying to do at the moment.

We were told, that about 3,500 people from the camps in Vavuniya were going be transported to Trincomalee on the 28th or 29th of August. In fact, 1,000 people had already assembled and the buses had come for the people to go. But at the last moment that programme was called off and the people did not go. We raised this question with His Excellency the President at the meeting we had with him on the 7th of this month and we were assured by the Presidents Adviser, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, who is here in the House, that these people will be sent back before the 15th of this month. We are happy for that assurance and I am sure it will be done.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa)

Yes, it will be done.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Thank you. Venerable Presiding Member, how much more time do I have?

( ) (The Presiding Member)

You have two more minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I have got many other matters to talk about, but I will not have the time to talk about them. I want to merely say this. Why is all this happening in this country? All this is happening in this country because the Tamil people in this country, from 1956, through their democratic verdicts, have asked for the right to internal self-determination. That is for substantial regional autonomy in the areas in which they live - in the North and the East - to enable them to manage their affairs. That is their most fundamental human right. That is a right recognized by the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is a right recognized by the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. You cannot deny it to them. You can deny them external self-determination. But, you cannot deny them internal self-determination. Within the framework of an undivided united country, those people

2009 10 2431 2432

have a fundamental human right to be able to exercise the right to internal self-determination, to manage their affairs and determine their destiny in the areas which they have historically inhabited. You have not given them that right. International law says that when you consistently refuse to grant that right and when people are suppressed and oppressed in that situation, they acquire the right to external self-determination.

I want to make an appeal to your Government; come up with a political solution that recognizes the right of the Tamil-speaking people - the Tamil and the Muslim people - of the North and the East to internal self-determination in the areas of their historical habitation. Once you do that, you have paved the way to peace and harmony and prosperity not merely for the Tamil-speaking people but for all the people in this country and to build a better country. I thank you, Venerable Presiding Member.

Venerable Presiding Member, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs has made a categorical statement that this is false.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

My contention is, we know that a responsible newspaper has published this in its headlines. Why are you trying to mislead the people?

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

You are taking money from the foreigners and then trying to make allegations against the Government.
