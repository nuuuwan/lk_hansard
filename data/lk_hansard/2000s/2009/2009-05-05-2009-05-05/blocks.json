    "text": "? . . . . , . . . . . . . . [. . 11.32] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are once again debating the extension of the state of Emergency and as usual, the De-bate thus far has centred on the war or the situation of war that is presently prevailing in some parts of the North, in some parts of the Vanni region. I propose, Sir, in the course of my speech this morning to review primarily the situation in the Vanni, which, in my respectful submis-sion, has witnessed one of the worst humanitarian catas-trophes in recent times : the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians, death and destruction of a magnitude not experienced ever before in Sri Lankan his-tory and perhaps not even experienced to this extent in conflicts in other countries the world over, death and de-struction caused by aerial bombardment, heavy artillery and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire into civilian popu-lated areas. The State claims to be engaged in a war against the LTTE - that was the tenor of the speech made by the Prime Minister in the morning and by the Vener-able Monk a little while ago - but, the victims in the main have been the Tamil civilians or population living in their historical habitations and, Sir, the war had been so in-tense that these Tamil civilians have been reduced to a state of penury, to a state of destitution. These were peo-ple who largely generated their own income and lived a humble but honourable life. They were not dependent on a dole from the State or anybody else. They managed their own lives and that of their families with self-respect and dignity. Today, Sir, many of them have lost their kith and kin. Every one of them has lost everything they owned and it will be a long long time, probably several decades, given the best of conditions and times before they can get on their feet again. This, Sir, is the tragic situation of the Tamil civilians in this region. We have seen some pictures of these people, men, women and chil-dren. Never ever before have any people in this country been in this most pathetic position, reduced to the state of starvation not having basic facilities and suffering im-mensely with their families with hardly any hope in re-gard to what the future holds for them. The most wicked element, Sir, of this humanitarian disaster is that there are hardly any witnesses to the tragedy that has befallen these people. No one has access to these areas and the tragic",

    "text": "story is shrouded in secrecy. The State endeavours to use this environment of secrecy to pretend that hardly any harm has befallen these people. I would therefore, Sir, seek to define what in reality has been experienced by these many thousands of Tamil civilians in this Vanni territory by reference to various statements, reports and records emanating from various sources, who have been able to ascertain the truth and who have, in the discharge of their duty, revealed the truth. I will deal, Sir, primarily with the references that these sources make in regard to the Government actions per-taining to the Tamil civilians. I would not refer to the references that these sources make in regard to the LTTE. The LTTE is a banned organization in this country. The LTTE is also a banned organization in several parts of the world and you say that you are fighting the LTTE. I stand here today to speak on behalf of the Tamil civilians, who have been the victims of this war and of the miserable plight in which they are, and to demand and to appeal to the Government that the present situation must not con-tinue. I will commence, Sir, my reference to these statements and reports by first referring to the concerns expressed by India in regard to the plight of the Tamil civilian popula-tion in Vanni consequent to the war as early as October, 2008 when the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commissioner was summoned by the National Security Adviser in India to express Indias grave concern and unhappiness at the growing casualties of unarmed Tamil civilians as a result of military action. The escalation of hostilities in the North and the resultant fallout was leading to a great deal of concern in India. India pointed out that there was a need for the Sri Lankan Government to act with greater restraint and address the growing feeling of insecurity amongst the minority community. Then, subsequently, Sir, the Indian Foreign Minister, Mr. Mukherjee made a statement where India once again expressed her concern about the Tamil civilian population and the Foreign Sec-retary himself expressed the view that India is gravely concerned about the situation now prevailing in Sri Lanka and he expressed worries at the humanitarian effect of the conflict on the civilians. It was consequent to this con-cern, Sir, that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Member of Par-liament as the special envoy of the President, went to India on the 26th of October and gave an assurance to In-dia that the Tamil people will not be penalized and will not be victimized during the course of the military opera-tions and that the Government would ensure that the Tamil civilians were safe. That was the assurance, Sir, that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa gave the Indian Govern-ment. But, I have in this Parliament, in the course of ear-lier Debates, referred to a number of instances where even immediately after the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa gave his as-surance to the Indian Government, Tamil civilians were continuously the victims of the war conducted by the Sri Lankan State.",

The report states, I quote: Since the fall of the LTTEs administrative center, Kilinochchi, in early January 2009, civilian casualties in the northern Vanni region have skyrocketed - to more than 5,100, including at least a thousand deaths, based on a conservative tally by independent monitors analyzed by Human Rights Watch. More recent information places civilian casual-ties at 7,000, including 2,000 fatalities. Added to this are the dire hard-ships faced by the displaced - insufficient food, medical care, and shel-ter, whether in the combat zone or government-run welfare villages. This was a report, Madam Chairperson, released on the 19th of February, 2009 by the Human Rights Watch. I will read another paragraph which again demonstrates the plight of the civilians. I quote: The LTTEs grim practices are being exploited by the government to justify its own atrocities. High-level statements have indicated that the ethnic Tamil population trapped in the war zone can be presumed to",

They go on to say that the Government efforts to bring food, medicine and supplies are inadequate and without the assistance of international agencies the Government would not be able fulfil this obligation. Madam, Chairper-son, yet another paragraph states, I quote: Displaced persons are increasingly escaping from the battle zone to what they hope is safety within government-controlled areas. Instead, they are finding government internment centers masquerading as welfare villages. While the government for security reasons should be screening new arrivals, it is instead secretly taking away LTTE suspects to arbitrary detention or possible enforced disappearances. The primary concern of the Tamil civilian population in the Vanni area, who are in this miserable plight is that when they come out of the conflict zone into so-called Government-controlled territory, they are completely at the mercy of the military. There are no records available with anyone in regard to who have come out with civilian authorities. Is there some registration of these people to show that \"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\" have come out on such and such a date, at such and such a time and these persons are now in place \"A\" or place \"B\"? No, there is no such thing; nobody knows. It is completely being controlled by the military and if they disappear, if they are taken for questioning, if they are detained, nobody ever comes to know. The Human Rights Watch Report states, I again quote: \"All displaced persons crossing to the government side are sent to internment centers in Vavuniya and nearby locations. As Human Rights Watch has reported previously, these are military-controlled, barbed-wire camps in which those sent there, including entire families, are de-nied their liberty and freedom of movement. Humanitarian agencies have tenuous access, but do so at the risk of supporting a long-term detention program for civilians fleeing a war. At this point, Madam, I want to read just one para-graph to show what the plight of the civilians in these camps are. I quote further from the Human Rights Watch Report, which states: I spoke to one woman in the camp - she was crying and screaming. It turned out that her elderly mother, who had been injured and admitted to the hospital, died there on February 7. The elderly woman's body was",

    "text": "given to the son, who lived in Vavuniya, but her daughter was not al-lowed to leave the camp even to attend her mother's funeral. She was in agony because she couldn't pay respects to her mother.\" Madam, the mother was injured. She was in the hos-pital in Vavuniya. She dies. The body is given to the son who lives in Vavuniya. This lady who was in the camp was not allowed to go for the funeral. That is the position of these people. They also refer to the conditions prevalent in the Va-vuniya Hospital and how the staff there have been told not to ask humanitarian agencies for any relief and that every-thing will be provided by the Government despite the fact that there was a considerable shortage of a number of ur-gent requirements in the hospital. Madam Chairperson, the report goes on to state: Instead of using its victories in the field to promote a more open and democratic nation, the Sri Lankan government has conducted a cynical campaign to prevent all independent public coverage of its military operations and the plight of civilians caught up in the war. While decrying LTTE abuses, it has kept out the media and human rights organizations that could report on them - and on government abuses. It has kept displaced persons who could describe the artillery bombardments locked up in camps and hospitals. It has traded the well-being of tens of thousands of Sri Lankan citizens for protection from international scrutiny. With civilian casualties mounting, it has sought to bury its abuses. This is what the Human Rights Watch states about the record of the Sri Lankan Government and how you are seeking to bury everything preventing the media, prevent-ing international human rights organizations going there and finding out; you keep the people locked up in the camps with no access. Nobody can go there. You pre-vent them from talking to people and coming out with the real truth. The report further goes on to state: During a three-week period from January 20 to February 13, 2009, independent observers in the Vanni collected information on 5,150 casu-alties -1,123 deaths and 4,027 injuries - from the current fighting. This number was derived from a compilation of reports that recorded individ-ual casualties, the date and place of the attack, and the nature of the attack. Newly obtained information places total civilian casual-ties at 7,000, with 2,000 deaths. This was in February 2009. This is the position, Madam Chairperson, in regard to what prevails in Vanni and this is the report that deals with the situation in Febru-ary 2009 which puts the position beyond any manner of doubt, a report by the Human Rights Watch in regard to the present position in Vanni. I will now refer to a statement made by the Foreign Secretary of the UK, David Miliband in answer to a ques-tion in the House of Commons. It happened on the 24th of February, 2009 and I quote from the Tamilnet of 25th February, 2009: At a discussion on Sri Lanka in the British Parliament Tuesday, Mr. Llwyd expressed concern that a humanitarian catastrophe was un-folding in Vanni.\"",

He further goes on to say, I quote : Time is of the essence. I understand that the right hon. Gentleman is doing what he can, but many of us are deeply worried about what is going on in Sri Lanka and, as time goes by, it is getting worse. And what the Minister said in reply was this, Madam Chairperson, I quote : What the hon. Gentleman said about the Sri Lankan Government was absolutely right,... Mr. Miliband said this in response and what the hon. Gentleman said was that the Sri Lankan Government's actions imply that they are quite prepared to go ahead with acts of genocide and the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom answering the Member of Parliament in the House of Commons says he is in agreement. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Common-wealth Affairs, Mr. David Miliband goes on to say, I fur-ther quote the Tamilnet of 25th February, 2009: The recent military advances by the Sri Lankan Government and the subsequent humanitarian crisis are of continuing serious concern. We have repeatedly called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. We have made it clear to the Government of Sri Lanka that a political solu-tion that addresses the legitimate concerns of all communities in Sri Lanka is the only way to bring a sustainable end to the conflict. That is what happened, Madam Chairperson in the House of Commons when Mr. David Miliband answered certain questions raised by certain Members of Parlia-ment. Then, we have the evidence given by Anna Neistat, a Senior Researcher for the Human Rights Watch before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I quote \"The Island\" of 26th February, 2009: She said her organization had received several detailed accounts from people who had been in the safe zone and they suggested that the shelling by Sri Lankan forces had killed dozens if not hundreds of people inside there. That was the evidence given before the Foreign Rela-tions Committee of the US Senate and one of our former ambassadors in Sri Lanka, Mr. Jeffrey Lunstead had this to say in his evidence. I again quote \"The Island\" of 26th February, 2009: Many Tamils have been abducted and have simply disappeared. It is sad to say that it is almost a certainty that these attacks have been carried out by elements of the government. Impunity seems total. Nobody has been prosecuted for any of these incidents, said Jeffrey Lunstead, a former US ambassador to Sri Lanka. Lunstead said media personnel had been attacked. Bob Dietz, Asia Programme coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists shared Lunsteads observation.",

    "text": "The Under-Secretary General of the United Nations, Sir John Holmes, who was in Sri Lanka in February 2009, gave a briefing on the Sri Lankan situation to the Security Council and this is what Sir John Hormes said in the course of his evidence. He says, I quote: Estimates vary of the number of civilians trapped, from 70,000 according to the Government, through around 200,000 according to UN estimates, up to 300,000 or more according to Tamil groups. Madam Chairperson, the Governments estimate of the number of persons who were trapped in this so-called no-fire zone in February 2009 was 70,000 which meant that they sent food; they sent medicine; they sent drinking water; they sent shelter and all other basic necessities, if at all, for only 70,000 people. But, we all know that in re-cent weeks over 180,000 people have come out and ac-cording to all reliable information there are still held up in the no-fire zone, according to our information, around 150,000 people. The Governments figure was 70,000 and they were providing for only 70,000 people. It means that the Government has been engaged in starving the balance people who are living in Vanni because we all now know that more than 180,000 people have come out and that they were deprived of their medicine and other basic necessities, which it was the duty of the Govern-ment to provide them with. Then, Mr. Holmes, in the course of evidence before the Security Council, went on to say, I quote: The Government assured me at every level that they have virtually stopped using heavy weapons because of their recognition of the need to spare the civilian population, who are of course their own citizens. It remains unclear how far this is the case in reality. In other words, the Government had given that assur-ance to Mr. Holmes. Mr. Holmes was not certain at all in the context of what was happening as to how much this was the reality.",

While this (the ceasefire proposal) may fall short of a declaration of willingness to lay down arms, it is our view that the government of Sri Lanka should seize the opportunity presented by the offer to bring about a pause in the hostilities, Mr. Mukherjee said. The pause in hostilities must be utilized to facilitate the movement of the Tamil population out of the war-affected areas to secure locations where proper rehabilitation is possible, and international aid organiza-tions have free access and scope to provide medical and other forms of humanitarian aid,... That was the appeal made by Mr. Mukherjee at the end of February 2009 to enable the civilians to be saved to the maximum extent possible. Then, Madam, we know that the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton spoke to President Mahinda Raja-paksa on the 13th of March and there was a statement is-sued by a spokesman on her behalf and what does the statement say? I quote from the statement, Madam, which appeared in the \"The Sunday Leader\" of 15th March, 2009: On March 13, Secretary Clinton called Sri Lankan President Raja-paksa to express the United States deep concern over the deteriorating conditions and increasing loss of life occurring in the Government of Sri Lanka-designated safe zone in northern Sri Lanka. The Secretary stated that the Sri Lankan Army should not fire into the civilian areas of the conflict zone. The Secretary offered immediate post-conflict recon-struction assistance and she extended condolences to the victims of the March 10 bombing outside a mosque in southern Sri Lanka. She con-demned the actions of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE).... I quote further: Secretary Clinton called on President Rajapaksa to device a politi-cal solution to the ongoing conflict. She urged the President to give international humanitarian relief organizations full access to the conflict area and displaced persons camps, including screening centres. The United States believes that a durable and lasting peace will only be achieved through a political solution that addresses the legitimate aspirations of all of Sri Lankas communities. We call on the Sri Lankan Government to put forward a proposal now to engage Tamils who do not espouse violence or terrorism, and develop power sharing arrange-ments so that lasting peace and reconciliation can be achieved. You see, Madam, the concern that has been generated in widespread sections of the international community which has even compelled the Secretary of State of the United States to call President Rajapaksa and speak to him in regard to the situation prevalent in Sri Lanka. Of course then, Madam, we have the statement made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay which also was given much publicity in the media and she made a fairly forthright and clear statement.

    "text": "statement which appeared in the \"Daily Mirror\" of 14th March, 2009: The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, ex-pressed her growing alarm on Friday at the increasing number of civil-ians reported killed and injured in the conflict in northern Sri Lanka and the apparent ruthless disregard for their safety. Certain actions being undertaken by the Sri Lankan military and by the LTTE may constitute violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Pillay said. We need to know more about what is going on, but we know enough to be sure that the situation is absolutely desperate. The world today is sensitive about such acts that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ms. Pillay said according to information made available to OHCHR despite the Governments designation of safe or --no fire -- zones for civilians, repeated shelling had continued inside those zones. Other areas holding civilians had also been shelled she claimed. OHCHR said a range of credible sources had indicated more than 2,800 civilians may have been killed and more than 7,000 injured since 20 January, many of them inside the no-fire zones. This statement was made on 13th March, 2009. It fur-ther states, I quote: The casualties are believed to include hundreds of children killed and more than a thousand injured. Even after the Governments announcement on 24 February that heavy weapons would not be fired into the no-fire zones, close to 500 people were reportedly killed and more than a thousand inured in these zones. Of these deaths, the great majority were attributed to the use of heavy weapons. Overall, since 20 January, more than two-thirds of the reported deaths and injuries have occurred in the no-fire zones. She goes on to say, Madam, I quote: 'The current level of civilian casualties is truly shocking, and there are legitimate fears that the loss of life may reach catastrophic levels, if the fighting continues in this way and very little attention is being fo-cused on this bitter conflict' the High Commissioner said. That is the view, Madam, expressed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. She further went on to say, I quote: There are very limited quantities of food, reports of severe malnu-trition and key medical supplies for treatment of sutures, painkillers and antibiotics for treating victims, are virtually unavailable, even in the one makeshift medical facility still functioning Ms. Pillay said. She called upon the Government to grant full access to UN and other independent agencies to allow an accurate assessment of the human rights and humanitarian condi-tions in the conflict zone. That was the statement, Madam, of Ms. Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. There were some little noises, Madam, made by some people in the Government and some others in regard to the statement made by Ms. Navi Pillay. They questioned her figures. But, the Government which ques-tioned her figures did not have its own figures; did not come out with its own figures. I must say that my good Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Dis-aster Management and Human Rights endeavours to do his best in order to win a bad case by coming up with all sorts of very similitudes - something very similar to the truth, but not the truth itself - and so on.

OHCHR said a range of credible sources had indicated that more than 2,800 civilians might have been killed and more than 7,000 injured since January 20, and many of them inside the no-fire zones. The Government, Madam, when it dares to challenge someone like the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights - Ms. Navi Pillay is a person who has held the po-sition of a Judge of the Supreme Court in South Africa and also the position of the president of several courts and international tribunals before she was appointed the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights - should at least have the courtesy to come up with their own figures. The Government has, for long, resisted an active role for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka. We all are aware of the strong efforts made by Madam Louise Arbour, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, to set up a fully-fledged human rights of-fice in Sri Lanka to be able to monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. Madam Louise Arbour claimed that there was a culture of impunity which had so deeply permeated into the Sri Lankan society, that if we wanted to eradicate this culture of impunity, there was an urgent need to set up a human rights mechanism, a human rights office in Sri Lanka under UN auspices to monitor the hu-man rights situation in Sri Lanka. But, you would not agree despite her very strenuous efforts. In fact, she came here twice - I believe, twice - and made statements. She appealed to the Government, but the Government was not prepared to accommodate her request. May I today ask you with due respect, I do not mean any offence, did you refuse to set up the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka under UN auspices? Be-cause even then you were contemplating these operations and you knew even then that the violations of human rights in Sri Lanka would be a continuing phenomenon and that the Government would be primarily responsible for that situation. Therefore, you did not want to be a party to any agreement to set up an office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka because you felt that if such an office was set up with an effec-tively functioning human rights monitoring mechanism in Sri Lanka, it would be a hindrance to your plans to carry out the military operations that you have been engaged in for the past several months. In this context, Madam, I must refer to something very significant said by Chief Justice Bhagwati, who was the Chairman of the International Independent Group of Emi-nent Persons appointed to help the Commission of Inquiry that was assigned the task of investigating certain specific",

    "text": "human rights violations. Justice Bhagwati is an interna-tionally renowned human rights activist responsible for revolutionary changes in India when he was the Chief Justice of India. Justice Bhagwati was questioned in re-gard to certain matters when they terminated their mission in Sri Lanka for various reasons and withdrew. I would like to read, Madam, from the Public Statement made by the Chairman of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons released on the 15th of April, 2008 and this is what Justice Bhagwati said in the course of that statement, I quote: All Members of the IIGEP are keenly aware of the security situa-tion presently prevailing in Sri Lanka. The Government is faced with an insurgency in which the Libera-tion Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) conduct their hostilities through ruthless methods, not sparing the civilian population. Sections of popu-lar opinion suggest that human rights and respect for the rule of law should take second place to measures necessary to repel these hostilities. The IIGEP rejects this opinion. There is no conflict or incompatibility between the successful conduct of military and security operations on the one hand, and respect for the rights of citizens on the other. Indeed it should be emphasized that respect for human rights, and the conduct of military operations in strict accordance with international humanitarian law, are powerful weapons in the struggle against dissident forces and terrorism in that they help to earn the trust and support of the civilian population. Moreover, they are essential to morale and promote a cul-ture of professionalism and self-respect within the police and armed forces. Madam, he went on to state, - this is what is very sig-nificant - I quote: To the extent that emergency conditions may require special state measures derogating from certain peacetime rights, these must be pub-licly announced, enacted in law, and justified in terms of necessity and proportionality. Summary executions, massacres, disappearances, wan-ton destruction of property, and forcible transfers of populations can never be justified. This is what is happening in Vanni now - summary executions, massacres and disappearances. There is not one single house standing in Government-controlled terri-tory, which you claim to have liberated. All the houses have been destroyed; not one single civilian lives in those areas. Madam, it further states, I quote: No efforts should be spared to uncover responsibility, including recognition of command responsibility, for such actions. The IIGEP has, however, found an absence of will on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka in the present Inquiry to investigate cases with vigour, where the conduct of its own forces has been called into question. Justice Bhagwati, in the course of his public statement, forewarned against what has been happening in Vanni recently: massacres, destruction of civilian property and displacement of populations. He said that there is no way that these things will happen in any country which wants to conform to the international law in regard to human rights. Then, Madam, having referred to Justice Bhagwatis statement, may I have your indulgence to refer to a state-ment that appeared in the Guardian, which was referred",

    "text": "to in the Daily Mirror of 24th March, 2009, a very sad reflection of the situation in our country. It gives me no pleasure, but I think it is my duty as a Member of Parlia-ment and as a Member representing these people to put these things on record. Madam, this is a report that ap-peared in the Guardian, which was subsequently re-ported in the Daily Mirror of 24th March, 2009. This is what the report states, I quote: More than 150,000 people are being shelled daily and are running short of water and medicine in a Sri Lankan-government declared No-Fire Zone, according to witness reports and United Nations briefing documents obtained by the Guardian newspaper. Diplomats said there was a real danger that a bloody denouement to the 25-year-old civil war could result in an 'all-out humanitarian catastrophe'. Senior UN officials in Sri Lanka have shied away from publicly criticizing the government in its hour of victory but in private, many argue that outspoken criticism may backfire and see foreign aid agencies expelled at the time of greatest civilian need. So, you have your ways of dealing with these people. If they talk too much, too publicly, you expel them. If you withdraw their visas, they have to go. Those people, if they want to remain in the country because they want to serve the affected civilians, which is their duty and for which they have funds and have been trained, can rather keep quiet. They do not criticize you and they carry on with their work. This news report further states, I quote: UN figures show there are more than 60 deaths a day due to army bombardment and more than 3,000 lives have been lost since the end of January. This report was in March. In the course of two or three months, over 3,000 lives have been lost. So, this is the position, Madam, in regard to what is happening. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have spoken for 60 minutes now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Yes, I have got time. I have got enough time, Madam. ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have got 100 minutes in total. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Yes, I have taken 60 minutes out of it. Then, Madam Presiding Member, Dr. Sathiyamoorthy, who is a doctor working in Vanni, has been speaking pub-licly even to the media in regard to some of the incidents",

    "text": "that have taken place in Vanni and I must say he has been quite bold and has spoken out the truth. This news report goes on to state, I quote: The doctor T. Sathiyamoorthy, who is in charge of the makeshift hospitals in the No Fire Zone, told the Guardian that civilians were being 'repeatedly shelled for no reason'. \" We have been hit this morning, 52 people were injured, there were also deaths. Five, six people [die] at one time.' \" \"The Sri Lankan government said Dr. Sathiyamoorthy was likely to have been pressured into giving interviews that support the 'terrorist position' but the doctor denied he was speaking under duress. So, this is the position, Madam Presiding Member. This is a report that appeared in the Guardian , which was also subsequently published in the Daily Mirror. Madam Presiding Member, there was a statement made by a senior US delegate to the United Nations when she testified before the informal UN Security Council briefing in regard to the situation prevalent in Sri Lanka, which was reported in the \"Daily Mirror\" of 28th March, 2009. It states, I quote: \"Rosemary DiCarlo, a senior US delegate to the UN, also voiced her governments 'deep concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka' and criticized the LTTE, noting that it is viewed by Washing-ton as a terrorist organization.\" .Ms. DiCarlo also chided Colombo for continuing to shell areas heavily populated by civilians. This is the point at which we make - this Government which claims to liberate the civilian people has been ac-cused fairly and squarely, directly by several responsible international organizations and institutions of shelling into the no-fire zone and into civilian populated areas, result-ing in a substantial number of deaths and injuries. It fur-ther states, I quote: ..Ms. DiCarlo also chided Colombo for continuing to shell areas heavily populated by civilians. She said Washington had urged Co-lombo to cease the shelling and had received promises. 'But we need to see results,' she added.. No one is prepared to easily believe the promises given by the Sri Lankan Government. We shall see as we go on why people are reluctant to believe. I mentioned earlier that the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour was endeavoring to set up a UN-sponsored human rights office in Sri Lanka. Recently, Ms. Navi Pillai, the present High Commissioner for Hu-man Rights, in the course of her visit to Delhi where she had taken up the question of human rights abuses in Sri Lanka and the plight of the Tamil civilians in Vanni, had also raised the urgent need for international observers in Sri Lanka; international human rights observers in Sri Lanka; with the Government of Sri Lanka, and told that the Government of Sri Lanka that if it was committed to the enforcement of the protection of human rights, there was a need, a dire need, to have international human rights observers in Sri Lanka and she had complained or had stated that despite her request, there was no response",

    "text": "from the Government of Sri Lanka. Why have you not responded? Is it because you do not want any interna-tional human rights observers in Sri Lanka? You want to carry on doing what you like, and you feel that if interna-tional human rights observers come to Sri Lanka they would be a hindrance. Is that the reason? Madam Chairperson, there has been another report from the Human Rights Watch that was published in the Daily Mirror of 25th March, 2009. I think I should put that on record. What the Human Rights Watch report says in its later report is that, I quote: .The Sri Lankan Army, despite Government denials is indis-criminately shelling the 'no-fire zone' in northern Sri Lanka where thou-sands of civilians are trapped by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Human Rights Watch said yesterday, citing new information from the region. More than 2,700 civilians have reportedly been killed over the last two months, and the number of casualties rises daily. 'We receive reports of civilians being killed and wounded daily in the no-fire zone, while the Sri Lankan government continues to deny the attacks,' said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Here is another reputed human rights organization which says that despite your denials you are continuing to shell these areas and that people are being killed and are being injured. I referred to Dr. Sathiyamoorthy earlier. He has made another statement to the press in regard to these matters. I would just like to refer to the information that he had given the media in regard to what happened on this particular occasion because of the significance of the way in which it happened and how it happened and in what circumstances. I quote the \"Daily Mirror\" of 10th April, 2009 : ..Sathiyamoorthy said 22 people, including an 18 month-old child and a medical worker, were killed and 283 injured in the attack which started soon after dawn yesterday... He goes on to say, Madam Chairperson, I quote: about 500 mothers and babies queued beside a clinic to receive milk powder and food rations. 'When we were ready to start the distribution at 7.30, there were about 500 people waiting, then suddenly shells fell.' he said. Half an hour later he went back to assess the damage. 'I saw there were bloodstains on the road, I saw there were slippers, and san-dals scattered all over.' He found five bodies, and so on and so forth. Madam Chairperson, 500 people have gathered to receive milk powder for their babies and when they were standing in a queue, from the Government- controlled territory shells fell into that area and people were killed. And, our good Government says that people are being liberated. People who go to receive milk for their babies and stand in a queue are being killed by shells that fall and this Gov-ernment wants the entire world to believe, despite all that is being said by the entire world against the Government and about the Government, that this Government is en-gaged in a course of action of liberating the people. It is",

I must say, Madam Chairperson, two of my senior Colleagues and I went to India recently - my Colleague, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah and my Colleague, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran. On the 15th, 16th and 17th of April we met with the National Security Adviser, Mr. M.K. Narayanan and Foreign Secretary, Mr. Shiv Shankar Menon. The Prime Minister was out campaign-ing and we were not able to meet with him nor with the Foreign Minister who was also out campaigning. Our trip was largely because we were concerned about what was happening in Vanni; about the large civilian casual-ties and we thought that we owed a duty to our people to bring this matter to the notice of Indian Government and get them to stop this. I must say there was a state-ment put out by the Ministry of External Affairs on the situation in Sri Lanka. I will read out that statement, Madam Chairperson. It is a short statement. I quote: India is deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka. Continuing conflicts have been taking a heavy toll among Tamil Civilians.\" Internally displaced persons are caught in the cross-fire. The Government of India has repeatedly expressed its concern about their security and has sought to ensure safe passage to secure zones for the civilian population. The Government of India has welcomed the an-nouncement by the Sri Lankan President, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa for a cessation of hostilities for the two-day Tamil and Sinhala New Year festivals. Madam Chairperson it further states, I quote: ....the Sri Lankan Government must extend this pause in hostilities to prevent further casualties and enable trapped civilians to leave the area to secure locations.\" \".....continuation of precipitated military action leading to further civilian casualties at this time would be totally unacceptable and while it was incumbent on the LTTE to release all civilians and displaced people under their control , the Government of Sri Lanka could not be oblivious to the evolving human tragedy and the fate of the Tamil civil-ian population caught up in the so-called No Fire Zone The statement issued by the Indian External Affairs Ministry further states, I quote: There is no reason not to continue with the pause in military ac-tions in the NFZ. The Government of India has extended humanitarian assistance, including medicines, food and other supplies, to the civilian population trapped in the conflict zone. A 62-member emergency medi-cal unit from India has treated more than 1500 serious medical cases among civilians in Pulmoddai are in Sri Lanka. We will soon send an-other consignment of 40,000 family packs to the affected civilians in Northern Sri Lanka. The Government of India expects the Government of Sri Lanka and others concerned to respond positively to this appeal in the interest of the Tamils who are citizens of Sri Lanka. This is one of the clearest messages that came out in recent times from the Government of India. The Govern-",

This is a report by the ICRC which has been published in The Hindu newspaper of Wednesday, 22nd April, 2009. \"The Hindu\" is not a newspaper which the Government can claim as being hos-tile to them and particularly this is by a reporter from Sri Lanka, Mr. B. Muralidhar Reddy. This newspaper gives maximum prominence to all Government reports in regard to their activities. This is what the ICRC has said in re-gard to the current condition prevailing in Vanni which is extremely serious and shows the plight of the Tamil civil-ian population in this area. The report says, Madam, I quote: 'The situation is nothing short of catastrophic. On going fighting has killed or wounded hundreds of civilians who have only minimal access to medical care.' 'In the coming days the ICRC will strive to assist and protect the thousands of displaced civilians fleeing the hostilities,' said Mr. Krahen-buhl. 'However, it is imperative that independent humanitarian organi-zations also be allowed to provide desperately needed services and relief for civilians still trapped in the no-fire zone.' I want to ask you - there are people suffering, there are people starving; they have no shelter, they have no medi-cine and they have no water - are you heartless? Why are you being so hard? Why are you preventing international humanitarian agencies from going there and being of hu-manitarian help to those people? Why are you preventing them? He goes on to say, Madam - this is most disturbing and this is a very very serious allegation being made by the ICRC. I quote again: The Sri Lankan armed forces are trying to weaken the resistance of the LTTE by using the Tamil civilians as human shields. And also using these trapped civilians to clear landmines at the frontal areas. The initial reports suggest that hundreds of civilians were killed in these operations. People who tried to resist were shot dead by the Sri Lankan soldiers. This is unbelievable, Madam. I could not believe it when I read this. But, here is the ICRC stating it and this is published in \"The Hindu\" newspaper, not in some paper hostile to you. It says that the Government soldiers are using Tamil civilians as human shields compelling them to uproot landmines, clear landmines and where they have refused or resisted, they have been shot dead. -[Interruption] ( ) (An Hon.

You cannot get away from these type of things and it is my duty, there-fore, to put these matters on record. Madam Chairperson, then there was a high-level meet-ing that took place in New Delhi recently chaired by the Prime Minister and also attended by the Foreign Minis-ter, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, Defence Minister, Mr. A.K. Antony, National Security Adviser, Mr. M.K. Narayanan and Foreign Secretary, Mr. Shiv Shankar Menon and a statement issued subsequent to the meeting - it was on the 22nd of April - said, We are very unhappy at the con-tinued killing of innocent Tamil civilians in Sri Lanka. These killings must stop. Mr. Mukherjee said, \"The Sri Lankan Government has a responsibility to protect its own citizens\" and he talked about the need for a political solution to address the real concerns of the Tamil people giving them a life of dignity within the Sri Lankan main-stream. This concern by the international community is a con-tinuing concern. It is not merely India, it is not merely the USA, it is not merely the UK, the European Union, Co-chairs but everybody. Then, Madam Chairperson, as you are aware, recently two top officials from India, Na-tional Security Adviser, Mr. M.K. Narayanan and For-eign Secretary, Mr. Shiv Shankar Menon visited Sri Lanka - it was, I believe on 24th April, 2009 - and conse-quent to their visit to Sri Lanka and their immediate re-turn to New Delhi, Mr. Narayanan made a statement. I quote The Hindu newspaper of 25th April, 2009. In a statement, Mr. Narayanan said they had conveyed the concerns of the Government of India at the evolving situation in the north, espe-cially over the casualties among Tamil civilians as a result of the ongo-ing operations. 'We also expressed the Government of Indias concerns about the humanitarian situation as a result of nearly hundred thousand Tamil civilians coming out of the conflict zone since early this week. The President of Sri Lanka was receptive to our concerns. We are hopeful of a positive outcome,' he said.\" Madam Chairperson, they say, \"The President of Sri Lanka was receptive to our concerns. We are hopeful of a positive outcome\". This was in the statement issued on the 25th of April consequent to their visit on 24th April . The elections for the Western Provincial Council of Sri Lanka took place on the 25th of April and on the 27th of April, just two days later, we saw the Government Spokesman coming on TV and saying that a decision is being taken by the Govenrment to stop the use of heavy weaponry and there would not be any aerial bombard-ment. I saw several Ministers saying that on TV on the 27th evening. But, Madam Chairperson, what happened immediately after that? On the 27th April, 199 persons were admitted to the Mullivaikal Hospital as a result of bombing and shelling and 37 died. On 28th April, 219 persons were admitted to Mullivaikal Hospital and 32 died. On 29th April, 250 persons were admitted to the",

At 9 a.m. on the 2nd of May, shells fell within the outpa-tients department building of the Mullivaikal Hospital; 23 civilians were killed and 34 civilians were injured. A couple of days earlier, on the 29th of April, a shell had fallen within the rear border of the hospital; 9 civilians were killed and 15 civilians were injured. So, this is a continuing process. I spoke to someone in Mullaitivu and asked him, \"Where are these shells coming from?\" He told me \"Sir, they are coming from Govern-ment-controlled areas such as Keppapulavu and Puthu-kudiyiruppu\". They hear a noise of shells being fired and within a few moments the shells land on the no-fire zone and people are killed; people are injured. This is after the Governments announcement on the 27th of April that they have stopped the use of heavy weaponry and aerial bombardment. Madam Presiding Member, this is a pa-thetic position. I do not think any government with any sense of responsibility can continue to deny that these things are taking place. The charges against you come from so many sources. You will eventually laugh at your-selves if you keep denying that these things are happen-ing. I think already the whole world is laughing at you and not taking your assurances seriously. Everybody is sceptical about what you say. Nobody is prepared to trust you. You are a State within an international system. You have got to conform to international norms and standards. You have to conform to international law. Human rights is not merely a national concern, it is an international con-cern. It is a concern in which every member of the inter-national community is interested in and has a deep con-cern, because if it can happen in Sri Lanka, it can happen in any part of the world and if it keeps happening in sev-eral countries in the world, the international system can never work. So, if you think that you can just carry on doing what you like and that you can get away with it, I must say with due respect, you are sadly mistaken. The day is not far when you will be called to answer, to re-spond, and that will not be a very pleasant situation. Then, Sir, there is a U.S. Statement dated 25th April, 2009 regarding the position of the Co-Chairs. It states, I quote: Ensuring the safety and security of those civilians who remain in the conflict area and respecting international humanitarian law must be the foremost priority of both the Government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers. Let us leave aside the Tamil Tigers. We are address-ing the Sri Lankan State, vis--vis your own citizens; the Tamil civilians who live in that area. It further states, I quote: We fully support the UN Secretary-Generals call for UN staff to be allowed into the conflict zone to facilitate relief operations and the evacuation of civilians. We call on the Government of Sri Lanka to allow UN and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to all sites where newly arrived displaced persons are being registered and provided shelter.",

    "text": "I mean, you do not allow any international body, any international personality to be present where people are being registered, where people are being screened, where people are being questioned. The result is that people are disappearing. The families do not know where these peo-ple are being kept. Why are you doing these things? The international community wants you to permit UN agen-cies to go into the no-conflict area, so they can be of assis-tance to these people. They can probably bring about a pause in the fighting. They can probably bring about a suspension in the fighting leading to a situation where Tamil civilians being slaughtered in this way can be ter-minated. Why are you standing in the way of that hap-pening? Then, Madam Chairperson, there was a statement made by Sir John Holmes after his visit to Sri Lanka. He briefed the Security Council with regard to the position here and there are certain matters I would like to place before the House because they are important. He says in a part of his statement, I quote: \"For its part, the Government has given repeated assurances of restraint, and that it is not using heavy weapons. The evidence is that these assurances have not been respected. Here is the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations who comes to Sri Lanka and meets the President, meets very important people and you give him assurances and that man goes back from Sri Lanka and briefs the UN Security Council. What does he say? The Government gives repeated assurances of restraint that it is not using heavy weapons. He goes on to say, The evidence is that these assurances have not been respected. What is your answer? He goes on to say, I quote another paragraph: Given these desperate conditions, during my visit I again urged the Government of Sri Lanka to allow a UN humanitarian team access to the conflict zone in order to assess the humanitarian situation, as well as to help larger quantities of much needed food and medical supplies reach the area. The UN team in Sri Lanka had already begun preparations to undertake such a mission, following apparent agreement between Mr. Nambiar and the President of Sri Lanka the previous week....\" Mr. Vijay Nambiar is the Chief Executive of the Sec-retary-Generals office in the UN. I again quote: I was very disappointed that, in the end, the Government decided not to allow this mission to go forward, on the grounds that it could not visit safely and was not necessary. I strongly urge the Govern-ment of Sri Lanka to reconsider this position, and to agree to the kind of humanitarian pause which would allow the mission to go, in order to give much-needed respite to the civilians still trapped, and give a chance for extra aid supplies to get in too. The President gives an assurance to Mr. Vijay Nam-biar who comes here as the Envoy of the Secretary-General of the UN that the UN staff would be allowed to go into the no-conflict zone, the local UN agencies starts making preparations to undertake the mission and the Government goes back on its commitment. Why? Why have you gone back on the commitment? Can anyone answer?",

    "text": "Further in his statement, he says, Madam Chairperson, I quote: It is welcome news that over 100,000 were rescued from the zone last week. But the human cost of this in civilian casualties was ex-tremely high. To rescue 100,000 people you probably killed around 5000 people. He further says, I quote: That is why we continue to urge a halt to the fighting and a con-tinuing search for other ways to bring the conflict to an end. Meanwhile, I hope that the renewed pledge earlier this week not to use heavy weap-ons will be fully observed this time. So you see that these officials who come here and talk to you are concerned about your inability or unwillingness to keep your commitments. You seem to think that you can go on like this and do what you like. Of course, there have been these aerial pictures, Madam, that were given much media publicity recently; satellite pictures, UN sat-ellite images, clearly showing that the no-fire zone had been bombed and shelled, or probably bombed only; the picture shows of course the bombing. There was some excitement on the part of the Government. You are accus-ing the UN of spying. That is not the question. The ques-tion is, having declared a no-fire zone where you wanted the civilians to go for safety, you have bombed those ar-eas and killed the civilians. That is the question you have to answer. You are bothered about UN spying, that coun-try spying, this country spying when you are doing all these things. The truth has got to be brought out. Some-body must do something. You cannot expect everybody to sit back with folded arms and not do anything. So, here are these UN satellite images, Madam, which show that in areas declared by the Government as no-conflict zones or no-fire zones into which people were asked to move and into which people moved, you have been carrying on with bombing. You have to answer these charges instead of trying to find fault with people. I think I will conclude, Madam, though I have many more things to say. I will reserve them for another day. But, there is only one thing I want to say, Madam, before I conclude. There was a policy statement made by the President of India, Ms. Shrimathi Pratibha Devi Singh Patil in an ad-dress to the joint sitting of the Indian Parliament on Thursday, 12th February 2009, which appeared in the Indias National Magazine \"Frontline\" - February, 28 - March 13, 2009. In the course of that statement she re-ferred to the Sri Lankan situation. I want to place before the House, Madam, what she said in regard to the Sri Lankan situation. As a way out of the present impasse, addressing the Members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, Ms. Shrimathi Pratibha Devi Singh Patil said, I quote: We are concerned at the plight of civilians internally displaced in Sri Lanka on account of escalation of the military conflict. We continue to support a negotiated political settlement in Sri Lanka within the",

I would appeal to the Government of Sri Lanka and to the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) to return to the negotiating table. This can be achieved if, simultaneously, the Government of Sri Lanka suspends its military operations and the LTTE declares its willingness to lay down arms and begin talks with the gov-ernment. Why can you not adopt this very civilized approach? I am warning you that if you continue with the operations in the no-fire zone where there are 150,000 people, you are going to kill a large number of people; you are going to kill tens of thousands of civilians. That cannot be without repercussions; that cannot be without conse-quences. Here is an offer. In the Policy Statement made by the President of India, when she addressed both Houses of Parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, she called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to suspend military operations and the LTTE to declare its willingness to lay down arms and begin talks with the Government. Is it not an honourable way instead of you masquerading as liberators and murdering innocent Tamil civilians in thousands? Is that suggestion made by the President of India not an eminently reasonable sugges-tion, through which process, I believe, Madam, if this Government is sensible the killing of Tamil civilians can be brought to an end I thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services. Before you commence your speech, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Ven.)
