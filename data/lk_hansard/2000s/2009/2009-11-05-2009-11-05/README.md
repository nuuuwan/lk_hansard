: , GSP PLUS CONCESSION : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF EXPORT DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE

. . ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade and Acting Minister of Posts and Telecommunications)

Mr. Speaker, I would like, with your permission, to respond briefly to the Question which was raised on the 23rd of October, 2009 by the Chief Opposition Whip in terms of No. 23(2) of the Standing Orders of Parliament.

A document entitled "Report on the findings of the investigation with respect to the effective implementation of certain Human Rights Conventions in Sri Lanka" was handed over to our Ambassador in Brussels by the European Commission on the 19th of October, 2009.

The Commission has informed the Government of Sri Lanka that it will be prepared to entertain any observations which the Government wishes to make on the contents of this Report before 06th November, 2009. There are several representations which the Government considers it necessary to make with regard to the factual material contained in the Report, the inferences drawn from this material and the sources which have been used. We find the Report inaccurate and unacceptable in many fundamental respects. Detailed information has been obtained from several Ministries and a comprehensive response has been prepared on the basis of this information. Sri Lankas Ambassador to the European Commission has been instructed to deliver this response to the Commission as soon as it is ready. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) , , . . .

You may use technical terms and try to deviate. But, the fact is that the Committee Report is relevant to Sri Lanka. Whatever it may be - the Committee of Experts or the European Commission - its report is relevant to Sri Lanka. People have the right to know as to why Sri Lanka is being deprived of GSP Plus. Under the Constitution, people have the right to information.

Parliament has the right to know. [Interruption.] - If you are honest in your dealings, then you must submit their report in the first instance.- .

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

But, Hon. Member, if you can look at it objectively, this is a document sent under confidential cover from Brussels to the Government of Sri Lanka. It is their report, not our report. So if they wish to publish it, that is their right. But, is it right for the Government of Sri Lanka, once we have received a document from the European Commission under confidential cover, to publish it? I do not think it is correct for us to publish it. But, in fact the information is out in the public domain. They have published it. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . . , GSP Plus .

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Venerable Presiding Member, let me first thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Vote on Account that has been presented for the year 2010. During the debate on the Budget for 2009, I stated that the problem with a budget is always that it is hard to fill up one hole without digging another. So, the problem this Government has, is that the depth of the holes they have to fill up is so deep, that the hole that they have to dig to

fill those other holes would be beyond a depth that can be measured. So, this is the predicament that the Government is in. . . That is the problem this Government has. From what was spoken in this House today, it is very clear that the Government is dodging the budget because there is an election due. At least there is one election due before the end of April. So, without presenting a Budget that would adversely affect the Government, the Government is presenting a Vote on Account to dodge the issue and put off whatever it has to do for the period after the general election. I was happy that the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa said that the next Budget is not being presented now because the Cabinet may be made smaller. I cannot even laugh at it because if that was something that the Government was keen on, the Government should sell it now and show that the allocation that it is making on the Vote on Account for maintaining the Cabinet is much less; therefore, come April, we will be having a smaller Cabinet. I am getting away from this debate as there is something that I want to particularly enlighten this House about, and that is about the GSP. I have been in the garment industry for almost 22 years and even in the previous Budget I spoke about the GSP. Now, everybody has made the GSP a political tool. It is not a political tool. The GSP, if I remember right, was in existence from way back as 1976 where preference was given to developing countries as a mode of helping them to export into the countries that were willing to help these countries on a preferred duty system, products that qualify certain criteria. This was the Generalized System of Preference that was prevalent for over 30 years. Now, very recently, in the last few years, we had the GSP Plus, which was brought in by the European Union. What is GSP Plus? How did the GSP Plus differ from the GSP? The GSP Plus was an additional duty incentive of 12 per cent to countries that were willing to comply to certain conditions that were set by the European Union. The European Union did not force this on us. The GSP Plus was offered to us on certain conditions like the IMF loan. We accepted those conditions and therefore, we benefited by the 12 per cent duty rebate on the products that were included in the scheme. Now, what is the impact of losing the GSP Plus? Losing the GSP Plus is not going to be mean the end of the Government. It is not going to mean the end of the textile industry. No. But, what we must remember is that when we lose the GSP Plus, over one billion dollars worth of merchandize that leave Sri Lanka will become liable to duty at the other end. For the year 2008, the European Union basically waived off 78 million Euros on exports from Sri Lanka. If the European Union was to impose tariff on the exports from Sri Lanka in the year 2008, they would have imposed a tariff of almost Euros 78 million. Now, the Directorate-General for Trade of the European Commision has issued a press

921 922

[ . . . ]

release on the status of the GSP Plus for Sri Lanka. This is the official press release which the Hon. Minister said was available on the internet. The press release states, I quote: The Commission has completed a thorough investigation into the human rights situation in Sri Lanka and in particular whether Sri Lanka is living up to the commitments it made to respect international human rights standards when it became a beneficiary of the European Unions GSP+ trade incentive scheme which provides for additional trade benefits. The report comes to the conclusion that there are significant shortcomings in this area and that Sri Lanka is in breach of its GSP + commitments. It further states, I quote: At the same time, the Commission is determined to pursue its dialogue with Sri Lanka on the substantive human rights problems identified in the report and the steps that Sri Lanka can take to address them. We want to work constructively with Sri Lanka on this and expect that any actions taken to improve the human rights situation will be suitably vigorous, rapid and verifiable. Now this is the position of the European Union on Sri Lanka. I am tabling* this document for inclusion in Hansard. What we need to do here is not keep accusing anybody who talks about it as being a traitor. The fact is that we accepted the GSP Plus on certain conditions. Now, those who gave us those preferences feel that we are not meeting the conditions and it is for us as a country to decide whether we want to abide by the conditions and benefit by the incentive or ignore the conditions and lose the incentive. This is not something that they are bound to give us. This is an incentive that they gave us provided we met these standards. It is true there are accusations that the European Union which imposing these conditions whilst the countries that belong to the Union are violating these same human rights. That is fine. That is a different issue; because they are not dependent on us, we are dependent on them. They say that a beggar cannot be a chooser; he cannot make a decision on . . Here the issue is that we need it, and they are prepared to give it, but they are prepared to give it only on certain conditions. If the Government is prepared to sit down and constructively discuss this issue with the Opposition and prepare a response to the European Union, I am sure the European Union would understand the impact of the country losing the GSP. Unlike what some of our more nationalistic Members point out , they are not out to throttle us. If they wanted, they could have done it long, long time ago. There is a give-and-take policy.

We shouted from the ceiling that we will never go to the IMF for loans. We said that we would unplug the Government from the IMF. Finally, we had to go and plug it again. Why? That is reality. You cannot continue to borrow at 8 per cent and pay back our debts. We do not generate that amount of revenue. Having finally realized that we cannot borrow at 8 per cent and pay back, we went back to the IMF to borrow at 1 and 2 per cent. That is the reality. Likewise, the GSP Plus is a reality and we can only stand up to that and win that back by collectively working on it and not continuing to accuse the Opposition of having blocked that, because the Opposition cannot block it. The European Union is not accusing the Opposition of violating human rights. It is accusing the Sri Lankan Government of violating human rights. We may have our own reasons. In a climate of war, so many things happen. It happens everywhere in the world. But, are we prepared to face up to it? If we are prepared to face up to it, we must do it collectively and not individually. It is true that the Government must take the credit for eradicating terrorism from this country. There is no doubt about that because it is the Government that directs the army. Likewise, it is the Government that must take the blame for everything that happens around it. You cannot say, We want to take the credit for winning the war, but we are not prepared to take what comes out of the war or Yes, we fought the war, we directed the war, we are responsible for winning the war, but the Generals are responsible for violating human rights. Can the Government say that? Can the Government say that General Sarath Fonseka is responsible for all the violations of human rights? No. If you want to take the credit for winning the war, then you have to take the blame that comes with it. We are not here to leave you alone on this matter. As a responsible Opposition, we are saying that the Government must face it. We are prepared to partner the Government, if the Government is prepared to partner us. Allegations can always come. How do you face those allegations? There is no point in saying, We will not surrender to this, we will not surrender to that. Fine, nobody wants to surrender but you have to face the reality. How long can you go on and how deep can you keep digging to keep filling the holes that we are opening up on every front because we have to pay and the generations that come have to pay for it. It is not that as soon as this Government falls, everything is over, all the accounts are closed. No. It is a continuing cycle. So, I am pleading with the Government to partner the Opposition to face the threats that come towards us. Losing the GSP Plus is not the end of the world, but it can have and it will have a severe impact on the expansion of the apparel trade in this country because after a long time the share of the European Union and the US trade was coming to a healthy balance and now with the losing of GSP Plus, we will find that we are at a disadvantage, we will lose the bulk of the european business to the other countries. Therefore, the exporters who are already hard-hit will have problems in continuing this trade in the country and thereby providing employment to thousands of our youth.

Give me one more minute, Venerable Presiding Member, to wind up. In conclusion I would say, "Man, of all creatures, is physically the most ill-equipped in this world. He cannot fly like a bird, can be killed by a tiny insect, cannot outrun a leopard, cannot swim like an alligator, cannot climb the tree like a monkey, he does not have the eye of an eagle, nor does he have the claws and teeth of a wild cat. Physically, man is helpless and defenceless. But, nature is reasonable and kind. Natures greatest gift to man is the ability to think. He can create his own environment whereas animals adapt to their environment. Sadly, very few people use the greatest gift - the ability to think to its full potential". Plato, the Greek philosopher and writer is quoted as having said, The punishment which the wise suffer, who refuse to take part in the government, is to live under the government of worse men. Thank you. : : Document tabled :

Hon. Speaker, I do not want to make a lengthy speech. Firstly, I would urge the Hon. Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition to implement a drug policy. We always read in the newspapers, issues relating to drugs. We want quality drugs at affordable prices for our poor patients. So, please do not delay in implementing a drug policy. Sir, I heard that somewhere in 2005 there was a draft policy approved by you. So, it is better if you can implement it as early as possible. The second matter I want to raise is, a number of people have made representations to me about the small allowance of Rs. 100 that is paid monthly to the poor people. As you know, a Minister gets Rs. 100,000 monthly as house rent. But, the allowance given for poor people is only Rs. 100 and they have to spend nearly Rs. 30 - 40 to travel to the post office to collect this money. Therefore, please see that it is increased from Rs. 100 to at least Rs.1,000.

945 946

[ . ]

The third matter is about the Agricultural Insurance Scheme for farmers and fishermen. Although they have paid the premium, they are given only Rs. 1,000 per month. Please look into this matter and try to increase it to at least Rs. 5,000 because a sum of Rs. 1,000 per month is not sufficient at all. I do not want to take anymore time. I thank you very much.

Might I have your permission, Mr. Speaker, to intercede? Also, I do not like to disturb or interrupt the Hon. Minister, but I merely desire to clarify this. What I did say was that it would not be appropriate to introduce a Budget for the whole year, 2010, when the term of office of this Parliament ends in the fourth month of the new year. Therefore, I said that in principle, the Government is correct in introducing a Vote on Account and not a full-fledged Budget for the whole year, leaving it open to any new government that may come into position in April next year to formulate its own financial proposals for the balance eight months of the year. I wish to clarify this. I said that whilst this is the correct procedure, the Vote on Account, I did not agree with the contents of the present Vote on Account. That is a different matter.

I said that is a matter for Parliament to look into and decide, but with the contents, I did not agree. - [Interruption.] But, as a citizen of this country, a Member of Parliament and a former Minister of Finance, I did say that the procedure of having a Vote on Account restricted up to the end of the current period of Parliament is the correct procedure. So, I thought that that was a democratic procedure also.
