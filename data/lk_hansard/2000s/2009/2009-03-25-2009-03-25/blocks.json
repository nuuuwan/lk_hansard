We read with delight that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is to host the Indian cricket team for a series of five ODIs and one Twenty 20 match in February-March 2009. Surprisingly, we seem to not have received any invitations to tender or participate in any process that you may be following in selling the rights of the said series and we would appreciate if you could immediately send the documents/correspondence on the same to the undersigned at Neo Cricket. We at Neo Cricket are committed to participate in any process that SLC may implement to market the rights of the said series. However, in view of the series starting less than two weeks from now, and recognizing that SLC has no time to lose as each passing day will reduce the marketing time available to SLC and rights buyer, we would like to propose as follows. We would like to secure these rights immediately and hence we hereby make, subject to contract, an immediate offer of USD 12 million for all the rights of the said event. Our offer is valid for acceptance by SLC before close of play (i.e. 5.30 pm Sri Lanka time) today. After this time, it will remain valid subject to our reconfirmation so that we can assess and, if necessary, make any adjustment for any loss of marketing time. We look forward to hearing from you shortly, and we look forward to working with SLC on this project. Please do not hesitate to contact me on+91 9833676336 or alternatively on +65 8113 9500 in case any clarifications are required. Warm Regards (Sgd.)

    "text": "Madam Presiding Member, while endorsing the anxious sentiments expressed by the Minister, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, in regard to the constraints to which the allocation of time on this Debate has now been subjected to, I would at the very outset make a humble request, Madam Presiding Member, that I should be given the 20 minutes allotted to my Party, the ITAK. As the only Member participating from my Party in the ongoing Debate, I would like to express the views my Party has on the subject matter of this Debate without any reluctance or reservation whatsoever. I find, Madam Presiding Member, that no sensible man or woman in this country would raise any objection if I could say that our country, I would repeat \"our country\", is indeed in the grip of a dire financial crisis and I would go on saying that the primary reason for that is the continuing military conflict for the last several years. Therefore, Madam Presiding Member, I am rather constrained to view this Debate against the background of the prevailing politico-military situation in the country. With His Excellency the President and his Government repeatedly proclaiming that ultimately it would be a political solution to the national question of our country, I am at a loss to understand as to why the repeated calls for a political dialogue between the parties to the conflict is being denied continuously and also as to why the demands made by our Party on behalf of our people that there is a pressing need for a ceasefire as a prelude to a political process to hammer out a permanent and viable political solution, is being denied with so much of vehemence. Madam Presiding Member, with some of my Friends from the other side being present today in considerable number, I would like to make this opportunity to request them to lend me their ears. With more than 200,000 hapless civilians trapped in the war zone between the parties to the military conflict, namely, the advancing forces of the Government of Sri Lanka on the one side and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on the other, our concern at the moment more than anything else, is the safety and security of those innocent and defenseless civilians. I find, Madam Presiding Member, that the humanitarian crisis that has been fomented by the adamant attitude on the part of the Government in refusing to heed the calls for a ceasefire in the continuing military conflict resulting in a situation that can be without hesitation named and called as a \"humanitarian crisis\", the need of the hour today is for the Government to sit back and have a fresh look at the problem. There is no point in adhering to the positions we all have taken all this time. There has to be a give-and-take attitude.",

On both sides of the conflict, whether it be the Government or for that matter the LTTE, it is the younger generation of this country who is involved and being sacrificed. So, Madam Presiding Member, with His Excellency the President extending an invitation to our Party, to each and every Member of our Party for a meeting with him tomorrow to discuss the prevailing political situation, and with our Party meeting today to make a decision after having a deliberation and discussion with an open mind, I think it is appropriate for me at this juncture to please remind that we are really at the cross roads of history; we are really at a historical moment when we can rise to the occasion, shedding petty political differences, shedding all petty political considerations and think first as human beings and immediately follow as sons and daughters of one country.",

My Party as a responsible political Party, a democratic political Party wedded to the normal principles of democracy is fully conscious of the sacred duties cast on us at this juncture. We shall never fail our people. We shall never fail our people, I would repeat. But, for us to do that, there should be a proper atmosphere. Violence should go. The safety and security of our innocent people - men, women, children and babies - should be first safeguarded and ensured with their safety and security. Their lives are at stake. I beg to state, Madam Presiding Member, one cannot expect us to discuss high politics and also the intricacies of a long-standing problem that is at the very root of all evils in this country with anybody in this country. But, we are ready to do that; we will do that provided there is a conducive atmosphere. Madam Presiding Member, this is a time if I could speak out my heart, I would have to come out with very many matters. But, my brain says, Do not do that. Do not do that in the interests of your people. That is my people. Therefore, Madam Presiding Member, as Members representing our own people, a community that has been denied its due since Independence, due to the policies and programmes adopted by each and every successive government, a community that has always been at the receiving end, a community today stands deprived of all its democratic rights - I beg to state, Madam Presiding Member, that for us to rise to the occasion, for us to discharge our duties in full measure, the Government should take the first step. His Excellency the President should take the first step. If there could be a positive approach, if the deadlock that is existing now can be broken, I believe, Madam Presiding Member, that we would be entering into a new era. We will be entering into a new era in that we would be able to solve this problem through dialogue and discussion. We believe that still there is hope and we can, if we all can put our shoulders to the wheel without any differences, forgetting party politics, petty politics; forgetting our own self-interests and rise to the occasion as dutiful sons and daughters of this country who are mindful of their sacred duties as the elected representatives of our people. There cannot be any force on earth that can prevent us from hammering out a solution.",

    "text": "Mr. Presiding Member, I am thankful to you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Jayantha Wijesekara on the conduct of the Eastern Provincial Council. I feel that I will fail in my duty if I do not at the outset point out that this Motion, according to my understanding, is in contravention of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which we all, as Hon. Members of Parliament, have sworn to uphold. I am open to correction, but I am of the view that this House cannot debate the conduct of the Provincial Council when it is functioning within the powers vested in it under the Constitution. Under the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, land - that is to say, the right to or over land, land tenure transfer, alienation of land, land use, land settlement and land development to the extent set out in Appendix II - is vested with the Provincial Council. As per Appendix II of the Constitution, I quote: State land shall continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of in accordance with Article 33 (d) and written law governing this matter. Subject as aforesaid, land shall be a Provincial Council Subject, subject to the following special provisions:- And it goes on. Anyway, in my view, the executive power of the Provincial Council is vested exclusively with the Governor, who is a nominee of His Excellency the President. Therefore, I feel that this matter should be first taken up at the Provincial Council and thereafter, referred to His Excellency the President before we can even discuss same. Having said this, I would like to focus on the crux of the problem that is staring us in the face today. We have a national problem; we have an ethnic problem and in my view, as I have said earlier, we have a jathiye problem, which we have to solve if we are to progress as a nation, as a Sri Lanka undivided, united or unitary in character, whatever you want to call it. But, how do we get there if we continue to put obstacles in the attempts that are being made to resolve it? I agree that the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was foisted on us by the Indo-Lanka Accord, which we, the Muslims, vehemently opposed and was, in fact, a contributory factor for the birth and growth of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress: the denial of the views of the Muslims being heard, leave alone being accommodated. Despite this, the Muslims did not want to stand in the way of any attempt at solving the problem and in fact,",

    "text": "contested the first election for the merged Provincial Council. But, what happened after that is now history, based on which we have to look at the future. The North and the East were merged without consulting the people of those provinces. It was de-merged again without consulting the people of the North-Eastern Province though there was provision in the Constitution for a Referendum to decide on whether it should stay as a merged province or a de-merged province. Now, what has happened after the de-merger? We had an election. We all know what happened at the election and what our views were on the end result. The Hon. Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan was sworn in as the Chief Minister. There were legitimate claims made by the constituent parties claiming to represent the Muslim community who are with this Government. But what did they do? They tamely gave in picking up the crumbs that were thrown on their own way or that was promised. But what is happening today? We have a Chief Minister who is publicly complaining, who is going on air and complaining, that his former boss, the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran, the SLFP Minister for National Integration and Reconciliation is obstructing him from carrying out his duties. This is the very same group that the UPFA propped up to contest the Eastern Provincial Council Election and we objected to it. We said, We are not against Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan being sworn in as the Chief Minister but we are against Pillayan being sworn in as the Chief Minister because this Pillayan is under the military control of this Government. That is why we objected to it. Today, two individuals who are under the military control of the Government are being pitted against each other and the end result is that the people of the East have no where to go. We have the Chief Minister who is complaining that he is unable to work and we have an Hon. Member of Parliament, who is now a Minister and given the power to override the Chief Minister. Now, we all must agree that the East is the only province in the country that has all three communities living in equal proportions. I have said this before that it is only in the East that no one community can come to power without the assistance of another and having come to power they cannot continue in power unless they compromise to retain that power. Now, having had these conditions, which in my term would be \"laboratory\" conditions to try out a solution to this national problem; all three communities are there, they are of equal strength and no one can function on his own. In an environment like that if we do not work towards finding a solution to this jathiye problem, how does this end? This Government is on record that after having cleared the East, the Thirteenth Amendment would be implemented to the full. But, now what we have is a Council elected under the Thirteenth Amendment and not being allowed to function by the manoeuvring of this very same Government. Now, we have a unique situation in this",

    "text": "province. We have three districts - Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara. We have the District Consultative Committees. In Ampara we have three co-chairs representing the three different parties. We have the Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ismail Ashraff who represents the NUA, the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah who represents the National Congress and the Hon. P. Dayaratne from the United National Party Democratic Group. There are three co-chairs but nothing can work. Why? Each one has their own vested interests. Now, in Trincomalee we have a fellow Thomian, a former UNPer or still a UNPer from the Ratnapura District, who is relocated to the Trincomalee District to co-chair with a Member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress who is sitting with the Government. So, there are two co-chairs. Now, the scenario unfolds in the Batticaloa District. In the Batticaloa District, all this time the Hon. Ameer Ali was chairing the District Consultative Committee as the sole Minister. But, now we have the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran appointed as a Minister in equal rank and then we will have two co-chairs in Batticaloa also. So, what does this mean? This means that nothing is going to work in these districts. There is not going to be any coordination. Now, under the Thirteenth Amendment and the Provincial Council set-up, the mess that is being created is that the Government Agents function on their own. The Governor sits on top of all that. The Chief Minister and the Governor sit at all these DCC meetings. But nothing moves. Why? Because everything is being manipulated from the top. Now we know, the Provincial Council as it stands today, has no funds. They have not been given the money, they have been promised. They do not have the manpower even to write their statutes. There is absolutely no coordination between the Government Agents and the Provincial Council, leave alone the Members of Parliament. Now, we have a big problem in that all these days we did not have a Provincial Council, therefore the Members of Parliament basically managed the affairs of the District. Now, we have a Provincial Council and most of the subjects are devolved to the Provincial Council and the Provincial Council has no funds or real power. The elected representatives of the Provincial Council have absolutely no power to do anything because everything is being done centrally. The Ministry of Nation Building has overall power of all developments in the Eastern Province. This has become a mockery, an absolute mockery because we have all these institutions. The Provincial Council system is basically a white elephant. The Provincial Council cannot do anything. The elected Members cannot do anything because according to the Thirteenth Amendment itself, all the executive powers are with the Government. On top of that, we have the Ministry of Nation Building doing all the work around with absolutely no coordination with the Provincial Council.",

Devolve maximum power and provide adequate financial support to the Eastern Provincial Council by immediately making the necessary administrative and legal changes, as outlined in draft Interim Proposals submitted by the All Party Representative Committee (APRC) in January 2008, to enable the consistent and workable implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment. 2. Grant police powers to the Eastern Provincial Council only after the Constitutional Council is functioning and has appointed a new National Police Commission. 3. Ensure the security and nurture the confidence of the three communities of the Eastern Province by: a) demilitarizing the TMVP and integrating those cadres not credibly accused of human rights violations into the police and the security forces, while affording TMVP officials and office holders effective police protection; and b) enforcing the law fully and without political interference, preventing further political killings and abductions and bringing to justice the perpetrators of major cases of human rights violations in the East, including the January 2006 killing of five students in Trincomalee, the August 2006 murder of the Action Contre la Faim workers in Mutur, the September 2006 murder of ten Muslim workers in Pottuvil, and the February-March 2008 organized sexual assaults of women in Akkaraipattu. 4. Invite opposition parties, including the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and civil society representatives, with guaranteed protection, to join a regional peace process to discuss the grievances of the three communities and seek consensus on the future of the east and viable forms of power sharing at all levels of governance.",

Before I wind up, I would urge the Government to use the ideal conditions prevailing in the Eastern Province now to fully test the Thirteenth Amendment so that this House can then start debating further amendments to the Constitution which will eventually be required to bring a lasting solution to this problem.

One is - I have already spoken about the swearing in of the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran as a Minister and I had shared my thoughts on that a while ago in the Tamil language, of course. Subsequently, I would like to talk about the other significant event of the handing over of weapons by the TMVP in the Weber Stadium in Batticaloa. It is a very welcome issue. According to the reports I have today with regard to the handing over of weapons, what has been handed over is, 62 AK 47 weapons with 73 Magazines, two Light Machine Guns, - I am sure the Hon. Karuna Amman would be more familiar with these weapons, we have never handled these weapons - two LMGs, it must be Light Machine Guns and 4,650 AK 47 rounds of ammunition. In total, 150 weapons were handed over on the 7th of March, 2008 to Brigadier Dampath Fernando, General Officer Commanding of the 23rd Division. A lot of hue and cry was made when these weapons were handed over. A member of the Chief Ministers office, Mr. Azad Moulana, comes in the press and says that they have decided to hand over these weapons because they feel that",

    "text": "the LTTE is no more a threat in the East for them. This was said by a responsible member of the Chief Ministers office. Having said that, he goes on to say that there are other groups that have already handed over weapons and therefore now they also would not prefer to hold on to these weapons and they are handing over these weapons, and there are others in their organization who wish to go abroad and it is their duty to facilitate them to go abroad to seek foreign employment. Thereafter, we find statements by the Hon. Muralidaran. At one place he says, There is an LTTE threat to us and we will not hand over weapons. Subsequently, he has said, \"We do not have weapons to handover.\" Which of these statements are we to believe? I am not here at cross purposes with the Hon. Muralidaran for his retaining arms or handing over arms. This was done way back by the LTTE also; Yogaratnam Yogi of the LTTE handed over a revolver. In fact, I participated in discussions with Mr. Yogaratnam Yogi and others who came to Colombo and who stayed in the Hilton hotel during the Premadasa regime. We took part in the then All Party Conference with them. The Hon. Sri Kantha was also present at those discussions. So, the LTTE has symbolically handed over a revolver to the IPKF Commander in the presence of the Secretary of Defence, General Sepala Attygalle. The Hon. Muralidaran also asked the same question from Mr. Pillayan as to why he did not hand over his pistol. He is still holding on to his pistol. So, what is this drama? Whom are you trying to hoodwink? We have a right as a community which is not armed, which has its own fears and apprehensions, a legitimate question to ask from the State, from the Government, from the Commander-in-Chief and from the Defence Secretary. Mr. Speaker, may I say this? John F. Kennedy once said, I am an idealist without illusions. I concede that Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the present mentor of my friend, Karuna Amman, is an idealist. But, I do not know whether he is an idealist without illusions because I certainly know that he is suffering from illusion as to the handing over of weapons and disarming of these forces. Of course, his idealism is welcome by many people in this country because he is very firm about terrorism. And, the President says, I will wipe out terrorism from this country. I will have no talks with them unless they surrender their weapons. You come on your knees and that is the time we will talk to you\". That is the tone and tenor of the statement of the Commander-in-Chief and the idealism is to be respected. That is welcome by many people; they have even endorsed it at the recently held elections to provincial councils. We see how the majority in this country is endorsing the idealism of the President and his brother, the Defence Secretary and of this Government. But, is it idealism without illusions? There is this illusion of the entire country being totally free from all terrorists and everybody will hand over weapons. Since Mr. Pillayan, the Chief Minister, has handed over 62 AK 47s and two LNGs, they think they have handed over all their weapons. Is it not illusion? He is correct to have asked the question, \"Why have they not handed over",

I mean, if the Defence Secretary - just because the Hon. Karuna Amman has joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and has become an organizer, - is prepared to accept his word and says, \"Okay he does not have weapons; I have accepted what he said\", that is not the issue. We are not bothered about what Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in his capacity as the brother of the President or as the brother of the Leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is saying on behalf of a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Here we are asking him, as the Secretary of Defence of this country, whether it is not an illusionary statement. Is he not suffering from illusion, if he accepts the word of Mr. Karuna Amman that he does not have weapons? I do not think many in this country would agree with that position. This has happened in the past. The symbolic handing over of these weapons can be given a lot of publicity. But then, that does not mean that it has, in fact, totally been shown. That is why in certain conflict situations, like in Northern Ireland, they used a different kind of terminology. They used the terminology \"decommissioning of weapons\".",

The British who have actually mastered the art of anti-terrorist warfare said, \"Because there is this question of parity of esteem...\" These are all terminologies that evolved out of the Northern Ireland conflict situation. But, anyway, several incidents have happened. Soon after this symbolic handing over, what happened? Within a few days, a SLTB bus plying from Colombo to Kalmunai was waylaid at Nawalady Junction, Batticaloa and was set on fire. Then, four people at Mr. Karuna Amman's office in Sori Kalmunai in Sammanthurai were killed. That was a TMVP office and that too was attacked. That was how people took it. I am not saying that this was the work of anybody else because he, himself accused the LTTE of having done that. It may be so. But, then are we to accept? Now the Member from Trincomalee, the Hon. Jayantha Wijesekara, my Colleague, said that yesterday in the Morawewa area, in Dehiwatta, five villagers were killed, apparently by terrorists. So, now this whole thing is a big enigma for all of us, as to what is happening. Therefore, idealism is one thing but that idealism must be without illusions. You must be straightforward in what you say. I have had lengthy discussions with the Defence Secretary on the issue of police reforms in the Eastern Province because all of us are worried about law and order there. So, how do police reforms takes place? Of course, Mr. Karuna Amman says, \"We do not want police powers for the provincial councils\". But, that would be until he becomes the Chief Minister.

Nimal Siripala de Silva says another thing in the Virakesari\" newspaper. All of us know that this Thirteenth Amendment came about as a result of the Indo-Lanka Accord. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva in the \"Virakesari\" newspaper states, We are under no pressure from India to devolve power\". That is the statement of the Leader of the House. He states, \"We are under no pressure from India to devolve power and all what they have done, they have done and finished. There can be no more interference in the affairs of this country\". From the point of view of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of this country, I think that might be most welcomed by many in this country. We are looking at the issue of sincerity of purpose in devolving power, something that this Constitution has promised to the provinces in this country, the minorities in this country, land powers and police powers and a variety of other powers to be devolved. But, constituent parties of the Government are vehemently opposing it; that is a different issue. Today, the Leader of the House indirectly but very clearly is telling that even if India tells us, we do not have to. That is the tone and tenor of that statement. So, I am not here to fish in troubled waters but where do we go from here? We are talking about devolution in this country and then this land powers and police powers are issues where there must be a clarity of thought. Merely inviting political leaders for discussions for cameras and for public consumption is not going to solve the issue. Issues have to be dealt with and then some consensus reached. We have been participating as a political party in the APRC. We are the only political party in the Opposition today in the APRC. Why are we there? We could have left long time ago. In fact, we gave an ultimatum. But then, we are still continuing because we have some feeling and some expectation that at least something might come out of this. Ninety five per cent of the work has been completed, so says the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, Chairman of the APRC. But, then that is of course without the participation of the TNA, without the JVP, without the UNP and many other important parties in this country. Yet, for a variety of issues, we have formulated certain ideas and brought them within certain parameters and it is waiting to be implemented. At least that has to be formulated as an accepted policy of devolution by the Government and to be presented for us to examine and for other parties which have not participated in those discussions to decide on what is going to happen. So, you cannot say one thing to the International Community and something to the local population here. About the IMF loan, the Government says one thing in the Sinhala press and another in the English press. In fact, I wanted to speak this morning about the IMF rescue package of Rs. 1.9 billion that the Government is seeking All of us as citizens of this country, would prefer to see",

But, for all of us it was a very ugly thing for this Government to have done. Now, you are sending an invitation. I am sure an invitation with the right dignity, a proper invitation, certainly will be respected by any of us. But, see that you invite the Party Leaders for discussion; have a very open discussion with them. We are prepared to assist in rebuilding this nation, reuniting this nation but it has to be with dignity and decorum. With those words, I conclude my speech. Thank you, very much.",
