[. . 11.14] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Madam, Presiding Member, I would like to say a few words on the issue relating to the amendment to the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill which is being brought in to facilitate elections in the Northern Province, after having liberated the North as claimed by the Government. I say it with emphasis that "as claimed by the Government" for the reason that all of us can see that this liberation is not enjoyed by the normal civilian population in the areas where the so-called liberation has taken place. We see that most of these people who are coming to the liberated areas and to the Government-controlled areas from the LTTE-controlled areas are being confined to open prison camps. That is one issue. Here, the avowed reason of the Government to bring in this amendment is to hold elections in the Northern Province and particularly, after a discussion we had with His Excellency the President a few weeks ago along with some of the Tamil party representatives who are siding with the Government - we were perhaps the only North-Eastern party which was not with the Government but attended the meeting whereas the TNA boycotted the meeting - we found that the President was keen to hold stage by stage elections and his idea is to first hold the elections within the Jaffna Municipal Council limits. Today, the Jaffna Municipal Council area is a virtual garrison city; whether there is freedom prevalent there for everybody to move as they wish, is a question that everybody could pose to the Government. But yet, in that situation if you are going to hold elections, we would welcome it but subject to creating conditions of normalcy there for all parties to contest with absolute security. This issue is a matter of concern for Muslims since all the Muslims from the Northern Province have been chased away by the LTTE way back in 1990. They are still living in refugee camps in the South and particularly, in areas like Puttalam. Now we have brought to the notice of His Excellency the President the need to introduce an amendment to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to facilitate the displaced voters to elect their members from wherever they are presently residing and this facility is available in the Parliamentary Elections. The President undertook to bring that amendment to allow voters living in other areas to vote from outside the municipal limits of Jaffna, so that those considerable number of Muslims who are now displaced could elect their members while they reside outside the Jaffna municipal limits. So, this amendment needs to be introduced before the Government envisages to hold elections. On the other hand, all parties will have to have the necessary security and freedom to contest in a future local authority election in the Northern Province

[ ]

2009 21 1407 1408

and subsequently if you are to hold even a provincial council election, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress would be quite willing to contest, provided these conditions of normalcy are properly satisfied. Having said that, I must also comment on the attempt by the Government to hastily bring in amendments to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to bring in a mixed system, a so-called mixed system where they are trying to re-introduce the ward system. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress challenged this matter before the Supreme Court and we succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to refer the Bill to the Provincial Councils since that was seen as a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, if the Government is to introduce the Bill without the consent of the Provincial Councils, they may have to get the two-thirds majority vote in this House in order to have those provisions passed into law. Now, the Government having considered the options available to them went to the Eastern Provincial Council in the first instance to have this Bill endorsed by them. What did they finally see? I must thank some of the Government side members in the Eastern Provincial Council who saw the danger that was in it to the minorities living scattered all over the island. The Chief Minister including a variety of other Ministers and Members spoke against the Bill and finally the Government was left with no option but to get the President himself to call the Chairman of the Council and hastily postpone the sittings. Sittings were postponed till the last 20th and thereafter we find that again the President has ordered it be postponed further, up to mid-May. This, we see as a healthy sign where the Government is now caving in to the pressure by the minority sentiments, even within the Government ranks. As much as the Government has given an ultimatum of 24 hours to the LTTE to allow the civilians to leave the areas where they are in control, similarly the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is giving an ultimatum to the Government. We are giving you another three weeks. Please withdraw this Bill and try to work it out with all the parties. Even the parties in Government, the Leaders in Government, the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman and the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana and various other small party leaders are seriously concerned about the implications of this Bill and the way in which this will finally destroy the healthy political culture we have developed through the Proportional Representation System where smaller parties enjoy some considerable representation in local authorities and in every other sphere of political representation. Therefore, this is an important juncture at which this Government will look at the reality and not to force-feed some of their amendments which is designed to perpetuate themselves in power. We see this tendency developing in the Government ranks. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is on a voyage to virtually swallow all the small parties; we see that in all these elections. Now, we do not see red decorations at the UPFA meetings, it is

all blue. All the red has virtually vanished. All the left parties have been made to virtually assimilate into the SLFP identity and this trend is very dangerous. If you are trying to introduce democracy into the liberated areas, this is not the way to get about. So, I would earnestly appeal to the Government to withdraw this Bill which you have attempted to introduce in the Eastern Provincial Council. Even after three weeks you will not succeed. It is to be seen whether all pressure tactics are going to succeed. But, I would earnestly request you - the Hon. Foreign Minister is here - if you are going to tell the International Community about your sincere commitment to democracy, see that you consult all parties, come to some consensus and then introduce this amendment. This amendment will lead to total discontent among minorities and will create another issue, and therefore I would expect some saner counsel to prevail and that they would withdraw this Bill. Then, on the issue of liberating the East and now liberating almost the entire North, what is happening today? In North of Pulmoddai, in the Pulmoddai-Kokkilai road, there is an area called "Jinna Nagar". It was reported to me two days ago that in that area, a Muslim area, suddenly roads are being named; sinhalization is taking place. The navy had intervened and started naming roads as, "Vihara Mawatha", "Kumudu Mawatha", "Dumhiri Mawatha", "Menik Mawatha", all of a sudden. Why is this attempt? A total sinhalization of the area where the Muslims are predominant is taking place. Suddenly, the local authority Chairman had realized that this is a matter for the local authority and when he intervened the navy officers had said, "This is for security purposes. To identify locations, we have temporarily decided to name these areas. We will withdraw them and allow you to rename them". But subsequently, after having taken the boards away, a delegation has gone from Colombo to look for archaeological finds and to demarcate new archeological sites and again the name boards have appeared. What is this attempt of trying to totally change the demographic nature of the entire area? People are fearing that there is a subtle attempt to create new settlements and to change the existing demography. Please do not do this. If you go in this fashion, the entire idea of liberating the East to create a healthy co-existence in the Eastern Province, which if is the pious intention of the Government, I request you, please do not take unilateral decisions of this nature and create more conflict. With those comments, I would conclude my speech since I know my time is limited. Madam, this is a very serious matter. I believe the Government will take serious note of this and take necessary steps to refrain from the so-called sinhalization of the East by renaming areas where other minorities dominate. Thank you.

Under the 2007 Budget, the Central Bank had authority to borrow money up to US Dollars 6.5 billion. So it is under that that the Government made the borrowing from the HSBC. ( ) (The Hon.

Venerable Presiding Member, the question is this. These defenceless Tamil civilians were forced to take refuge in the so-called no-fire zone or safety zone because of the announcement made by the Government. But, what is happening now is that they do not have any safety even in that so-called no-fire zone. They do not have any guarantee to their lives, any guarantee to their safety even in the no-fire zone. That is the point I am seeking to make. But, unfortunately I find a collective vocal power of some of the Hon. Members from the Government ranks being applied in order to shut down the truth to which I am referring, I am averting now. Venerable Presiding Member, now there are hundreds of people who have been seriously injured and admitted to Government hospitals in Padavi Sripura and Pulmoddai. In regard to the details of those who have been injured and admitted to these hospitals for immediate medical treatment, for urgent medical treatment, no details are available. One of our Members of Parliament, the Hon. K. Thurairetnasingam has contacted the Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition; he has contacted the Government Agent, Vavuniya. Unfortunately, no details are available. All what I am saying today, Venerable Presiding Member, is that the Government is duty-bound to give the names and the details of all those who have been injured and admitted to Government hospitals including Padavi Sripura and also the hospital at Pulmoddai in order to get urgent medical treatment. This is a humanitarian problem. Why are you hiding the details? They are hidden in the camps in Vavuniya. I understand, Venerable Presiding Member, that some young men and women have been taken by some men, who have identified themselves as members of certain units of the Police Department, for interrogation. I am in possession of some distressing and disturbing reports that some of them have not returned to the camps. This is a very

serious situation. Therefore, this is a matter which I would like to place on record today for the Government to go into, and if it is true, to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of those young men and women who have been found missing as I have mentioned now. Then comes, Venerable Presiding Member, the question of registration and re-registration of Tamil civilians in Colombo. A couple of days ago, the Tamil people in Wellawatta - [Interruption.] ( )

STABILIZATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me permission to move the Adjournment Motion on the stabilization of the financial institutions in this country. I move, "After the collapse of the Golden Key Credit Card Company several financial companies and generally the private sector and investors have come under severe stress. Thousands of depositors of Golden Key

1495 1496

Credit Card Company have lost their savings and consequently the confidence of the finance sector has been greatly eroded. Therefore it is incumbent on the Government to give redress to the depositors and support the legitimate financial institutions to conduct their business." Sir, the Government is mismanaging the economy. Today, this has spilt over to the private sector, especially to the financial institutions and as a result you could see that a lot of innocent depositors are faced with an imminent bankruptcy. The depositors who have deposited money on the assurance given by the Central Bank that their monies are safe are today in a vulnerable situation. Over the last two or three months the way the Government has been handling the financial institutions is rather pathetic, precarious and lacks any direction. So, I thought of bringing this Motion before this House because there is a necessity to protect the financial institutions that are running well and protecting the depositors' money and to ensure that we will not get into further chaos.

, , (.) . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (VEN.) UDAWATTE NANDA THERO took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Venerable Sir, we see that the country has almost 111 Ministers and in the area of finance, there are two or three dedicated Ministers. Unfortunately, each of them speaks in different terms, with different connotations giving different meanings. In September 2008, when this Government was told that there is an economic downturn in the world, they said that there is no necessity to worry about that. At that time, it was none other but the Finance Ministry personnel and the Governor of the Central Bank who said that even though the European and the American financial

systems are having a meltdown, Mahinda Chintana is strong enough to face any downturn without any problem. That was mentioned on the 21st of September 2008. But, Venerable Sir, if you look at the Central Bank Report, 2008, which was tabled here yesterday, on page 1 itself it is stated that the global meltdown had had an impact of almost US Dollars 120 billion by way of an additional debt to the country and almost US Dollars 1.7 billion out of US Dollars 3.56 billion foreign reserves have evaporated owing to the financial meltdown. So, this shows the inability of the Government to take a stand on a particular issue. Now, going on further, I quote from the online edition of the Daily Mirror of 21st April, 2009 where the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Non-Cabinet Minister of State Revenue and Finance has stated:

Global financial crisis hits Lanka-" The same Minister in January said that there is no financial meltdown and in November 2008, during the Budget Debate he said, " " . . . Venerable Sir, the depositors who have invested money in financial institutions as well as banks have been guided with confidence. I am quoting a notice put up by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the "Daily News" of 21st July, 2003 where it has named 22 licensed commercial banks, 13 licensed specialized banks and 26 registered finance companies which are authorized to accept the deposits from the public. This is a notice issued under the seal of the Central Bank by Mrs. L.K. Gunatilake, Director of Department of Supervision, Non-Bank Financial Institutions.

When these types of things are brought into the public domain, it is absolutely important that the Central Bank follows up with these institutions. While this appeared on 21st of July, 2003, we have been questioning the Central Bank at the COPE on various occasions and on every single occasion the Central Bank said that the people need not worry to invest as the Central Bank has put in the necessary regulations and safeguards to protect their money. So, this was the beginning of monies being invested in the institutions supervised by the Central Bank even though sometimes they had not been fully supervised. Today, people are taking their monies out from financial institutions because they do not have confidence in keeping their monies there owing to the duplicity shown by the Government.

Venerable Sir, on the 25th of December, 2008 the Governor of the Central Bank has said, Nothing could be done with the unauthorized deposits. This intimation contradicts the notice which appeared on the 21st July, 2003. So, the Central Bank itself does not know what it is doing.

So, we ask the Government, can you please tell us at what point the United National Party opposed the taking of money from the IMF? As a matter of fact, we told the Government, Do not go after the HSBC, the Standard Chartered Bank, the ICICI Bank and take loans at 8 to 9 per cent, because the country cannot pay it back. Now that the Government has taken the money, pay it back. But we, the UNP, will not allow this money to be paid because we do not want to burden the people. We did tell them so. Today, the IMF has imposed certain conditions. We want to ask the Government to tell us this. Now, the Ceylinco institutions and other companies are having an impact because of the financial meltdown that has taken place. The Government says that they are taking loans without conditions. We are asking the Government to please tell us what are the conditions that have been imposed. If conditions have not been imposed, then why is the rupee value of the dollar being taken up to Rs. 120? Why did the President say that there would be no salary increases? Why did Mr. Sumith Abeysinghe issue a letter on the 4th of March, 2009 instructing not to create any jobs? That is the situation. Why did you bring in the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill? Was it because of the instructions given by the IMF? Please ensure that these are told. Now, you say that the IMF is not giving money. Is it because of the fact that the Government did not give in to the conditions of the IMF? Now they are supposed to be giving in. That is why the dollar is being depreciated. So, please give us an answer as to what the real situation is. Today, the IMF is having a problem with monies. When the IMF came forward, the Government was trying to show that they came forward as if there was no other country to lend the money. Now, what has happened? Now they have enough countries to lend and they are worried whether there is enough money to give Sri Lanka. Romania and Poland got US Dollars 65 billion yesterday - US Dollars 45 billion to Romania and US Dollars 20 billion to Poland. That totals to US Dollars 65 billion. The IMF has

2009 21 1503 1504

realized that there are three categories in lending to the countries. One is, fundamentally flawed countries. The other one is, the second category to which Sri Lanka belongs, countries which have screwed up their economies. The third category is the low-priority economies. Sri Lanka, which is in the second category, has to look into whether these conditions have been met by the IMF. So, if the Government says that there are no conditions in taking loans, please prove it to us that you are taking loans without any conditions at all. Then, the next matter that has got to be looked at is the inability of the Government to fulfill other macro-conditions in the country. That is one of the salient factors for the breakdown of the economy. So, most economists in Sri Lanka and others who have come to advise the Government have been calling upon the Government to spell out its long-term economic policy. Now, there is no point, owing to your inability, in saying that there is a war and the economy is not able to go forward. Every country has multiple problems. The United National Party also faced the problem. We had a war; we developed the economy; we developed our foreign relations; we developed the infrastructure; we protected democracy; we ensured that human rights were protected and the media freedom was enshrined. So, do not go on the basis that you are the only ones confronted with that problem. What we want to do is to ensure that the economy does not take a beating, which is unable to be repaired or beyond repairable limits.So, Venerable Sir, what we are asking at this particular moment is to ensure that there is a guaranteed policy in how finance is going to be looked at. Is the lending rate going to be increased? If so, tell us to what level. If the inflation has come down to 5 per cent, why are the Treasury Bills at 15.6 per cent? You do not need to have such a huge gap between inflation and the lending rate. Why is it not being brought down? If you go on the basis that you spent US Dollars 1,000 million in order to defend the rupee, then for whom did you defend it because in two months' time the defence has fallen and now the dollar is almost Rs. 118? Is it that you did it for certain people in order to ensure that they get unlawful monies and make a capital gain out of that? . , ? ? , ? 138 . . 10 . , if you take the language of the Central Bank Governor, 35 300 . ? 300 .
