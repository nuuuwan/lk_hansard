With Ms. Shahida Barrie SC. For A.G. in SC. (SD) 07/2009. Court assembled for hearing on 31st August 2009 at 10.00 a.m. A Bill titled Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill has been presented to Parliament and was placed on the Order Paper of Parliament on 6th August 2009. Four Petitions numbered as above have been presented invoking the jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution. Upon receipt of the Petitions the Court issued notice on the Attorney General as required by Article 134(1) of the Constitution. Counsel representing the Petitioners and the Attorney General were heard before this Bench at the sittings held on 31st August 2009. The Bill seeks to repeal Sub Sections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10) of Section 7 of the Parliamentary Elections (Act) No. 1 of 1981 and replace Section 8 and 9 thereof. Counsel for the Petitioners sought to object to the constitutionality of the following provisions in the Bill. Sections 7(5)(b) and 7(6) in Clause 2 Sections 8(2) and 8(4) in Clause 3 Sections 9(3)(i) in Clause 4 Section 7 in Clause 2 deals with recognized political parties for the purpose of Parliamentary Elections. Sections 7(4), (5) and (6) deal with the selection process of recognized political parties. Section 7(5) states as follows:- Upon receipt of an application duly made under sub section (4) on behalf of any political party, the Commission shall, after such inquiry as it may deem fit - (a) if in the opinion of the Commission such party is a political party and is organized to contest elections under the Act; and (b) if the Commission is satisfied that such party has been engaged in political activities for a continuous period of at least four years prior to the date of the making of such application or that out of at least two candidates nominated by such party at least one was successful at the last Parliamentary general election or that out of at least five candidates nominated by such party for five defferent Provincial Councils at least three were successful at the last provincial elections, held immediately preceding the date of application of such party, make Order- (i) that such party shall be entitled to be treated as a recongnized political party for the purpose of elections, subject however, to the provisions of this Act ; (ii) allotting an approved symbol to such party, being the approved symbol which the political party wishes to have allocated to it out of the approved symbols, determined by the Commission in its absolute discretion, but not being the approved symbol of any other political party which is entitled to be so treated.

2009 08 1785 1786

Petitioners contend that Section 5(b) does not make provision for parties that would be formed based on political alliances. In recent times it has become common for political parties to form alliances among parties and contest under an alliance which will be a new political party for the purpose of the election. It was submitted that Section 5(b) as presently worded would not permit recognition of such a new alliance as a recognized political party. It was contended that it would affect the franchise which is a part of sovereignty of the people in terms of Article 3 of the Constitution. It was also contended that it would prevent a voter from voting for such an alliance at a Parliamentary election and would accordingly violate freedom of expression contained in Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution in accordance with the Judgement of Mediwaka Vs. Dayananda Dissanayake [(2001) 1 SLR 177]. The Senior State Counsel submitted that there was no intention on the part of the State to preclude parties based on political alliances being accepted as recognized political parties. The fundamental right to equality too acquires that laws should apply equally in respect all persons including political parties. We are of the view that Section 5(b) as presently worded would not permit recognition of an alliance as contended by the Petitioner. Due to the aforementioned reasons Section 7(5)(b) is inconsistent with Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(a) of the Constitution and therefore would require to be passed by the special majority as laid down by Article 84(2) of the Constitution. It is also our view that this inconsistency with the constitution would cease if the following words are added at the end of Sub Section 5 of Section 7 of the Bill. The words such party in this sub section would include a constituent party of a party formed based on a political alliance. Petitioner also objected to Section 7(6) in Clause 2 of the Bill. Section 7(6) of the Bill states as follows :- A political party shall not be entitled to be treated as a recognized political party under paragraph (a) of sub section (5) if its name is identical with the name of any party which is already entitled to be treated as a recognized political party or in the opinion of the Commission so nearly resembles such name as to be calculated to mislead, confuse or deceive or signifies any religion or community. The Petitioners are of the view that the words or signifies any religion or community would prevent a political party having a name which signifies a religion or a community from being considered as a recognized political party. Learned Senior State Counsel stated that it was never intended to prevent consideration of political parties which have names that signifies any religion or community from being recognized as a recognized political party. When Article 41A(3) of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution recognizes minority communities, the Court is of the view that the words or signifies any religion or community are superfluous and may amount to interference with the franchise of the people as dealt with in Articles 3 and 4(e) of the Constitution thereby leads to a possible violation of Article 14(1)(a) and 14(1)(e). In the circumstances, the Court recommended and the Senior State Counsel agreed to move for an amendment at the Committee Stage of Parliament to have the said words deleted from Section 7(6). Petitioners also objected to Section 8(2) and 8(4) in Clause 3 of the Bill. Section 8(2) and 8(4) states as follows:- Section 8(2) - Every recognized political party shall hold a general meeting once a year or as specified in the

Constitution of the party. The procedure to be followed at such meeting shall be specified in such Constitution. The notice of the holding of such meeting indicating the venue, time, date of such meeting shall be published by the Secretary of such recognize political party in daily newspapers circulating in Sri Lanka in the Sinhala, Tamil and English languages, at least there weeks before the date of the meeting, I order that the members of such party become aware of such meeting. Section 8(4)- A copy of the annual statement of accounts of every recognized political party audited by a registered auditor shall be public in the Sinhala, tamil and English languages in newspapers published in Sri Lanka and an audited copy of such statement shall be furnished to the Commission by the Secretary of the party within sixty days after the end of every financial year. Such statement also shall contain details of donations in cash or kind received by the political party. Such statement shall also contain names and addresses of donors, the nature of the donation and where the donation consists of money the amount in rupees and if the cash donation is made from abroad, the amount in rupees and its equivalent to the foreign currency it was received and if the donation is in kind the description of the items received. The Petitioners contend that these provisions are not necessary for a proper administration of the Parliamentary Elections Act and would cause an unfair burden on the political parties and would result in a violation of Article 14(1)(a) as it would affect the right of voters in exercising their freedom of expression. They also contend that in the context of the Provisions in Section 8(7), 8(10) and 9(1) of the Bill, this would repose arbitrary powers on the Commission and would be violative of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Senior State Counsel states that recognized political parties are accorded a host of privileges under the Parliamentary Elections Act and other electoral laws at public expense and accordingly, it is necessary to have transparency and accountability of the activities of recognized political parties. Counsel also referred to the judgment of this Court in Environmental Foundation Ltd. Vs. Urban Development Authority [SC. (FR) Application No.47/2004,SC. Minutes dated 23.11.2005] where right to information was considered as a constitutent element of the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. Counsel further stated that the information required to be furnished by the political parties would be necessary to secure the rights of The public obtain relevant information in accordance with their rights guaranteed by Article 14 (1) (a) of the Constitution. Senior State Counsel also submitted that powers under Section 8(7)(a) is to be exercised with adequate safe guards as the said Clause specifically states that such information or document could be called for purposes of exercising the powers conferred on the Commission under this Act. It is observed that general or special directions under Section 8(10) could be issued only where it may be necessary for the effective and efficient implementation of the provisions of Sections (7) and (8).

After considering these submissions, the Court is of the view that Sections 8(2) and 8(4) in Clause 3 are not inconsistent with the Provisions of the Constitution.

1787 1788

The Petitioners objected to Clause 4 which contains Section 9(3)(i) of the Bill. The Petitioners took up the position that this Clause will prevent a political party formed consequent to a political alliance from continuing to be a recognized political party. Accordingly, Petitioners argued that this Clause violates Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. Learned Senior State Counsel took up the position that this submission is misconceived on the basis that these provisions do not suggest that the nomination should have been by means of a list submitted in the name of that very party (the party of the political alliance). He stated that if one of the constituent parties could satisfy the requirement in Section 9(3)(1) it would suffice. The Court is of the view that the words such party in Clause 9(3)(1) do not refer to a constituent party and therefore this provision could affect the rights of a party formed consequent to a political alliance and therefore would be inconsistent with Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. It is also our view that this inconsistency would cease if the following words are added at the end of Sub Section 3 of Section 9 of the Bill. The words such party in this sub section would include a constituent party of a party formed based on a political alliance. For the reasons stated above, we make a determination in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution as follows:- (1) Section 7(5)(b) in clause to of the Bill in its present form is inconsistent with Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(a) of the Constitution and therefore this Bill may only be passed by a special majority as provided for in Article 84(2) of the Constitution. We make a further determination in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution that inconsistency stated above would cease if Clause 7(5) is replaced by a Provision on the following lines ; Upon receipt of an application duly made sub section (4) on behalf of any political party, the Commission shall, after such inquiry as it may deem fit - (c) if in the opinion of the Commission such party is a political party and is organized to contest elections under the Act; and (d) if the Commission is satisfied that such party has been engaged in political activities for a continuous period of at least four years prior to the date of the making of such application or that out of at least two candidates nominated by such party at least one was successful at the last parliamentary general election or that out of at least five candidates nominated by such party for five different Provincial Councils at least three were successful at the last provincial elections, held immediately preceding the date of application of such party, make Order -

(iii) that such party shall be entitled to be treated as a recognized political party for the purpose of elections, subject however, to the provisions of this Act; (iv) allotting an approved symbol to such party, being the approved symbol which the political party wishes to have allocated to it out of the approved symbols, determined by the Commission it its absolute discretion, but not being the approved symbol of any other political party which is entitled to be so treated. The words such party in this sub section would include a constituent party of a party formed based on a political alliance. (2) Clause 9(3) of the Bill in its present form is inconsistent with Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution and therefore this Bill may only be passed by the special majority as provided for in Article 84(2) of the Constitution. We make a further determination in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution that inconsistency stated above would cease if Clause 9(3) is replaced by a Provision on the following lines; A Political party which is entitled to be treated as a recognized political party for the purpose of elections shall cease to be so entitled - (i) if not one single candidate of such party is nominated for two consecutive Parliamentary general elections; (ii) if it does not conform to the requirements of sub sections (1), (3) (4) and (7) of section 8. The words such party in this sub section would include a constituent party of a party formed based on a political alliance. (3) The words or signifies any religion or community be deleted from Section 7(6) in Clause 2. Subject to the aforesaid, none of the other provisions of the Bill are inconsistent with any provisions of the Constitution. We wish to place on record our appreciation of the assistance rendered to Court by the Senior State Counsel and the Counsel for the Petitioners. J. A. N. de Silva Chief Justice. K.

Hon. Speaker, If I may reply to the Hon. (Prof) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala; I asked a relevant Question. Obviously I asked a Question related to ships and aircraft. Ships do not come to the Pettah Bus Stand; they come to the harbours. So, the motive and objective of my Question was to know, how many jobs have been created. - [Interruption.] That is what we are asking. So the relevance is obvious. ( ) (The Hon.

Hon. Speaker, there was a reference made by an irre-sponsible Member of Parliament about the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara about some files. He is a person who has been absconding and avoiding the Police. How can he threaten another Member of Parliament who is doing an honour-able service here? What is this talk of carrying files and things like that.

UNIVERSITIES (AMENDMENT) BILL . . Order for Second Reading read. [. . 11.00] . . ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala - Minister of Higher Education)

I move, That the Bill be now read a Second time. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to begin with an explanation of the amendments which have been placed before this House for approval. The purpose is to amend certain Sections of the principal piece of legislation introduced in 1978. The Universities Act, - [Interruption.] No, I am not giving way. We are debating an important piece of legislation. I am not prepared to give way. The Universities Act, No.16 of 1978 is the principal piece of legislation under which universities have been administered in the last several years. As stated in its Preamble, the purpose of the Act of 1978 was to establish - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

No, I am not giving way. We are debating a Bill. - [Interruption.] I am not giving way. The purpose of the Universities Act, No.16 of 1978 was to establish the University Grants Commission and to provide for the establishment, maintenance and administration of the universities and other higher education institutions in this country. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . , " " . . . . 11.00.

( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara) , . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . " " . . . ( .. ) (The Hon. Y. M. Navaratne Banda) ? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara) , ? [ ] . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Mr. Speaker, apart from creating the University Grants Commission and the USAB, and decentralizing the single university which was a unitary university, the 1978 piece of legislation referred to the powers of the Minister of Higher Education. Under this Act which was enacted in 1978, the Minister enjoys certain powers, and he can give written instructions to the UGC on specified matters pertaining to the establishment and administration of the universities. This Act has been amended on a number of occasions, and the last amendment was in 1995. I, in my capacity as the Deputy Minister of Higher Education, was associated with the last amendment with which we reduced the period of office of the Vice-Chancellor to two terms which means, - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

- Mr. Speaker, that a Vice-Chancellor can remain in office for a period of six years. This Act, which was enacted in 1978, was in operation for more than 27 years and various defects were identified and they needed to be corrected in order to achieve both administrative efficiency and proper academic control within our universities.

2009 08 1865 1866

Yet another defect was that certain provisions of the 1978 Act did not fall in line with certain changes in public policy in other spheres of governmental activity in this country. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the University Grants Commission, as the apex body in the field of higher education in this country, examined those special provisions in the Act which needed revision and recommended a few amendments which are to be debated today in this House. Section 48 of the principal enactment - I refer to the principal piece of legislation which was introduced in 1978 - which dealt with the composition of the Faculty is to be amended with these new amendments in order to include Senior Professors and Lecturers (Probationary) as members of the Faculties of the University. In the past, the Assistant Lecturers enjoyed this opportunity and now it has been extended to Lecturers (Probationary). The purpose is to expand the Faculty. The base of the Faculty has been expanded by this amendment and the Faculty in future will include the following: (1) all permanent Senior Professors, Professors, Associate Professors, Senior Lecturers and Lecturers of the Departments of Study; (2) two members elected by the Lecturers (Probationary) of the Faculty; and (3) two members of the permanent staff of instructors. Mr. Speaker, there are three major components in any modern university, for that matter - Administration, Faculty and Students. A university, as you know very well, Mr. Speaker, is a community of scholars dedicated to the preservation, advancement and transmission of knowledge. It is a knowledge-creating body. In any university, the branches of study are broadly divided into Faculties and they are subdivided into Departments. It is on the basis of this division that both teaching and research are organized and conducted in a university. Therefore, the Faculty is subordinate to the Senate, which as you know, is the highest academic body in a given university. It is the Senate which takes all academic decisions and the argument has been made that the powers of the Senate need to be expanded to include powers pertaining to discipline as well. It needs to be done. Section 71 of the principal enactment is to be amended to provide for the Commission to determine the salary points of employees who are not teachers and they are to be appointed on the basis of the recommendation of the Higher Educational Institutions. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. PIYANKARA JAYARATNE] took the Chair.

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am referring to a particular provision in the legislation, which is to be amended. This provision, in my view, has expanded the autonomy and independence of the Higher Educational Institutions which come under the purview of the University Grants Commission. In other words, some of these amendments, in my view, expand the autonomy and independence of our universities in this country. That is a good thing because we need to preserve the independence and autonomy of our universities. The next amendment, which proposes to amend subsection (1) of Section 72 of the 1978 Act, relates to the need to serve a probationary period of one year and this applies to teachers who have been previously confirmed in a post in another Higher Educational Institution. The next amendment is a vital concession extended to all the non-academic employees of this country. According to Section 75 of the original piece of legislation, an employee was expected to retire at the age of 55. A person was able to obtain extensions up to the 60th year and that was subject to a number of conditions. The amendment which is before this House today proposes to change the optional age of retirement to 57, a vital concession to the non-academic employees in the university. They need to be happy about it, which means that a person can now continue to remain in service until he completes his 57th year. This, in my view, is a major concession extended to all the non-academic employees of the universities and all trade unions have applauded this decision. In the last amendment, the definition of the word Teacher has been changed to include the following: Senior Professors, Professors, Senior Lecturers, Lecturers and Lecturers (Probationary). Mr. Deputy Speaker, these are the things which I need to mention in respect of the amendments. Now, I would like to seize the opportunity to provide the House with certain basic facts relating to university education in Sri Lanka. Our system has been commended by the World Bank. I have here with me a book published by the World Bank titled "The Towers of Learning", which they produced a couple of days back. I am sure my good, learned Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, would have seen this. This is what its Executive Summary states. I will quote the second paragraph: The higher education sector can and must lead Sri Lanka successfully over the crests of these two waves of golden opportunity. Higher education institutions should drive and accelerate the countrys ascent to middle-income (MIC) status. Also, the higher education system should inspire the countrys values, ethics and social institutions so that Sri Lanka becomes celebrated as an enlightened and peaceful multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural society.

This is what they say in respect of our higher education. They have commended our proposals. Our higher education system has been commended by the World Bank, which has agreed to support us till 2015. The Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, my good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, will be happy to hear that the World Bank is willing to support the higher education system till 2015, within which period we propose to bring about a comprehensive change in the system with a view to converting our universities into global centres of excellence; we want to convert our universities into global centres of learning. This can be achieved only with the co-operation of the undergraduate community. Let me begin with the progress we made in respect of the buildings and the rest of it. With regard to admissions, we have made a couple of achievements. In 2006, we admitted 17,248 students. In 2007, it was increased to 20,069 and in 2008, we admitted 20,846 students. Every year we made an increase. This is a major improvement and we propose to increase the intake to 25,000 in the next two years. In terms of global standards, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the public investment in higher education is comparatively low. I accept that. This was due to various constraints in the Sri Lankan economy in the last 30 years. Public investment in higher education in terms of GDP is still low. In other words, it is 0.5 per cent of GDP and only 18 per cent of the public Budget is allocated to higher education. Despite the nature of investment, which, in my view, - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister - . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

Please do not interrupt me. I am not giving way. I have no time. Please do not interrupt. I am not giving way. You have been used to these kinds of interruptions. Some of them are useful; some of them are absolutely useless. Despite the nature of investment, we have achieved a commendable progress within the system. We are now in the process of modernizing the curricular of the universities. Mr. Deputy Speaker, the curricular is fairly old. It needs to be modernized in the interest of better performance of our graduates from the universities. Now we want to break away from the traditional disciplines which dominated the university since 1942 or for that matter, dominated the system in the last 60 years. The traditional disciplines served a purpose at that particular point of time, but now we need to make changes. We need market-oriented courses with which we can produce

an employable graduate. That is our aim. We want to produce graduates who can find employment in the competitive labour market. Now the system has 86 courses for which students are annually selected. In 2006, we introduced a couple of new courses. In 2007, ten more new courses were introduced and in 2008 another six courses were added. We have done the changes in keeping with the global changes in the field of higher education. One problem within the system was the failure to work according to the University Calendar. Now we have fixed common dates or common days for the commencement and the conclusion of the undergraduate academic programmes of the undergraduate academic year, and this is to be implemented in the academic year 2008 and 2009. In the area of academic development, two new Faculties were established both at Peradeniya and Rajarata. Thirty six new Departments of Study have been established in the last three years, and the aim was to modernize the course structure in the universities so that you can produce people who can obtain employment in a competitive employment market. It is only on the basis of such changes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we can produce employable graduates. Yet another thing which we have undertaken is the re-examination of the external degree programmes of the universities. Universities expanded the external degree programmes in order to provide more access to higher educational opportunities. The external degree programmes were introduced in order to give more opportunities to students to obtain a higher educational qualification. In Sri Lanka, external degree programmes are conducted or offered by 11 universities and cater to our student clientele - you will be surprised to hear - of nearly 175,000. Certain universities register more than 75,000 or sometimes more than 50,000 students. The quality of external graduates has declined, and therefore measures are being taken or measures are immediately necessary to improve the quality of the external graduates. In future, students will be admitted only on the basis of the Z-score. A minimum level will be established for this purpose. Otherwise, every Tom, Dick and Harry can get into the course, go into one of the poorly-administered tuition classes, collect a couple of notes, sit the exam and pass it. We do not want to produce such graduates in the future. We want to produce a quality graduate even through the external degree programmes. In Sri Lanka, the emphasis has been on undergraduate education. Mr. Deputy Speaker, all of us know that since 1921 when the University College was established during colonial time and since 1942 when an Independent Autonomous University was established under the colonial regime again, our emphasis was primarily on undergraduate education. It was this reason which led to the neglect of the postgraduate sector. A postgraduate intellectual culture is fundamentally necessary if one wants to make an impact on the learning environment of

[ . . ]

the undergraduate. A postgraduate intellectual culture needs to be promoted and restored in order to change the learning environment in our universities. Most of our undergraduates do not want to learn; they want to go pasting posters all over the country or carrying a kete in order to collect money. No university will be allowed to conduct postgraduate courses without the approval of the University Grants Commission because that too needs to be streamlined; that needs to be properly controlled, so that we can produce good postgraduates with qualifications which are acceptable to the outside world. A Faculty of Graduate Studies needs to be created for the purpose of promoting postgraduate education. Another important matter on which the Ministry has taken a decision was the need for a Common National Qualification Framework. I am sure my learned Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Amunugama will be happy to hear this. This country, Hon. Kiriella, needs a Common National Qualification Framework because there are bogus providers. Yesterday, I read in a newspaper that there is a small factory in Matale which is producing degree certificates. Therefore, there are bogus producers. This kind of thing needs to be stopped. Such a National Qualification Framework is necessary to discourage bogus providers in this country. In any case, the country at this given point of time needs a National Qualification Framework in order to maintain standards, consistency and comparability of university level qualification. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, your time is over. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

I have been given 30 minutes and the Hon. Chief Government Whip told me that I might be able to get ten more minutes from the other speakers. Is it okay? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

You have been allocated only 22 minutes and you have already finished that. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

Since the emergence of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, several measures have been taken to improve the infrastructure facilities of the universities. Impressive achievements have been recorded in respect of infrastructure development. Thirty five construction projects have been completed in order to provide facilities for teaching, learning and accommodation. There are 49

on-going projects the cost of which is around Rs. 10,429 million. In addition, there are 31 projects for which approval has been given by the Department of National Planning. There are another 18 projects, the estimated cost of which is Rs. 4,020 million. It has been approved by the Cabinet. Measures have been taken to curb ragging. This is a thing on which, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I need to speak. You need to give me a little bit of time because I need to speak a couple of words on ragging. . Measures have been taken to curb ragging in the universities. The incidents of ragging need to be dealt with under the Prevention of Ragging Act. It is the piece of legislation with which you were also associated, with which all of us were associated when it was passed in 1997. It is my concerned view that strict measures are necessary to prevent ragging in the universities. Ragging and other forms of violence destabilize the universities, and the learning environment is disrupted. I need to mention this. I read an article in the The Economist of London referring to ragging in India. In India, strong measures have been taken to curb ragging and every universitys gate - - has the poster which says, An Act of Ragging May Land You in Jail. , . . The Indian Government which sees ragging as a criminal offence - the Indian Supreme Court treats ragging as a criminal offence - is determined to deal with those elements which indulge in violent ragging. Recently, an 18-year old medical student was beaten to death in Northern State of Himalchal Pradesh during a ragging ceremony. A voluntary organization has been formed in India to curb ragging. This is the name of the organization, Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education. . . ; . - . . ? ? . Toilet commode flush . , 17 . . . rag . Therefore, I do not want to speak anymore on

1871 1872

this. Even in Tamil Nadu, they passed a piece of legislation to curb ragging. In February, 2009 - I am sure my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, will be happy to hear this - the Supreme Court of India declared ragging as "a human rights abuse in essence"; that in essence, ragging could be treated as a human rights abuse and ordered measures to stamp it out. Closed-circuit television cameras have been installed both at the University of Delhi and the Jawaharlal Nehru University to prevent ragging. Both students and parents should co-operate with us to get rid of this menace. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) , .

Okay. , Progress of Activities of the University Grants Commission, 2006 - 2009 * . , " " * . . , . In our universities, ragging has been used as a

mobilization instrument. It has been used by a certain political party, by certain activists among the student group in order to convert it into an instrument of political mobilization. This is the thing which needs to be dealt with and I am planning to take measures to deal with it. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. : : Documents tabled : Progress of Activities of the University Grants Commission 2006 - 2009 1.

(2) Reviewing external degree programmes External Degree Programmes are offered by 11 Universities/HEIs at present. There were concerns expressed at various for a regarding the quality of these degrees and the external graduates, recently. Therefore a workshop was held in September 2008 to discuss the status and idenitify solutions for the existing problems and constraints faced by External Degree Programmes. As a follow up action, on the recommendation by the said workshop, action has been initiated to establish a Board for External Degrees and the proposed Board will take action to review the external Degree programmes in future. (3) Regularization of Postgraduate Programmes (a) With a view to regularize the postgraduate programmes conducted by Universities & HEIs the Commission appointed a committee to study the issues including generating income through postgraduate courses and other extension services by Higher Educational Institutions and make recommendations. As an outcome of the study, it was decided that all Postgraduate Programmes including those conducted by Postgraduate Institutes must be channeled through the Faculty of Graduate Studies of the University. The Commission also instructed all the Universities and HEIs to obtain prior approval of the UGC for conducting such postgraduate courses. UGC initiated action accordingly to identify the necessary changes in the Act/Ordinances to implement the above changes. (b) The Commission granted approval accordingly to commence the following Postgraduate Degree/Diploma Programmes during the last year having considered the proposals made by the Universities/HEIs; * MSc in Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ruhuna * MSc in Nanoscience & Nanotechnology, Postgraduate Institute of Science, University of Peradeniya * MA in Regional Development and Planning, Faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Colombo * MSc/PG Diploma in Material Science Programme, Faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa * M.Sc.

D Degree Programme in Library Information Science at National Institute of Library and Information Science, (NILIS) * Masters Degree Programme in Social Work at the National Institute of Social Development (NISD)

(4) Common Credit and Qualification Framework for all Universities The University Grants Commission having noted that there is a significant variation in the degree awarding criteria as well as in the structure of degree programmes conducted by different faculties/universities within the Sri Lankan University System decided to formulate a common Credit and Qualification Framework for Sri Lankan University System in order to maintain the consistency and comparability of university level qualifications. As such, a Commission Circular on Common grades, grade point value for courses and cutoff levels of GPA for awarding classes/passes was issued by the UGC on 25.11.2008. (5) Appointment of Subject Committees The Standing Committee on Quality Assurance and Accreditation having realized the importance of contribution that the Inter-Universithy Subject Committees can make toward the enhancement of quality assurance activities in the university sector recommenced to appoint Subject Committees. The Commission accordingly approved the appointment of 40 Subject Committees comprising of 602 members and Subject benchmarking is expected to be initiated during 2009. 4. Fund Allocation Funds allocated to the University System during the last 3 years under recurrent and capital grants are as follows; Government Grants for HEIs 2007 2008 2009 Recurrent (Rs. in Millions) 9,974 10,940 11,176 Capital (Rs. in Millions Construction of Buildings 3,026 2,883 3,337 Rehabilitation & Improvement 584 744 414 of Assets Acquisition of Fixed Assets 984 1,116 699 IT Development 150 186 85 Total Capital (Rs. in Millions) 4,744 4,929 4,535 Release of Funds by the Treasury as a % of Grant 2007 2008 2009 (up to June) Recurrent 93.62% 90.50% 45% Capital 64.75% 58.50% 25% 5.

Expansion of Library Facilities In order to expand the library facilities in the universities, additional funds were granted to six selected Universities to purchase Library Automation Software Packages during the last year and new buildings have been provided on a priority basis taking into consideration the needs. In order to assure the quality of libraries in the University System a series of workshops were held with the assistance of the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Council and a handbook was published giving the guidelines as to how the services could be improved. Libraries are now in the process of evaluating the quality. Inter Library Loan Code, a policy documents on issuing materials to other libraries and borrowing materials from other libraries on loan basis for the use of readers, was prepared and finalized and this code will be used by university libraries widening the access for information to readers. A policy document on Minimum Standards for University Libraries was approved by the Standing Committee in order to upgrade the service standards of university libraries in Sri Lanka. 8. Project Monitoring Project monitoring unit was established in the UGC a. to evaluate new infrastructure development projects b. to monitor the progress of on going capital projects As a policy, priority is given for newly established universities and universities in the North and the East in the infrastructure development. Under this scheme reports were regularly obtained and on-spot visits are made by the officials of the UGC to ensure the progress of the projects. 9. Introduction of a Centralized Information System for Strengthening and Supporting Activities of UGC and Universities The National Higher Education Information System (N HEMIS) is developed to provide information for planning, monitoring and evaluation for the entire higher education sector, with World Bank funds. This IT based intranet facility will enhance quality and efficiency of the management within the system. The proposed Centralized Information System (CIS) will meet the requirements of the UGC, universities, undergraduates, graduates & other stakeholders. This system will also be a tool for management / monitoring of activities in the Universities and the UGC, in the areas of university admission, student placement & tracking human resource administration etc.

10. Strengthening Inter University Gommunication & Development Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) and Video Conferencing provide sophisticated and cost effective media for interuniversity communication. All universities are connected via Lanka Education And Research Network [LEARN] and recently the backbone w as upgraded through Improve Relevance and Quality of University Education [IRQUEL], a World Bank funded project. Communication over telephone among universities can be done free of charge by using the VOIP facility. Video conferencing, which has already been installed will reduce the communication gap further. 11. An IT Policy for Higher Education Sector The Government has invested extensively in information technology education in Universities and promoting the use of IT in assisting administration, monitoring and other functions of the System. In order to ensure the proper usage of the computer system by all staff and authorized users in an effective, ethical and lawful manner the UGC has implemented a User IT policy for the Secretariat. The Commission decided to encourage Universities and HEls too to set up parameters for using IT resources in education, learning and administration and to have a code of practice for users. The UGC initiated the activity through the IT Standing Committee, subsequently, a workshop was organized for representatives for University/HEls. 12. Department of data base on national research and development A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the National Science Foundation and the University Grants Commission on 25.01.2008 to collect information and prepare a date base on national research and development. Accordingly a survey was carried out by the UGC for the year 2006/ 2007 and a data base has been developed by using collected information. The date base is being updated annually. 13. Student Related Matters Special attention has been paid by the University Grants Commission to minimize student protests and to strengthen relationships between the university administration and students. Following precautionary measures were taken during the last two years accordingly by the University Grants Commission to minimize / avoid student problems and for the wellbeing of students in Universities and Higher Educational Institutes. (a) Protecting students from unruly elements The University Grants Commission, in order to safeguard the students from unruly elements, instructed all Vice Chancellors of Universities. Directors of Institutes and Rectors of Campuses to address all parents through a letter requesting them to protect their children from unruly political elements in universities and be vigilant of their childrens behavior. (b) Avoiding student unrest The University Grants Commission noted that in general due attention is not paid to student problems in universities and that is the main cause for student unrest. Therefore the Commission requested all university authorities to meet student representatives at least once a month and address their issues wherever possible in order to avoid student unrest. (c) Measures to eliminate false information among people Although the universities are doing a lot for the wellbeing of students, no adequate publicity is given on such activities, Accordingly, the Universities/Higher Educational Institutes

and Campuses were requested to give adequate publicity with regard to the actions taken by them for the wellbeing of students in order to make the public aware of such activities and to eliminate false information among people about the facilities provided to students for them to pursuer their higher studies. (d) Minimizing ragging incidents A document prepared by University Grants Commission on Legal framework on ragging and establishing Student Unions in universities in Sri Lanka was distributed among all Universities / Higher Educational Institutes in order to make students aware of the gravity Of committing ragging and other forms of violence in Universities/Campuses/Institutes and remedies available for same. (e) Recovery of cost of damages for university properties The University Grants Commission after going through the reports sent by the Universities on different student related incients noted that students have caused damages to university properties at certain instances and thus decided to make them accountable for such damages and charge the cost of damages from responsible individuals or reduce the cost of damages from the allocations made to student councils. Accordingly a Commission Circular was issued in order to safeguard student welfare. (f) Preparation of Student Charter by each University/HEI Having noticed the increased trend of student misbehavior/misconduct in universities/HEIs, action is being taken to prepare a Student Charter/Student Hand Book by each University/HEI to avoid unnecessary incidents and make students aware of the consequences of such incidents and the importance of university education. (g) Enhance Welfare Facilities for Students The University Grants Commission is in the process of collecting information on availability of safe drinking water, hygienic sanitation facilities and waste disposal mechanisms from all Universities and HEIs in order to improve the same with the intention of improving better learning environment for students. (h) Student Support Service Units

Actions are being taken to establish Student Support Service Units in Universities in order to upgrade standards with emphasis on teaching/learning and allied services and facilities. (i) Training opportunities for university students in Public and Private Sector Having recognized the importance of providing training opportunities for their students in public/private sector organizations the universities have been requested to include a training/internship component in the curriculum wherever possible and most of the universities have already taken action to provide training opportunities for their students accordingly. 14. financial Assistance to University Students There are 03 main schemes under which university students are assisted financially, They are; 1.

: : Document tabled : IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA In the matter of an application under Article 140 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist republic of Sri Lanka. 1. Mohamed Musthaffa Fathima Asrin No. 272/C, New Road, Kalmunai - 14 And 08 others Petitioners CA Application 1013/08 CA Application 1014/08 & CA Application 1015/08 Vs. 1. University Grants Commission No. 20, Ward Place, Colombo - 07. And 09 others. Respondents BEFORE : Hon. Sathya Hettige P. C. J. President of the Court of Appeal Hon. Anil Gooneratne, J. Judge of the Court of Appeal COUNSEL : Sanjeewa Jayawardane with Abdul Najeem and Senani Dayaratne for Petitioners. Priyantha Nfawana SSC with Hajaz Hisbullah SC for Respondents. Nimal Weerakkody for Intervenient - Petitioner. ARGUED : 01.04.2009, 29.04.2009, 30.04.2009, 21.05.2009, 25.05.2009 & 12.06.2009 DECIDED ON : 07.08.2009 SATHYA HETTIGE, P. C. J. P/CA The petitioners in Application No. 1013/08 and the Intervenient petioner, the petitioners in application No. 1014/08 and the petitioner in application No. 1015/08 are seeking Writs of Certiorari to quash the decisions contained in documents marked P5 dated 05/11/2008 and the document marked P3 dated 04/11/2008. The petitioners are also seeking Writs of Mandamus directing the 1st to 10th respondents to permit the petitioners to engage in studies at the Faculty of medicine of 6th respondents University. In order to determine the issue involved in this application it is necessary to consider the facts of each case which are of similar nature. These applications were taken up together on 27/02/2009, 19/03/2009, 01/04/2009, 30/04/2009, 21/05/2009, 25/05/2009 and 12/06/2009 for hearing and all parties agreed to combine all three applications and one judgment would bind the parties in all three applications. The petitioners in all three applications are Muslim students originally selected by the 1st respondent Commission to a course of study in medicine for the academic year 2007/2008 in the Faculty of Health Care Sciences of the 3rd Respondent namely the Eastern University of Sri Lanka by the letter dated 12/06/2008. The petitioners

and the Intervenient petitioner further state that they registered themselves with the 3rd respondent university by sending their applications before 28/07/2008. It is stated that before commencement of the scheduled academic activities in the 3rd respondent University, the 1st respondent Commission transferred 195 students including one Sinhala student and 27 Muslim students from the Faculty of Health Care Sciences of the 3rd respondent due to security situation in the Eastern University of Sri Lanka that existed in August 2008. It was further submitted that the petitioners and the intervenient petitioner were transferred out of the 3rd University to Universities of Colombo, Sri Jawardanapura and Kelaniya. The petitioners in CA application 1013/08 were transferred to University of Colombo, the petitioners in CA application No. 1014/08 were transferred to University were transferred to University of Sri Jayawardanapura and the petitioners in CA application no. 1015/08 were transferred to University of Kalaniya by the 1st Respondent Commission. The Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the transfers were effected by formal letters dated 27/08/2008 addressed individually addressed to each petitioner. It was strongly submitted that the said letters were issued by the 1st respondent Commission in its capacity as the supreme governing authority under the provisions of the University Act. It was further submitted that the said transfer was subject to certain conditions and the said transfer letters were marked 4(a) to 4(e). The learned Counsel drew the attention of court to the conditions and the entire contents of the said letter marked P4(a) transferring the petitioners which reads as follows. As already in formed you have been selected to follow a course of study in medicine at the University at the Eastern University, Sri Lanka for the academic year 2007/2008. I wish to inform, you that the University Grants Commission has decided to transfer you to the Faculty of Medicine University of Sri Jayawardanapura with the concurrence of Vice Chancellors of the University of Sri Jayawadanapura and the Eastern University Sri Lanka Considering existing situation in the Eastern University Sri Lanka (5)The UGC shall be at liberty to send you back to the University which you have been originally assigned when situation in the Eastern University, Sri Lanka becomes normal. On perusal of the condition no. 5 above mentioned, it appears that the UGC had reserved the right and power to sent the students back to the Eastern University once the situation becomes normal and the UGC had taken the decision to transfer the petitioners and the intervenient petitioners with the concurrence of the relevant vice chancellors of the Universities. The petitioners complain that on 31/10/2008 the petitioners were informed by the 9th respondent who is the Senior Assistant Registrar of Sri Jaywardanapura University stating that that the Senate at the meeting held at the 257th meeting on 30.10.2008 decided to cancel the temporary registration of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the University of Sri Jayawardanapura with effect from 31st October 2008 on the basis that the permanent residence of the petitioners is in the Eastern/Notherrn province and informing them to report to vice Chancellor of the Eastern University. The petitioners state that similar letters were received by cach petitioners from the Senior Assistant Registrar of the respective University. The petitioners have annexed to the petition a copy of the letter dated 31/10/2008 marked P5. The petitioners and the Intervenient petitioners in these applications are seeking Writ of Certiorari to quash the unlawful decision of the 6th respondent University to cancel the registration of the petitioners Contained in the said letter dated 31.10.2008 marked P5 on the basis that the decision of the 6th respondent unlawful, arbitrary, ultra vires and discriminatory nature. The petitioners further state that they are entitled

2009 08

in law to engage in their academic activities in the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the 6th responded University and other respective Universities where they are currently studying until the decision of respondent canceling the registration is reviewed by the 1st respondent Commission. The issue to be determined by this court is whether the 6th respondent had power of authority to make inter - university transfers of students whereas the temporary transfer of the petitioners had already been done by the 1st respondent Commission which reserved the right to re - transfer them by the UGC. The learned counsel for the petitioners strenuously argued that the 6th respondent and the 9th respondent had no power or authority to cancel the registration of the petitioners and direct them to back to the 3rd respondent University in terms of the Universities Act. And if at all, the power of transferring the petitioners are only with the 1st respondent Commission. Therefore the decision of the 6th respondent to cancel the registration of the petitioners is unlawful and without jurisdiction. The learned counsel submitted that the decision to cancel and transfer the petitioners back to the 3rd respondent university had not been taken with the concurrence of the 1st respondent and the copy of the letter transferring the petitioners has not even been sent to the 1st respondent Commission. It was submitted that the highly pernicious and precipitous decision of the Senate of the 6th and 9th respondent to retransfer the petitioners has completely over - ridden the authority, power, jurisdiction and sole prerogative of the University Grants Commission. It was the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the case of the petitioners is not that they must be permanently at their new universities but only that they are entitled in law to remain in the new universities if and until the UGC makes an informed decision in accordance with the due process and the law. I have considered carefully the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioners and agree with him that the senate of the 6th University is obviously subordinate to the Council and at the very apex is the Council and the Council shall be the exclusive body and governing authority of the University and the decision to re - transfer could only have been taken by the University Grants Commission on the basis that this is clearly an Inter University Transfer which is common ground of the parties. The learned Senior State Counsel for the respondents objecting to the application and relief sought by the petitioners, admitted in the course of his submissions that the Faculty of Medicine of Sri Jayawardanapura cancelled the temporary transfers of the petitioners as a step in the executory process of re - transfer which was deliberated before the 1st respondent Commission. It was further submitted that all other students, except the petitioners and the Intervenient petitioner went back and commenced their studies at their originally assigned Eastern University consequent to the cancellation of the temporary transfers. The learned SSC submitted that, for the purpose of judicial review of a decision the issue of Ultra vires should not be considered on the basis of supervicial perusal of two documents in relation to the sources of origin. The court must consider the amenability of the impugned decision to a prerogative writ and the petitioners do not have a legal right or interest to remain in the Universities they were temporarily transferred because there is no legal provisions in the law governing the temporary transfers of students. I do not agree with the submissions of the learned SSC on the above position. The decision to temporarily transfer the petitioners was taken by the 1st respondent Commission and whether it is temporary or permanent transfer of students that decision affects the students academic rights thereby a legal right or interest appears to have accrued to the petitioners to be at the respective Universities to which they were assigned in terms of the law. The learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently opposed

the contention of the 6th respondent that the reason given for the retransfer of the petitioners was the petitioners permanent residence was in a district in the Eastern/Northern province. The UGC as the supreme authority had transferred the petitioners out of the Eastern university on the basis of security situation in the 3rd respondents University. The petitioners counsel contend that the Senate which is a subordinate authority within the university structure had completely ignored condition 5 in the document marked P5 and the jurisdiction of the UGC under the provisions of the University Act in relation to inter - University transfers. It should be noted that the 2nd respondent in his affidavit (Statement of objection) dated 6th February 2009 in paragraph 18 unambiguously states as follows. ...I state that I am not aware of such commuinications being addressed to the 5th respondent. The respondents state further that, as the universities have no authority to effect inter-university transfers of the students the 1st respondent decided to convene a meeting to discuss the above matter to take appropriate action with regard to the retransfer these students I take the above position of the 2nd respondent as an admission on the part of the UGC that universities had no authority to effect inter-university transfers of the students. The learned Senior State Counsel strongly argued with emphasis and submitted that even the University Act does not provide for and or contain provisions empowering the UGC to transfer students from one university to another. I do not agree with the above contention of the Larned Senior State Counsel that the UGC too had no power to effect transfers of students. It should be further noted that paragraph 28 of the 2nd respondents affidavit (statement of Objections) it is stated that according to section 15 of the University Admissions Hand book that inter-University transfers of students can be made only by the 1st respondent Commission. In fact it can thus be seen that the correct position has been stated to court by the 2nd respondent under oath. It is the argument of the learned counsel for the petioners that due to decision of the 6th respondent to retransfer the petitioners having cancelled the registration, the petitioners have been deprived of their university education in respect of medical faculties from the time the application was filed for the last 8 months and unable to sit for the future examinations. It is the view of court that the petitioners and the intervenient petitioner have been deprived of the academic activities as a result of the action of the 6th respondent in canceling their temporary registration in the respective universities to which they were transferred by the 1st respondent Commission. I agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for petitioners that the 6th respondent (Senate) in application No. CA 1013/08 and 9th respondent who decided to cancel the registration of the petitioners in application Nos. CA 1014/08 and CA 1015/08 had to legal power or authority to take that decision to cancel the registration and issue letter marked P5. I am of the view that the only authority to make such decision to re-transfer the petitioners is the University Grant Commission in terms of the provisions in the Universities Act and the University Admissions Hand book. Even though the learned Senior State Counsel demonstrated to court that the petitioners are not entitled to the benefit of the discretionary relief in the form of a prerogative writ to be exercised by this court I hold that the petitioners are entitled to the relief in the circumstances of these cases. I further hold that the reasons given in P5 by the 6th respondent when canceling the registration of the petitioners, which is a critical issue in these applications, on the basis that their permanent residence is in the Eastern- Northern province and requiring the petitioners to report to the 3rd respondent university is unacceptable to this court.

1901 1902

[ ]

In the circumstances of these applications I hold that the discretionary remedy vested in this court should be determined in favour of the petitioners and the intervenient petitioner in granting relief as per paragraphs (a), (b) and of the prayers of the petition. However, the judgment of this court will not affect the rights of the University Grants Commission to take steps in accordance with due process and law regarding inter-university transfers of the students. The judgment is also not applicable to those petitioners if any, who have already commenced academic activities in the 3rd Respondent University. Accordingly I allow the application of the petitioners as per paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) as above of the petition. I order no costs in the circumstances. Sgd.

But, the amendments that have been presented are very innocuous in nature. I guess there is a necessity to have a much broad-based discussion on this subject matter which is very important.

Sir, one of the first things that needs to be mentioned is that the curse of the education system has been the politicization. Politics must stop at the doorstep of a school they say, and countries that have adopted this have achieved a fast-track development. This type of investment is what little Sri Lanka must be putting in. We, for the sake of politics, sacrifice our future generation and make that an issue to gain our future aims. The Hon. Minister who is aptly qualified in handling the subject sometimes loses his amiable disposition for various trivial matters. This is not the hallmark of a good Minister. If he refuses to respond - we are the people who need to be responded to with regard to the subject matter and I passionately feel that this is an area that should be handled devoid of politics - at such times as to who intervenes must be taken in, and not have fake doctorates that you seem to be using to ensure political display in this House. So, be that as it may, we have about 17 . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

I wanted to save time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No, there is no saving of time. Probably an answer that comes in may help you to stop four minutes of unwanted talk. So, you have 17 universities that grant degrees. Our level of quality is very superior. Unfortunately, I need to go back to history in order to bring out the problem we have. In the 1950s, we had universities which were within the first 25 in the world. In the 1970s, we had moved down; we were one in 500. In the 1980s, it went further down; we were one in 1,500 and now it is completely wiped out. This is something which I learnt from what you told which is absolutely correct. That is the level of the degradation that has taken place. Look at the academic days that are lost out in many universities. I am informed that there are about 235 academics days in a university and there is one university that was functional only for 198 academic days. Instead of getting such matters legalized, Hon. Minister, we are bringing in an amendment to move the optional age of retirement of university employees from 55 years to 57 years. You have political parties that are using this for their political game. Ensure that that is taken off, then you will have half the problems solved. You know, in Korea they tried to make a mess in the university system by stamping out the younger generation during 1985-86. The then President and the government took it upon themselves and said, "We are sorry. This type of political nonsense should stop". The government changed but the investment made put Korea

where it is today. They withstood the Asian financial crisis and they have managed to overcome the financial meltdown in the world before any other country. That is due to the investment they made in higher education. Here again, the same thing needs to be done. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena mentioned that 120,000 students - you mentioned that it is 100,000, Hon. Minister, but it is 125,000 which was corrected - get qualified every year for pursuing higher studies but due to lack of facilities in the country they are deprived of that opportunity. So, what happens? Finally, 5,000 to 7,000 students go overseas and this does not happen at the cost of nothing; it is almost Rs. 5700 million, that is roughly US Dollars 570 million, that are going out of the country a year. Just because there are political chauvinists and you are learning on some of them, you are unable to take a stand. If the future of 125,000 students is at stake, there is a necessity to come forward and give an answer to this. What is the answer? . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

That is why we want to pursue a policy of diversification. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Certainly. When you say diversification, you go to the origins of the United National Party, blame them for all what has happened and then come back to the same place and say, Let us kick off from that point. That is why you need to give the credit to where it is due. The United National Party had the courage of its convictions and the necessary drive to take it forward. There are areas where we all have faulted. The ethnic problem in this country arose squarely because of one of your founders. That was mentioned even by the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma. There are times when you have got to unite in order to ensure a better tomorrow. You cannot be fighting everyday specially when it comes to education, when it comes to health and infrastructure. We must mention this because if we take this out of context, they will say - '' .'' . . ; ; . . . . . 24,000 . . 24,000 , ,

I must congratulate the Chairman of the UGC for having stated that universities are guerrilla training centres. He had the courage to say that and I appreciate that. So ensure that is taken in and give necessary attention. But what happens is, they engage in politics at this particular moment. The biggest problem that you have is the offering of fake doctorates. Ensure that these types of things are stamped out. We had problems in Parliament this morning due to people with fake doctorates. These are the type of people who are utilized to ensure that the Proceedings of this Parliament are stymied. So, ensure legislation is brought in to stop this. There is no point in saying that we have this problem. In every nook and corner we have institutions offering fake degrees. So, ensure that laws are brought in against such institutions. Hon. Minister, as I said, the United National Party wants to see that free education is ensured, protected, fostered and developed. But, if there is a point beyond which the Government is unable to proceed, then utilize the private sector in order to do that. Just because the word, "private sector" comes in, it does not mean that it puts a stop to free education. No way! Ensure that you give them a certain percentage so that instead of 25,000 students, the next time you can have 35,000 in free education. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

In India they have introduced a piece of legislation called the Foreign Universities Bill under which measures have been introduced to control the private sector universities. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If that is the case, have the conviction to move forward with this. Do not let our future generation suffer just because your Government does not have the courage. On one hand, the Mahinda Chintana says there will be no private universities and on the other, you are permitting them. So, take a decision, this or that. According to the estimates that have been forwarded to this House with the Budget, in the year 2007, there was an allocation of Rs. 15,000 million and in 2008 there was an allocation of Rs. 20,000 million. Out of that only Rs. 16,000 million has been spent. In the year 2009, you have an allocation of Rs. 21,378 million, but you have not provided for inflation. The rate of inflation is 28 per cent. In the previous year it was 21 per cent. So, if you factor in inflation, your real allocation will be reduced by 35 per cent. In that case how can higher education go forward? So, ensure that politicization of education is stopped. Have the courage to do that. Call upon for a national policy on this. I have been mentioning that with regard to

[ ]

2009 08 1913 1914

the economy; that there is a necessity to depoliticize it. It is not being addressed. That is why we are in this mess. You all laughed at the IMF and now you are at their doorstep virtually begging them to do what you were told to do earlier. If that was done, there would not have been any problem. So, going on further, all what we want to say is, this piece of legislation that has been brought in is a waste of time. You talk of ragging. If you bring in the Universities (Amendment) Bill tomorrow, we will support you on that area. If you do not, the people who are trying to do this and live on it as a means, should be exposed. So, here is the time to unite on behalf of the future generation. These are investments that need to be put in and that is where you could be differentiated between a traitor and a true statesman. That is what the United National Party today is faced with. We are statesmen in politics and paying the price for being statesmen. The traitors today are just wasting time. Let us ensure that we have a more statesmenly approach and invest for the future of our country. Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . [. . 12.44] ( )

[. . 12.50] . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai)

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I was listening to the Hon. Ministers speech this morning. I really appreciate it and am highly taken up with the progress that has been made. We congratulate you and your officials, especially the officials in the University Grants Commission and the SLIATE, and wish you success. Hon. Minister, I wish to remind you of the request that I made a number of times about the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education - SLIATE - in Batticaloa. We have about 400 students there but we do not have enough space, we do not have enough furniture and we do not have any equipment. Hon. Minister, since we do not have enough space at the SLIATE, the Director-General of the SLIATE wanted me to find a suitable land for the construction of a building. With the greatest difficulty I found two acres of land and got it vested with the Director-General. He told me that Rs. 25 million has already been allocated and plans have been drawn up. Last year, I spent Rupees one lakh to put up a fence on one side. This year I am trying to buy an auto from my DC Budget for the officer to run about and do the work. But, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am highly disappointed because so far nothing has been done; no groundwork has been done. Sir, you know about our district and we are talking about "Nagenahira Navodaya". But, I am very sorry to state that your Ministry has done nothing in our district. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

I assure you that I will look into this because we are getting Euros 21 million as assistance from Austria and the Netherlands. We will be able to make use a part of it for the development of your Institute. I will do that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Thank you, Sir. You must come and lay the foundation for that. The second matter is about the research done by the Eastern University in Batticaloa. They are doing a research in the sandy regasole soil in the coastal areas. Our main crop is paddy. That land is not suitable for research at all. On the last occasion, the Hon. Minister and the Director-General of the Department of Agriculture assured me that they will give 20 acres of land to do research. This is about 10 kilometers away from the University. The land is available. These people have made a request but the land has not been taken over. The officials of the University must go and take over this land and do some research. Our main crop is paddy. There is a 500-acre farm started by the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake about 75 years back. Now, this farm land is being encroached by the people. You must see that the land allocated for research work is immediately taken over and some sort of research is done. As they want to be closer to the University, they are doing research in the regasole soil. The main soil found in our district is non-calcic brown soil. So, this must be done there. Paddy is an important crop. The third matter is, you must start a Fisheries Faculty in the Eastern University in Batticaloa. Our main livelihood is agriculture and fishing. This University has taken over 100 acres of land in Kaluvankerny area which has a high potential for fishing. Our area is really backward in the fishing industry. We must produce some professionals to develop the fishing industry so that the people could benefit from this industry. So, please keep this in mind when you prepare the programmes for the future to provide a Fisheries Faculty for the Eastern University. One more thing Sir. My good Colleague, the Hon. Thurairetnasingam tells me that when students are selected for admission to the universities from the Trincomalee District, there have been instances where some students, for various reasons, do not make use of the opportunity. For example, when you select 10 students to the Medical College and the Engineering Faculty, which is the quota for the Trincomalee District, one or two students, due to various reasons, drop out. Even finance is a big constraint for them and when they are sent to the Jaffna University, they do not want to go because they do not have money and there is no organization to help them. So, his request is that when 10 students are selected from the Trincomalee District and only eight seek admisson, the places of the other two be filled from the same list. In other words, if 10 students are selected out of which only 8 have gone, he wants the students in the 11th and 12th positions in theTrincomalee District list to be taken because otherwise he feels it is a

2009 08 1917 1918

loss to the district. He is from Mutur which is an educationally backward area. There are not enough doctors in the Mutur hospital. They need 20 doctors but only three are there. So, please look into this matter. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do not want to take much of your time, Sir. Thank you very much for allotting me this time, Sir. [. . 12.55] .. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. H.R.
