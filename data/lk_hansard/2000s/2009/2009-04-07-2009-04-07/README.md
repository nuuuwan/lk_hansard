( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . At this stage, I would like to respond to some of the statements that have come from my learned Friend, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah and also I would like to look at this historical aspect as to what we are discussing today. The Hon. Member went on to refer to a request made by him to the United Nations. Do you want them to

come to Sri Lanka, Hon. Member? What we have to look at is that the UN agencies are very much in Sri Lanka. The fact that today we have countered terrorism in the most comprehensive manner has gone on record and been appreciated by world over. The humanitarian situation that we are trying to address here will bear realization with the systematic approach the Government is making today. Today, at the time when I am speaking here, not only as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka but as a Sri Lankan, I am proud to state that not a single inch of Sri Lankas land is being held by the terrorist organization, the LTTE. This is a phenomenal achievement in the parallels of Sri Lankas history. I would like to recall the efforts of the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Today, what is developing is the hostage situation that our learned Friend is unable to address to the LTTE. Only if the LTTE laid down arms on the call made by our President, today what you have to speak in terms of statistics of civilians who are being entrapped and kept hostage would not have arisen. Instead, we could have spoken on the political dimension in relation to what Sri Lanka should seek. Fortunately, in your speech you referred to the fact that you want to be a part of the democratic process and you are strongly committed to a democratic channel in terms of achieving your goal. That is what Sri Lanka is all about. Everyone of the 225 Members of this august Assembly is part of that. We can have views; we can have discussions; we can bring legislation and we will be part of that process and our President has called on the TNA to join that process as well. We want you to respond to that call. You come and discuss and be a part of that, and that is my call to the TNA and to my learned Friend, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah. Our call has already been made to you with great responsibility. . ( . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah)

My question is, will you bring a UN mission to monitor the IDPs in the Tamil areas? A catastrophic situation is developing in those areas. I appeal to the UN mission to come and look into this matter, monitor and give the security and safety to the Tamil people who are trapped in these Tamil areas. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I must categorically state that the UN agencies, the ICRC, everyone of them, are part of this process and they are currently handling the humanitarian situation in the Northern part of Sri Lanka. We are handling that. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana)

As a Member of Parliament of the UNP, I have made a request to visit IDP camps- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) . [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) We will make that arrangement for you. [Interruption.]. Of course, why not? You come with me. I am also going there. No, [Interruption.] We should allow everyone to be a part of this process. I am going to encourage that. There is no hold on that ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana)

Very good. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Thank you. Let me continue my speech.

Having said that, we must understand why this crisis has emerged. I will draw your attention to what the Tamil people are saying today. This newspaper is not a newspaper of Sri Lanka. This is The Sunday Telegraph that I am going to quote to you. Look at what is happening here. This is what has been reported by Nick Meo, The Sunday Telegraph reporter, who went to the IDP camps and interviewed the people. This is dated 30th of March, 2009 and this is what your people - our people - coming from the Vanni, are saying. It states, I quote: He described how he had gathered his family and friends, as quietly as possible in the dead of night, before slipping past guards. They had been wading across a muddy lagoon towards the Sri Lankan army lines when things went wrong. We left at 2 a.m. today in a group of 23 but the Tigers fired at us and only 12 of us arrived here, " Now, what happened to the balance 11 of them? Who killed these 11 people? The Tigers fired at their own people. This is stated on the 30th of March, 2009. Now, we are talking about a humanitarian crisis. You want a UN mission to come . We have called on the UN to call on the LTTE to lay down arms and surrender. That call had come but not been heeded by the LTTE. That is our issue. I join with you on the same appeal; we have to get the LTTE to lay down arms at least in this final thrust, where the Government has succeeded in eliminating terrorism from every inch of our country. Today, we have a no-fire zone and I will deal with the no-fire zone later. Let me finish this first. It further states, I quote:

I do not know what has happened to the rest. We became separated in the confusion.... .....What the man had to say about the Tigers would have been unthinkable for a subject of their dictatorial ministate a few weeks ago. The people do not like the Tigers anymore, he said angrily. They are trapped by them and they are scared. They want the Sri Lankan army to rescue them. Now, who is calling on the Sri Lanka Army to rescue the IDPs? They are the ones who are being trapped in the no-fire zone. These are the very people who are trying to escape from the Tiger hold and come to the Government hold. That is our aim; that is what we are going to achieve. We want you also to be a part of that process and join with us in the democratic channels that you are also advocating very strongly. I must now get on to the prepared text of mine because I am running short of time. Our Government under President Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership took a bold decision to engage the LTTE militarily, only after exhausting all available options to talk to them. In July 2006, when the LTTE used water as a weapon of war by closing the Mavil-Aru sluice gates and cutting off their essential source of life to thousands of farmer families, President Rajapaksa acted swiftly and decisively. Thus, commenced the great humanitarian operation to liberate, firstly the Eastern Province from the LTTE terrorist menace, and thereafter extending to clear the entire Northern Province.

2009 07 1123 1124

When Sri Lanka goes down in history, Mahinda Rajapaksas name will be written in golden letters as the Great Unifier of our beloved motherland, Sri Lanka. He has achieved this commendable and historic feat that no other leader in our post-Independence history has been able to. That is an achievement, a single achievement for which we all have suffered. Hon. Member, you and I have travelled to KKS together and you would recall how difficult it was for us to get into the Tiger hold. Today we have liberated the entirety of the Jaffna Peninsula plus the entirety of Vanni from the clutches of the Tiger menace. We have included the Tamil diaspora today as part of our entire engagement. We want to be a part of the engagement of our own people and whether they are Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims, there is no difference where the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa is concerned. Further, I would like to salute our military personnel in extricating all the areas in the Vanni from the subjugation of the LTTE, known to the world as a ruthless terrorist organization. I am certain that all peace-loving Sri Lankans will welcome this as a signal of freedom. This groups ruthlessness knows no bounds with its remaining cadres and leaders having holed themselves up in the 12 kilometre no-fire zone created as a safe zone for the civilians, thus continuing to secure themselves by a human shield. As for our military, it has been an arduous trek, inching their way to avoid civilian casualties while losing their own, in their quest to gain control of the land and annihilate terrorism, to create a secure environment imperative for the establishment of democratic institutions required for the pursuit of a sustainable political solution. Today, with the military successes, we are poised on the threshold of defeating terrorism and embarking on an era of lasting peace and security for all our people. Hon. Members, this strategy for the creation of a safe and secure environment has been conducted at times with the demonstration of some understanding by the international community and at other times pitted against a war of rhetoric - the latter overriding the former at most times. It was indeed a welcome recognition by the British Government as contained in the Ministerial statement issued earlier this month by the Foreign Secretary of Britain , Miliband, which I quote: The LTTE is a terrorist organization and that the Government of Sri Lanka has a need to root out the threat from terrorism. An aspect of this position was echoed when the European Council in its conclusions in February 2009 called on the LTTE to lay down its arms and renounce terrorism and violence once and for all and end the inhuman use of child soldiers and forced recruitment and participate in a political process to achieve a just and lasting solution. Undoubtedly this call together with similar sentiments from other quarters of the international

community have hitherto gone unheeded by the LTTE. This only demonstrates the LTTEs apathy and the contempt it has for such positions from the international community. Regrettably, however, punitive action on the LTTE by the international community remains largely on paper, where a proscription though in force, its implementation amounts to nothing. Fund raising by the LTTE operative continue unabated, public demonstrations have now graduated to the blatant use of the terrorist organizations name, insignia, cut-outs of the leader et cetera are held in the proscribed territories with excuses of how legal action cannot be taken. I am only left to question the validity of a proscription. While some countries thankfully have been taking action against such activities, there are those who churn out excuses. For instance, it would not be wrong to expect some uniformity of action in relation to the EU proscription being an integrated entity of member states. However, this has not been the case. Hon. Members, instead we have, for instance, a situation of being censured by the British Government in terms of the actions of the LTTE not being an excuse for any failings on the part by the Sri Lankan Government to meet the higher standards naturally expected of democratic governments in a conflict. I wish to assure the Hon. Members and through you the international community, that no one is more concerned than the Government about the civilians trapped and used as human shields in the safe zone. It is misplaced to be reminded of the responsibility towards our own citizens nor of our international commitments, and it has been the very basis of Government strategy in having a secure environment. All this while, it has been the LTTE which continued to fire at civilians trying to escape from its clutches, shelling heavy artillery out of the no-fire zone, exploding suicide bombs in welfare centres and targeting anti-aircraft missiles at a helicopter evacuating civilians et cetera. Despite this as at 2nd of April, 2009, 62,106 civilians have entered welfare centres through safe corridors established by the Government. In addition, the Government has continued to evacuate the sick and injured, together with bystanders, by sea and air. The Government of Sri Lanka has throughout the conflict followed a zero tolerance policy on civilian collateral by observing extreme caution in the conflict area, cognizant of the LTTEs modus operandi on the use of human shields. Further, in keeping with the high standards expected from a democratic government, the Sri Lankan Government has continuously ensured the humanitarian needs of the population from the very inception of this conflict. The World Food Programme has confirmed adequate food supplies - I am replying to the query made by the Hon. Mavai Senathirajah on food supplies. For the year ending January 2009, 55,000 metric tons of food, relief items and medicine had been sent to the conflict area. Since mid-February up to the end of last month,

1125 1126

2,465 metric tons of foods, essential items and a large stock of essential medical supplies including antibiotics and vaccines have been dispatched. As this House is aware, the LTTE regularly siphoned these supplies for their own use - but the numbers will be less today - thereby depriving the civilian casualties of medicine and subjecting purchase of same at black market prices. Hon. Members, then we have the international chorus for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. It is an unrealistic call on the Government considering that over the past 30 years strategically the LTTE has been cleared of the areas which were under their domination. There have been repeated calls by His Excellency the President, as recent as yesterday, on the LTTE to lay down arms. If heeded, will it not construe an automatic ceasefire? The International Community should raise their voices in crescendo in calling on the LTTE to lay down arms and allow the people to leave for the safe zone, in the absence of which punitive measures would follow. The constant outflow of civilians against the machinations of the LTTE, only signals their confidence in the conditions outside the area of conflict. Therefore, the advocacy for a humanitarian ceasefire is redundant. Hon. Members, denial of access to the then uncleared areas and welfare villages has also been a bone of contention for the International Community, which is also reflected in the British Foreign Ministers recent statement to the House of Commons. This position, I totally reject. It may be recalled that the UN Under Secretary General, Sir John Holmes, some Colombo-based Heads of Missions including those representing the EU countries, EU delegation in Colombo, Brussels-based officials from the EC and most recently, Dr. Walter Kalin, UN Secretary Generals Special Representative on Human Rights for IDPs, all visited these centres. This is a clear testimony to Sri Lanka carrying out its international commitments fully and transparently, which will continue. It is rather baffling that the denial of access having been included in the British statement considering that a Director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office visited a welfare village in Vavuniya last month. Also, it may be noted that the UN and ICRC together with 14 INGOs including CARE, Caritas, Save the Children have been working in these welfare centres. With regard to access to the then uncleared areas, which Sir Holmes in an interview with the BBC World Service described as a pocket, stated that the UN was certainly not present in that pocket itself and said that since it is a dangerous area, he was not sure whether the UN actually wished to go into that area. It is this very fact of the prevailing security situation in the conflict area, that access had been restricted into that region. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , ?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , . . Hon. Members, the welfare centres housing the IDPs were established over a short period of time. Nobody in the Government is claiming that the conditions in these centres in the North of Sri Lanka are perfect, but the best is being done in the circumstances. Many of the international visitors to the centres have acknowledged that the Government of Sri Lanka is doing a difficult job creditably and the shortcomings are being rectified. It is important to understand that we cannot get it right in one go. The UNHCR as the leading agency dealing with IDPs has in a recent report welcomed the initiatives taken by the Government of Sri Lanka in keeping with its objectives by providing maximum relief to ensure the well-being of the IDPs without neglecting security. In this context, the development of establishing a Visitor Centre to enable the IDPs to contact with friends and relatives is noteworthy. The UNHCR has also welcomed the recent initiative of the Government releasing persons with special needs, where 371 persons have been released and begun reunifying separated families inside IDP sites. Approval has been given for six hundred more elders to be sent to their families and 1,108 persons who have been displaced in different IDP sites have rejoined their families. Telephone facilities have been established at the main sites and the UNHCR is continuing to work on a set of principles with the Government in enhancing the conditions further. One such is, maintaining the civilian character of the IDP sites and the UNHCR report states that it is encouraged by the positive initiatives taken towards this end at the Jaffna site. It is also satisfied with aid distribution so far. It is therefore clear that the Sri Lankan Government is firmly in the saddle in providing facilities to the civilians to ameliorate their plight in trying conditions. Hon. Members, it is rather disappointing that the British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband has sought to make the point to us that these welfare camps be temporary and the IDPs returned to their homes. It seems to be forgotten that when the security forces successfully liberated the Eastern Province, the Government was able to settle 80 per cent of the displaced within eight months in their original places of habitation. The Government has never suffered any illusion that the welfare centres are temporary. Resettling the displaced is a priority and would be done at the earliest when their safety could be ensured. While the Government would wish to replicate in the North its achievements of resettling the displaced as in the East, it would pursue this noble objective in

[ ]

2009 07 1127 1128

keeping with the situation on ground which includes heavy mining of the Vanni area by the LTTE before its retreat. Time lines are generally pursued in order not to lose sight of the ultimate objective and in this case resettlement of the IDPs is an imperative priority of the Government. Hon. Members, steps taken military readily show tangible results while on the political side, it is more difficult to measure progress. There are howls of protests from the international arena that the Government is seeking a military solution. It is a misnomer. The APRC process which is aimed at finding a lasting solution with the involvement of political parties has progressed steadily and before long the proposals will be unveiled. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the fourth time invited the Tamil National Alliance which has representation from the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Unfortunately, as a group they rejected the invitation though individual MPs of the TNA have at times differed. Having a solid partnership of the stakeholders from all political parties is imperative to evolve a lasting political settlement. I welcome your gesture today, Hon. Senathirajah, when you said that you are prepared to enter into the democratic process. It is something that I welcome on behalf of the Government. The Government continues to seek the cooperation of all stakeholders, even from those who pulled away. The International Community therefore during their contacts with the Sri Lankan polity could impress upon them of the need of working together. Hon. Members, I wish to take this opportunity to brief this House on Sri Lankas position with regard to the appointment of the British Prime Ministers Special Envoy for Sri Lanka which seems to be regularly surfacing in British polity culminating in Foreign Secretary, Miliband, expressing disappointment at the continued rejection by the Government of Sri Lanka - I repeat, we have rejected that call on the appointment of the Special Envoy - despite earlier assurances of His Excellency the President that the Government would engage with the Envoy. Hon. Members would recall that the Cabinet rejected this unilateral appointment as it contravenes the basic principles governing international relations and the requirement for consultation and reciprocity. I have repeatedly informed this House of our stand on the appointment of the Special Envoy; that the fundamental and cardinal rules of international and bilateral relations have to be maintained and in the absence of consultation and reciprocity, we will not accept an appointment made by another country unilaterally. That will be applied to the appointment of the Special Envoy by the British Prime Minister, Hon. Gordon Brown.

I would now continue my speech, Venerable Sir. Hon. Members would recall that the Cabinet rejected this unilateral appointment as it contravenes the basic principles. Neither proper procedure nor consultations, which are time-honoured traditions in diplomatic practice, had been made by the British Government prior to the said appointment. In this context, wider consultations on the appointment of a Special Envoy would have been expected, as at the very outset it had been made known that this initiative would be unhelpful for Sri Lanka in pursuing a sustainable solution to the conflict. In fact, having learnt of the impending announcement by the British Prime Minister, I personally requested the British High Commissioner to seek for a delay in order to consult and discuss the issue which did not come to pass, resulting in a unilateral appointment. Since then, in deference to the traditional warm British-Sri Lanka relations and to find a way around this impasse, I have continued to discuss the issue with Foreign Secretary, Miliband and the Foreign and Commonwealth Minister, Lord Brown. Sri Lanka welcomes constructive engagement with the International Community and in this context I have proposed that Lord Brown undertakes a visit, as a follow-up to his last visit to Sri Lanka in June 2007, where he went to the Eastern Province, met the Chief Minister, the Governor of the Eastern Province and had a quite an impressive engagement. Hon. Members, it is however regrettable to note from the statement that while the British Government envisages to continue to press the Sri Lankan Government to reconsider the position", in the meantime Des Browne, the Special Envoy "will engage with representatives of other countries, UN agencies, NGOs, Parliamentarians and community representatives with an interest in Sri Lanka. What has been said in the House of Commons is that Des Browne is engaged with the NGOs, Parliamentarians and community representatives with an interest in Sri Lanka. From where could we expect this type of conduct having rejected such nomination at the outset? This only concretizes the unilateral nature of this appointment and such engagement by Des Browne has precipitated further difficulties for the Sri Lanka Government. In fact, Des Brownes participation at a conference in London recently where it was resolved to establish a sovereign state of Tamil Eelam - the doctrine of the LTTE proscribed by the UK - and his utterances in that forum, justifies Sri Lankas stated position on that appointment which we have repeatedly rejected and have never conceded to. Hon. Members, it was not so long ago that a European diplomat told me that currently the war is not on terrorism but on propaganda and that the International Community has fallen a victim. His analysis is spot on, when delving through the utterances which fall off the lips of representatives of august assemblies abroad and statements churned out by international entities which are a litany of falsehoods, drafted on the propaganda material fed to them by the LTTE operatives and espoused in the interest of domestic political compulsions. Such rhetoric

1129 1130

lacks clarity and demonstrates no understanding of ground realities. In some instances it is regrettable that these measures have contributed to queer the pitch of longstanding bilateral relations. Hon. Members, some sections of the international community have tended to push an agenda with the Sri Lankan Government at their pace, rather than at a pace the Government could practically implement due to the conditions on ground. After all, a sustainable solution to the conflict has to be pursued in terms of a Sri Lankan agenda. The Government of Sri Lanka is best placed to achieve this objective to which end the international community could play an important and constructive role. The Sri Lankan diaspora with commitment to their country of birth and dedication to the well-being of their brothers and sisters could complement this endeavour. I reiterate my call made at the recently held ground-breaking Diaspora Dialogue. For the first time after 23 years, I must welcome the presence of the Hon. Sri Kantha joining me that evening at the diaspora discussions and the Diaspora Dialogue to join hands with us in the historic and noble task of reconstruction and reconciliation in Sri Lanka and in the - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Hon. Minister, thank you very much. Now the Government has regained all the territory that was under the control of the LTTE, except the safe zone, which is really meant for the civilians. Why not the Government, in the interest of its own citizens, stop all military operations and attend to the pressing problems in relation to more than 250,000 Tamil civilians trapped in that area? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Hon. Member, we are very much on those lines. There is no military engagement within the no-fire zone and I state that with all responsibility as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Sri Lanka. We are trying to see how we could get the civilians to the safety of Government hands. That is our endeavour. Today the ICRC President is due to see me at 4.00 o clock. He is flying from Geneva this evening and I will be meeting him. We must thank the ICRC and all other agencies trying to help us in this great endeavour of rescuing the hostages from the limited hold of the LTTE who are now trying to trap them once again within the no-fire zone. We are mindful of our responsibilities and will discharge them, Sir. , .

Venerable Sir, the degradation and belittling of success achieved by the winner is the common trait of many losing sides of any duet, war or confrontation. History bears many an example. Nevertheless, the losers continue to indulge in this futile exercise, which in a real sense, confirms the state of the denial the loser dwells in.

It is in this context that I address this Assembly today. It gives me great pain of mind to say this. Nevertheless, state I must, and not only might it help the Opposition to make realization that the Governments campaign against the LTTE is gaining ground, but also that the successive Governments failed to achieve these military milestones despite their unequivocal dedication and determination to the elimination of the terrorist threat.

The history of the Northern war is replete with mistake after mistake from both sides of the divide. From the very beginning of the 20th century, from the day the National Congress was formed to agitate for political freedom from Great Britain, the Tamil leaderships mindset has not shown any fundamental change. Although we are driven by many latter day politicians to the contrary, the Tamil political hierarchy agitated for total autonomy in their traditional homeland, starting from the retired Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam up to Velupillai Prabhakaran. After his resignation from the National Congress in 1924, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam declared that the only path for the Tamil population in Sri Lanka was a totally autonomous Eelam. In fact, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalams last address was an evocation of an Eelam. When Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam formed the Tamil Congress, his call for fifty-fifty fell on deaf ears, not only on those of the Sinhalese leaders, but also of the British hierarchy. Then, Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam broke away from the Tamil Congress after Mr. Ponnambalam assumed ministerial posts in the D.S. Senanayake Cabinet. Yet, Mr. Chelvanayakams cry too was for total autonomy or Tamil Eelam. Although Mr. Chelvanayakams party was commonly known as the Federal Party, the real name of that party was Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, ITAK, the direct English translation of which is Sri Lanka Tamil Kingdom Party. Mr. Chelvanayakam was succeeded by Mr. Amirthalingam at the Vaddukoddai Convention. The rest, as they say, is history. The phase of the current turmoil that we are living in is very a part of that history.

My aim here is not to give a discourse to this distinguished House on the failings of yesteryear Governments, although such introspection does play a contributory role in the current context. On the contrary, my objective is to throw some light on the most significant advances that our valiant soldiers have made in the battlefield with their blood, sweat and tears. I also wish to point out that successive Governments, both the UNP and the SLFP or the PA, failed to convert many a military victory into a tangible and lasting political settlement of this nagging problem. Venerable Sir, today we are standing on the threshold of a military victory of an unprecedented scale. It is unprecedented not only because of its very magnitude, but more so because of the rising expectations of the people that these victories have engendered. These rising expectations are almost frightening to gauge. They are the stuff that national dreams are made of; they in turn create a unique sense of national pride of historic proportions, as Pundit Nehru declared at the dawn of Indias Independence from Britain: A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new; when an age ends; and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance. In that context, the challenge of meeting these rising expectations is even greater than some of the battlefield difficulties we have overcome over the last two years. This brings me to the most important point I made at the very outset of my speech today: the role a responsible Opposition should play in a parliamentary democracy. History abounds in many irresponsible acts by many irresponsible leaders in parliamentary democracies. One can argue that the essential function of an Opposition is to oppose. But, should they oppose at all cost? Should the Opposition contest every point of policy of the Government at the cost of national security? Should it oppose at the cost of blood, sweat and tears of its populace? When some Opposition Members make such reprehensible and foolish utterances and try to equate Alimankada to Pamankada and Kilinochchi to Medawachchiya, they not only display their total lack of understanding of facts, but also their callous disregard for the intelligence of the average voter. That is why I ask them in the name of truth and fairness to stop fighting success. However much you scream, you cannot deny the massive military gains of our armed forces; you cannot spin the unspinnable; you cannot denigrate the courage and dedication of our frontline fighters. For the first time since Independence, today we are witness to a totally harmonious amalgam of the military and the political leadership. If one chooses to deny this, one does it at the peril of ones elementary intelligence. Chanakya, the first political scientist of the recent history, the first adviser to Emperor Chandragupta Maurya of the Maurya Empire once said, The function of a leader is to make his people fearless. Are we not

1137 1138

achieving that noble end by these gains in the North? I recall in what kind of fear our people were living in cities like Colombo, not knowing when they leave for work with the morning sunrise whether they would come home in the evening fearing that there might be a bomb blast at this junction or that building; whether their children who went to school in the morning would come back home in one piece avoiding a blast here and a blast there; whether the stockbroker would fear another dip in the stock market after another blast in Colombo; whether the ordinary boutique keeper would be alive in the evening to close his shop and get back to his wifes waiting arms not fearing a gang like shooting by the terrorists. That all pervading fear, that frightful sense of fear grips our minds, it cripples our movements and today that fear is slowly but surely fading away; thanks to the onslaught that these perpetrators are receiving in the North. Is that not a good-enough reason to shed our partisan garb and celebrate the good things that have come in the wake of these monumental victories our armed forces have made? Venerable Sir, it is in the interests of eradicating this fear, that I appeal to the Members of the Opposition to engage in more meaningful and constructive criticism. I do not want to indulge in frivolous and disrespectful utterances questioning the patriotism of any Member of the Opposition, but I question their judgement. People elect us to make judgements on their behalf and if we fail in that fundamental duty, then we have failed as leaders, we have failed as the guardians of public trust. ( ) (The Presiding Member ? ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) , . Venerable Sir, since 1947 until today, more than one thousand different individuals have had the singular honour of occupying a seat in this august Assembly, which we call Parliament, in this Temple of Democracy, the corridors of which they walked through. Each and every one of them did his or her best to serve his or her voters. We have seen debating giants like Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam, His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene, Mr. Dudley Senanayake, Dr. N. M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and Dr. W. Dahanayake perform in this Assembly with utter vigour and impeccable decorum. They never hurled scorn at the voters; they never ridiculed the soldiers on the warfront for they knew better. Their patriotism was never in question, their eloquence never faltering. It is a disgrace to the memory of such illustrious Members of this House, not forgetting all other Members of Parliament, if I do not appeal to the Honourable Members of the Opposition to please stop fighting success, the success of our soldiers,

the success of the civilians, the success of the political acumen shown by our President in realizing that military strengthening is a precondition to a lasting political solution for the burning issue of today: the Tamil national question. This success may be too heavy a cross to bear for some of the Opposition MPs, yet bear you must in the name of our country and our people. Finally, we all must realize that, as one sage once said, success is nothing but success. But, after a successful closure of the war, we come to a more critical phase of our countrys life: managing the rising expectations of our people; their fervent hope that tomorrow will bring more prosperity. The farmer will be expecting a more decent price for the harvest of his crops; the shop owner will expect more vibrant sales and filling of their godowns with goods and materials; the university student will expect a better paying job when he passes out; the village girl will dream of a better day ahead after her lover secures a more lucrative source of employment. These are all hopes and expectations, hopes and expectations of millions of our youth, millions of our own brethren. Are we to let them down? If the country is not galvanized as one single entity to achieve one single goal of collective good, prosperity and peace ably motivated and led by its leaders, then we will fail them, we will fail in our duty, we will fail as a State, as a country and as people. I do not think that a single Member of this House would like to face that phenomenon. Therefore, Venerable Sir, managing these rising expectations and giving them effective expression is of crucial importance in the coming weeks and months and I am sure that our economists and planners have given sufficient time, energy and attention to this emerging reality, for failure in this regard is not an option. Thank you.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have since my entry into Parliament in April 2008, been speaking on the extension of the Emergency and pleading with the powers that be, to look at addressing the issues that have necessitated successive governments to declare a state of Emergency to basically give it powers to protect its people. But, what we need to look at is, have these many years of Emergency rule brought about any change in the thinking of the affected people or has it changed the day-to-day life of the peoples of Sri Lanka? The answer is a big NO. The Tamil-speaking people still feel that they have not been given a sense of belonging to the land they call their home, and are in fact living today in an increased state of fear than ever before. I blame successive governments and the LTTE for the state of affairs as it stands today. The sincerity to solve this problem has been lacking right from day one. As I have said before in this House, the jathiye or the national problem has been kept like a beggars wound for political benefit and no one has felt a moral obligation to attempt to solve it; the result of which was as Bertrand Russell, the British Philosopher once said, Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity towards those who are not regarded as members of the herd. This was applicable to the LTTE and is now aptly applicable to the present Government as well.

The LTTE precipitated the current situation and is at the receiving end. Had it continued to engage the Government in talks, the nationalist elements who now publicly claim credit for pushing the Government to war

would not have had an opportunity to do so. The LTTE is to be blamed for giving in to this agenda and having to pay the price for it which has caused thousands of deaths from both sides, and the misery the IDPs are suffering. Right now, the whole nation awaits with abated breath the announcement that every inch of the Island has been brought under the control of the Government of Sri Lanka I am sure celebration of an unprecedented scale will follow. But, will all this spring hope in the oppressed Tamil-speaking peoples of this land to hope for a better future and new opportunities rather than think of their security, as right now they are more afraid of life than of death. Ernest Becker, a famous American cultural anthropologist once said, Now we know that the human animal is characterized by two great fears that other animals are protected from; the fear of life and the fear of death. For citizens of this country, death is not the biggest fear we have right now. Our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive and express what we really are and want to be. How do we get ourselves out of this mindset is the biggest challenge before us and this is where the Government too faces its biggest challenge. This is where I am reminded of what James Thurber, the famous American humorist said, Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in awareness. This is what I am urging the Government to do. Create the environment for the Tamil-speaking people to trust your actions and intentions. You cannot drive fear into the people and expect them to toe the line. Albert Camus, the famous playwright once said, Nothing is more despicable than to expect respect based on fear. Today the whole country is gripped in fear; fear of what is next, as very little information is available on what is happening. Aggression and violence are the dominant forces of getting things done during everyday life. I was surprised to read an article which appeared in the Sunday Island of 5th April, 2009, written by Tisaranee Gunasekara under the caption, The New Frontiers. I am not going to read it for want of time but I am tabling* it. Now, I will get on to what is happening in the East today. We know that the East was liberated and the Eastern Provincial Council Election was held. We installed a Provincial Council. In my last speech on the Adjournment Debate on the Eastern Provincial Council, I spoke about what is going on now. But, what is more interesting is that an independent group of professionals visited the East recently. I will just quote a portion of the preliminary report that they have prepared.

In their report they say: Members of the Muslim community stated that the future of the country looked bleak. Force had to be dealt with force and Prabhakaran needed to be defeated by the armed forces. But, the Government should have genuine sentiments towards the minorities and make the people elect politicians by their will. The Government should not force splinter group politicians among the people. This is what is important today. You have to understand that you have to let the people elect their own representatives and be governed by them. The day before when H.L. Jamaldeen, SP, was shot dead in Marathamunai, Kalmunai, we did know who committed the crime. Automatically, the finger was pointed at the LTTE. But, strange enough, when I speak to the villagers, they are not too sure. They do not know who has committed this crime. Is it the LTTE, the splinter group of the LTTE or somebody else? Now, I hear that there are more dangerous trends emerging. I am told that there is an effort being made to divide the Kalmunai DS Division into a Tamil area and a Muslim area. For goodness sake, please do not do this, because it is these divisions that have driven this country to this situation. Please do not make an attempt to divide the Tamil-speaking peoples into divisions of Tamil people and Muslim people. Then, very soon in Colombo we will have to divide among all the communities who are here. Please do not do that. So, I plead with the authorities, please do not break up the Kalmunai DS Division.

Before I conclude, I would just quote what Woodrow Wilson said. He said: I do not believe that any man can lead who does not act, whether it be consciously or unconsciously, under the impulse of a profound sympathy with those whom he leads; a sympathy which is insight; an insight which is of the heart rather than of the intellect. Thank you.
