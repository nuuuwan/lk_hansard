[.. 10.45] . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) Venerable Presiding Member, I am happy to follow my good Friend, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera who made a number of realistic issues relating to the welfare of the soldiers of this country. Let me make use of this opportunity to focus the attention of this House to the piece of legislation which proposes to establish a National Institute of Textile and

Clothing. I need to congratulate my good Friend, the Hon. Kumara Welgama, Minister of Industrial Development, for introducing this realistic piece of legislation, which once passed in this House, will certainly create a strong basis for the sustainability of the textile and apparel industry in this country. The National Institute of Textile and Clothing is to be set up to : 1. Conduct training programmes and workshops; 2. Provide training for local and foreign students; 3. Provide consultancy services to foreign countries. Yet another function of the Institute is to conduct postgraduate and degree programmes in textile technology, and this means that the Institute has to obtain the approval of the University Grants Commission even though the courses are conducted for those in the textile and apparel industry. I am happy that a representative from the Ministry of Higher Education has been included in the Board of Governors of this particular Institute. It proposes to form affiliations with local and foreign universities specializing in textile technology, which means that this institute has to establish a vital, a fundamental link with the University of Moratuwa where this subject is taught at the undergraduate level. The University of Moratuwa began its BSc Engineering Degree in Textile and Clothing Technology in 1997 and in the last ten years, it has produced nearly 500 graduates who have specialized in textile technology. The annual intake to this particular course is 50. It is insufficient. We need to increase it; we need to expand it. In addition, there is another course related to the apparel industry: Fashion Design and Product Development, for which the annual intake is 40. This, again is insufficient in my view, and we propose to increase the intake. This course was started in 2000 and it, in the last several years, has produced 280 graduates. Venerable Sir, all these graduates have found employment. The course has been set up from the point of view of the concept of the employability. The Open University of Sri Lanka conducts four courses related to textile technology. The following are the courses: 1. BSc in Industrial Studies - Textiles. 2. Bachelor of Technology in Textile Engineering. 3. Bachelor of Industrial Studies in Apparel Production and Management. 4. Bachelor of Industrial Studies in Textile Manufacture. Both the universities, the Moratuwa University and the Open University of Sri Lanka, have developed employment-oriented courses in the field of textile industry and this means that this Institute which is to be set up under the Ministry of Industrial Development can enter into an understanding with the two universities which are specializing in your own field of technology.

2009 23 1093 1094

What I am requesting the Hon. Minister is to make full use of the academic resources of the University of Moratuwa and the Open University of Sri Lanka to improve your institute as well. In addition to training of people who are associated with the apparel industry, your institute is planning to undertake a number of responsibilities such as the maintenance of standards, which is very important in my view - standards have to be maintained especially since this industry is internationally competitive - formulation of a national policy on apparel industry, carrying out research in the field of textile technology, promotion of product development in the field of textile technology, offering of consultancy services, conducting of market surveys and the maintenance of a database relating to the industry. These are very lofty objectives, very important objectives, I do not grudge them, and they go beyond the doors of an academic institution. In my view, the Sri Lankan apparel industry, at this given moment of time, needs such an institute as this industry provides a livelihood for nearly 1.2 million people in this country. This is a very important industry as far as the generation of employment is concerned. The garment industry began to expand after the liberalization of the economy in 1977. The Sri Lankan garment sector accounted for 6 per cent of GDP, 39 per cent of the industrial production, 33 per cent of the employment in the manufacturing industrial sector, 52 per cent of the total exports and 67 per cent of industrial exports of this country. These statistics, Venerable Presiding Member, amply demonstrate that this country is dependent on the garment industry, on the apparel industry for both employment and foreign exchange. Therefore, it has a very vital role to play in our own economy. Foreign Direct Investment has been taking place in this sector and it accounted for nearly 10.4 per cent of the total Foreign Direct Investment - FDI. Approximately 10.4 per cent of the FDI came from the apparel industry. According to the BOI, nearly 50 per cent of the total garment industries in the entire country is owned by foreign investors, which means the foreign investor has invested in this industry. This shows the importance of the garment industry in the context of the Sri Lankan economy. Speaking as the Minister in charge of Higher Education, I can tell you that the policy of the Government is to encourage institutes of this nature which can undertake the training of young men and women in non-scholastic occupational trades. This is what the Hon. Minister, the Hon. Kumara Welgama, is trying to do by establishing this institute. Today, there are 17 universities in the country, but we cannot find places for all the students who aspire to get into the formal university system. In 2008, my good Friend is here, 298,000 students sat the Advanced Level Examination, out of which nearly 131,000 obtained the

minimum qualifications to enter a university. But, what is the annual intake? Our annual intake is within the range of 20,000 which means nearly 110,000 students are out of the formal, conventional university system. This is the challenge before the Government. That is why we need to think in terms of making alternative routes. The only route available, my good Friend, the Hon. Handunnetti, knows, is the O/Ls, the A/Ls and then the university. This is the route; this is the traditional route along which every student would try to move. But, we need to change this; we need to create alternative paths. Now, that is what the Hon. Minister of Industrial Development, my good learned Friend, the Hon. Kumara Welgama, is trying to do. He is trying to establish an alternative institute in the field of textile technology through which we can train young men and women who can find employment in a very competitive employment market. That is what he is trying to do. Therefore, Venerable Presiding Member, we are trying to increase the intake, but the public resources are not enough. It is in this context that Sri Lanka needs to diversify its system of higher education. The National Institute of Textile and Clothing, which is to be set up under the Ministry of Industrial Development, is yet another non-university tertiary institution which can train young men and women who cannot find places within the formal university system. We need more and more alternative routes or institutions of this nature which can undertake to provide higher educational opportunities to those students who aspire to get into the university, but cannot find a place due to lack of places and this needs to be provided on the basis of the concept of employability. We need to produce a graduate who can find a job, Venerable Presiding Member. We need to produce a quality graduate whose knowledge could be marketed in a globally-oriented job market and who could find a lucrative job. We need to produce educated men who can find employment in a highly competitive job market. Now, we are in the process of formulating a development-oriented higher education policy with which we propose to bring about changes with a view to producing quality graduates who can find employment in a highly-competitive global market. This is all I am going to say in respect of this particular Bill which my good Friend, the Hon. Kumara Welgama, has placed before this House. Now, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the Ranaviru Seva Authority Act, No. 54 of 1999, which is to be amended and the amending Bill seeks to expand the composition of the Board of Management of the Ranaviru Seva Authority. The composition of the Board of Management, to which the Hon. Prime Minister referred to in the morning, needs to be changed in the context of the changes that have taken place in respect of their welfare. Their welfare is fundamental. We need to look after them as the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera said in the morning. The country, because of the heroic achievements of the soldiers who are engaged in the humanitarian mission against the LTTE, has to give

1095 1096

[ . . ]

priority to the welfare of the disabled soldiers and their families, especially the families of the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives to safeguard and protect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Sri Lankan State. I need to make use of this opportunity to congratulate the heroic Sri Lankan armed forces for their bravery and valour in breaking the invincibility of the LTTE. The most sophisticated and deadly terrorist organization with wide international links has been virtually defeated in this country and this achievement was primarily due to the nature of the political leadership with which it was conducted in the last two and a half years. Venerable Presiding Member, we know that no offensive, military or otherwise, could succeed without a proper political leadership and that proper political leadership has been given by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Terrorism is a world phenomenon, Venerable Presiding Member. The Mumbai incident in India demonstrated to the world that no country is same in the context of internationalization of terrorism. The "September 11" incident in the USA established a global coalition against terrorism and the Indian incident has now focused attention of the international community to develop a global strategy for combating terrorism. It is my view and it is my criticism that global strategy against terrorism cannot be built with double standards of the international community. The international community has double standards. Sometime back they thought that terrorism is a Third World phenomenon. But, when it came to their doorstep on 11th September, they thought that it is a world phenomenon. Now the western world, the entire international community treats it as a world phenomenon. All of us are aware of the fact that terrorism, whatever its nature, manifestation and its magnitude, undermines the human rights of people. No society, developed or underdeveloped, that respects the rights of people can remain silent when the most fundamental rights to life and liberty are violated. That is the role of terrorism both locally and internationally. What do the terrorists, whatever the country from which they operate, do? They attack the values that lie at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations: respect for Human Rights, the rule of law, tolerance among peoples and the nations and the peaceful resolution of conflict. All these things are demolished by terrorists. It is important to recognize that continuous terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka in the last several years, for more than a decade or two, have taken a heavy human toll, affected the social and economic development of the country, destabilized the country and undermined its democratic fabric. It was only with the assumption of power by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa that politics of national security - I emphasize the term politics of national security - came to the forefront. National security has been made a priority in the national political

agenda and it was given priority due to the leadership of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. In the name of national security, we are not engaged in a war against any community. What we are engaged in is a war on terror, nothing but a war on terror. It is a fight against terror in order to create a safe and secure environment for the people of this country. It is in this context that we need to support the welfare services of the disabled soldiers who have shown their heroism. They were engaged in a heroic struggle against one of the sophisticated terrorist organizations in this world and they have broken their invincibility. At one stage there were people who said that their invincibility cannot be broken, but the heroic Sri Lankan soldiers have broken the invincibility of the LTTE, which is now on the run, now on the defence. This is all what I want to say in respect of this Bill. Thank you, Venerable Presiding Member. [.. 11.03] ( ) (The Hon.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Presiding Member, basically I was not prepared to speak today but chose to speak on a subject on which I have spent over 20 years of my life. That is, in the textile industry. I am very happy that after so many years of existence and at a time when the industry is going through the most difficult time of its history, that it has dawned on the powers that these two organizations, the Clothing Industry Training Institute or the CITI and the Textile Training and Services Centre, which we used to call the TTSC, are joined as the National Institute of Textile and Clothing.

Now, we all know that the textile industry which basically started to boom in this country in the latter part of 1970s reached its zenith around the year 2000. As said, I have been in the industry for 20 years. So, I have seen its growth from 1979. What is important here is not the setting up of an institute, but the way in which it is run to serve the industry in general. Now, we know that the CITI was an institution that carried out training programmes while the TTSC concentrated on the technical side of providing services. What is important at this juncture is that we need to see why we, as a country, have not been able to retain the volume of business that we have enjoyed over a period of time. Of course, the global context and the withdrawal of the quota system impacted this process. But, what was more important was that we were not as productive as the other countries that were involved in this industry and the competitiveness came out of the efficiency factor of our workers. I know that our people are very, very competent, but what prevented them from delivering on this was, of course, due to multiple factors and you can now see that only those industries or only those organizations that ploughed back the profits into their human resources and technical advancement, have now survived to hold the industry. So, what this new institute should concentrate on doing is to basically ensure that we provide the necessary technical input and also the technological input because we, as human beings have a barrier to efficiency. There is a limit to which we can mechanically move our limbs. Beyond that we need technology to be able to break that efficiency barrier and this is where the institute has to spend quite a lot of its time trying to research and involve pneumatics into improving the efficiency of operations. Now, this is a vital factor. The other factor is, being able to harness the expertise that we have in this country. I am sure most of you know that in countries in the South East Asian Region where the textile industry is prevalent or the garment industry is prevalent, the senior positions are held by Sri Lankans; whether it be India, Bangladesh, Vietnam or Cambodia; wherever you go you find Sri Lankans heading the operations or holding vital positions. So, it is not the lack of expertise, but in the way we have used them and the way the Government has involved itself in the growth of the industry. Another important area - I am deviating from this Bill - which I would like the Hon. Minister to pay attention to, as the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti said, is the handloom industry. Now, the handloom industry has a rich history in this country, in the Kandyan region as well as in the Eastern belt. The problem here is, the growth of the handloom industry has been impaired because we have tried to imitate others. What we must understand is that handlooms from Sri Lanka can only be an attraction to somebody if it is Sri Lankan. That means, it should have a Sri Lankan imprint. If you go to the African countries, you cannot sell anything you want in Africa.

[ . ]

2009 23 1113 1114

But, anything with an African imprint is saleable there. So, we need to ensure that the handlooms that we produce have a Sri Lankan imprint. The design should be unique to us. There is the history of that. We know, it is recorded in our history, that the peasantry around the Kandyan Kingdom has excelled in handlooms. Likewise, Maruthamunai in the Eastern coast is known as the heart of the handloom industry. But, what is lacking there is the input of new technology and knowledge of dyestuff; because, for our products to enter the European market or the American market, there are restrictions on the types of dyestuff that can be used. Now, this knowledge has to be imparted to the handloom weaver. Everybody talks of design centres. But, the designing should be indigenous. We should not bring in Indian designs, we should not bring in European designs, the designing has to be unique to Sri Lanka. It is only then it becomes marketable as a Sri Lankan product. Now, when you go to Malaysia, you buy a Malaysian batik shirt, because it is unique. When you go to Africa, you buy those African shirts, because they are unique. So, when they come to Sri Lanka and when we market our handloom products, they should be unique. When we concentrate on trying to grow our handloom industry, we must make sure that we do not lose that Sri Lankan imprint. That is very important. The Government should assist the people with technology and knowledge of using modern dyestuff which will enable the entry of these products into the world market. Thank you. [.. 12.16] . .
