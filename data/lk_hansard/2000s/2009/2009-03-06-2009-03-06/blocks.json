Those were difficult days. But, as the system of Executive President was introduced into this country in 1978, Anura had certainly made a great contribution in defining and upholding the role of the Opposition under the 1978 Constitution. If the Opposition was silent at that time, there would be no place for it. A few of them were able to ensure that the Government was made answerable, the Government was kept on its toes and the dissenting voices in the country were reflected in this House. Those were difficult days. Sometimes Anura Bandaranaike had to speak on behalf of the Members of the TULF, with whose policies he did not agree but nevertheless, some of their rights had to be safeguarded. At difficult times, he had to agree with the Government, despite the fact that the majority in this party wanted to disagree. Those are traits of leadership and he displayed that again when he became the Speaker; when he had to uphold the rights of Parliament, the sovereignty of Parliament and the power of Parliament against courts and all other authorities which sought to challenge these. The ruling he has given in this House is a historic one and will be an illustrious part of our record. Certainly Anuras contribution as various ministers should not be belittled in that way. But the fact is that he, having been a Member of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker, made a greater contribution, and I am sure he will be remembered for that role because Anura was essentially a Parliamentarian. From the very beginning, from the time I remembered him, before he came to this House, he liked to make speeches and from here, he made those speeches. Having inherited the Parliamentary traditions from his father,",

I never thought that we would have the occasion of sitting together on the same side. We did so. Firstly, in Government, then in the Opposition and in the last part of his career, the last few days, in the Opposition. Anura was a person who had many ambitions. Unfortunately, he could not achieve all of them. He had ambitions of his Party and of Government. But, he bore those disappointments well. He talked about it occasionally but nevertheless realized that he had a role to play in politics. He continued to play the role in Government as a Minister, in the Opposition as a Member who was always forthright in his views and always got up when he found the rights of the opposition or the rights of citizens were being transgressed.",

    "text": "Anura was a person who enjoyed life. As he enjoyed life, he would not allow his disappointments to stand in the way. He was well-read. He enjoyed films. He had one of the largest collections of videos and DVDs of movies in Sri Lanka. He liked to travel and he liked to give us the benefit of his knowledge. He was a very easy-going person and sometimes you feel that he indulged too much and the indulgence itself took a toll on his health. Anura was a person who did not believe in limitations. He thought life was too good; that we should not in any way try to impose limitations in the way we enjoyed. So, he went around the world. He went around the country. He spoke well. He relaxed well and I must say that as far as Anura was concerned, he did not have vengeance in his heart; he did not. He may criticize you; he may even abuse you; he may shout at you but it was all forgotten after the speech. It is very rare to meet a person like that and rarer still to meet a person who, when he ended politics, was poorer than when he started. Anura and I used to speak about politics today, the standards that were not being kept; the standards that were not being maintained and how the public were looking down on Parliament and on Members of Parliament and he said, I am proud that I have not made a cent and I am poorer today than when I entered Parliament\". I know that. He would tell me of some of the measures he had taken. But, I suppose Anura in his own way had nothing to worry.",

    "text": "I think I had the opportunity of having not only the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, but also another Colleague, the Chief Government Whip, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, in Parliament. Anura was a person who was very outgoing. There were times when he was depressed. You could notice it, but most of the time, he was outgoing. He knew many world personalities. But, towards the end of his life, he was shattered by the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. He liked Benazir Bhutto. She came here when he launched his book and when he heard that she was assassinated, he was really shaken. Anuras last illness, he concealed from all of us. He would not tell anyone that he was ill. I got to know about it by chance. I was due to meet him in January after returning from India and when I got back, I found that he had gone to Singapore. The last few weeks I had the occasion to visit him regularly both at Ackland House and the hospital, and though the end was near he never showed it. When I used to go and meet him, we used to talk about politics, about international affairs; we talked a lot about the democratic primary, whether Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama will be the democratic nominee, because week by week the results of the primaries were coming and also about the political situation in Sri Lanka. We used to talk about all that. Very rarely did we ever touch on his health and at the end of it I used to say, \"Well , Anura, we will meet again; I will drop in to see you\". Then, one morning when I was at home, I got the message that Anura Bandaranaike had passed away. So, I have lost a Friend, I have lost a Colleague and the House has lost a Member who could have made a valuable contribution in time to come. I do not want to speak at length - Anura was a person who spoke using a lot of quotations - but to speak from the heart is the best and I want to wish my friend. May he attain Nibbana.

    "text": "Condolence in general, before I come to the subject proper. We are moving this Vote of Condolence on a distinguished Speaker of this House after a lapse of almost one year. I have raised this matter earlier and I do repeat it now. The names of so many other Members who are dead and gone are already lined up for similar Votes of Condolence. Mr. Presiding Member, can we be so disrespectful as that? Self-critically, we must admit that such an undue delay is not at all in keeping with the best traditions of this House. The state of affairs of this House has deteriorated so far to be disrespectful even to the dead - to many a distinguished Member of this House, some who had made a significant contribution to the economy of our country and for the cause of our people. Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to bring to your recollection that when the Hon. D.M. Rajapaksa, Member of the State Council for Hambantota, the Lion of Ruhuna, collapsed in this House and died, the then Hon. Leader of the House, the Hon. D.S. Senanayake, within a few hours of his death moved the suspension of other work of the House and proposed the Vote of Condolence on that great man. That should be the spirit of this House and that has been the well-established tradition since the State Council days. But, that has been completely ignored and we had to wait 365 days to pay our tribute to the distinguished former Speaker, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike. Mr. Presiding Member, I am not finding fault with the Hon. Speaker. I raised this matter over and over again at the Party Leaders Meetings and my Friend, the Hon. Chief Government Whip, also, I think repeatedly raised this question at the Party Leaders Meetings and at various other places. The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike was a Speaker of this House, even the Leader of the Opposition of this House, a Cabinet Minister in several administrations, one of the finest debaters that this country has produced and it took us one long year to move this Vote of Condolence. It was so in respect of the other Members also. That is by the way. But, I could not allow this lapse on our part to go unchallenged. Let us be more cultured and not be disrespectful at least to the dead. Mr. Presiding Member, I recall my first meeting with the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike at Temple Trees, soon after his return to the Island after his higher education. At that stage, he was associated with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's Youth Organization. I can remember that I invited him to deliver a talk on Lenin in English and that meeting was presided over by Mr. George Rajapaksa, the father of the Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa. That, I think was his maiden delivery in English after his return from London and it was a stunning speech, not only from the point of view of his style of delivery, but also from his knowledge of history and his critical analysis of Lenin.",

    "text": "In the 1980s, I had the privilege of associating myself with the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike very closely and serve with him as a Member of the Opposition in this House, under his leadership as the Leader of the Opposition. He held the Floor ferociously along with eight of us in the Opposition against 215 Members on the Government side. He also had a very tough time in dealing with the Speakers of those days and confronting a galaxy of intellectual giants in the Front Benches of the Government, including at that stage, the most unruly Member, Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe, although he is today a tamed Leader of the Opposition. He was a good Leader of the Opposition. Therefore, although we were diametrically opposed politically and ideologically, as a novice in this House I was given the privilege of winding up two Debates on the Budgets presented by the Hon. Ronnie de Mel. I also had the privilege to join him in the delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations when he was the Foreign Minister. He was friendly; he was cheerful; he was cultured; honourable; humane and above all, a man of the highest integrity. I shall ever remember his landmark and historic ruling given by him as Speaker on the Floor of this House on a Supreme Court Decision. When the judiciary was attempting to encroach on the frontiers of the legislature, he defended valiantly on the Floor of the House; he defended the legislature and that is where he made his mark as the Speaker. I associate myself with the sentiments expressed by all the previous speakers on both sides of the House. To save time, I do not want to repeat or reiterate them. Mr. Presiding Member, I believe, when discussing a Vote of Condolence of this nature on a distinguished Member of this House, as the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, we should not restrict ourselves to mere eulogies, appreciations, evaluations or admirations. After all, he was the son of two Prime Ministers with an outstanding, illustrious and a distinguished social-political background. He served as a Member in different capacities for over 35 years on both sides of the House and also as the Speaker. We all know that he could not achieve what he aspired for. It is necessary as students of history, as students of political science to inquire and investigate as to why he failed, where he failed and how he failed. What are the objective and subjective factors which contributed to his failure to achieve what he aspired for? It is necessary to gain an insight into his political life, contemporary political trends and developments and prevalent political culture if we are to make an assessment and evaluation and draw necessary conclusions. Mr. Presiding Member, it is my sense of history and political judgment that he failed because he placed himself as a \"right of centre\" of politics in a party like the",

    "text": "Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Maybe he stood by his own political convictions. But, this was the fundamental failure. When he was ready, luck did not come and when luck dawned on him he was not ready. So no one can be blamed, except himself. Mr. Presiding Member, as a politician of a right of centre in the SLFP, I think all such leaders receded into the political oblivion. In those days, even those who were pushed into power or forced into power by the force of events like the late Hon. W. Dahanayaka and the late Hon. C.P.D. Silva, met with the same fate. Secondly, he was probably influenced by the neo-conservative political thinkers. Thirdly, even as a right of centre he was probably more dogmatic and less pragmatic. Fourthly, he was prone to subjectivism and unconcerned with the objective realities that subjectivism overpowered him. Fifthly, his pride, with due respect to him, was his guiding principle. Sixthly, he relied upon the superstructure of the party and not so much of the infrastructure of the party. Seventhly, he failed because he was surrounded by a circle of friends, some of whom were social climbers, careerists, opportunists who fattened themselves and who made their fortunes and probably they would have contributed to paralyze his political fortunes. Mr. Presiding Member, in the last days I can remember he confessed certain things to me personally as to why he failed politically. I do not propose to come out with those and I will find some other time later to make things known to the people. As a Friend and as a Colleague, I pay my tribute to the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike for all what he has done for the cause of the people, for the cause of the country and I wish, Mr. Presiding Member, through you, to convey our deepest sympathies to Sunethra and Chandrika, his two sisters.

He entered Parliament as a very young man and he represented the multi-member constituency of Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya. He held a number of important portfolios in this House.

In that sense, the late Mr. Anura Bandaranaike was a Parliamentarian par excellence. He was an excellent speaker.

He did a thorough study of the subject or the issue before he decided to speak on it in this House. He was well-read. I know that he was a lover of books. He had a good collection of books. He was an avid reader and specialized in Western History and Politics. He used to tell us that it is through the study of biographies that a history of a period could be well understood. Therefore, he was reading all biographies of all leading politicians throughout the world.

In the sphere of Foreign Affairs, he was a peer who knew the subject. He knew the subject thoroughly. He wanted to specialize in foreign policy matters. He spoke on foreign policy more in the nature of an expert on the subject. This, he inherited from his illustrious parents. Both the late Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike made a permanent impact on the foreign policy of this country. Anura derived inspiration from this great tradition of his illustrious parents. He always looked at foreign policy issues from a scholarly point of view. Anura Bandaranaike, when he entered politics was in a unique position because all the factors were to his great advantage. He came from the legendary Bandaranaike family which dominated the political landscape of Sri Lanka for more than 50 years. His illustrious father, the late Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, was the architect of the political change of 1956 and his charismatic leadership was a source of great inspiration. His mother, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the worlds first woman Prime Minister. Who in this country can claim such advantages, such massive political advantages? His sister was elected twice as the President of this country. Anura Bandaraniake began with tremendous political advantages. The dynastic politics became important during that period and he, though intelligent and educated, could not make use of these advantages to reach the top of the political ladder. That was very unfortunate. That was the most unfortunate fact. Unlike his illustrious parents who bestrode the Sri Lankan political landscape in the form of a colossus, he could not understand the political currents of the period. Though he derived inspirations from the ideological positions of his parents, he remained slightly rightist. I do not say that it is a \"right of centre\". He remained slightly rightist. He could be described as a politician with a rightist stance. He failed to understand the role of the established traditional left of this country. That was a major mistake he committed. He never understood the historical role of the traditional left of this country and he crossed swords with them at the very initial stage of his political career. This, in my view, debilitated his political career at the very initial stage itself. It was this stance of his which prevented him from emerging as a national political leader. The differences within his family and the political orientations of certain members of his family, especially ideological positions, alienated him and he eventually joined the UNP. His entry into the United National Party showed that he never understood the political philosophy of his illustrious parents who founded the great Sri Lanka Freedom Party. They were great political strategists and pragmatists. He could not make use of the charisma of the Bandaranaikes' especially the charisma of the late",

Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was a political phenomenon. She was a great woman politician of the century. Anura, crossed swords with Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and joined the UNP. I can remember, I was in the Central Committee when he left, and I can remember the debates which took place inside the Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Even in 1982 he buckled the late Hon. Hector Kobbekaduwas campaign by calling him a contractor. He, at one stage thought that the SLFP was their private property, and this kind of attitude distanced himself from the rank and file of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He never understood the populist historical foundations of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He could not understand the nature of the political base of the SLFP. He could not come to terms with the historical traditions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Though he became a Deputy President of the Party, he could not reach the top because he was not acceptable to the rank and file of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. A politician, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, has to be consistent; a politician must show an ideological commitment in the given context of politics of a particular country and the failure to display such characteristics would not help a person to emerge as a national leader. In the initial phase itself, there were forces which operated to prevent the emergence of young Anura Bandaranaike as a key person in the Party. In my view, the political ambitions within the Bandaranaike family interfered with his rise to high office. I do not want to go into these details. The very forces which destroyed Anura on ideological grounds in the initial phase tried to rehabilitate him in the early 2000. It was too late. By that time, he had been politically destroyed by those very forces, which at one stage, formed a political party to challenge the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Certain people formed a political party saying that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is reactionary and not progressive enough and they wanted to challenge the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. One platform of this political party was to prevent the emergence of Anura Bandaranaike via the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The politics of the subsequent period demonstrated the extent to which Anura Bandaranaike has been misled and misguided and he, in the end, failed to achieve what he had aspired from the time of the assassination of his illustrious father. With Anura Bandaranaikes untimely death, the dynasticism in the Sri Lankan politics came to an end. The popular base of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party had been activated under a new leadership and the nature of the political change is such that dynasticism, which",

    "text": "dominated the politics of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party for more than 50 years, had been dumped inside the dustbin of history. Anura Bandaranaike was an astute politician. Nobody denies that. He was an astute, capable politician who missed the bus due to his own follies. It is very unfortunate that he missed the bus due to his own follies and also due to the ambitious intrigues and rivalries of his own family members. Anura, with his all astuteness could not exploit the fund of goodwill, the fund of popular goodwill, which the Bandaranaikes built in this country since the 1930s. With all his ability, he failed to achieve anything substantial in the arena of Sri Lankan politics. As my good Friend, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena said, it is up to the historians of the party or the historians of this country to examine and analyse the political and social reasons, which culminated in the total failure of Anura Bandaranaike as a politician of the legendry Bandaranaike dynasty.

    "text": "Ministers. Anuras mother, the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike became the First Woman Prime Minister in the World in the year 1960. She served as the Prime Minister from 1960 to 1964, then from 1970 to 1977 and later in 1994. She was instrumental in organizing the Non-Aligned Summit Conference in Sri Lanka in 1976, in which leaders of more than 60 countries in the world participated. It was after all these achievements that Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was disenfranchised by the late President J.R. Jayewardene. Anura Bandaranaike played an active role in the General Elections of 1965, 1970 and 1977. He became a Parliamentarian in 1977 by becoming the second Member of Parliament for the Nuwara Eliya District. Anura had been the chief organizer of the SLFP Youth League since 1973. He became the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament and held this post for a long spell. While being the Speaker of Parliament, he took bold steps to address some problematic issues. He staged his protest against the 1978 regime of the late President J.R. Jayewardene by going on a Barefoot Pilgrimage to Kataragama, joining hands with the present President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. Anura also held several honorary posts like the Adviser to the Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs from 1974 to 1977 and a Member of the Education Ministry (Advisory) Bureau. Anura had his education at Royal College, Colombo and then qualified himself as a Bachelor of Arts from the University of London. When he was in Europe, he organized the SLFP Youth League there. He was a good orator, both in the Sinhala and English languages. He was a man of independent thinking and the most liberal of politicians. He was open to discussion, negotiation and even to conviction. Anura was able to reconcile extremes of opinion, not merely to satisfy the needs of practical politics but also to accept them from an ideological standpoint. This was a unique feature. A party as well as an individual needs such thinking, and that is the void that Anura has created by his death. Anura Bandaranaike had a good rapport with the minor communities in Sri Lanka. He was well-respected by all communities for his gentle and harmless politics. Anura had a very close association with my father, the late Hon. A.L. Abdul Majeed who was the Deputy Minister of Information and Broadcasting. I recollect that when Anura visited Mutur in 1983, he received a warm welcome. He had the opportunity of talking to all communities and was very compassionate in listening to the difficulties faced by them in their practical living. In fact, Anura was a very affable politician respected and loved by all walks of life, all party politicians and as a whole by the Sri Lankan people. His death is a big loss to the people of Sri Lanka. Thank you very much.",
