C. Determination No. 6/2008 Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill Tissa Attanayake -Petitioner- S. C. Determination No. 7/2008 M. T. Hasan Ali -Petitioner- AND Hon. Attorney-General Attorney Generals Chambers Hulftsdorp Colombo 12. -Respondent- Before : J. A. N. de Silva, J. D. J. de S. Balapatabendi, J. K. Sripavan. J. Counsel : A. P. Niles with Prof. Zafurulla for the petitioner in S. C. Determination No. 6/08. Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, P.C., with Nizan Kariyaapar for the pertitioner in S. C. Determination No. 7/08.

M. A. Sumanthiran, Attorney-at-Law with Nivan Anketell Intervened in S. C. Determination 6/08. Viraj Dayaratne S. S. C. with S. Barrie S. C. for Attorney-General. Court assembled at 10.30 a.m. on 19.12.2008. A Bill bearing the title Local Authorities (Special Provisions) was published in the Government Gazette and placed on the Order Paper of Parliament on 3rd December 2008. Two petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in two different petitions in terms of Article 121 (1) of the Constitution. Learned Senior State Counsel objected to the two petitions on the basis that the petitioners have failed to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court as provided in Article 121 (1) of the Constitution, in that they have faild to deliver copies of the petitions to the Hon. Speaker and at the same time the two petitions were field in the Supreme Court. Mr. Niles, Counsel for the Petitioner in S. C. Determination 6/2008 shown Court the Registered Postal Article receipt by which a copy of the petition was sent to the Hon. Speaker. Dr. Wickramaratne, Counsel for the petitioner in S. C. Determination 7/2008 conceded that a copy of the petition was not delivered to the Hon. Speaker as provided in Article 121 (1). Thus, the Court rejected the petition in S. C. Determination 7/2008 on the ground that the jurisdiction of this Court was not duly invoked and proceeded to hear S. C. Determination 6/2008. However, Dr. Wickramaratne and Mr. M. A. Sumanthrian were permitted to intervene in S. C. Determination 6/2008 and to make their submissions as to the constitutionality of the said Bill. The main contention of the petitioner and the intervenients is that the Provisions of the Bill taken as a whole are inconsistent with the Constitution is its content and that the procedure laid down in the Constitution has not been followed in having the Bill placed on the Order Paper of Parliament. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution established Provincial Councils and vested legislative power in such Councils to be exercised in relation to the subjects in List I of the Ninth Schedule (Provincial council List). Article 154G (30 provides that no Bill in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Councils List shall become Law unless such Bill has been referred by H E the President, after its publication in the Gazette and before it is placed on the Order Paper of Parliament, to every Provincial Council for the expression of its views thereon. Leaned Senior State Counsel conceded that the Bill under reference has not been referred by H E the President to the Provincial Councils as provided in Article 154 (g) (3). We have to now consider whether such compliance is necessary. The Preamble to the Bill reads as follows : An Act to amend the Municipal Council Ordinance, the Urban councils Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987 : Item 4 in Article 1 (Provincial Council List) of the Ninth Schedule specifies Local Government as a subject coming within that list. Items 4:1 and 4:3 provide as follows: 4.1 Local authorities for the purpose of local government and village administration such as Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas except that the construction, form and structure of the local authorities shall be determined by law. 4.2 Local Authorities will have the powers vested in them under existing law, Municipal Councils and Urban Councils will have the powers vested in then under the Municipal Councils Ordinance and the Urban Councils Ordinance, Pradeshiya Sabha will have the powers vested in then under existing law. It will be open to a Provincial Council to confer additional powers on local authorities but not to take away their powers.

2009 06 5 6

It is thus seen from the existing law, the Municipal Council, the Urban Councils and the Pradeshiya Sabhas have powers to control and administer all matters relating to public health, public utility services, public thoroughfares and generally with the protection and promotion of the comfort, convenience and welfare of the people and the amenities of the Municipality, the town and the Pradeshiya Sabha in terms of Section 4 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, Urban Councils Ordinance and Section 3 of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, No. 15 of 1987. Therefore, the aforesaid matters fall within the legislative competence of Provincial Councils as stipulated in List I. Even the Provincial Councils cannot take away these powers from the respective local authorities. Both Dr. Wickramaratne and Mr. Niles submitted that establishing Ward Committee in every ward of the Municipal Council, Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sabhas as provided in Clauses 5, 10 & 16 respectively and giving various powers, inter alia, to develop the areas, to formulate development plans and projects with a view to obtain participation of youth, women and underprivileged person, implementing social development programmes for the welfare of those living within the area, implementing programmes and projects to protect the environmentally vulnerable places within the area are matters relating to the protection and promotion of the comfort, convenience and welfare of the people and the amenities of the local authority. Senior State Counsel on the other hand, sought to argue that Clauses 5, 10 & 16 only amend the form and structure of the local authorities and therefore could be passed by Parliament. While the Court agrees with the submissions of Senior State Counsel that creation of Wards in the local authorities amends the structure of the local authorities granting various powers to the Ward Committees for the formation of the comfort, convenience and welfare of the people, allocating sufficient finances to meet the administrative expenses of the Ward Committees and making the Ward Committees accountable to the respective local authorities are matters falling within the Provincial Council List. It is noted that Clauses 3, 6 & 15 specify the manner in which members have to be elected to the local bodies. However, these Clauses do not indicate the basis upon which thirty percentum of the members are to be elected under the proportional representation system. The uncertainty and vagueness can lead to the violation of the equality provision contained in Article 12 (1). Clauses 3,5,6,8,10,15 and 16 give the Minister the power to make various orders and regulations. Contrary to the usual practice, the Minister is neither required to publish the regulations in the Gazette nor is he required to bring such orders and regulations to Parliament for approval. Minister in relation to the Municipal Councils Ordinance, Urban Councils Ordinance and Pradeshiya Sabhas Act means the Minister to whom the subject or functions of Local Government has been assigned by H E the President. Thus, the Bill empowers the National Minister to make various orders and regulations in respect of a subject which falls within the Provisional Council List. This cannot be done unless there is due compliance with Article 154 (G) (3) of the Constitution. It was also contended by the intervenients that in dividing the Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas into wards, the Minister has a wide discretion; sufficient guidelines have not been formulated for the exercise of the discretion by the Minister; Various political parties and the members of the public in the relevant local or municipal areas have no opportunity to make representations to the Minister to express their views on cultural and political diversities before a decision is taken by him. While there is some merit in the foresaid submission, for the reasons stated above, we make a determination in terms of Article 123 read with 154 (G) (3) of the Constitution that the Bill relates to certain matters set out in the

Provincial Council List and shall not become law unless it is referred by H E the President to every Provincial Council as required by Article 154 (G) (3) of the Constitution. Since the Bill has been placed on the Order Paper of Parliament without compliance with the provisions of Article 154 (G) (3), we would not at this stage, make any determination as to the other grounds of challenge urged by Counsel. We wish to place on record our appreciation of the valuable assistance made by all counsel at the hearing. (sgd.) J. A. N. de Silva, J. Judge of the Supreme Court (sgd.) D. J. de. S.

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . , . . . . Sir, in this regard, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the editorial in "The Island" of Monday, 5th January, 2009. It states, I quote: The capture of Kilinochchi would not have been so difficult if the UNP-led UNF government (2001-2004) had not allowed the LTTE to smuggle in shiploads of arms and ammunition taking cover behind a CFA. Army Commander Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka told this newspaper on Friday that the army had come under a rain of shellfire and over 12,000 officers and men had sustained injuries as a result. It was during the UNF government that the LTTEs arsenal got the biggest ever boost. According to the erstwhile LTTE military commander Karuna, the LTTE had used the CFA to smuggle in 12 shiploads of arms before his breakaway. It is believed that the total number of arms shipments the LTTE received during the UNF government could be 20 or even more. Most of those stockpiles have been reserved for the final battle. The UNF government was also responsible for the decimation of the army long range operations due to a raid an army safe house at Athurugiriya. The deep penetration unit operating from there had accounted for several key terrorists including Prabhakarans right hand man, Shankar, who set up the LTTEs air wing. His killing caused all the senior LTTE leaders to confine themselves to underground bunkers

71 72

for fear of the armys shadow warriors who beat Prabhakaran at his own game. How scary a proportion their operations became to the LTTE could be seen from a clause in the Norwegian-drafted CFA prohibiting deep penetration operations. Now, Sir, this is the beginning of the end that we have come to. The CFA that brought about disastrous consequences to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, the national security and to the individual security of our people should not be forgotten at any time in the history of Sri Lanka. "" . , . , " " . . . 2008 - - 03 . . - The subjugation that the LTTE imposed on the Tamil community both in Sri Lanka and the world over has been well depicted in the document, LTTE, The International Dimension of Terrorism released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This speaks of the Ceasefire Agreement. I will quote from the Ceasefire Agreement dated 22nd February, 2002. In that, the first thing that the UNP Government did at that time was to bring the LTTE, a terrorist organization, banned the world over, in parity with the Government of Sri Lanka as a sovereign state. Not only that, they also restricted the armed forces in Sri Lanka, the legitimate military arm of the Government, from exercising its due responsibility in the protection of our territorial integrity, sovereignty and national security. See the restrictions that have been imposed. Article 1.2 of the Ceasefire Agreement states, I quote: 1.2 Neither Party shall engage in any offensive military operation."

So how do we protect the country from a terrorist organization? This requires the total cessation of all military action and includes,... . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

As a Minister of that Government, did you at any point, oppose the signing of the CFA or what you are referring to now? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

We were not even aware of that. This House was not aware of that Ceasefire Agreement dated 22nd of February, 2002.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Then, it is not fair for you to read that because you were a part of that Government. You were a part of that Cabinet. Hon. Minister, it is not fair. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I was never a party to that. That is one reason why I left that party. I left the UNP because of the disaster it brought to the national security and sovereignty of our country - [Interruption.] . . . . [ ] . [ ] 200 .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Will you please permit me to - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) No, I will not permit you. You can speak during your time. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You are so worried about this. How about the ban that you achieved with the EU and Canada because of the CFA? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) What has the CFA got to do with that? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Because of the continuous violations by the LTTE, you were able to achieve all those bans. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

The Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar was killed in August 2005. The ban was imposed in 2006 under our Government. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

In the past you have gone on record saying this. Now it suits you.

[ ]

2009 06 73 74

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) By that time, my predecessor had been assassinated by the LTTE. Do you want to know the atrocities committed by the LTTE? Here, read this book- LTTE : A Trail of Atrocities. Read this book and find out what led to the international ban on the LTTE. Today you speak from the Opposition benches. Previously you were on this side of the House. Likewise, you go between the benches of the House. I do not want to respond to you. Let me respond to the House. In terms of the fundamental issues, we have today been able to overcome our counter-terrorism campaign. Now, Sir, the main issue that I was coming to, is with regard to how the Sri Lankan Army has been restricted by the CFA. It states that the army of the country cannot take any military operations against the LTTE. So, that is why the Leader of the Opposition is saying that the CFA is the one that led to the success in Kilinochchi. Can you see the distortion? Now, Sir, I will further read Article 1.2 of the CFA in terms of military operations. It states, I quote: ..This requires the total cessation of all military action and includes, but is not limited to, such acts as: a. The firing of direct and indirect weapons, armed raids, ambushes, assassinations, abductions, destruction of civilian or military property, sabotage, suicide missions and activities by deep penetration units;. That is what the editorial of The Island newspaper of 5th January, 2009 highlighted. In the absence of our deep penetrating unit being in operation, we could not have achieved the successes and it only strengthened the dismantling of the Athurugiriya safe house, established and promoted the LTTE activities to continue uninterfered. Then Article 1.2(b) states, I quote: Arial bombardment That means we cannot take on any of the LTTE targets. Then Article 1.2(c) states, I quote: Offensive naval operations We were restricted even with naval operations when the countrys sea belongs to the sovereign State of Sri Lanka and the protection within the seas of Sri Lanka too was prohibited by the CFA. Now, Sir, there are very interesting areas. , .

. . Article 1.10 of the CFA states, I quote: " Unarmed GOSL troops shall..." "unarmed" - they cannot take any arms. "... as of D-day, +60, be permitted unlimited passage between Jaffna and Vavuniya using the Jaffna-Kandy road (A9). The modalities are to be worked out by the Parties with the assistance of the SLMM" .

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) ? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . . [ ] . ,-[ ] Sir, they cannot disturb me. I did not disturb them. . [ ] . . , , LTTE propaganda machinery . [ ] . . . .. . - - , . . . . , . [ ] . . . . [ ] . . Then, Sir, I come to Article 2.12 . . . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Have you heard - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) ; . , , . . .

Then Article 2.12 of CFA states, I quote: The Parties agree that search operations and arrests under the Prevention of Terrorism Act shall not take place. That means, we cannot use the law of the country because there is the CFA. It further states, I quote: Arrests shall be conducted under due process of law in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code. Why do we want the Prevention of Terrorism Act? When there are terrorists, you have to deal with terrorists and that is how we have looked at it. Now, Sir, this is the level to which the CFA led our countrys security and at the end of it, today we have to pay the highest price of losing our soldiers in the battle

against terrorism as the Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka has stated and as rightly depicted and highlighted in the editorial of "The Island" newspaper yesterday. These are the disastrous consequences that we all have to bear because of an unforesighted CFA that the UNP Leader and Prabhakaran had entered into in February, 2002. Whilst the CFA was on, what was the LTTE doing? You signed an agreement on the 22nd February, 2002 to maintain the ceasefire. The LTTE was quoted in "The Island" newspaper of 6th March, 2002. It states, I quote: Cache of LTTE explosives seized in Thailand.

Then, the Daily Mirror newspaper of 9th October, 2003 states, I quote: "Thailand earns ugly name over gun running for LTTE.

This is what happened when they were trying to procure ammunitions, arms from sources in East Asia. Now, this is whilst the CFA was on. Then, we have a very interesting development, where "The Island" newspaper states, LTTE links with al-Qaeda would worry US. Now this has happened whilst the CFA was on. It further states, According to Olafsdottir, the government has said it was a violation of the cease-fire agreement. The LTTE counters that it is 'a question of military balance . Now, they are acquiring the air capability in order to keep a balance with the Government of Sri Lanka in terms of military equation, military balance. Now, can a terrorist organization be matched in terms of a military equation with the government of a country? Now, the CFA gave them the open licence to become a parity with the Government of Sri Lanka. Sir, I will take one minute more.

We want to have sustained effort in terms of restoring normalcy in our country. The Governments responsibility lies more that we go after the LTTE. More the responsibility, the more it is increasing in terms of sustainable peace and the political proposals emanating from Sri Lanka. At the time of the termination of the CFA, I made an official statement to the world at large. I want to quote that statement today in this House because it is also valid in the context in which we are going to pursue our objective. It states, I quote: The Government of Sri Lanka will, while dealing militarily to eliminate the scourge of terrorism from our land, will spare no effort in our bid to arrive at a practical and sustainable political settlement. In doing so, our Government is conscious that the 13th Amendment to the Constitution signed following the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 1987 itself, is yet to be fully implemented. We have a vision; we have a proposal. We have an aim in bringing about sustainable development, sustainable peace to our people. Thank you, Sir. [.. 12.13] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Presiding Member, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, Minister of Foreign Affairs sounded to me as if the Satan was reading from the scriptures. Both of us have been in the same UNF Cabinet. I was in the Cabinet with him even in the present Government until about a year ago. Therefore, there was an accepted principle of collective responsibility which I believe, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, is well aware of having been a part of the Cabinet which had fully sanctioned the Ceasefire Agreement. Of course, I as a member of that Cabinet had disagreements with the Prime Minister for not properly including matters regarding the Muslim dimension and protection of the Muslim community in the Ceasefire Agreement. Subsequently, the Prime Minister was forced to make a statement in Parliament embodying certain aspects of the understanding that he had with us and I took it up with even Mr. Prabhakaran in Kilinochchi, the very capital you have now captured. The attitude of this Government after the capture of Kilinochchi is what we have got to now look at with the expectation in the country rising as if we can achieve the hitherto unexpected goal of total emancipation of the entire Vanni from the stranglehold of the LTTE. When His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected to power, the so-called peace activists too were somewhat jubilant for a different reason. Since his mandate showed a preponderant majority from among the Sinhala-Buddhist people of this country, the peace lobbies felt that there was a healthy sign in getting a Sinhala-Buddhist leader with such a

preponderant mandate from among the Sinhala-Buddhist people in this country. There was at least a chance to market an acceptable consensus, a compromised formula as a solution to the national ethnic problem. They felt that he possessed that ability. For us the minorities, today the issue is not the pursuit of war alone, but the parallel pursuit of an agenda to prepare an acceptable devolution package with the consent of all parties. We have participated with a lot of hope in the All Party Conference and the All Party Representative Committee. You know, Hon. Minister, you have visited several capital cities. You have spent Rs. 700 billion to go to these capitals; that is a different matter. But, in all your discussions with various leaders and foreign ministers of those countries, the frequently posed question to you is as to what the political solution the Government is offering to the minorities in this country. There you have made pious pronouncements. Only a few days ago after the Kilinochchi victory, the President came out and said that this is not a victory by the South over the North; this is not a victory of one community over another community. Those were very pious pronouncements indeed. But, those pious pronouncements have to be translated into effective credible action. Up to now in our participation in the All Party Representative Committee, we feel thoroughly disillusioned. We feel there is no direction. We had a lot of faith in the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana as a man hailing from the leftist tradition, that he would be able to build up that consensus. But, whenever we reached a consensus the neo-fascist forces that prevailed on the President were able to scuttle whatever agreements we were able to reach. Finally, we have come to a very painful situation where we may be compelled to withdraw from the All Party Representative Committee, if the Committee is unable to put forward the consensus that thus far has been reached on almost 98 per cent of the issues discussed that you yourself have told various world leaders. Therefore, do not forget that your paramount duty today is to offer that solution and not to exult in these periodic victories. These are victories achieved after much sacrifice; after much blood and toil of the soldiers and also blood and toil of those who die on the rebel side. Let us look at the innocent plight of the civilians who are trapped in Vanni. On the one hand, the Government is asking them to come over to the liberated areas. The LTTE, according to the Government, is holding them forcibly under their control. You must allow them their free will to move to wherever they want. There again, Prabhakaran too is wrong, if he is holding them against their will, so is the Government in forcing them to come out of those areas. They must be allowed to live where they are. Today, what is happening in Gaza and what is happening in the North cannot be separated. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

What is happening in Gaza? The President today is hailed as the biggest friend of the Palestinian people. He had led the Palestinian Solidarity Movement in this country for almost two to three decades as a young parliamentarian in 1970. But, he is able to just issue lame statements. What has he been able to - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

This is not a lame statement. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

You celebrated the visit of - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) We asked Israel and Gaza Strip to cease all types of hostilities and engage in a dialogue. That is what I have said. Have you read the statement today? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You say one thing there and do another here. This is your problem. You are now caught. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) No. We have said that to the country and to the world at large. Hon. Member, have you read the statement what has come out from the Government today calling for a ceasefire? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Todays statement I have not read, with all respect to you. But, you cannot differentiate the situation there and the situation here. Ultimately, what has to be offered is a political solution. You cannot tell the people in Gaza and the West Bank that the autonomy of the Palestinian people must be ensured and refuse to give that autonomy to the people here. This is our argument. Today the SLMC is proud that we have also achieved a victory. In this very House, the Hon. Speaker read out the judgment of the Supreme Court on a petition we filed before the Supreme Court by challenging the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill. Mind you, the Chief Justice was not part of the Bench. Therefore, you

cannot blame the Chief Justice for other machinations, as you do. There were other Judges of the Court who held with us on the argument that the Government has to consult the Provincial Councils because this is a devolved subject. This Bill has to be placed before the Provincial Councils and only thereafter it must be placed before Parliament. Therefore, we have achieved a limited victory on our own acting within the confines of the Constitution. That is what democracy enables us to do. But, today it is the President who is violating the Constitution by not appointing the Constitutional Council. The very letter of the Constitution is being violated everyday by the President who enjoys immunity under the Constitution. Therefore, we have got to remember one thing. They say, Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. What is happening today? I complained about it yesterday at a Press Conference. It is true, a request by the Government was there to raise the National Flag. The Officers-in-Charge of various Police Stations had been calling up the shop owners in various bazaars to light crackers. The shop owners in Eravur were told yesterday, You go to Polonnaruwa. We will give you a van to buy National Flags. They were calling me and telling me, Sir, please bring this to the notice of the Government and the others who are forcing us to do this. We have our Tamil brothers who are sulking, who are beleaguered, who are distressed and their sentiment today is that their dignity is at stake. They feel as if they are a polarized nation today. They feel affected and for us to celebrate at this time, to raise the flag and light crackers would not be the right thing for us to do in an atmosphere of this nature at this time. This is what I am saying. I am not saying that you should not be patriotic. Patriotism should not be thrust down the throat of the people. They must voluntarily come forward. What were you doing? You were telling Officers-in-Charge of the Police Stations to ask trishaw owners and shopkeepers to start lighting crackers. Of course, there were some who voluntarily did that. They respect that. Many Muslims also would have done it. Well, they are no less patriotic than the others in this country. But, patriotism as I told you according to the great saying, today, in the way in which this Government is trying to foist patriotism down the throat of the people, I get reminded of the saying, "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel" -

.

.

What is the patriotism today? If at all, His Excellency the President is to be credited with anything, I will credit him with something. He has in fact brought the Sinhala-Buddhist majority in this country out of a defeatist mindset. I salute him for that. So, what is happening is, having come out of the defeatist mindset, it is now translating into a triumphalist mindset to the extent of going and setting fire to a media institution. See what has happened at the Sirasa/MTV studios today. That is your triumphalism. Goons have gone there and destroyed the entire place. Free media is under attack. I told the police

2009 06 81 82

officer who was wearing an overall with the wording Crime Scene Squad and taking photographs, . . He was taking photographs of the crime scene. We know nothing will happen. I will tell you that Mr. Keith Noyahr, the Defence Columnist of "The Nation" was attacked in the middle of the road in Kirillapone. The same squad, all wearing masks came and destroyed the MTV/Sirasa studios early morning today. Do you mean to say the Government does not know who the perpetrators are? They are the very perpetrators, in my opinion. You will never bring them to book. They are openly masquerading, going and destroying the freedom in this country. If this is the freedom that you are asking the Mullaitivu people to come and enjoy from the clutches of the LTTE, certainly I will tell them, Please do not come. They may be enjoying the same type of atrocities there but then, nothing is better on this side and that is what I have to say with regard to the situation in this country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Presiding Member, may I once again say that it is very pathetic to see both the Governor and the Presidential Adviser, both Muslims, holding placards. Please do not betray the community by becoming the mouthpiece for this bankrupt Government in the middle of the road, blocking our path to Parliament. Thank you.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, since my entry into Parliament in April of 2008, I have always maintained that I am an opponent of war. I would like to start with what Henry Ford said in his writings, My Life and Work. It states, I quote: My opposition to war is not based upon pacifist or non-resistant principles. It may be that the present state of civilization is such that certain international questions cannot be discussed; it may be that they have to be fought out. But the fighting never settles the question. It only gets the participants around to a frame of mind where they will agree to discuss what they were fighting about. Since the advent of this problem in this country and the many wars that we have fought, we have finally always tried to settle down to discuss the ultimate solution to this problem. Now, we have in this House a classic example of how youth of the minority community emotionally got sucked into this war. We have Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran alias Karuna who belonged to the generation which came of age with the Black July. His is not just the story of one man; it is symbolic of the tragedy of an entire generation compelled by circumstances beyond their control to make choices which enmeshed them, their community and the country, in a cycle of vicious and deadly errors. It was a generation which came of age witnessing the spectacle of innocent Tamil men, women and children being brutally murdered by rioters while a majority of Southern society watched in silence. But, we all know that there were quite a lot of Southern people who risked their lives to save thousands of more lives. It was the most courageous and idealistic among that generation who joined the militant movements only to have their dreams shattered or characters degenerated by an unforgiving reality. In a few short

years, they were either killing fellow Tamil militants or being killed by fellow Tamil militants, supposedly brothers in arms against a common oppressor. Some died, some left, others stayed and died or prospered. Karuna stayed and prospered. But, I must remind Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran what Albert Camus said or Albert Cami as pronounced in French said, I quote: We all carry within us our places of exile, our crimes, our ravages. But the task is not to unleash them on the world; it is to fight them in ourselves and in others. Now, this is the plight of this community and the country. What we need to understand is that the situation today, the military victory in Kilinochchi and the push forward to the North and the eventual or inevitable defeat of the LTTE, looking at the numbers should teach all of us a lesson in that this event that we are witnessing today and some being forced to celebrate is of our making. This is not something that was born out of nothing. I have said this in the House before. That when a section of the population finds that it is being deceived at every turn, when every democratic option is denied to them, then they have to resort to what they think is fair. Now, we have members of the Government constantly harping on the CFA. I was a vociferous critic of the CFA. In fact I did not belong to the UNP at that time, and I was one of the vociferous critics of the CFA. And, you must remember that the Muslim community of the East suffered the most under the CFA. Under the CFA the events of Trincomalee, the events of Valaichchenai all happened when Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran was a part of the LTTE fighting machinery. He was commanding the East. We suffered the most but what we need to understand is that if not for the shrewd tactics of the then UNF Government and its leader, we would not be in this position today. You have to understand that. In fact, when I was the Assistant Secretary of the United National Party, I used to have long discussions with the Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe, Leader of the Opposition with regard to how to approach this issue. He would always say that the only option left is to agree to a ceasefire at any cost and hold it as long as possible. Now, if you look back, if not for the CFA, if that then Government had kept on fighting, Pillayan would not be the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province today. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran would not be a Member of Parliament. He would still be a part of the LTTE fighting machinery. It was the CFA, the resultant peace talks, the exposure to the outside world, the mechanizations of so many foreign bodies that eventually made Karuna Amman leave the LTTE and fight the very forces that he had helped to build. If not for the CFA the international safety net would not have been established and the abandoning of the LTTE by the international community would not have taken place. In fact, it was the CFA, the very CFA that destroyed the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes chances of becoming the President of this country. He paid the price for that. If the LTTE did not fear him, he would have perhaps been

[ () ]

2009 06 97 98

His Excellency Ranil Wickremasinghe. It was the biggest mistake that the LTTE did that brought this curse upon the Tamil community. If the LTTE had sat down genuinely and worked towards a peaceful solution they would not be in this situation today. We would not have lost thousands of lives on both sides, thousands of young men and women maimed for life and we would not have been discussing what we are discussing today. So, it is easy to heap the blame on one side when the other side comes to power. And, that is why I was reluctantly compelled to interrupt the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs when he spoke about the CFA. If not for the CFA, what we have achieved or what the State has achieved today would not be a reality because you can keep fighting a war. You do not need the Opposition to fight a war. All you need is dedicated, well directed armed forces to fight a war. And, I must commend the Government for the leadership it has given to the forces and what they have achieved. As proud Sri Lankans we have to give credit where it is due and I am reminded of the situation that His Excellency the President is in today . In a letter that Winston Churchill wrote to a friend in 1916 he said, I quote: I think a curse should rest on me - because I love this war. I know its smashing and shattering the lives of thousands every moment - and yet - I cant help it - I enjoy every second of it. This is what Winston Churchill wrote to a friend in 1916. As I said before, you do not need the Opposition to fight a war and the Government is doing a good job of fighting the war. But, what are we fighting the war for? Is it just to gain territory? No. The ultimate objective of fighting this war is to bring about peace. To bring about peace what do you need? You need consensus. Finally, you need consensus of this House and all those who sit here to bring about durable peace. So, how do you build consensus when you keep on blaming the other side for everything that has happened in the past? You cannot bring about consensus. You are basically dividing the country further. Anybody who speaks against the war is a traitor. Anybody who is associated with the UNP is a traitor. But, you must remember that 48 per cent of the people of this country voted for the UNP or for the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. So, how do you bring the leadership of these millions of people to reconcile to peace? How do you bring peace without a consensus? Today Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran is in this House. He fought with the LTTE. Now he is with the Government and when we sit down to talk peace, he will definitely have his say. The JVP basically brought victory to his Excellency the President. But, today a section of the JVP is opposed to him. The reality is that all these forces will have to come together and sit down to decide as to how we are going to take this country forward. Today you are in power, tomorrow you can be in the Opposition. But, that does not mean that you should continue to antagonize each other and not work towards building a consensus. You fight the war. Nobody can stop this Government from fighting the war. You have caught the Tiger by the tail. You cannot let go;

you have to finish it. But, finishing it militarily, you must remember, does not necessarily mean that you are not leaving room for young people of 1983 like Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran who felt like what Albert Camus said, I quote : rebellion cannot exist without the feeling that somewhere, in some way you are justified In 1983, he felt that somewhere, in some way he was justified in what he was doing. This is not going to prevent other Tamil youths thinking in the same way. So, we do not want to re-invent the wheel. We need to work towards a consensus now, a Sri Lankan consensus, not a Sinhala-Buddhist consensus or a Sinhala consensus. It is a Sri Lankan consensus where everybody - every Sinhalese, every Tamil, every Muslim, every Burgher - in this country feels that he is a part of this solution and that he is a part of a new Sri Lanka. But, this cannot be achieved in the way we are going, my Friends, not by people being forced to fire crackers, to gather around the roundabout to prevent the Opposition Leader coming to the House or trying to intimidate us. Anyway, I do not get intimidated. All I can get is killed. But you have to die some day. But we have to speak out as to the dangerous trend that we are setting with the events of these few days such as burning of the MTV studios. I have never appeared on MTV. I do not attend those talk shows. But, that is a necessary element of our society. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Just give me one more minute, please.

So, I as a representative of the Tamil-speaking people of the East, I humbly request every Member of this House to forget their political differences and work towards a solution by consensus and not by blame. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . 14 .

Ponnambalam, your Thirunelvely Research Station which belongs to the Department of Agriculture produced very fine top class varieties of vegetables. The purple brinjal variety comes from Thirunelvely and the Catholic Church has a big farm called Tholakaddy Farm where they grow numerous crops and make the best nelli crush in the world and different kinds of wines. So, we want to develop that. We want to develop the Vavunia School of Agriculture. During my last tenure of office - I went to Vavunia School of Agriculture. There we gave the best of everything to the students of the Vavunia School of Agriculture. We want to develop the Vavuniya seed station. We want to develop the entire area. The lands in the Northern Province are very fertile with calcareous soil. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)

May I ask the Hon. Minister, who is being very generous in saying that he would like to develop lot of things, as to why there is this infatuation about them

wanting to develop. Why can the other people also not develop? Why is there this dire urge to have the monopoly of power and want to dictate or decide for others? ( ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara)

My dear Friend, Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, it is not I who is going to decide on that. It is the people of this country who have elected us and whether you like it or not, I happened to be the Minister of Agriculture - [Interruption.] Let me explain to you. Also, I am working very closely with Mr. Rajendran, the Provincial Minister of Agriculture in the East. I am the person who sent the soil scientists to the East to give a solution to the salinity problem in the paddy fields. Likewise, if you are going to be the Minister of Agriculture in the Northern Provincial Council, my dear Friend, Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, I will join hands with you. That is how we are going to do that. Who is Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan? He was a fighter who started his life as a child soldier in the LTTE. Now, he is our Chief Minister in the East. Mr. Muralitharan alias Karuna - the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran is now a Member of Parliament. So, not that we are going to do that but we are going to be instrumental in getting the people to do that and whether you tell to do or not, I am going to give my fullest support and cooperation to the brethren in the North to develop the Northern area. Is there anything wrong in that? Now, you all . . ( . . ) (The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam) Mr. Chandrakanthan who happens to be the Chief Minister of Eastern Province is a disillusioned man today. ( ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara) You may say so. You may try to say so many things. But, I have never seen you disturbing a speaker like this on the Floor of this House before. You were trying your monkey pranks during the last couple of years to make a division. But, the easterners have joined the mainstream and they are being benefited. So are the northerners going to join us, the mainstream. Neither the LTTE nor the TNA can stop that. People have come to know what the TNA and the LTTE are. Wait and see! The late Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakams son, Chandrahasan is waiting to come and take up to politics in Sri Lanka. The late Hon. V. Dharmalingams son, former Member of Parliament, the Hon. D. Sithadthan, is also eagerly waiting to take up to politics in Sri Lanka, no sooner peace is restored in the North. The Hon. Veerasingham Anandasangaree, one of the brilliant Tamil politicians, who never went to bumsuck

the LTTE, and people like him are waiting to take up to politics. I think when I make my speech next time, I would be able to mention the name of Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam because he is also an educated and nice gentleman who feels for the country and the people of Jaffna. I hope and pray - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

( . . ) (The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I was told that I have 15 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity to speak in the Debate on the extension of the State of Emergency. I have not spoken in this House for quite some time and I thought I will make a short speech, but share with this House some sentiments that I think Members of my party and more importantly the Tamil community in this Island, would like to express at this moment.

Today, this Debate on the extension of the State of Emergency is taking place at a time when the current Government - many of the Sinhalese parties, if not, all of the Sinhalese parties - are in a very jubilant mood feeling that they have succeeded to a great extent on the military front celebrating victory. The Government officers have been asked to respect this victory in a number of ways such as with two-minutes' silence, raising the Lion Flag and many other things. When my Colleague, the Hon. Sri Kantha spoke before me, he took a lot of time in pointing out the other side of this so-called victory where there are 400,000 civilians - in my opinion it is close to 500,000 - in the LTTE administrative areas in the North who have been suffering immensely. Out of that figure, 330,000 are internally displaced. They live under stringent embargoes; economic, medical and food embargoes. These are all well-known. When there is a humanitarian crisis, the international humanitarian organizations that ought to be serving these people withdraw. All this is happening and the Tamil peoples view is that this Government has been waging a war of genocide; it is a war that is targeting the Tamil civilians and the Tamil population at large. It is being waged in the name of fighting the LTTE, but the actual target is the Tamil population itself. Sir, todays celebrations or the celebrations over the last few days, to be very frank, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, are not something that I am surprised at. I think it will be also correct to say that most Tamils expected this jubilation in the South, particularly amongst the Sinhalese parties because there is something fundamental here. That is, as long as the Sinhala leadership and the Sinhalese people believe that the Tamil people must simply live in this country at their mercy or at their sufferance; that this is a Sinhala-Buddhist country where 75 per cent of the population being a majority in this Island must therefore have the right to rule, as the Army Commander had stated, and the Tamils and the other members must know their place in this Island, you will never ever have peace and you will never ever find a solution. The reality is, Sir, the Tamil peoples struggle is not against or not wanting to live with the Sinhalese. It has never been about not wanting to live with the Sinhalese and I do not think it will ever be about not wanting to live with the Sinhalese. We have to live. The fact of the matter is, we share this Island. The question is what sort of relationship we want to have with the Sinhalese. Is it going to be a relationship of being subservient to the Sinhalese where we accept that this birthplace of ours does not in fact belong to us but belongs to someone else and that we have to live at the mercy and the goodwill of another community or are we going to associate with the Sinhalese as absolute equals where we pool our own identities, where we pool our separate sovereignties and come to an understanding of how to cohabit in this Island?

[ . . ]

The Hon. Nandana Gunathilake, who spoke before me, I think was very honest and I agree with his point of view that there cannot be a federal solution and that this has to be more importantly a unitary State. But, he also tried to couch that language, which is very honest I thought in some usual political diplomacy, by saying that of course this country must belong to all Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and even some other communities. The reality is, when you have a 75 per cent population belonging to one community and when that community has a very simplistic notion of democracy, no other community other than the Sinhala-Buddhists can live in this Island as equals. That is what our struggle is against and if our struggle is against that mentality of wanting to dominate, of wanting to subjugate, of wanting to have the monopoly over power, the monopoly to decide to be the sole decision maker of the destinies of the various people in this Island, then no amount of your military victories will ever bring a solution, nor will it ever bring peace. For as long as the Tamil people - this is important, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, and it has nothing to do with the Sinhalese people - feel that there is a subjective and objective test here; for as long as the Tamil people also feel that they are oppressed, that they are being subjugated, that they are being ruled by aliens, this struggle of theirs will continue and it will continue for several generations, if it takes that. I do not believe that it will take that. I believe the current euphoria amongst the Government is a mistake, is unfounded. I only hope that when events unfold in the future and when certain euphoric tendencies that prevail today give way to realities subsequently, that my good Friends opposite and more importantly, the community that most of these members opposite represent, understand that for as long as they continue to think along the lines that this Island belongs to only one community and masquerade what is essentially a Sinhala-Buddhist State in the name of a civic identity of Sri Lankan identity belonging to everyone, where in reality it being a Sinhala-Buddhist State, you will never have peace, nor will you ever be able to find a sustainable negotiated solution. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.
