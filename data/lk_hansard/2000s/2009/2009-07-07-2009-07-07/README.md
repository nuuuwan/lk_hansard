* : : Letter tabled :

TAMIL UNITED LIBERATION FROUNT 05.07.2009 His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa President of Sri Lanka, Temple Trees, Colombo-03

Your Excellency. THE PATHETIC PLIGHT OF THE IDPs. In utter despair I am writing this appeal to you to convince you that your intervention at this stage is indispensable. If the country is to maintain its dignity and honour. The countrys credibility lies in your decision to order the immediate release of certain categories of IDPs and J to follow it up soon by re-viewing the problem of the remaining IDPs. At present, they are virtually kept under compulsion without any justification. giving them the feeling that they are kept in an open prison with too many restrictions and not in a welfare centre. Hence your announcement tomorrow, a POYADAY, will be very crucial and will grant relief to the entire Buddhist World. I am acting on the assumption that many happenings in the IDP Camps are not brought to your notice. Seeing is belleving and a visit to some of the IDP Camps by you is long over due. but not any in the Menic Farm, These things cannot and should not happen in our country with you as the Head of the State. Your decision which I am sure will open the eyes of some, who think that we can play with the lives of over 300,000 odd IDPs who are suffering for no faults of theirs. We are a proud Nation in which small children used to save the lives of cows. from the butachers, with their pocket-money. What provoked me to write this to you today is the denial of the authorities, to release a one your old child with the 61 year old Grandmother with whom the child is now staying in a IDP Camp at Pulmoddai, The father of this child and son of this Grandmother had his lett ieg amputauei and is now in Pulmoddai. His wife had a right leg amputated with a multiple fracture on the left leg and is now in Vavuniya. These things are not happening in any part of the world. Even for a moment I will not assume that you have any knowledge of these incidents. This type of incidents are available in abundance in various camps among the 300,000 odd displaced, persons. This detention is contrary to the undertaking given by you to the people of Vanni that they will be well looked-after if they escaped from the areas under the control of the LTTE at their own risk and came into the areas under the control of the Government. How many died or got killed in the risk they took. While crossing over, is not unknown to the world. Unfortunately they are not looked-after well but are physically and mentally tortured due to the prevailing conditions in the IDP Camps. Had they known that they will be forced to undergo this ordeal not one person would have dared to cross over at such risk to his or her life and would have preferred to stay behind and face death with their kith and kind or their dear ones, many of whom died due to shelling from both sides or died in the process of crossing over to the Government side. You will see for yourself that, if you allow the gates of the IDP Camps opened for a day, hardly one person staying behind. It is indeed painful for me to bring to your notice all these. Please pardon me for giving vent to my un-controllable feelings which I am doing after waiting so long. For the situation to improve. If you are in my position it will be easy for you to understand my feelings. Thousand of my old constituents have come to the IDP Camps from the Districts of Kilinochchi and Mullaitheevu. You know that I lived with them for several years and had represented them for a fair length of time. It is a tale of woe, that I hear from every one of them without any exception. Some are without their wives and some others their husbands and children. A good number had lost their parents, most of whom lost their

lives in the battle front, not as combatants but as innocent civilians caught up in the cross fire and some others got buried alive in the bunkers. Many died of starvation and children without milk food. They are still searching for their kith and kind. I made an appeal at the very start to publish a list of persons in each camp to enable the IDPs to trace their missing relatives and to help people living outside and in foreign countries to locate the people dear to them. So far it is not done. An officer named Mr. Tharmakulasingham attached to the Mullaitheevu Health Department who was maintaining a record of all causalities; himself got killed in a shell attack while he was on duty. That is the end of it. There is no way to determine whether a missing person is alive or dead. Many unidentified bodies in decomposed state are damped in common graves, many a times in the IDP Camps. Even the close relatives are not allowed to be present at the burial ceremony. There are a lot of rites that will have to be performed for the dead. Some of which are compulsory for a soul to rest in peace. It may look ridiculous but people all over the world fear that souls for which no proper rites are performed has a tendency to roam about restlessly. Let one person dare say that what I say is rubbish. These are very sentimental issues that cannot be brushed side. For obvious reasons the IDPs do not complain but continue to weep in silence. I strongly believe this and I hope as a true Buddhist you will agree with me. I will certainly not bear to see this happening to any one. Not even to an enemy. I heard and continue to hear a number of stories. Some of which moved me to tears. It is the injured and the pregnant women who suffer the worst, without proper and prompt attention. Many injured had died for want of prompt treatment. Apart from the physical pain they undergo the mental torture affects them the most. Although there are thousands of cases, I give just one or two examples for you to consider the seriousness of the problems. One, is the story of the young man of 30 years who had his left leg amputated and is now in Pulmoddai. What is the security risk the country faces from these four individuals ? What is the need to have them at three different places for months? In another case the Principal of a School in Vanni died of shell attack and his daughter also got badly injured. They are from Jaffna having plenty of relatives to weep for them and also to look after them. The mother and child are at the Mannar Hospital with hardly any one known to them. Who is answerable to this crime Your Excellency? I do not blame you for this. The authorities should have sent them to Jaffna to be cared for by their people and also to perform the due rites to the dead husband. I know you for over forty years. These are matters, I know you will not tolerate. This type of harassment, especially to people who had suffered in many ways for more than quarter of a century and had been living in constant fear and tension, is unacceptable. They have suffered enough and came running to you. Risking their lives and leaving behind the seriously wounded and dying relative to seek solace from you as their President. You are aware that I never misled you in any matter. The suggestions I make are well intended and to save the credibility of the country as a Buddhist Nation. I remember warning you on an earier occasion too that the world is watching every step we take and there are many keeping a record of what is happening in our country and elsewhere. One day when you and I are no more or may be even during your lifetime Sri Lanka will wake-up to see itself condemned by the whole world, when many hidden truths come to the open. Above all there is one above preparing a balance sheet. You know me well. I do not flatter anybody for my personal gains. I dont hesitate to call a spade a spade. To be very frank, I had been always feeling proud that I am a citizen of Sri Lanka that has a proud Buddhist heritage. Although not a Buddhist I am one who pays obeisance to Lord Buddha. I have lost count of the number of visits I paid to Mahiyangana, and Dalada Maligawa. I have had the blessings of several Mahanayakas including those of the most Venerable Asgiriya and Malwatte Mahanayakas. I am now beginning to think as to why I was born in this country where the future of this country as a Proud Buddhist Nation is at stake. I strongly urge that you should without any delay order the immediate release of the injured persons, the old and the feeble, pregnant women, women with children, disabled persons, mentally

1527 1528

retarded persons, the insane persons, orphans, destitute persons and such others who deserve release. Also please reunite members of the same family from various camps. Please send people from various districts to their respective districts. As a patriotic Sri Lankan who loves not only his country but also its people, I have done my duty to my country. A further letter will be sent to you with some other suggestions which you will accept as reasonable. If you want to win over the Tamils do this first. Resettle them soon and think of any development latter. Thanking you, Yours Sincerely, V. Anandasangaree. President - TULF President Tamil United Liberation Front [. . 1.56] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.

[. . 3.38] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency and I think it is appropriate that I speak after the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran. On the 19th of May, His Excellency the President came into this House and announced to our joy that we are now a country that is free of terrorism. But, I beg to ask the question as to how a country that has been under the rule of the Emergency Regulations for many years, which I believe started way back on the 12th of August, 1953, could call ourselves a free nation, because what the Emergency Regulations effectively does is basically suspends the rule of law. What amply demonstrates this is that during the periods of these Emergencies, we have not seen a reduction in crime in this country. Now, everyday when we tune in to the radio or the television or read the newspapers, we find that there is an increasing trend in crime. So, sometimes I wonder whether the state of Emergency and the impunity that comes with it has any relevance to the rule of law. I happened to read a statement by the Asian Human Rights Commission, dated May 18,2009 which stated in its caption, I quote: Government must now end the operation of anti-terrorism lawsIt states, I quote: Emergency and anti-terrorism laws are a tremendous burden on the operation of the normal legal process. When extraordinary laws that allow the special suspensions of the general law of the country operate it permeates the normal rule of law system and virtually paralyses it. It further states, I quote: The collapse of the rule of law system in Sri Lanka has been noted by everyone and one of the contributory factors has been the continuing use of such extraordinary laws. Emergency and anti-terrorism laws create a situation of terror and fear psychosis. One of the major challenges that the country will face in the immediate future is how to exorcise such terror and fear and the first step towards that is the abolition of these laws. It is hoped that the government will not look for another demon, whether real or imagined, in order to justify the continuation of emergency and anti terrorism laws. The governments propaganda machinery, which has for a long time depended heavily on the existence of the LTTE for the purpose of justifying all forms of terror exercised by the state, is very likely to look for another demon or even a phantom in order to continue with its vicious propaganda for the purpose of controlling the entire population. ........ ......In view of the developments of the past few days it will not be possible for the government to justify the continuation of the emergency and anti-terrorism laws, either to the local population or the international community. Such a move will only give credence to the accusation that there are ulterior motives for maintaining the operation of such laws.

Now, this I quoted from the statement made by the Asian Human Rights Commission. When you read this, it rings a bell as to whether we can, after so many years of war claim that we are a free nation or whether we could continue to justify the rule under emergency laws. I agree that a violent nature thrust upon us for over 30 years cannot be erased within a few months. But, I think now the Government must set a timetable for the ending of the Emergency. Like we set ourselves goals for eradicating terrorism, we must now set a timetable as to when we can really be a free Sri Lanka, where everyone is ruled by the law of the land and not under special circumstances. Asanga Welikala in his article to the Sunday Leaderof 07th June, 2009 has stated, I quote:

.. Normalising The Exception - The Emergency Continues. War may have ended, but not emergency rule. He states in his last paragraph, I quote: A martially victorious government is still the government of a democracy, accountable and changeable, and the celebrating people of Sri Lanka would do well to remember the salutary words of John Stuart Mill : Evil for evil, a good despotism, in a country at all advanced in civilisation, is more noxious than a bad one; for it is far more relaxing and enervating to the thoughts, feelings, and energies of the people. The despotism of Augustus prepared the Romans for Tiberius. If the whole tone of their character had not been prostrated by nearly two generations of that mild slavery, they would probably have had spirit enough left to rebel against the more odious one. This basically took me to another article by Tisaranee Gunasekara that appeared in the Sri Lanka Guardian of 06th July, 2009. I quote the caption: From the Sun God to the High King? Basically she starts with the astrological predications published in the Silumina which states, I quote: President Mahinda Rajapakse and the Rajapakses will rule this country for a long time The Rajapakses will become beloved leaders of this country The next chapter in Sri Lanka is reserved for the Rajapakses: I am sure the majority in this country accepted that prediction with glee, and I am sure this astrologer was not taken to the Fourth Floor because he was saying something that everybody wanted to hear. In fact, even I for a moment was very happy that we are going to have continuity of rule in this country. Otherwise we find change every six years and we are good at changing everything. So, I thought that is very good. But then when I went on reading that article, there was something that bugged me. Paragraph 4 states, I quote:

The Tigers and a segment of the Tamil community hailed Vellupillai Pirapaharan as Sarvadesh Thalevar and venerated him as Surya Thevan At some of the Pongu Thamil celebrations, worshippers rolled on the floor in front of a vehicle carrying Pirapaharans picture. During the final peace process, this leadership deification assumed a life of its own, with Tamil identity totally subsumed in Pirapaharans personal identity. But, despite the

1559 1560

sycophantic outpourings and mindless veneration of genuine believers and opportunists, Pirapaharan remained what he was, a fallible and destructible mortal. The manner of his death bears a striking resemblance to the ultimate fate of many a hubris-infested hero/leader in Greek tragedies. Pirapharans refusal to surrender either to the Lankan government or to a third party is understandable; not so his refusal to leave the battle zone when he could have done so and move into the familiar jungle from which he could have continued his struggle. Here was a man who, blinded by hubris, believed he could not lose and thought he could work out a miracle whenever necessary. This is almost identical to the mindset that enveloped Adolf Hitler when the empire he won was crumbling from his own hubristic errors. Even as Berlin was being surrounded on all sides and the once invincible German military machine was disintegrating, Hitler continued to make plans and give orders for counteroffensives to be launched by non-existing armies.

The politico-psychological landscape of the LTTE was based on the nexus between the leader, the organization and the people; Tamils, the Tigers and Vellupillai Pirapaharan were believed to be bound to each other with unbreakable links, with identical goals and interests - One people, One Organisation, One Leader. Any Tamil who ventured out of this hermitically sealed world was seen as a traitor." Now, suddenly we ask ourselves, is this the path that Sri Lanka has chosen, post-war? She goes on to say, I quote again: The politico-psychological landscape of the LTTE was based on the nexus between the leader, the organisation and the people; Tamils, the Tigers and Vellupillai Pirapaharan were believed to be bound to each other with unbreakable links, with identical goals and interests - One People, One Organisation, One Leader. Any Tamil who ventured out of this hermitically sealed world was seen as a traitor. Currently a similar identification between the Rajapakses, the people and Sri Lanka is in the making. Just as the successes scored by the LTTE and the seminal role played by Pirapaharan in ensuring these enabled the creation and maintenance of the axiomatic identification between the Leader, the Organisation and the people, the victory over the LTTE has enabled the Rajapakses to link their future to the future of the country." Now, I have nothing personal against His Excellency the President. But I am scared, I am worried, as a Sri Lankan whether we are creating a situation which could take things out of context. I further quote: A familial project is not viable unless it is placed within a certain ideological framework which legitimises the rule of one family by making its interests coterminous with the interests of a key segment of the populace. The ideological framework for the Rajapakse dynasty is being provided by Sinhala supremacism. The Rajapakse regime is linked to the restoration of Sinhala dominance in Sri Lanka and its continuance is depicted as a sine qua non for the existence of Sri Lanka as a hierarchically pluralist country. These claims have been enormously strengthened by the spectacular victory over the LTTE; the next step would be to pacify the North and the East, without making major political concessions to the Tamils. The consent of the majority Sinhala community to the transformation of Sri Lanka from a flawed, albeit vibrant democracy, to a family oligarchy, in return for the restoration of Sinhala supremacism, geographically, politically and psychologically: that seems to be the quid pro quo the Rajapakses are aiming at." I am tabling* this article for inclusion in the Hansard because I am sure this is a very thought-provoking article which needs to be read.

* . . Produced at end of speech.

And, going beyond that, now we know that on the one side we have this image being built of a Supreme Leader and we also keep talking of a solution to the problem that has been existing in this country long before Independence where the question of majority versus minority arises. There was a lot of noise made about the statement that the President made that there is no minority in this country. But I, as a Member of a minority community would have loved if the President had said that there is no majority in this country, because the problem in this country is that if you do not belong to the majority you have a problem. Therefore, we need to look at how the majority in this country, if we all belong to that majority, are going to bring about a settlement to the problem that is faced by the minority community now. We all harp on this Thirteenth Amendment and I am sometimes amused that we make such a big fuss about this Thirteenth Amendment which is a part of the Constitution of this country. All of us who are seated in this House have taken oath to protect the Constitution of this country. Therefore -I am not a lawyer- I feel that we cannot speak against the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment. You should be thrown out of this House if you speak against the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, because, that is the law of this land. How it was brought in, how it got into the books is irrelevant. If we want to change it, let us bring about amendments; let us bring about the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. There is no problem. But, let us talk about that Amendment because, at every turn, both parties canvassing the votes of the majority have gone against all principles of democracy. They agree to disagree: when UNP agrees, SLFP disagrees; when SLFP agrees, UNP disagrees. Why? Because, they are scared of the majority vote. They want to take the biggest share of the majority vote and we are only a topping; we are the cream on the pudding. Like the Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ismail Ashraff once told me we should be a good fruit salad and not a mixed fruit juice. I think the Lady heard me. She once said that we should be a good fruit salad and not a mixed fruit juice. But, then, what we are used for is the cream on the mixed fruit juice. You have to change that attitude. There was only one piece of legislation where the Tamil people agreed to in this country, the District Development Council, and that too was scuttled by whom? The majority. Why? Because they think decentralization or devolution is a crime. Deconcentration is not decentralization or devolution. Devolution is strengthening at the grassroot level and we are not doing that. We still want to impose the majoritarian concept of rule in this country and unless that mindset changes, we are just fooling ourselves. Now, we have set a timetable for ourselves saying, Okay, we will solve this problem after the next Presidential Election. No, that should be the basis of the next Presidential Election as to what the solution to this problem is. And this cannot come other than at this moment: when you are

[ . . . ]

2009 07 1561 1562

carrying the majority with you, when the majority is willing to enthrone you as the king, when the whole world is moving away from monarchy, is the time you have to come out with a solution. And you cannot say, You make me a king again, I will deliver the solution. No. You cannot solve a problem by prolonging it, but by being able to take a decision when the iron is hot. This is what happened to the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Though he professed federalism in 1926, in 1956 he went against it and had to pay with his life. Now, we do not want that to happen in this country; we do not want a discontinuation of a firm rule. But, that ruler must have the courage and the foresight to say, This is it and no more. Because if you really get to the bottom of this, what are we talking about? We are talking about empowering the very people who are electing us to power. You are not empowering the Indians or the Pakistanis or the Chinese. You are empowering your own people. So, why are we fighting against empowering our own people? If we do not empower these people, it is natural that they rebel, like the South rebelled in the 70s and the 80s. The North took one step further. Why? Because, we are not willing to accommodate. When does this come? Every time when we come close to scoring a goal, we push the goalpost and say, No, wait! Still it is not right. The goalie might catch it. We cannot go on like this. So, I plead with His Excellency the President, the Sinhala population and the country has proclaimed you as a King, now you should rule and deliver. Thank you * : : Document tabled : From the Sun God to the High King? (July 06, Colombo, Sri Lanka Guardian) By Tisaranee Gunasekara President Mahinda Rajapakse and the Rajapakses will rule this country for a long time. The Rajapakses will become beloved leaders of this country The next chapter in Sri Lanka is reserved for the Rajapakses (An Astrological prediction published in the state-owned Silumina - 7.6.2009). The singer is young and pretty. Her pose is one of veneration and her words worshipful. Around her, traditional dancers in colourful garb gyrate rhythmically. The ensemble seems apposite for a Pongu Tamil celebration with its overtones of leader deification. But this singer is Sinhala and the subject matter of her symbolism laden song is President Mahinda Rajapakse of Sri Lanka. The message embedded in the lyrics will be fully comprehensible only to those familiar with the theology and the myths of Sinhala Buddhism. Rajapakse is hailed as the High King (Maha Raju) who has received his royal mandate from the four Great Brahmas (superior heavenly beings believed to have been present at the birth of Prince Siddhartha). He is praised for reuniting this country with his miraculous feats (pelahara - a term usually reserved for the miracles of Prince Siddhartha and the Buddha). In a final flourish he is called the god who won the land (derana dinu devidun). The Tigers and a segment of the Tamil community hailed Vellupillai Pirapaharan as Sarvadesh Thalevar (Leader of all lands) and venerated him as Surya Thevan (Sun God). At some of the Pongu

Thamil celebrations, worshippers rolled on the floor in front of a vehicle carrying Pirapaharans picture. During the final peace process, this leadership deification assumed a life of its own, with Tamil identity totally subsumed in Pirapaharans personal identity. But, despite the sycophantic outpourings and mindless of genuine believers and opportunists, Pirapaharan remained what he was, a fallible and destructible mortal. The manner of his death bears a striking resemblance to the ultimate fate of many a hubris-infested hero/leader in Greek tragedies. Pirapaharans refusal to surrender either to the Lankan government or to a third party is understandable; not so his refusal to leave the battle zone when he could have done so and move into the familiar jungle from which he could have continued his struggle. Here was a man who, blinded by hubris, believed he could not loose and thought he could work out a miracle whenever necessary. This is almost identical to the mindset that enveloped Adolf Hitler when the empire he won was crumbling from his own hubristic errors. Even as Berlin was being surrounded on all sides and the once invincible German military machine was disintegrating, Hitler continued to make plans and give orders for counteroffensives to be launched by non-existing armies.

The politico-psychological landscape of the LTTE was based on the nexus between the leader, the organization and the people; Tamils, the Tigers and Vellupillai Pirapaharan were believed to be bound to each other with unbreakable links, with identical goals and interests - One People, One Organisation, One Leader. Any Tamil who ventured out of this hermitically sealed world was seen as a traitor. When Hitler indulged in his delusive plans for a coup de main in a Germany going down to a historic defeat, none dared to tell him the reality, The Nazi subculture was one in which the leader ordered and the followers obeyed, unquestioningly. That the Fuhrer was always right was an axiom, the most fundamental article of faith in Nazism. Similarly even if Pirapaharans senior lieutenants (and most of them remained loyal to him and the organisation until the bitter end, unlike the top Nazis) saw way the wind was blowing, they may not have dared to impress this unpalatable reality on the Tiger leader too strenuously, because, of the of unquestioning obedience. This lack of space for debate and dissension, for alternate opinions and different viewpoints, prevented the LTTE from averting decimation and propelled Pirapaharan into an avoidable death.

Is this the path Sri Lanka has chosen, post-war? MAJESTIC DREAMS Mahinda Rajapakse, the scion of a minor aristocratic family from Hambantota, named his Presidential Election manifesto Mahinda Chinthanaya (The Philosophy of Mahinda) after himself. This move, unprecedented in Lankan politics, seems portentous with hindsight. Once elected, Rajpakse worked diligently at creating a personality cult. The regimes budget airline (Mihin Air), its housing programme (Mihindu Sevana) and its infrastructure programme (Mahinda Randora) were named after him (a plan to build a massive religious edifice, similarly named, was abandoned, for the time being), Colombo and its environs are dotted with cut-outs adorned with Rajapakses picture, many of them hailing his as the High King of Sri Lanka.

With siblings, cousins and nephews ubiquitous, the administration has a distinct Rajapakse flavour. President Rajapakse is Minister of Defence, Public Security and Law and Order, Finance, Religious Affairs and Moral Upliftment and Highways and Road Development. Older brother Chamal is Minister of Irrigation and Water Management and Ports and Aviation. Two younger brothers function as presidential alter egos, controlling key swathes of the state structure. Gotabhaya is effectively in charge of the countrys defence and its powerful and growing military machine. Basil, believed to be the brains of the family, is Senior Presidential Advisor and an appointed member of the legislature. As the Development Czar he presides over mammoth infrastructure projects. Though only a junior parliamentarian, he dictates even to senior ministers and acts as his brothers trouble shooter with factious local allies and key international players. Together the sibling control 67.6% of the national budget.

1563 1564

The formal introduction of the next generation of Rajapakses into the political arena is already on, with the elevation of Presidential nephew Shashindra Rajapakse as the de facto Chief Ministerial candidate of Uva, over and above senior party men (young Shashindra is a son of Chamal Rajapakse; he is also the Presidents Private Secretary and the Basnayake Nilame of the Kataragama Devalaya). The Presidents oldest son, Namal is the head of his own organisation, Tharunayata Hetak (Aspiring Youth), which he founded after his father became the Presidential candidate; though not a statal or a para-statal entity, it receives massive state patronage. Namal, who holds no offical position, plays the role of a high official unofficially. For instance the para JVP website, Lanka Truth reported that Namal Rajapakse made an uninvited visit to the police headquarters in Kandy on 7 September 2008 and advised the officers on the importance of public relations. He was also a keynote speaker at the official 61st Independence Day ceremony at the Lankan Embassy in Washington, together with the Ambassador Jaliya Wickremesuriya (A son of President Rajapakses first cousin, Wickramesuriya managed his tea company in the US, before being made the Consul General for Los Angles and the Ambassador to Washington by his uncle). The necessary line of demarcation between state and First Family is steadily evaporating, as the First Family proceed to occupy larger and larger swathes of the state, thereby tightening its stranglehold on power. A case in point is the awarding of a licence for WiMax broadband frequencies to Sky Network, a company incorporated on 6 May 2006 with a share capital of Rs. 20/- and owned by a nephew of the President, Himal Laleendra Hettiarachchi (his mother is a sister of the President.) According to a detailed report in the Sunday Leader of 24 February 2008, once Sky Network obtained three WiMax frequencies from the telecom Regulatory Commission (headed by a handpicked nominee of the President), it issued 950,000 shares to Hastings Trading E Services of Portugal, a subsidiary of Lycatel, a UK based prepaid international calling card company. Two weeks later, on 30 March 2007, one of the two original shareholder - directors of Sky Network resigned and Hettiarachchi was appointed in his stead as a director. Interestingly the former director and the new one share an address (175/2, Old Kottawa Road, Mirihana, Nugegoda), which is also the address of Sky Network. In the meantime, after an unsuccessful application to the telecom Regulatory Commission for a WiMax frequency, the part state-owned giant, Sri Lanka Telecom purchased a 40% stake in Sky Network to obtain a WiMax frequency without which its competitive edge would have been blunted. The Rajapakse Family has become an octopus, with its tentacles reaching into the far corners of the Lankan state, polity and economy. ONE LEADER, ONE PEOPLE, ONE COUNTRY The politico-psychological landscape of the LTTE was based on the nexus between the leader, the organization and the people; Tamils, the Tigers and Vellupillai Pirapaharan were believed to be bound to each other with unbreakable links, with identical goals and interests - One People, One Organisation, One Leader. Any Tamil who ventured out of this hermitically sealed world was seen as a traitor. Currently a similar identification between the Rajapakses, the people and Sri Lanka is in the Making. Just as the successes scored by the LTTE and the seminal role played by Pirapaharan in ensuring these enabled the creation and maintenance of the axiomatic identification between the Leader, the organization and the people, the victory over the LTTE has enabled the Rajapakes to link their future to the future of the country. A familial project is not viable unless it is placed within a certain ideological framework which legitimizes the rule of one family by making its interests coterminous with the interests of a key segment of the populace. The ideological framework for the Rajapakse dynasty is being provided by Sinhala supremacism. The Rajapakse regime is linked to the restoration of Sinhala dominance in Sri Lanka and its continuance is depicted as a sine qua non for the existence of Sri Lanka as a hierarchically pluralist country. These claims have been enormously strengthened by the spectacular victory over the LTTE; the next step would be pacify the North and the East, without making major political concessions to the Tamils. The consent of the majority Sinhala community to the transformation of Sri Lanka from a flawed, albeit vibrant democracy, to a family oligarchy, in return for the restoration of Sinhala supremacism, geographically, politically and psychologically: that seems to be the quid pro quo the Rajapakses are aiming at.

The identification between the Rajapakse familial project and the Sinhala supremacist interests makes sense from two angles. Firstly the war is the only success story of the Rajapakse regime. Secondly the Sinhalese form the core-constituency of the Rajapakses. As the President himself stated, he regards himself, first and foremost, as the President of those Sinhalese who voted for him rather than of all Sri Lankans, equally : You must remember my political legacy and constraints. During my election I received few Tamil votes because of the LTTE - enforced boycott. I was elected primarily by a Sinhala constituency on an election manifesto which made it clear that an ultimate solution to the ethnic crisis could be evolved only on the basis of a unitary state (Friday - 13.9.2007). In short Rajapakse believes that he owes a special duty to the majority community - because they voted for him - and that he is justified in treating the minority communities somewhat unequally - because they did not vote for him. Rajapakse needs Sinhala supremacists as much as they need him; theirs is a symbiotic relationship. Who else would hail Rajapakse a King and provide the necessary patriotic cover for the familial project?

The current cult of veneration around Rajapakse will not turn him into a king (or Sri Lanka into a monarchy) let alone a god. The danger posed by such absurd practices is the psychological degeneration of both the worshipper and the worshipped. It creates a mindset which is profoundly anti-democratic and anti-civilisational, consisting of blind faith in the ability of the leader to overcome any challenge, unquestioning obedience to his orders and uncritical acceptance of his world view. It turns free men into mindless slaves and equal citizens into unequal subjects. That happened to Tamil polity and society with the dominance of the LTTE and the elevation of its Supremo to celestial heights. Perhaps it is our turn now.
