Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Speaker, let me thank you for giving me the privilege to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by those who spoke before me on the Vote of Condolence of the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare and I am happy that I have an opportunity to speak when you are in the Chair, which is very rare. But, I would once again start my contribution on this Vote of Condolence emphasizing on the fact that the precedent we are setting in this House with the empty chairs on a Debate on a Vote of Condolence is a sad indictment on the quality of Members who are entering this House. Basically, when we speak on the demise of the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare, we are also speaking of a change of guard, a change of generations who are representing the people of this country and what we see in that generation is that we do not have even a 10 per cent attendance in the House when we move Votes of Condolence on Members who have adorned this House for over 39 to 40 years. So, I plead with you that some action be taken to ensure that Members of this House present themselves at least on the days that these Votes of Condolence are moved. Getting back to the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare, we know that the Aluvihares are synonymous with Matale. When you say, "Aluvihares", we know that they are from Matale and this fact was amply demonstrated by the speech made by the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayaka, his political opponent. In his speech, he paid tribute to his opponent as a true son of Matale and that is what the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare was. He was a proud scion of the Aluvihare family, described as a man with no secrets, a man with a generous heart and a clear and strong voice. We are told that he entered politics at the request of his uncle Bernard Aluvihare and was the first Mayor of Matale at the young age of 21 way back in 1947. Why I chose to speak on this Vote of Condolence is because I

remember as a young boy, when my father was a Member of Parliament in the 60s, the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare strode the halls of "Shravasthi" in 1961. We used to see this imposing figure and used to ask, Who is this man? We were told that he was the new Member for Matale. That was the time from when I remember the gentle giant. He was also known to have a very clean pair of hands - utterly honest and led a clean public life. He was extraordinarily brave and adept at handling tense, difficult and explosive situations, which he is known to have defused in minutes with utmost ease. Maybe because he was a six-footer, he always cut an imposing figure and was an amiable giant. I remember, when I attended his funeral in Matale, I was impressed by the crowd, not because of the crowd, but the expressions on the faces of the crowd. They were there to pay homage to a man who had served them for 40 years.

I distinctly remember one of the speakers describing him as an Indra keela and I was very curious to know what this meant. Then I was told that it means a "pillar of strength" and he was a pillar of strength for his family, for the people of Matale and for his party.

This reminds me of what Sir Winston Churchill said. I quote: One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it. If you do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will reduce the danger by half.

That is what the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare was. He always stood up for what he thought was right. He always stood with his party and with its leader. For me, he was a majestic tusker of the UNP, carrying with pride and ease, the responsibility thrust on him as a representative of his people and his party.

This takes me to what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said. I quote: The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy. This was amply demonstrated by the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare. When his party was under threat, when his leader was under threat, he always stood with his party and with his leader. He never moved away from them. As we have so many other Votes of Condolences to be moved, I do not wish to speak at length. I wish to take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to his wife and children, members of his family and pray that he attains the supreme bliss of Nibbana.

I conclude by requesting you, Hon. Speaker, to forward a copy of today's Proceedings to his family. Thank you.

[. . 11.23] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress would like to join both sides of the House, in paying tribute to a very illustrious Parliamentarian and a legal luminary who adorned this Chamber for many long years. Hon. Deputy Speaker, you would agree with me as a son of the soil from the same area as that of the late Hon. Harindra Corea that he was a worthy opponent of your illustrious father, the Hon. S.D. Jayaratne. There used to

be an interesting saying in the good old days that Chilaw is famous for Coconuts, Catholics and Coreas. Whatever the pun intended by this saying, Chilaw is famous for Coconuts, Catholics and Coreas. The late Hon. Harindra Corea indeed lived and practised a philosophical mode of life going by the erudite education he had, both in this country and abroad, in very illustrious institutions. I reckon he attended one of the famous Inns of Court in studying for barrister in London - the Lincolns Inn. I stand to be corrected, if it was otherwise. But, yet though he was born into a landed gentry, he was very much a man of the common people. I remember his short tenure as the Minister of Justice in this country. I very vividly remember as a young lawyer myself, when I attended a Voetlights Dinner that happens to be the year-end bash that we, lawyers have after the court vacation in December where the Hon. Harindra Corea was called upon to make a speech after the speech by the "baby" of the Bar. I do not remember who it was in that year. The Hon. Harindra Corea made such a fitting, hilarious and an interesting speech in such immaculate English with such an oratorical skill combining wit, humour and substance. I was myself surprised that he could make such an impromptu speech holding the entire audience thrilled to bits. Particularly, Voetlights Dinner is a dinner that by the time the Chief Guest speaks, all are somewhat high on spirits and would be making a lot of cat-calls at the speaker himself. Anyway, the late Hon. Harindra Corea enjoyed the cat-calls and made such a wonderful speech. That was one of the speeches I would never forget in my entire life as a lawyer. Speaking of the late Hon. Harindra Corea, I understand that he attended St. Thomas' College, Gurutalawa, Bandarawela in his early days and thereafter pursued his secondary education and legal studies in London. Being a Thomian from Bandarawela, he was proud of his roots and would always be sharing anecdotes about the Royal-Thomian encounters, though he may not be qualified to call himself a "fully-fledged" Thomian. He was somebody who took pride in his education roots. By the way, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I must thank you and congratulate you for having taken a very good step of forming the Old Boys Union of Parliamentarians as far as the Royalists are concerned. I have been contacted by some people to join this exclusive club - which I am sure, a very proud one - where we will have even the Chief Government Whip with us so that we will perhaps have the "Voetlights" tradition within Parliament to continue good banter forgetting our political rivalries. Be that as it may, Sir, the Hon. Harindra Corea was somebody whom all of us could call "a thorough gentleman in politics". Someone hailing from a place like Chilaw to be completely above board when it comes to violence, when it comes to being accessible to his constituents, is a shinning example for all Parliamentarians to follow.

617 618

In bidding him farewell, I remember in the good old days lawyers always remembered and felicitated those who had completed a particular number of years in the Bar. But, the Hon. Harindra Corea was one who, having left active legal practice, did not want to be even conferred "silk" on him though it was very much there on offer due to his political influence and eminence. And such was his humility, humble way that he even declined to accept "silk" though it was always available for a person of his erudite scholarship. Therefore, Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that we participate in todays Debate to pay tribute to such an illustrious Member of this House. Having mentioned all that, may I also wish that a record of the speeches made in this House be sent to his family. Thank you. [. . 11.32] ( )

( The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of Fisheries)

Hon. Deputy Speaker, it gives me great honour and privilege to speak on behalf of the Members of Parliament for Puttalam, about the late Minister and Member of Parliament who represented Chilaw and contested with your distinguished father, who also represented Chilaw, the famous "Jayaratnes" and the famous "Coreas". I would like to mention his background for it to go on record. The Hon. Harindra Jayantha Corea, Member of Parliament and Deputy Minster of Foreign Affairs, which was the last position he held, was a Barrister-at-Law (Inner Temple, United Kingdom), an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon and an Attorney-at-Law of Sri Lanka. He was born on 4th March, 1936. At the age of 73, he died. He was married to a well-educated, honourable lady who was the pillar of his success, Mrs. Rochelle Corea. They are blessed with one daughter. She is Harindrini. By now, she must be in the age of 15 or 16 years. He started his career in 1977 after returning from London. Immediately after he returned, within two months, he became a Member of Parliament of the Government in 1977 and he served till 1994. Thereafter, again he became a Member of Parliament in 1998. The ministerial portfolios he held were Deputy Minister of Public Administration, Acting Minister of Justice, Minister of State for Posts and Telecommunications, Minister of Telecommunications Development and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, which was the last. He was a Member of the following Committees during his Parliamentary career: the Select Committee on the Reform of the Constitution in 1978, the Committee on Public Enterprises from 1979 to 1986, the Committee on

Public Accounts, in which he was Chairman Designate in August 1994, the Select Committee on Ways and Means to Achieve Peace or the Mangala Moonesinghe Committee from 1990 to 1994, the Parliamentary Advisory Committees on Foreign Affairs, Finance and Justice, and the Sri Lankan-Korea Parliamentary Friendship Association, as Treasurer. He also participated as a member of the Sri Lankan delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva in 1984 and in New Delhi in 1993, as a member of the Sri Lankan delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in New York from October to December, 1980. He was also a special Cabinet emissary to seven countries to report on Sri Lankans employed in India, Pakistan, Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Oman from December, 1978 to January, 1979. He was also a member of the UNDP-sponsored Parliamentary delegation to the United Kingdom, France, the United States of America, Costa Rica, Japan, Thailand and Singapore in 1981. He was primarily educated at St. Thomas' College - Preparatory School in Gurutalawa, Bandarawela from 1942 to 1946. Then, he was educated at St. Pauls School, London from 1946 to 1955 and at the University College in Oxford from 1956 to 1959. He also authored publications : Freedom - What then Ceylon since Independence - 1947-1959, which was published in February, 1960. He was a Guest Columnist on Political and Economic Affairs of the "Ceylon Daily Mirror" from 1973 to 1975. He is the great son of Sir Claude Corea, KBE and Lady Corea. Sir Claude Corea was also a Member of the Ceylon State Council from 1931 to 1946. He also held several ministirial portfolios. Thereafter, he took up his career as a diplomat. 1977 . . 1977 2002 . . , . . , .

[. . 11.43] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is indeed my privilege to participate in the proceedings pertaining to the Vote of Condolence on the demise of the late Harindra Corea on behalf of our party, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, also known as the Tamil National Alliance.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have had the privilege of seeing and observing the late Hon. Harindra Corea at close quarters when I did have a brief stint in this august Assembly in 1994. Having come to know about him even prior to that, in fact I used to get delighted watching him in action on the Floor of this Assembly though they were very rare occasions, given the fact that I did have a brief stint at that time in this august Assembly. Hailing from the illustrious family of Coreas from Chilaw, known to us - the Tamils - as Chilapam, it was nothing but natural for the late Harindra Corea to enter politics in the footsteps of his uncle, the late Hon. Shirley Corea, from whose hands, I am very happy to say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I did have the privilege of receiving a gold medal as far back as 1969, having won an all-Island oratorical contest in Tamil. As far as we, the Tamils, are concerned, we used to have a very soft corner for the Coreas for the simple reason that both the Corea brothers, the late Victor and the late Claude, stood for parity when they were among the leading lives of the Ceylon National Congress. That was the time when, unfortunately, some well-read and well-known leaders of the Ceylon National Congress were starting to toe the line that was, in fact, in variation or rather in deviation of the noble principles for which the Ceylon National Congress was formed by leading members of all three communities in the early part of the last century. I remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, my mentor, I am very proud to say, the late V. Navaratnam, who represented the Kayts Electorate from 1963 to 1970, referring to the Corea brothers with so much of affection and sincerity, whenever I had the occasion to listen to him on the origin and the evolution of the national question of this country. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is not a surprise for anyone of us to have witnessed a totally non-communal and a national-minded politician in the political personality of the late Harindra Corea. He was a gentleman to the core; well-read and qualified as a lawyer who subsequently proved himself as an able legal practitioner. The late Harindra Corea, I should say, was one of those who in fact adorned this House in its history. I can, without any reluctance, state on record, Sir, that Chilaw and the people of Chilaw can always be proud of the fact that they had a representative of the calibre of the late Harindra Corea. This is an occasion, Sir, when the House pays its tribute to one who has left this world having been a Member of this Assembly. It is definitely not a ritual. When we speak on a personality like the late Harindra Corea, I should say that we give expression to our feelings and sentiments and in that we remember a noble soul, a gentleman par excellence, who, in the best traditions of his illustrious family, tried his best to serve the country without succumbing to matters based on the differences that have been in existence among the people of this country.

621 622

I am in fact happy to use this occasion to place on record the sincere gratitude that the Tamil-speaking people of this country owe to the Corea family of Chilaw; both Corea brothers - the late Victor and Claude, then the former Speaker of this august Assembly, the late Shirley Corea, another gentleman from that family who too, was totally non-communal and also a true Catholic and also the late Harindra Corea, who till his last, I would say, had his life true to the noble principles for which his uncle and also his forefathers stood with sincerity and commitment. Witnessing the proceedings of this august Assembly and also while participating in the proceedings of this august Assembly, there had been very many occasions when I was compelled to feel for the days when this Assembly was adorned by personalities who had all the qualities of leadership, who functioned every minute, both in and out of this House, bearing in mind that they did have the trust and confidence of the people. Unfortunately, Mr. Deputy Speaker, today, to say the least, all these things have unfortunately become matters of the past. But, yet we should not lose hope. I do believe that this august Assembly will live up to the expectations of our people. When I say "our people", I mean all the people of this country. The contributions of personalities like the late Hon. Harindra Corea will guide all of us to discharge our responsibilities with honesty, integrity and courage. Again, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to place on record the condolences of our people, the Tamil people, the Tamil-speaking people of this country and my Party, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi on the demise of one of the great sons of this country. I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . 1977 . 2000 . , . , , . . . , . .
