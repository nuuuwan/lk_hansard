( ) ( () . . - , , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade and Acting Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) Mr. Speaker, the Government is coming before Parliament this morning to seek approval for two Orders which have been made under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act. I am very happy, Mr. Speaker, to inform the House of the enormous interest that exists all over the world with regard to investment in Sri Lanka at the present time. I was in India during the last 24 hours and at the official residence of His Excellency Romesh Jayasinghe, our High Commissioner in Delhi, we had a very fruitful interaction with some of the largest companies in India. Thirty two of Indias largest companies enthusiastically accepted our invitation to engage with us in a dialogue.

Mr. Speaker, I was saying that 32 of Indias largest companies turned up on our invitation at the residence of Sri Lankas High Commissioner to India and they told us that they were very anxious to come to Sri Lanka at this time to take advantage of the unique opportunities that are available in the country with the advent of a durable

41 42

peace. The central point they made, Mr. Speaker, was that there is now political stability in India. The Manmohan Singh administration will last for the full period of five years. There is not a shadow of doubt about it. There is great euphoria and expectation about the development of Indias economy and across the water in Sri Lanka. They now find that the one impediment which prevented us from achieving Sri Lankas full economic potential has now been removed. That is what they were waiting for. They had always recognized the inherent strengths of Sri Lankas economy: our geographical location and the Free Trade Agreement with India, which enables other countries to make investments here and to secure duty-free entry into the markets of India. They are fully aware of the quality of our human resources. They were always very eager to learn details about our initiatives in respect of export promotion villages. They are fully aware of the mechanisms which we have put into place under the Board of Investment. But, the one thing that caused them to hesitate was the violence in the country. Now that, that has come to an end, there is today an atmosphere that is conducive to enhance trade and investment. The largest Indian companies have expressed their willingness, indeed their eagerness, to come to Sri Lanka at this time to take the fullest advantage of the unique vistas of opportunity that are opening up in our country today.

I would also like to tell you, Mr. Speaker, with great pride that in spite of the global economic meltdown, we have been successful in containing that situation, in mitigating the adverse consequences of that crisis. Certainly, it would not be realistic for any country to try to live in isolation; all countries are affected. But, as far as Sri Lankas economy is concerned, the impact has not been anywhere near what it is in countries which have had far stronger economies.

In order to establish that point, I would like to place before the House some relevant information. Actually, Mr. Speaker, in the first few months of the year 2009, in many sectors of our economy we have increased our foreign exchange earnings. In many sectors, it has not been simply a question of retaining the previous threshold of foreign exchange earnings - I admit that in some other sectors inevitably there has been a decline - but we have been able, as a result of the policies which we have constructed and put into place, to actually increase in very substantial measure the export earnings in several sectors of Sri Lankas economy. As examples, I would like to cite the following: the earnings from packeted tea and instant tea have recorded an increase of 12 per cent and 37 per cent respectively. Thirty seven per cent from instant tea! With the exception of desiccated coconut exports, all other kernel products have marked up by 102 per cent and coconut fibre exports have grown by 59 per cent. This is in spite of the very hostile, very difficult atmosphere that prevails throughout the world.

Mr. Speaker, the real strength of Sri Lankas economy has been the agricultural sector. The Api Wawamu-Rata Nagamu" programme has really been a success. The agricultural economy is growing by approximately 12 per cent. Among the minor agricultural products, Mr. Speaker, as far as coffee is concerned, there has been a growth of 182 per cent and we are very proud of that. The earnings from nutmeg and maize have increased by 3 per cent, cardamoms by 43 per cent, tobacco by 8 per cent and with regard to cut flowers and foliage, the increase is 31 per cent. Then, Mr. Speaker, there was great concern articulated on the Floor of this House with regard to the future of the apparel sector. The prophets of gloom announced that there was going to be a major crisis in this area, that GSP Plus was going to be taken away from Sri Lanka. Nothing of the sort has happened. There were prognostications of large-scale unemployment, people on the streets agitating about loss of employment. Nothing of the sort has happened, Mr. Speaker. On the contrary, the apparel sector is today more healthy than it was at the beginning of the year and the amount of foreign exchange they are earning, the robust contribution they are making to Sri Lankas economy is today one of the most conspicuous features of the current economic landscape. Now, Mr. Speaker, in the first quarter of 2009, total export earnings from apparel and garments have increased by 6 per cent. Actually I was looking at the March figure. When you compare March 2009 with March 2008, this is very surprising, but it is true, Mr. Speaker. The increase has been as much as 13 per cent from the apparel sector. I say this not in a spirit of partisanship, but I am sure that all Members of this House would derive great satisfaction from this achievement because Sri Lankas economy has been largely insulated from the repercussions of the global meltdown, and the point I wish to stress is that this has not been a mere matter of coincidence. It has not happened coincidently, but it is a result of policies which had been thought through carefully, which had been constructed and put into place in order to deal with the exigencies of the current situation. It is not only the apparel sector which has grown in this way. If you look at other categories of industrial exports - leather products - the increase has been 50 per cent in the first quarter of the year 2009. Mr. Speaker, this has happened because of the Governments ability to anticipate problems and to take suitable precautionary measures before the crisis was aggravated. There is a certain philosophy that underpins the Governments basic approach. We believe that whatever support we are giving needs to be given when companies are still alive and functioning. If we wait till they collapse, the amount of money that we would require to revive them would be much larger than it needs to be. The whole process of resuscitating these companies would be more painful; it would take longer. So, it is important not only to do the right thing, but to do the right thing at the right time. So, that is why we have acted promptly in order to ward off possible adverse consequences.

The incoming Indian Finance Minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, whose political career spans almost 40 years - the Indian press yesterday had photographs of Mr. Pranab Mukherjee with former Prime Minister of India, Shrimati Indira Gandhi in the early 1980s discussing his budget proposals - in a statement which he made soon after being sworn in as the Finance Minister in the new administration of Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, said that new situations call for new responses and his thinking on that matter was very similar to ours. He said that it is necessary to stimulate demand; there has to be an increase in government spending, of course selectively, in the areas where it is called for. Now, that is exactly the motivation underpinning the action taken by the Government to put certain incentives at the disposal of the private sector. The Stimulus Package is not a handout; it is not a giveaway. But, it has been very carefully structured and designed to enhance the competitiveness and the commercial viability of Sri Lankan companies under these excruciatingly difficult circumstances. Now, Mr. Speaker, I make bold to say that while there are many elements which comprise the explanation, the main reason why Sri Lankas apparel sector is today performing at the level it is when it is collapsing in many other countries around us, is that the apparel sector has been able to continue the commercial viability of their operations because of the support that the Government is giving through the mechanism of the Stimulus Package. The Stimulus Package has as its principal concern the safeguarding of employment in this country. That is our first and foremost concern. We want to protect employment. It is said that companies are closing down. Of course, companies close down; companies open. That is very much in the nature of things. But, if the apparel sector is actually able to enhance their earnings, then there must be a reason for that; and one of the reasons is the support that they are receiving from the Government in a nuanced and structured manner. Also, Mr. Speaker, there is great appreciation in the West about the ethical standards which prevail in Sri Lankas garment factories. We have no sweatshops; we have no child labour; we do not use prison labour in the garment factories. The quality of our apparel products has been recognized the world over and these are among the reasons why the apparel sector is doing Sri Lankas economy so proud at this time. For our own part, we are determined to give the private sector every support we can. Some of the larger companies like Brandix and MAS Holdings have won worldwide praise for meticulous adherence to the most exacting environmental standards. Sir Stuart Rose, the present Head of Marks and Spencer visited Sri Lanka. I was present with him on two occasions: once when he visited the Brandix Factory at Seeduwa and also when he visited the MAS Holdings Factory in Tulhiriya. There, he said that he would have no hesitation in asking the biggest apparel companies in the United Kingdom to come to Sri Lanka to learn from Sri Lankan entrepreneurs. He said he is not shy to say

that. He said he will publicly say that the largest companies in the United Kingdom have a great deal to learn from Sri Lankan entrepreneurship. So, what is required, Mr. Speaker, under those circumstances is a symbiotic relationship between the Government and the private sector and that is exactly what we have accomplished in abundant measure. Now, I would like to give you some indication of the Governments thinking with regard to this matter. What we have done is, we have identified the strongest areas of Sri Lankas economy. We have identified what are called thrust industries. The Governments definition, Mr. Speaker, of a "thrust industry" is an industry which has the potential to be developed up to the threshold of US Dollars one billion a year, foreign exchange earnings to the level of US Dollars one billion. At the moment, there are only two industries which qualify in terms of that criteria: the apparel sector which, last year, brought in US Dollars 3.1 billion and the tea industry which brought in approximately US Dollars 1.2 billion. But, there are several other sectors in this country which are capable of being developed up to that level. For example, rubber, which is now at the level of US Dollars 750 million, gems and jewellery at the level of US Dollars 450 million and the IT sector at approximately US Dollars 215 million. Now, Mr. Speaker, what have we done? Take the ceramic sector. We are very proud of the performance of our companies: Noritake, Royal Fernwood and Dankotuwa Porcelain. Their products satisfy the highest standards in the world. But, because of the global meltdown for no fault of theirs, orders were drying up and that was naturally affecting their commercial viability. The Government took stock of that situation and decided on a variety of measures which were certainly successful in breathing new life, vitality and energy into those sectors. The ceramic sector is energy intensive. We, therefore, concentrated on reducing the price of diesel, furnace oil and so on. The ceramic sector also had an agreement with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, in terms of which they were allowed to sell 20 per cent of what they produced in the local market. At that time they did not make use of that concession because they did not need to. Servicing foreign orders was much more lucrative. But, now in the transform situation, because foreign orders are not forthcoming in the same way, they made a request to the Government of Sri Lanka to consider enhancing the threshold from 20 to 30 per cent for allowing them to sell their products in the Sri Lankan local market. I have had discussions on that subject with the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, who is in charge of the Board of Investment and we are prepared to make that concession. Then, as far as the spices sector is concerned, Mr. Speaker, there has been tremendous development in the spices sector. I do not know whether the Hon. Members of the House are aware that Sri Lanka produces 80 per

45 46

cent of the world's cinnamon and it is high quality cinnamon. We are doing a lot with regard to the infusion of technology. As far as the spices sector is concerned, we have embarked upon an ambitious programme for branding. Just as much as Ceylon tea is known the world over, we want to produce a certain consciousness in the world at large with regard to the quality of Sri Lankan cinnamon and branding is an exercise that we have embarked upon incurring very considerable expenditure for a good purpose. Then, there has also been very healthy development in respect of the gems and jewellery sector. But, there have been certain problems with regard to obtaining credit from the banks. We have therefore sent for representatives of all commercial banks and they have been very co-operative in their attitude; the money, the financial resources which are required for the development of the gems and jewellery sector, particularly the branding concept in respect of the Sri Lankan sapphire, which is known the world over for its depth, its value and its lustre. So, in all these areas, whether it is gems and jewellery or spices or apparel or ceramics, we have identified the particular problems and the Government has stepped in, in a big way, in an interventionist manner, in a discriminating way to address those problems in a pragmatic spirit and that is the reason why, Mr. Speaker, these industries are performing at this level when all around us, the most powerful economies which have prospered for so long are collapsing, Sri Lanka is setting a different trend altogether. The two Orders which the House is considering today, are to do with cess. There is a reason for the imposition of this cess. At a time like this, we have an undoubted obligation to protect the local industry. This is not to say that we discourage competition. We are interested in protecting the consumer. But, there are times when extraordinary measures are necessary to protect a vulnerable local sector. So, that is why, Mr. Speaker, we have imposed this cess in order to control goods that are coming into this country. It is a measure of protection that is required by the local industry, that is certainly required if we are to protect employment in this country. So, as far as that aspect to the matter is concerned, what I would like to say by way of summary is that the Government wishes to take advantage of the opportunity that is now available throughout the Island. His Excellency the President in his recent speeches has made it clear that this is not just a time for exultation and jubilation. It is also a time of unique opportunity. We have successfully confronted one challenge and we are now responding in earnest to another challenge which is equally daunting and that is a challenge of economic development and social advancement for all the people who inhabit this country. There are vast acres, thousands of acres which are being opened up in particular in the Eastern Province. There are companies that are coming

here; the Indian companies spoke to me, they were with me for a long time after the formal proceedings were over. His Excellency, the High Commissioner Romesh Jayasinghe was present and Ambassador Peter Burleigh of the United States who served two terms in Sri Lanka was also present on that occasion and he made it clear to me that American companies are very enthusiastic to take advantage of this opportunity. Ambassador Peter Burleigh who had a very distinguished career in the Security Council of the United Nations and who was at an earlier time the Ambassador of the United States in Sri Lanka.

So what we are doing is, these companies are coming to us. Now, Mr. Speaker, over the weekend we had an International Ayurveda Exhibition, an international exhibition which stimulated a very high degree of interest all over the world - people came here. Now, in the West, in countries like Germany and Japan, people are moving away from allopathic medicine; they do not want to use antibiotics, they want to get closer to nature. Companies like Siddhalepa, a four-generation company, Mr. Samantha Kumarasinghes Nature's Secrets; they have told us that they can cater to the worldwide demand for these herbal products if land is made available to them. Now, in the Mahaweli Systems in those areas, the lands that are being opened up as a result of the cessation of hostilities, can now be made available to the private sector - not selling, the Government is not prepared to sell land, but on a lease, which is structured on reasonable terms.

Then, Mr. Speaker, the Northern waters - Trincomalee, Mannar and so on - fisheries in that area have been neglected for so long. There are Indian companies; there are American companies that are prepared to come in and take advantage of the immense fisheries resources which are now available for commercial exploitation.

Then, take tourism; the beaches of Arugam Bay, Pasikuda and so on. Sri Lanka is interested not in the run-of-the-mill tourism, but in specialized tourism, eco-tourism; the Sinharaja Forest for example. Then, take religious tourism. We are one of the few countries where Theravada Buddhism still is practised and there are many tourists who are prepared to come here to make a deep study of the doctrine and the practices of Theravada Buddhism. Take health tourism. I have myself seen in hotels up and down the country, German tourists who come every year to benefit from Ayurvedic treatments in the potency of which they have great confidence.

So, all these opportunities are now available. The Government is particularly keen on stimulating this small and medium sector in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and indeed all over the country. These are people whose lives have been ravaged by 20 years of armed conflict. The undoubted obligation of the Government at this

[ . . ]

2009 26 47 48

moment, our undisputed priority is to enable them to rebuild their lives and their livelihoods and we are doing this in partnership with the private sector. Companies like Hayleys is already very active in agricultural pursuits in that part of the country. USAID is spending a great deal of money on programmes which are connected with vocational training and skills development. So, Mr. Speaker, we make this appeal to all Members of Parliament irrespective of political affiliation to join with the Government in this exciting endeavour as we stand on the threshold of new opportunities. Then, Mr. Speaker, I would like now to address some of the matters that were raised by the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the question that he posed to me on the last occasion. Now, the situation as I see it, is the following. Sri Lankas Constitution and statute law makes provision for certain funds. Article 148 of Sri Lankas Constitution enshrines the sacrosanct principle relating to Parliament's control of public finance; that is Article 148 of the Constitution. Article 149 deals with the establishment of the Consolidated Fund. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, there are two principal funds concerned with Sri Lankas public finance. One is the Consolidated Fund; the other is the Contingencies Fund. But, apart from that our countrys statute laws make it possible for separate funds to be established under the aegis of different pieces of legislature. One of them is the Export Development Board. The Export Development Board Act in Section 13 authorizes the establishment of a fund for purposes exclusively connected with the Export Development Board. Now, monies coming from certain sources are channelled into the Export Development Board fund in terms of Article 13 of the relevant law. Now, what has happened last year is that the budgetary allocation to the Export Development Board was Rs. 741 million. But, much more money was required for work connected with exports. Rupees 741 million was the formal allocation to the Export Development Board, but, there was a sharp focus on activities connected with exports. Some of the information that I made available to the House just now shows how vital exports are to the well-being of Sri Lankas economy. That is why I told my Friend, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, that it is useful to consider these matters together without doing one in isolation of the other. There is no doubt if the Sri Lankan economy is performing well; if we are not affected as much as we might have been, one of the major elements of that explanation is the robust performance of the export economy. That has not just happened. It has happened because of conscious policy. Now, we require money to do these things properly. Money is not the only thing; there are many other requirements, but there has to be financial provision. So, Rs. 741 million was not sufficient.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, there were other allocations which were made for this purpose. Rupees 1,000 million was given to the Export Development Board for promotional activities. Apart from that, Rs. 500 million was made available for the promotion of the export promotion villages with a particular focus on agriculture. This is necessary to ensure equitable distribution of the countrys resources. The Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake is aware that our per capita income is now fast approaching the threshold of US Dollars 2,000. We are very proud of that. Apart from the Maldives, we have the highest per capita income in this region. You cannot consider Maldives as there are only 325,000 people. Now, we are trying to distribute this income in a more equitable manner. That is why we are concentrating on these export promotion villages like Bingiriya. Bingiriya is cut flowers and foliage. Tambuttegama, vegetables and fruits. Now for these, apart from the budgetary allocations to the Export Development Board, there have been other allocations. Now, Mr. Speaker, I explained to the House the importance of the Stimulus Package. If you take away the Stimulus Package, I am certain that the foundation of the performance of Sri Lankas exports today will be seriously eroded. So, the Stimulus Package is a vital component of the Governments economic strategy. Now, the Stimulus Package, Mr. Speaker, as far as the Export Development Board is concerned, is worth Rs. 8,000 million. So, those are special requirements which are being catered for. In those circumstances, I do not see anything wrong with money coming into the cess being credited to the Consolidated Fund because we are still operating entirely within the purview of the fundamental principle that is contained in Article 148 of Sri Lankas Constitution which enshrines in a very explicit way Parliaments control over public finance because we cannot depend only on what comes into the Export Development Board funds.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are meeting for the first time after His Excellency the President addressed Parliament following the remarkable success he, as the Commander-in-Chief, had in the war in this country. It is incumbent upon me as the Leader of the Sri

69 70

[ ]

Lanka Muslim Congress, a principal party representing an important community in this country, to congratulate His Excellency the President as the Commander-in-Chief, the three Service Commanders, the IGP, and the Secretary of Defence, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for the unprecedented success they have achieved in wiping out terrorism from this country. The Muslims in this country have all the more reason to rejoice at the prospect of an end to the war in this country since they have suffered immensely for past several decades. I must therefore, also, sound a word of caution. The Hon. G.L. Peiris as a legal luminary will know, Polybius, the Greek Historian who is known for his ideas of political balance in the government which was later used in Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws and the drafting of the United States Constitution, once said, I quote: Those who know how to win are much more numerous than those who know how to make proper use of their victories. Sir, it is easy to get carried away by this euphoria and lose sight of what needs to be done to sustain the momentum. I earnestly appeal to all my Colleagues in this House to harness their abilities, patience and tolerance to make our Motherland a truly united country. We, the Muslims pledge our wholehearted support to any honourable move forward based on mutual respect and understanding. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I now come to the point which was raised by the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena about the request made by the Opposition regarding the removal of the Emergency Regulations in this country. It is true enough, given the post-war situation, there may be certain imperative regulations that may have had to be retained in the short term. We are to debate the extension of the state of Emergency on the 9th of next month, but of course, as a responsible Opposition Party, we do expect the Government to create the conditions of normalcy. The Government must proceed to look at the whole plethora of Emergency Regulations that are presently in existence and see which of those things may be unnecessary in the present context and in a gradual process are the burdens that have been brought about on to the civilian population in this country. Speaking about another matter - to transgress a little away from the subject matter that has been listed for debate today - is the issue concerning creating conditions of normalcy to conduct elections. We quite welcome the Governments decision to conduct elections in two specific local authorities in the Northern Province as a pilot project so that civilian administration can be restored in the North. I brought this subject up before His Excellency the President when he summoned the parties in the Opposition to explain the humanitarian crisis that then existed in the No-Fire Zone and said that it is

imperative to consider bringing in some amendments to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to permit displaced voters to vote from their present places of domicile. Now, I am specifically referring to the Muslims who have been displaced from areas such as the Jaffna Municipal Council way back in 1990. It is no secret that one of the atrocious things the LTTE committed was to drive away the unarmed innocent Muslim civilians entirely - it was an ethnic cleansing - from the Northern Province way back in October 1990. They have been languishing as refugees in refugee camps almost for last 20 years. So, their right to vote in the impending elections is a matter of absolute importance. That is why I asked His Excellency the President to consider bringing in some amendment as an urgent Bill in the national interest to facilitate these displaced voters to vote at the Jaffna Municipal Council Elections. I think it is an important step that the Government must consider and in fact I brought it to the notice of the Leader of the House of Parliament and the Chief Government Whip this morning when the Party Leaders met. They have agreed to consider it earnestly and I would propose to meet the Elections Commissioner this afternoon to look at the modalities as to how this could be implemented in the short term. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I must also say that now it is time for us to look at a national effort to solve the countrys economic problems. We all know the country is facing a serious crisis on balance of payments. That is why the Government has requested for an IMF stand-by facility of US Dollars 1.9 billion. In this regard, we are also in a very unique position where the Central Bank has depleted the reserves to prevent the depreciation of the rupee in order to protect the debt obligations of the Government and where State agencies are intervening in order to protect the exporters; they are now trying to prevent the appreciation of rupee. In this situation, it is important for the Government to take the Opposition into confidence and make a collective plea to the International Monetary Fund because I see that there is an inordinate delay in releasing the stand-by facility. This is unprecedented and I saw a report made by the IMF. They are forever saying that they are at an advanced stage of negotiations with the Government. So a combined effort could be made in this post-war scenario, that we, the collective Opposition as well as the Government make an appeal that they do not delay the granting of this much-needed stand-by facility to tide over the balance of payments crisis that we are facing. We have been told that our foreign reserves have come down to almost US Dollars 800 million from about US Dollars 4.2 billion which existed in the third quarter of last year. It is indeed a perilous situation and therefore I believe that we must make a collective appeal and look at how to get over this impending crisis. This is not a matter for the Government alone; the Opposition should also get involved. I know my time is up, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees. So, while making this appeal, I would also request the Government to please consider this specific

2009 26 71 72

issue of introducing some amendment to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to facilitate the displaced voters to vote in the impending Local Government Elections for the Jaffna Municipal Council and the Vavuniya Urban Council. Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . . 12.00 , .

Hon. Presiding Member, I take this opportunity to say a few words on the Order under the University of Vocational Technology Act because I have been following this Act and also made contributions at the last occasion.

2009 26 87 88

What I find is that, after almost 106 years of having started vocational education in this country, we have now a multitude of organizations which are involved in vocational education and what is sad about it is that all these institutions have become competing organizations than complementing organizations. We basically started in 1893 with the Government Technical College and now we have VTAs, NIBMs, NAITAs and the technical colleges and we find that each one of these, which have grown, have become competing organizations than complementing organizations. So, what we need to do is to relook at the syllabuses of these organizations, the need of the country, the need of the world and reorganize the syllabuses so that these organizations complement each other and not compete. We know that in this country the biggest problem we have is the dearth of qualified instructors. Most of these organizations do not have competent instructors. So, unless we get them to complement each other and share their resources, we will find that we have buildings all over the country, but no competent instructors to carry out the courses and train our youths to take on the challenges of this world. I have two institutions in my village: a VTA centre and a technical college. Both do not have enough instructors and I am told that the principal of the VTA centre, opened just a few months ago, is retiring next month. If we allow this to happen, we will find that the whole organization would collapse because it is an organization that has no funds and is just starting off. So, we need to see that there is continuation of service, that these organizations are funded enough and they become complementing organizations and not competing organizations so that they serve the purpose they have been brought up for. Diverging from the subject, I now get on to the topic that has taken precedence in this House today: the current situation in this country. We know, unlike ever in the past, that we have today a situation where the whole country is rejoicing at the end of a war. I am on record as someone who is against war, but I have also maintained that force has to be met with force. I am relieved that we have now come to the end of the war. But, I must remind this House that the end of the war does not mean the end of the problem. Because, if we go back into the history of this country, King Dutugemunus first attempt at invading the North was put down by his father and when he got the opportunity to invade and conquer Elara, a Tamil king, he did not rejoice. Though I would not compare Elara to Prabhakaran, I must say that King Dutugemunu did not rejoice. Because it is on record as, Looking back upon his glorious victory, great though it was, he knew no joy remembering that thereby was wrought the destruction of thousands of both enemies and his soldiers. This is attested to by the sheer number of religious foundations attributed to him by the chronicles. So, we know what happened in history and we now compare our present President with King Dutugemunu. In fact, he has been bestowed the title Vishvakeerthi Sri

Threesinhaladhishwara that was never bestowed on any ruler in this country. But, I would like at this moment to state that Mahatma Gandhi is attributed as suggesting that "attempting to sustain truth without humility is doomed to cause it to become instead an 'arrogant caricature' of truth". I would also like to quote Winston Churchill, who is famously quoted as saying, In war: resolution. In defeat : defiance. Both qualities that were exhibited by His Excellency during the war; in war : resolution and in defeat : defiance. Now in victory we need magnanimity. Magnanimity is the need of the day and in peace : goodwill, because although Churchill won the war he lost the next general election. We do not want that to happen in this country. We want to have a strong leader who can take this country to the next phase of peace. But how do we ensure that the people look at him as the leader who can take us to peace? This is where magnanimity comes into play because when Aristotle coined these words he said, This is the suitable virtue of a great man, arising from his other virtues. Right now one form of magnanimity is the generosity of the victor to the defeated. This is what is important today, that we have to be magnanimous in everything that we do from now onwards. We have to be able to serve the defeated, the downtrodden Tamil people more than they expected from Prabhakaran. If Prabhakaran promised them Eelam, they have nothing now. In this moment, it is the duty of every elected representative of this House to support His Excellency the President in fulfilling what he has declared in this House and outside. When we liberated the East, we spoke about that four Ds. We do not talk about it anymore. Now we speak about equality in this country. That is a very difficult thing to implement knowing the divisions we have. But, it has to be done, because if we do not do that we are doomed. I was very happy when I read an interview given by the Presidents son, Namal, because I read somewhere in that interview that the well-known German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche had said, What was silent in the father speaks in the son, and often I found in the son the unveilled secret of the father. The son is on record saying, I think, we need first to win the hearts and minds of the Tamil people who live in Sri Lanka and resettle the IDPs as soon as possible and give their lives back to them. Then I am sure, the international diaspora will understand". Those words coming from a Thomian, I am sure he means that, and I am sure that is what he vouches for the conduct of his father or what his father's thinking is. Now we need to basically look beyond us and since I have very limited time I will table* three articles which appeared in the Sri Lanka Guardian website titled, "Walk

the Extra Mile by N. Sathiamoorthy, Presidents son for 13th amendment an interview by Nilantha Illangamuwa and Ten days that Shook Sri Lanka by Sumanasiri Liyanage, for inclusion in Hansard. I will fail in my duty as a Sri Lankan if I do not warn the international community of its hypocrisy towards this country. We all know that it was the West that supported the LTTE at its prime. We know that and we know that the West changed its stance after the 9/11 attack when they got hit by a terrorist organization. Now, having helped this Government to defeat terrorism - I place it on record - now they talk of war crimes and everything. They are hypocrites. We know what they are doing all over the world. We as elected Members of this House should never allow foreign powers to intervene in our country. I, as an elected Member of Parliament from the Digamadulla District representing the minorities, assure His Excellency that we will stand with the Government in denouncing the hypocrisy of the West. Thank you. : : Documents tabled : Walk the Extra Mile Sunday, May 24, 2009 By N. Sathiya Moorthy (May 25, Chennai, Sri Lanka Guardian) The war is over, long live peace. With President Mahinda Rajapaksa declaring the victorious conclusion of the war on terror in Sri Lanka, it is time the Government redeemed its oft-reiterated pledge to usher in peace and power devolution alongside. In doing so, they need to walk the extra mile that would make the Tamil population feel comfortable and wanted in a nation where they suspicious and doubtful, and not without reason. President Rajapaksa has begun well. He told Parliament that it was his duty now to protect the Tamils and meet their political aspirations. He has promised a home-grown solution in this regard - which is what it should be. To work on the ground, such a solution should however carry conviction with the Tamil population. It was in the absence of such an effort that the Tamils had to look elsewhere, and sought and obtained external facilitation.

The Governments task is cut out. As President Rajapaksa has outlined at the conclusion of the war in the East, demilitarization, democracy, development and devolution are the Four Ds that should help the Sri Lankan nation to re-integrate the Tamil people without side-stepping them or seeking to absorb them into ways that they did not seek. This is as much necessary as devolution of political power, but the latter too in ways that they understand and by means that they can touch, feel and enjoy. There cannot be any prioritization in the implementation of the Four Ds They have to move together if the Government has to deliver - and also has to be seen as doing so. If democracy is a means to an end - that it devolution - so is de-militarization a means to demonstrate that democracy is safe and sound, and does not flow any more from the barrel of the gun. Independent of which of the political parties decide to contest the local government and Provincial Council elections in the North that President Rajapaksa had promised even before the war actually ended, the Government has to ensure that they are as free and fair as the democratic world has known them to be. De-militarization, for instance, is an area where the average Tamil could be made to feel less threatened than he might have been earlier. It does not have to mean that all military installations, old and new, have to

be wound up. Independent of insurgencies of the LTTE kind, every nation has had military camps and Air Force installations across Provinces and regions, to meet daily demands and logistical requirements. In doing so, the Government could also evaluate the man-troops ratio under the new circumstances, and find productive but non-intrusive ways of redeploying them. Various UN agencies could be of help. Involved in the process of demilitarization is also the need for greater humanization of the police force which, after a break, was designated an adjunct of the Defence Ministry after President Rajapaksa assumed office. He can thus initiate the normalization process by transferring the police administration back to be Interior Ministry, where it anyway belonged. It may only be a gesture - but that gesture could also be a beginning. In a way, this would also facilitate speedier transfer of Police powers to the Provinces, as promised under the Thirteenth Amendment. With the Sri Lankan Government reiterating its resolve on the Thirteenth Amendment and indicating a fresh look at the process at talks with a visiting team from the Indian neighbour, one can now hope to see pro-active measures on the ground in the coming days and weeks. The Indian team was followed a day later by UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon,. Both have reiterated their pledge to help restore the lives that had been lost to the Tamils in the country for decades now. Other nations are also in the queue, though their concerns and priorities may be different - and hence may have to be differentiated. That President Rajapaksa clearly indicated the desirability of home grown solution without outside interference should not be lost. There are ways in which the Sri Lankan society can facilitate the normalization process. Much of the mutual suspicions between the Tamils and the Sinhalese on the one hand, and the Tamils and the Muslims on the other, flowed from inter-personal relations, where separate identities got the better of the common national identity. It is sad that in this hour of national reconciliation, certain Ministers should continue to harp on ethnic divisions and military defeats that are centuries old. With the name of the religion getting muddied in the post-Independence conflict, the prelates may now consider revisiting the issues and redrawing the lines that divide the individual and the Stateif only to help re-harmonize inter-identity relations, to suit a modern democracy that Sri Lanka has been. The civil society has a role to play in this. The Tamils have been hurt, yes, but they too may need to introspect as to where and how their earlier generations might have faltered, in pushing the Sinhala majority to a corner from where they could only hit back with the kind of ferocity that did not belong to their religion. Separation is not the answer as individual societies in Sri Lanka, as elsewhere, are driven with divisions and contradictions. There will thus be no knowing where one would end and another begin, if one went deeper. The North-East divide, independent of the de-merger, is not an exception. It is rather the rule. -Sri Lanka Guardain Presidents son for 13th amendment Sunday May 24, 2009 AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW I think we first need to win the hearts and minds of the Tamil people who live in Sri Lanka and resettle the IDPs as soon as possible and give their lives back to them. Then Im sure the international Diaspora will understand. By Nilantha Ilangamuwa (May 25, Colombo, Sri Lanka Guardian) I deem it a rare and unique meeting when I met with Namal Rajapaksa, son of the President Mahinda Rajapaksa on the present situation in the Island Nation after the historical win against the Tamil Tiger terrorists who are seeking separatism. His voice is very clear and understandable. My father always believed that a person should fight the fight that should be fought but not the fight that person can win, Namal said.

According to Namal He (the President) always believed and still strongly believes that there should be a political solution or in other words there should be equality among all communities in Sri Lanka and that there is no place for any form of discrimination. Speaking to Sri Lanka Guardian, Namal Rajapaksa said, First of all we should resettle the people who have been liberated from the LTTE, and give them new hope of life, give them vocational training, educate the younger generation and give them equal opportunity as any Sri Lankan would have, then we can talk about political developments such as the 13the Amendment. I was pleasantly surprised to have met this young person who has an excellent grasp of things our country needs most. I found in Namal something unique as we interacted on many issues pertinent to peace and harmony of the country. He is certainly a different person than most of those I met in the recent times. Here are the excerpts from our discussion : Let me first know about you academic standing ? I will be completing my Final Year in LLB in few weeks time. According to a well known philosopher in Germany, Mr. Frindrich Nietzsche, what was silent in the father speaks in the son, and often I found in the son the unveiled secret of the father. So, I think you are the person who knows very well about your father. He is a patriotic leader who has eliminated the most wanted ruthless terrorist organization in modern world. I would be happy if you can clarify the thoughts and vision of your father that paved way for victory ? My father always believed that a person should fight the fight that should be fought but not the fight that person can win. He has proved it during the early 80s and early 90s when he was one of the few people who stood up for Human Rights at a time no one spoke about it. Now he has proved it again by defeating the most ruthless terrorist organization in Sri Lanka and bringing the country under one Flag and one jurisdiction which was believed impossible by the majority. He always believed and still strongly believes that there should be a political solution or in other words there should be equality among all communities in Sri Lanka and that there is no place for any from of discrimination. The LTTE stood between Sri Lanka and its development as a nation and thus it had to be defeated militarily. Here in Sri Lanka, mission has been accomplished against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. What is your opinion on these developments ? Yes the Mission is accomplished against the LTTE or Terrorism but there is a possibility of ad-hoc incidents taking place for sometime as we can see from other examples such as NI with IRA. However, I strongly believe that there wont be any LTTE activities in an organized form. And now it is our duty as the youth and as Sri Lankans to look towards the future and work towards the development of our nation. Some people criticize the government saying that it wields family power and they claim that anyone called Rajapaksa can take high ranks in the Government. How do you respond to these allegations, as a son of the President? Well there are few members of Rajapaksa family who are actively involved in my fathers administration, but I firmly believe that all of them deserve their positions and are suitable for their respective designations as proved by them. It can also be said that the Presidential Secretariat has become a friendlier place than ever before and has opened its doors to young active Sri Lankans to take part in His Excellencys administration. How do you read the so-called ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka? Well if there is an Ethnic crisis, I think it is more of a politically motivated crisis than an actual ethnic problem. However it is imperative that we address the issues faced by the Tamil people in Sri Lanka. We

all know that there is a gap between the two communities because of the LTTE and it is up to the Government and as Sri Lankans we all should work together to build a bridge between the two communities. What are the options do you think available to achieve a sustainable solution for this problem, after the elimination the Tamil Tigers? First of all we should resettle this people who are liberated from the LTTE and give them new hope of life, give them vocational training, educate the younger generation and give them equal opportunity as any Sir Lankan would have, then we can talk about political developments such as the 13th Amendment. But the most important thing is to resettle them and get them back to normal life. You are a leader of volunteer organization, which is focused on Sri Lankan youth. What is the vision behind setting up such an organization and what are your achievements so far? And please let me know about your future plans for youth empowerment in Sri Lanka? Well we first started as a sports Organization. We are still actively involved in developing sports in Sri Lanka, especially in the rural areas. We are even building a swimming pool in Jaffna which should be completed in matter of few months. The Tharunyata Hetak youth organization is committed to unite, develop and nurture the youth of Sri Lanka together in the name of peace. The Tharunyata Hetak youth organization works towards creating bonds between the youth of Sri Lanka with mutual understanding, national patriotism and development highlighting significant qualities of goodwill, friendship and harmony. Carving a peaceful environment among the youth of Sri Lanka regardless of political geographical location, economic differences, religion or race is the motto of this enlightening youth association. All youth from different ethnicities encompassing Sinhala, Tamil, Burgher, Muslim, Malay, Borah, and other races and religions will help towards the goal of bringing peace not only to the youth but for the whole country. The youth of today are the lifeblood of this country and we must make sure that we keep their interests at heart. Sympathy surrounds Sri Lankas poignant history that has taken a number of young lives. Hence we are dedicated to learn from our countrys grave mistakes by ensuring that youth are not needlessly wasted for unintelligible acts of suffering and rebellion. We hope to instill faith and hope in the hearts and the minds of the youth of Sri Lanka, the future generation that will take our country forward. When you talk about projects we have small projects going on almost every other day. At this moment we are doing a project to collect drinking water for our brothers and sisters who have been liberated. At the same time we are conducting Grade 5 seminars Island wide. Generally youth in Sri Lanka keep away from politics as they are said to be more concerned about things which are based on enjoying life. So.... in this context, what is the future direction for Sri Lanka? Well generally the urban youth keeps away from politics or getting involved in politics actively unlike the youth who come from Villages or rural areas. I think the reason for this is that more rural youth are dependent on politicians for their future, especially when getting jobs. This should be changed and I think it should be more independent and jobs should be given on educational and vocational training or experience more than a political background. But things are different with urban youth who are more independent and have more opportunities when it comes to their future. This is what we are trying to change via our youth organization to make rural youth more independent and give them similar opportunities that are open to urban youth. Are you planning to become the President of Sri Lanka one day? I dont think anyone can plan to be a President because a President is democratically elected and at the moment my plan is to be a good citizen and to work towards the development of my country.

Do you think the political system and the electoral system in Sri Lanka must change?

We there is nothing wrong with the political system in my country other than the fact that we need young educated people who love their country coming into politics. There should be some changes made to the electoral system as we have experienced in the past as with the present system there is no majority government in place and there might be discrimination on the basis of preferential voting.

Let me know your views on Sri Lankas foreign policy and international relations and the power of our Diaspora?

I think the government is very clear about our foreign policies and is straight forward as any other country and since 2005 we have developed good relationships with regional countries such as India, Pakistan, China, Nepal and the Maldives. We have also been able to maintain good relations with countries like Iran, Libya, Turkey, Israel and Russia and we have always been friends with Palestine. Even the West has always been good with Sri Lanka.

When you talk about our Diaspora I think we have a very strong international Diaspora, especially in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. Our Diaspora is powerful as long as they stay together and work together as one. I think we have still not got what we should be getting from these people who live abroad even though we get some sort of support.

How can Sri Lanka address the issues of pro - LTTE Diaspora and change their stances after the war?

Well I think we first need to win the hearts and minds of the Tamil people who live in Sri Lanka and resettle the IDPs as soon as possible and give their lives back to them. Then Im sure the international Diaspora will understand. At the moment they are under the wrong impression about Sinhala people because most of the Tamil people left Sri Lanka in the early 80s and 90s and they dont know anything about Sri Lanka other than killing and suffering of Tamil people and most of the second generation Tamil youth dont even speak Tamil and they go along with their parents and pro LTTE media so I believe with proper development and at the same time educated Tamil representatives in politics will change their perspective.

What are your plans for future?

Well Im just about to finish my first degree and I want to do my masters degree. I also plan to develop our youth organization further.

What is your message to our Tamil - speaking Sri Lankan brotherly citizens, some of who are concerned/upset about the latest battlefield developments?

We all are Sri Lankans and I believe there should not be any discrimination on the basis of caste, religion or the language you speak. As our President stated there is no minority anymore. We are all Sri Lankans who love our nation..... And, yes, we Will rebuild the nation and we will rebuild the lives of our Tamil and Muslim brothers and sisters in the North. I would like to invite all Sri Lankans to join this cause as the government cannot do it alone. We as citizens and especially the younger generation should get together and hold hands to develop our nation.

It is important to have peace within the communities otherwise there is no point of having any political solution.

Do you think it is good for all Sri Lankan schoolchildren to learn all 3 languages.. Sinhala, Tamil and English. from primary school? Yes. I strongly believe that we all should learn all languages. I regret for not learning Tamil when I was schooling even thought now Im working on studying Tamil. It is important to know all 3 languages.

Ten days that Shook Sri Lanka Tuesday, May 12, 2009 By Sumanasiri Liyange (May 13, Colombo, Sri Lanka Guardian) Since the dawn of April 20, 2009 events that have unfurled in Sri Lanka. particularly in the context of ethno-political conflict are of great importance because they not only reveal the extreme human suffering caused by internal armed conflicts but also raise theoretical and practical issues related to an unfinished state-building project in a small post-colonial country. Sri Lanka is a microcosm that helps understand how the big and the powerful who often treat the rest of the world as their backyard operate in current global setting and how a small post-colonial country can use the new space created by the same process of globalization in reducing the impact of the pressures of the powerful global actors. Sri Lanka would also be an interesting case study showing how and to what extent a small pluri-national society could develop an accommodative governing structure ensuring parity of participation for its peoples not only as individuals but also as groups and communities. This article attempts to examine events of the last ten days of April 2009 in Sri Lanka focusing primarily on military operations of the Sri Lankan security forces, massive inflow of civilians to government-controlled areas, the politics of Tamil Nadu on the eve of State and General elections, response of Indian Union Government and the international community. The article begin by narrating the main events as they have unfolded in Sri Lanka in the last ten days of April 2009. The issues and challenges reinforced by the events are the subject of Section 2 . Measures to deal with those issues and challenges briefly outlined in the Section 3. Narrating the Episode At the dawn of April 20, the 53rd and 58 th divisions of Sri Lanka Army broke the earth embankment built by the Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) creating a space for trapped civilians to flee the so-called no-fire zone. the last patch of Sri Lanka under LTTE control, and enter into government controlled area. By Thursday April 25 around, 109, 000 people from palammaathalan, Ambalavanpokkanai and Puthumaathalan had been freed from what was in reality an open prison of the LTTE Even French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner who visited Sri Lanka had to admit that the civilians. Sri Lankan government refused to buy that argument and continued its own operations of freeing trapped civilians are hostages of the LTTE. The response of the international community was mixed. USA. Canada and some countries of the EU continued to insist that contending parties should agree to a permanent or protonged ceasefire. Their argument has been that a ceasefire. notwithstanding failure of the governments decision to stop military action for two days to mark the Tamil and Sinhala New year, would help in release of civilians Sri Lankan government refused to buy that argument and continued its own operations of freeing trapped civilians and of capturing the LTTE leadership. Attempts by countries of Global North to raise the issue at the UN Security Council were thwarted by a possible veto by China and Russia. The firm policy of the Sri Lankan Government based on the understanding that there is no uniform international community angered the countries of Global North. According to Reuters. US has advised the executive body of IMF to delay processing the Sri Lankan request for $1.9 billion SDR facility (SDR is an international reserve asset. created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the existing official reserves of member countries) to ease the Sri Lankan balance to payment problem. Mohomad Qadaffi announced that Libya would release the promised $500 million grant to Sri Lanka immediately. In the meantime, Co-Chairs (USA, Norway, EU and Japan) issued a statement calling for a ceasefire and suggested that LTTE leadership be given a chance to submit themselves to a third-country. Interestingly, none of the co-chair countries have expressed their willingness to accept them if the Sri Lankan government would go with their suggestion making the option and incomplete one. Paradoxically, in Colombo, both Bernard Kouchner and British Foreign Secretary David Millband stressed that their governments do not seek to save Prabahakaran-leader of the LTTE. The pre-election heat in Tamil Nadu and the competition between DMK and AIADMK to use the Sri Lankan Tamil issue for their election gains as well as DMKs links with the Congress Party made it imperative for India to engage with the Sri Lankan government to find and amicable

solution to the humanitarian crisis of the remaining civillians in LTTE controlled areas that has now been reduced to 10-12 square killometers. Indias concerns are legitmate and stem from different reasons. For India, the Sri Lankan Tamil national question has partly been and internal issue embedded in the Indian political landscape. It also has security dimension, thoughe that aspect has gradually been reduced in importance as a result of new foreign policy fomulations by President Mahinda Rajapaksas government. In an interview with NDTVX24 Gotabhaya Rajapakshe, the Sri Lankan defence secretary, accepted that Indias cncerns were legitimat and Sri Lanka understood them. Indian defense secretary and national security advisor visited Sri Lanka on April 24 and met President Rajapaksa to brief him on Indias concerms. Meanwhile, the LTTE annoucned an unilateral ceasefire that the countries of Global North praised heavily, But the Sri Lankan government rejected as a farce. On 26, Indian Home Minister, P. Chidambaran announced that there would be an important announcement by the Sri Lankan government in the next 24 hours. DMK leader, Karunanidhi began fast unto-death asking for immediate ceasefire in Sri Lanka. On April 27, the Government of Sri Lanka announced that the military operations against the LTTE had come to a conclusion and the security forces would engage only in securing the release securing the release of remaining civilians trapped in the tiny silver coastal belt of 10 square kilometres Hence, force were advised not to use heavy weapons or air shelling thereafter.

UN sent three high level officials to Sri Lanka France announced that if would donate 100-bed hospitals to treat freed civilians. The UK announced a financial grant of more that 2 million pounds and Indian government promised a 1.9 billion Rupee grant for relocation and rehabilitation. Bernard Kouchner and David Miliband visited Sri Lanka on April 29 and insisted on their usual demand of ceasefire, but the Sri Lankan government refused.

The response of the countries of the Global North is not only inconsistent with their declared policies but invariably dominating in approach and substance. One may even perceive that the old sticks and carrots, policies continue to appear through in a different garb and through different techniques of domination. They have failed to explain how a ceasefire proposed by them would assist in releasing innocent civilians trapped in the tiny silver of coastal land in Sri Lankas North being used by the LTTE as a human shield. The Washington Post in its editorial has revealed this inconsistency in the following words: The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, on of the worlds most violent terrorist outfits, are surrounded in nothern Sri Lanka and about to be destroyed-but Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and European self-styled peacemakers are getting in the way of victory. The meddlers should let Colombo fish off this menace. It furher added: Last week, Mrs. Clinton played into the hands of the terrorists by blaming the Sri Lankan government for the crisis. The entire world is very dissapointed that they were causing such untold suffering; she said. Ceasefire would have produced only two results in the context that the LTTE continue to use civilians as a human shield. First, it would have prolonged the suffering of Tamil civilians forcefully brought into this small stripe of land by forcing them to continue to live in that hell-hole for a longer period. Secondly, had the space been opened for outside forces to operate, it would have given LTTE a new legitimacy, making a tiny Tamil Eelam and new life for the LTTE leadership. The question asked by Foreign Secretary of Sri Lanka Dr. Palitha Kohona is interesting and revealing. He asked the USA and EU to do what they preach for Sri Lanka in relation to Taliban and Osama bin Laden.

Problems and Challenges

The depressing video reports unfurled on TV screens worldwide on April 20 and 21 showing Tamil civilians fleeing the last patch of Sri Lanka under LTTE control would have made anyone wonder if there was no way to prevent the extreme human suffering of innocent Tamil civilians trapped in the North. Like in any massive hostage rescue operation, there were so many casualities, some civilians were killed, some injured. Among them were women, children and elderly people. With the influx of more than 160,000 people since March this and another 15,000 to 20,000 trapped in LTTE area, the Sri Lankan government has to face an enormous task that is more complex than the co-chairs have envisioned, its challenges are basically three-fold, namely, (1) immediate humanitarian crisis, (2) return, rehabilitation and reconstruction, and (3) structural reforms.

The immediate humanitarian tasks are hugs since the exodus was so sudden and unexpected and involved some degree of security threat owing to possible suicide attacks and LTTE infiltration. The security concerns have made the situation rather different from the Tsunami situation about five years ago. The result was it took quite a long time to send the civilians to their temporary accommodation. Provision of food, clothing and other basis services to rescued civilians was a challenging task so the government had to use air force helicopters and planes for transport of food and other requirements. Most interesting development is that people in the South came forward like in Tsunami disaster to help their Tamil fellow citizens. Understandably there have been many gaps and flaws in the mechanism of providing basis requirements. The government is now taking steps to build new institutions with more civil participation to handle these immediate humanitarian concerns.

Initially, there was a rumour that civilians rescued from the LTTE controlled areas would be kept in IDP camps for a period of three years. However, the government has recently announced that the process of sending them to their normal habit will begin in six months time. The commencement of these tasks is assigned to one of the chief ministers. Rehabilitation and reconstruction of destroyed villages and infrastructure would be a mammoth task requiring a huge budget.

Thirdly, Tamil national question is not only an issue allocating material, physical and human resources, but also restructuring old state structure of power-sharing. The critical question is how to introduce new democratic structures after three decades of military conflict?

What is to be done?

International community can play a big role in helping Sri Lanka meet these problems and challenges if they adopt a non-domination but directional donor policy. Foreign assistance as a means of domination would make things worse in the Global South. Instead, assistance should be linked with normative principles. The most important ingredient in non-dominant, but directional assistance in relation to Sri Lankan national question is that foreign assistance should be aimed of rebuilding and strengthening local governments thus reducing over-centralization that in fact lies at the heart of the national question. With the end of the military conflict, Sri Lanka will encounter two dangers, First, in the last three years, the war has given the military establishment a relative independence and popularity. As a result, the military may, in future, play a more influential role in Sri Lankan polity further weakening democratic structures. A more dangerous trend however would be the reemergence of exclusive Sinhala nationalism that would jeopardize attempts for state re-structuring. The military victory would be interpreted as the end of the Tamil national question. The current interference of the governments of Global North is indirectly feeding the Sinhala exclusive political groups, like janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. National Freedom Front and HEla Urumaya, link national independence with Sinhala exclusivism.

The countries of Global North can play a positive role if their policies are based on a qualitatively different perspective. International donors of the Global North Should link their assistance to power-sharing programmes without limiting it to constitutional changes. First, in the North and East, it is imperative to rebuild and strengthen local government institutions. International donors should fund directly these bodies [money may be transferred through normal channels] and that would gradually assist in engendering people at the grass root level. Funding through line ministers and NGOs should be discouraged. Second, rehabilitation and reconstruction projects should come not under the government but under Provincial Councils and local government bodies. Essentially what is currently happening in the East should not be encouraged. New criteria such as degree of implementation of bilingualism may be helpful in making donor projects more ethnic sensitive. Third, any long-term assistance should be linked with explicit state-restructuring programme with substantial power-sharing and democratization.
