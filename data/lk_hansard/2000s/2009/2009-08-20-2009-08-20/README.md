It was agreed that Indian-Sri Lanka relations are developing strongly and has matured into an abiding friendship. It is particularly important at this time of transition and change that both sides should continue to strengthen ties. President Rajapaksa expressed his hopes for future development in Sri Lanka, and stressed that the present military victories offer a political opportunity to restore life to normalcy in the Northern Province and throughout Sri Lanka. The President assured the visiting Indian Minister of his intention for both countries to work together to enable Sri Lankans, and particularly the Tamil community in the North, to begin leading normal lives as soon as possible. External Affairs Minister Mukherjee expressed Indians readiness to participate in the reconstruction of northern Sri Lanka so as to overcome the ravages of armed conflict and also lay the economic and political foundations of a sustainable peace in which all communities in Sri Lanka feel comfortable. Indian will work together with Sri Lanka on a reconstruction plan for these areas which involves infrastructure development and other support. President Rajapaksa assured minister Mukherjee that it was his intention to move as quickly as possible to implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, which followed the India-Sri Lanka Agreement of 1987 and even explore the possibility to go further than these proposals.

Both sides reviewed the humanitarian situation arising as a result of the conflict. The Sri Lankan side reassured that it will respect the safe zones declared by the Security Forces to minimize the effect of conflict on Tamil civilians. The Indian side will continue to extend its relief supplies to civilians caught up in the zone of conflict. During the discussions, President Rajapaksa extended a personal invitation to an all party delegation from Tamil Nadu led by Chief Minister Karunanidhi and Ms. J. Jayalalitha, General Secretary of the AIADMK, to see for themselves the situation on the ground and to persuade the LTTE to lay down arms and join the democratic mainstream. Both sides agreed that an early restoration of normal democratic life in the areas affected by the conflict would be a major contribution to peace and stability. The Indian side indicated that it will do all that is necessary to bring this about. Presidential Secretariat Colombo January 28, 2009 ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , ?

I, on behalf of the United National Party, would like to reflect my views on the two Bills that have been presented today. Let me take the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (Amendment) Bill first and then subsequently follow up with the Secured Transactions Bill. Sir, while stating that this is certainly a step in the right direction, the motives of those obviously have got to be questioned. But, as a responsible Opposition, it is our intention to support the good things that are being enacted and certainly express our concerns and apprehensions that could be followed by their implementation. I think the main factor is to try to boost the capital market; in a market where the world economy is in dire straits and the Sri Lankan economy is certainly doing far worse than that. I think they are trying to flog every single thing in order to boost the capital market. Certainly, there is nothing wrong and it is a step in the positive direction. But, if it is done for the sake of boosting the popularity only, then of course it is certainly a fairly dangerous trend. Sir, see the number of Members who are present here now. I do not want to call for the Quorum. I do not want it called because I like it debated in this manner. We have, in any case, a pack of nearly 120 Ministers who do not have a clue of what is going on. But, you could only see the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, a cricketer turned financial analyst, at the moment listening to what we are saying. I only want to show the intention and the interest of the Government. Now, this is the way they run the country.

That is all I want to mention. They bring in a Bill; they read out something that is given there and when they are questioned, they do not know how to answer those things. Now, this is the difference between a responsible Opposition and an irresponsible Government. Anyway, let it be as it is. So, basically I was talking about boosting of the capital market. I am also informed - this is not a specialty in my area - when speaking with the professionals in this field, that this is moving towards an index-based derivative form. Now, these derivatives or future's exchange was something that was very popular in the beginning of the 2000s and certainly when I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, there were various suggestions that came about and the germination at that moment has borne fruit at this particular moment. But, I would also like to take up certain matters that have been happened in the recent past. I am sure this is leading to a future's exchange. It is perfectly okay as long as the mechanisms and the bodies that are governing these are doing their job professionally. But, what we find today is that there is such a lot of politicization of the institutions, that the very body that is supposed to be controlling them does not understand as to what they have got to do about it. Look at the Central Bank. We need not go too far out. The Central Bank that should look into the financial institutions has today become the mouthpiece of the Government. So, when they, such an independent authority that is supposed to be doing something for the collective good of the country becomes a political animal, then who controls that political animal? Now, if these institutions become one of the same because they stem from the same top, then it becomes a fairly dangerous trend. Now, when I say that this is going to be derivatives and a future's exchange, that means we are looking futuristically but those are the ways how the hedging deal came into place. The Governor of the Central Bank who is trying to hide behind many curtains today is the one who led the Petroleum Corporation into the hedging deal. Now, what is hedging? Hedging is a gambling between a position taken today and to a future event. Now, when they took that particular event one year ago or nine months ago, petroleum prices were at US Dollars 147 and they wrote themselves into a protective situation of a futuristic hedging deal. Now, hedging per se is gambling. Future markets are one of the same. You envisage and anticipate a market which is actually not there. So, you do not have professionals - I know there are very good professionals who are silent - but you have got only political mouthpieces who have overtaken those professionals. So, that is going to be the problem. The Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga is a standing example. He was a cricket captain but sidelined from cricket and made to go and do some nursing or housekeeping or something

[ ]

2009 20 1577 1578

like that. Cricketers are put to those things and nurses, housekeepers or those type of guys or clerical hands are put to run the cricket administration. That is the difference. Probably due to my mentioning this, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga might be subject to further harassment. But, I am sure as he is in the sporting world, he would not mind. The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa who just walked in, is another glaring example. The guy who basically should be in remand prison is telling this Minister that he should not be the Cabinet Spokesman. A Minister who is doing his job honestly and says what he means, and means what he says, is told today by some cultural person that he is behaving like a kid and not like an adult. ( )

( - , , ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa - Minister of Mass Media and Information and Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion)

I do not take these things seriously. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

My job is to make you serious. That is my job here because otherwise your Government does not speak about you. At least, we are speaking about you. So in doing this, I am only trying to draw a parallel, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan)

We are concerned - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes, we are concerned. My good Friend and Colleague, the Hon. Mano Ganesan, is quite concerned. As much as we are concerned about the IDPs, we are concerned about the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa who has also become an IDP in the Cabinet. You are internally displaced in the Cabinet. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa)

No. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

You say, No, but it is a muted "no". We are saying, Yes. So you do not need to disagree. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana is another able person. As the Chairman

of APRC, he has given a holiday to the APRC. Where is your professional judgment on particular issues? Today, that is put into a back burner. We read in the newspapers today is that essay by essay is sent from the APRC. If these institutions are going to function in this manner, then we are going to have a very dangerous trend, Sir. So, all I want to mention is that the index-based derivatives of the future's exchange or capital markets is certainly a step in the right direction. In fact, it was a professional who pointed out to me that this was something like how the Consumer Affairs Authority was enacted by us, with the guidance of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe when he was Prime Minister and the Hon. K.N. Choksy, the then Minister of Finance. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe ensured to make this professional and he said, let us depoliticize this. This was our aim then. It was our policy to ensure professionals were brought into the Board, and I am happy to say that six persons were brought in to enhance and widen the experience of that institution. Now the only problem is, while that is there in statute, you have MPs, having doctorates playing hell today. If those types of professionals are going to be put in, then you will only make a bad case worse. But, in any case, it has covered the fields of law, finance, banking, business and I think in todays context, you must also put in a CID person there to see what type of things that come in here - [Interruption.] Accountant is there, the Hon. Dew Gunasekara. I was particularly concerned when they said, Finance, but I was informed that finance covers both the degree point of view as well as the commercial aspect. That is the first one I would have checked on. That is certainly a step taken professionally in the right direction. But, the other matter that I would like to mention is, if we are trying to develop a capital market let us have the principles, the main points, set in the right direction. You cannot have a Government that is flagrantly violating human rights on one side, telling the Westerners, Go to hell, bashing of the professionals who are there and stymieing the Opposition to such an extent that sometimes the very democracy is in peril. You must ensure that there is more freedom. Then, there is a Central Banker, who tells the IMF to go away one day, and when they are in absolute economic dire straits, he asks them to come back. These things do not augur too well. Instead of trying to develop the capital market - I am sure Sir, if we ask the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga to run the Ministry of Sports and Public Recreation; you know almost you have lost out almost US Dollars 12 million to 15 million during the last couple of months owing to the fact that TV licences have been given to almost US Dollars 12 million to15 million less. If we collect money of this sort in a proper manner, we do not need to run after others for loans. This is the tragedy in this country. [Interruption.] - Hon. Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, I was

1579 1580

referring to the sports area concerning the television contract entered into with the Nimbus (Pvt.) Limited. There was one other TV deal on the right to telecast. There was one deal where Sirasa TV was given and later withdrawn and given to Rupavahini. So, these types of things are going on. Hon. Minister, you might be able to add on to that because there was a TV deal signed on the previous Twenty-20 series; it was in the newspapers that Sirasa TV was given the right to telecast and suddenly it was withdrawn and given to Rupavahini. So, while the other one is being looked into by you I am sure this may get your attention as well. But, you may not be able to comment on that. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa)

[Interruption.] Even in the past, telecast rights were always given to the Rupavahini. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No. It was on a tender basis, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa)

We always make the highest bid. We do not know anything other than that. What we have requested from them is that there was some discrepancy in deciding the right to be given to a certain party and we have stated that we have always been given the first place and we have reported it. That was what happened. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Well, that may be your intention and your prerogative. All I want to say is that there has not been fair play. Tender process is the best method and the one who tenders the highest should get it. You would have seen from an answer to an Oral Question in Parliament yesterday that the private sector television stations have paid over Rs. 290 million as taxes and of that one institution, Sirasa has paid Rs. 273 million. Swarnavahini has paid Rs. 20 million. Derana has paid, Rs. 5 million. But, the Governments television stations do not pay anything at all. So, of the private sector is considered the engine of growth, you do not need to have an incompetent Government institution, which is basically the mouthpiece of the Government come in to just take the revenue factor, Hon. Minister. That is all I want to say about it. I guess that is for another debate but I just mentioned it in passing. These are the ones which do not bring in confidence on the economy of this country. You can bring in legislations. You have legislations, but privatization processes that have taken place are disregarded. Matters approved by the Attorney - General

are only done. I am only talking of the aspect of the confidence-factor that is shattered. You can bring in the Security Exchange Commission, tighten it, do anything saying that the Cabinet says this, that and the other, but finally the implementation aspect is the most vital factor for business. You, as the Minister in charge of the BOI, I am sure you know how many people are coming for a day to get themselves registered under the BOI. During the period 2002 and 2003, when Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas Government was defeated you almost had 50 to 60 applications which were crystallized. Todays economic issues were what were done then. But, today if you look at BOI, you have a bare three or four applications that have come in. That is the problem. We cannot blame you. I mean, you are only carrying a bad brief on behalf of the Government. But, what I am saying is that these are the areas that the Cabinet must sit and look into. You have 125 Ministers and only five or six Ministers who are working while the rest are on jaunts. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) [Interruption.] As regards the investment to be made in Sri Lanka, the BOI and the Ministry have done everything. We are facilitating to the highest and we are actually doing everything possible to make sure that investments do come to Sri Lanka. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know that. I certainly did not bring you into the picture. I only said you have a bad brief. Yesterday, I browsed the Annual Report - 2007 of the BOI, which basically shows that there are 3,800 agreements that had been signed. I just recollect that 1,700 agreements have been cancelled and 95 have basically closed up. So, you would see the actual implementation or the practical running of the BOI in its real administration is only 40 per cent of it. So, the "hit and miss" run is becoming increasingly worse. So, Hon. Minister, today do not run after new investments. You ensure to protect the existing businesses. The existing investor is the best ambassador for the next one. I was horrified to hear that the German investor, Mr. Michael Lohs of Eskimo Fashions Knitwear (Lanka) Limited in Negombo, whom I personally know, is closing up and selling his company and going to Bali. Why? He feels that this is basically becoming a very dangerous society. He basically sees that there is too much politicization. You can see the German investors are moving out. You can see the British guys are feeling helpless. You look at the Labour GSP. I have been telling day in day out; Hon. Minister, we were the first party to say, Please go to IMF. Please go to the World Bank. You all laughed at us. You thought that we were sending you into a debt trap. Today you all are in a debt trap and that is

[ ]

2009 20 1581 1582

why you have got to go on your knees to IMF and say, Please come and bail us out. And, now you are basically talking virtues of that particular thing. You kicked out IMF on one side and then you call them, hug them, wash them and bring them to the same place. Hon. Minister, this is not the way to run a country. Country does not mean only one element or one aspect. Bringing in capital market development or not, is not the question. What is important is confidence, coherency, consistency and discipline. Today when you go to the police, you do not know whether the police is going to hit you or accept your complaint. Look at what happened in Angulana; two innocent boys were killed. Look at what happened to Nipuna in Kaduwela. Look at what happened in Maharagama. Look at what happened to one of your own Municipal Council Member in Kottawa; the Municipal Council Member of the SLFP killed by the police. See what happened in Puttalam. See what happened in Bauddhaloka Mawatha two days ago. Then what happened in Biyagama? Two boys from Colombo North have been killed. So, all these are due the non-appointment of the Constitutional Council under the Seventeenth Amendment. You look at the Public Finance Commission. It is the same, because of the lack of the Public Finance Commission, the Committee on Public Enterprises in the Provinces does not exist. Then, you look at the Public Service Commission. Due to the lack of Public Service Commission, today the Public servants have become palace servants, because the more you run after them, the more they think that can get a position. So, why have a Public Service Commission? Let us be the massage egos of politicians. Look at the Judicial Service Commission. Today, there is certainly a change, fresh air blowing across the judiciary. But, still the very aspect of judgments should be basically to provide justice to anyone. If you have the Judicial Service Commission, there may be no complaints. Look at the media. People are worried to report what is being debated even in the Parliament. They will tell what the Government wants. But, they will not report anything the Opposition tells. When the staff of the Daily News newspaper came before the Committee on Public Enterprises, I was horrified to listen to the answer the Legal Manager gave when I asked a question. I asked, How many defamation charges are there? He said, We have about 20, Sir Then I asked, What is the provision available for defamation actions? He said, Rs. 1.2 million. When I asked, Have you booked them?, he said, No. I asked, Why? He said, Because when it comes to a point they get a pardon. Idiots like us have given Rupavahini three pardons and ITN three pardons. Hon. Dew Gunasekera is laughing. We are the idiots because of the sense of - [Interruption.] Whether it is the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti, all of them have publicly apologized. It is nice to character-assassinate; it is absolutely great when apologies are

tendered. But, the same institutions under your Ministry keep character-assassinating. I know you are powerless. But, what can be done? It is a dictate from a higher position than you are. But, this type of character- assassination must stop. You must ensure that justice prevails there. So, he said that owing to the fact that they come to an amicable settlement, they keep on character-assassinating. This type of manager should be really sacked. That was mentioned. That is the level it has fallen to. Also, look at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. Why is bribery rampant in the country? That is because of the lack of an effective Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. How many of your Ministers have been harassed? We are subjected to harassment. How many Members of the Opposition are harassed? That is the problem. Is this right? All this is because of the lack of a Constitutional Council. If you bring that in, the foreigners will think, Ah! the judicial system works; the police works. You do not need to go to the underworld for protection. It is because of this that investments are not coming into the country. During the United National Party, when the JVP was running amock in 1988 and 1989, we had the highest amount of investments coming in. But, why are they not coming in now? That is because there is no rule of law. My learned Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, stated that and he has been repeatedly mentioning that in this House. You do not have the rule of law even in Parliament that stems from the Speaker down to the Secretary-General. You do not have a Secretary-General appointed by the Constitutional Council. The Assistant Secretary-General, who is here, came through an interview. Then, there are others who have parachuted to the place. There is no personal disrespect for them, but that is due to the lack of a Constitutional Council. It is the same with regard to the Auditor-General. He asks questions, but who is he to ask questions when he has been precipitated into the position? The Attorney-General came the same way. You have people from the Attorney-Generals Department shoved off and a political appointee brought in. What is the meaning of this? So, when the foreigners see these, they think, Oh, this is a banana republic. So, let us go and make hay while the sun shines". Yesterday, I was sad to see the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Minister of Export Development and International Trade, very eloquently batting, "We collected Rs. 220 million through Treasury Bills in one day". Todays newspapers state that another Rs. 200 million is coming in. Hon. Minister, when the foreign investors are given only 0.3 per cent over LIBOR for a quarter today, which is 1 per cent interest at the maximum, if they have the opportunity to come and invest here at 11 per cent interest, who is the idiot who would not come? That is not investor confidence

1583 1584

generated in this country. It is worse than privatization. I thought the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was an erudite scholar. He says that the money collected is equivalent to the amount needed to build three Hiltons. He little knows that the money comes in only for three months. If he can build three Hiltons, then in three months, the three Hiltons can crash again. This type of information could be given to nursery kids, but should not be brought to this august Assembly. It is a professional debate that needs to take place. The day before yesterday, we had the Debate on the IMF loan. In the agreement with the IMF, the Budget Deficit is 7 per cent of GDP. In answer, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Non-Cabinet Minister, waxed eloquently saying, "Our deficit is 6.5 per cent. Why do you bother to say it is 7 per cent? What a flexibility! Today the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya gives an answer in Parliament saying that the anticipated revenue for the year 2009 is Rs. 654 billion as opposed to the revenue projected at Rs. 855 billion. Hon. Minister, Rs. 855 billion minus Rs. 654 billion is Rs. 201 billion. That is 25 per cent off the mark. Rs. 201 billion added to Rs. 353 billion is the Budget Deficit. It adds up to Rs. 554 billion. That, as a percentage of GDP, which is Rs. 4,913 billion, is 11 per cent. So, we asked an elementary question from him: How can you reduce that 11 per cent to 7 per cent in the next 120 days? The answer was, "Wait and see what happens." It is just pie in the sky. He has to either cut the expenditure or increase the revenue or tell the IMF, "We will take the second instalment and the rest of it can go to hell. That is what is basically seen.

I think the bringing in of the Secured Transactions Bill is also another step in the right direction. It basically brings in the maintenance of a Secured Transactions Register. But, I only hope that the maintenance of these registers and other intentions are all pure, because if they are aimed at bringing in a bigger tax net or if the CRIB is brought in just to harass, then the purpose is lost.

Today, we have to make a declaration of our assets and liabilities. You would have got all our statements. Mr. Deputy Chairman, on the basis of what is stated in Clause 10 and Clause 11 in this Secured Transactions Bill, you basically will not get all the details. They will say that it is a Minister; this and that, and they will hide behind those types of things. Now, if this type of a thing ends up in the same manner, then it is detrimental. If you look at the Secured Transactions Bill, you are basically giving all the protection to the lender. You are protecting the institutions that lend from the time they lend until the time the loans are repaid. But, in the case of the person who borrows, there is no protection at all. See what has happened to the Golden Key and Asian Finance depositors today? If you look at Shriram, all Ceylinco related companies, the Okanda Group and Daduwam Mudalali, all these are supposed to be looked after by the Central Bank.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will take one more minute, Mr. Deputy Chairman. The Central Bank when it was brought before the COPE two years ago said that they were perfectly okay and ensured that they could be monitored. Almost an amount of Rs. 100 billion has been collected through the Ceylinco Group. I am just taking an example because I want to show the gravity. A revenue of Rs. 2 billion has been reduced per month from the Ceylinco earnings that are divided among the depositors and that is one of the reasons today why inflation has come down.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

On the same basis, today the Central Bank that is supposed to control them, have no control at all over them. Look at Mihin Air, look at SriLankan Airlines; you have brought them under control but they are not adhering at all. You have Mihin Air that has run into a loss of Rs. 5 billion in the last 20 months.

Then going on the basis of the CRIB Register, I want to know whether you all are trying to bring all the movables into this. The desirability is different. I am sure it is to enhance the credit- creation activities. But, what the Hon. Minister was saying was that the Government was trying to give these loans to the farmers. What a poppycock is being spoken? These are absolute insults to the credibility of the Parliamentary system. You basically talk of one and aim at another. You are looking at maintaining a separate register for the movables.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Just give me a second, please. On that same score, I hope that this is not another step of adding a percentage on to your Movable Assets Register and imposing a tax in the future. So, while congratulating the Government for the good parts, I only hope the desirability and the practicality are looked at according to what we spoke. But, ensure that at the end of the day we stop fooling with the economy. This country has gone through so much of turmoil and turbulence. So, please ensure that stability is brought in void of political persecution and political drive. Thank you. [. . 12.15] ( )
