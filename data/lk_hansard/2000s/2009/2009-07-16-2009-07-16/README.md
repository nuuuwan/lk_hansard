[. . 11.08] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Madam Chairperson, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the demise of a great political leader, none other than the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare. Today, we are having a special Session purely to pay tribute, honour and respect to this great politician. Alick was a man who practised, what you call, Gentleman politics. He was a gentleman in all his dealings in the political field. In this House, he never violated the Standing Orders nor did he resort to unparliamentary language. It is very unfortunate these days how we see Members indulge in such activities. But, Alick was not so. In his 40 years of political career as a Member of Parliament, there were no complaints. Even in the ministries that he held - very important ministries in the development field of this country - there were no complaints. There were no complaints of corruption; there were no complaints of nepotism; there were no complaints of favouritism. He was very keen to do a job of work so as to ensure that his responsibilities were discharged to the satisfaction of his leaders as well as the people of this country. Looking back at his service record, we heard just now from the Hon. Nandimithra Ekanayaka, the present Member who succeeded the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare, about his record of work for the development of the Matale District, more particularly the Buddhist temples, building up of viharas, stupas and all other activities. Therefore, all in all, this county has lost a valuable politician; a valuable social worker; a man who set an example to the up-and-coming politicians of this country as to how a Member of Parliament, a peoples representative should work and act for the people and for the country. We are very happy that he has given us at least one of his sons, the Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare to take his place in this House and out of the other three sons of his family, two of them are also in politics and the third is in the plantation sector. However, the United National Party has lost a valuable Member, I must say, not only as a Member of Parliament, but also as a Member of the Party. I, therefore, wish to express my sympathies and condolences to his beloved wife, children and all his relatives who are present here and to the people in the Matale District. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Madam Presiding Member, may I on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, say a few words in paying tribute to one of the colourful personalities who had adorned this House ever since 1960, except for a very short period from 1970 to 1977.

For anyone to be in active public life for almost half a century is a very difficult task, difficult in many ways. Particularly, as the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane who spoke before me talked about us, the politicians, I must agree collectively speaking, we are perhaps sometimes the most ridiculed species, most often denied even the right of reply to the variety of criticisms levelled against politicians these days. But, the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare was not simply a physically tall person; he indeed stood tall among many of an average height in politics, particularly, when it comes to hill country politics in this country. Having entered Parliament in a by-election in 1961 where he fought on behalf of the United National Party when his own uncle Bernard Aluvihare passed away, he was by then already a local politician having been the Mayor of Matale. The people of Matale have many fond memories of how he pioneered the water scheme for the Matale Town and subsequently his family members too have adorned the Matale Municipal Council and are even now serving in that Council. Having said that, Madam, I must say that sometimes when it comes to politics, patronage politics; when it comes to serving your constituents, it may not be approved by purists. But, what is important is not to indulge in corruption or any illegal activity. Yet, you could be accused of being overly partial towards your constituents. The late Hon. Alick Aluvihares conduct in politics was always to help his constituents and he is remembered by the people of Matale for the way in which he stood against anyone who would criticize him for helping his constituents. This morning when I wanted to look up a few details of the Hon. Alick Aluwihare, I read an article written by a former Member of Parliament, the Hon. Buddika Kurukularatne about the differences he had with him on the issue of recruitment of workers from the Matale District to the Port of Colombo when he was a minister. As a back-bencher, the Hon. Buddhika Kurukularatne had a serious difference of opinion with him and at that time the United National party had a rule that if the back-benchers are to criticize their ministers, they will have to get the permission of the Parliamentary Group and bring it to the notice of the leadership. With the permission of the then President, he had raised this issue and the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare had wanted three months' time as usual - unlike these days where Members do not comply with the Orders of the Chair - but the then Speaker had ruled that the Minister will have to answer this at least on the very next occasion and not to ask for too much of time. The question was to the effect as to how many people were recruited from Matale to the Port of Colombo and then how many among them were from the village of Aluvihare. The Hon. Minister had then replied saying that altogether 25 people were recruited from Matale, out of that 12 were from Aluvihare for which the Hon. Buddhika Kurukularatne had said that none of them had seen even the sea and you have gone and put them into the Port. Then, the late Hon. Aluvihare

2209 2210

had got very angry. When he walked out of the lobby, the Hon. Kurukularathne recounts very jovially that he had to run out of the lobby and seek refuge in a room in Parliament so that, the known boxer he was sometimes, would have come to blows with him. That was the way in which he concludes saying that subsequently he ended up as his own family lawyer defending the late Hon. Aluvihare and his family members in many legal battles or suits which had been filed maliciously against the family of Aluvihare in politics.

All of us know, when we are in the Opposition, are the targets of all types of vituperative and baseless complaints. I am sure his children Ranjith, Duljith and Wasantha have gone through the mill as their father had gone through in politics, having to face all types of malicious propaganda and baseless allegations. In this instance, we must remember that the late Hon. Aluvihare was someone who courageously faced all his opponents in the Matale District in furthering his political ideology. He gave fearless political leadership to the people, particularly to the UNP constituents of the Matale District, and for us today dynastic politics may be somewhat of a derogative term to refer to some family members indulging in politics. But, electoral politics has been so conditioned in this country that successive generations have been popularly elected due to the commitment and sacrifice the people, the forefathers and other family members showed in serving that constituency. Being in the doyen of the family of Aluvihares, the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare served in many capacities in Parliament. He had been the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Ports and Shipping - incidentally, both Ministries I too held for a few years - then, the Ministry of Plantation Industries, and the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government. When he held office in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government particularly after the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord, this Ministry was an important Ministry in designing the devolution framework for the entire country. The late Hon. Alick Aluvihare served with distinction in these positions and had done immense service to the country in discharging his duties in a variety of portfolios. Therefore, the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare would always be remembered as a gentle giant of hill country politics and I would like also to record here that the minorities of the Matale District - Hindus, Muslims and others - remember the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare as somebody who never resorted to unreasonable communal politics. He is somebody who had even gone to the extent of saving the Hindu Kovil from being attacked during the 1983 riots and this is something that the people of Matale very well remember. Therefore, in paying our tribute to the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare, I would like to associate myself and my party with the condolences expressed

today to all his family members; his dear wife, his children - Ranjith, Duljith and Wasantha, his daughter and the other members who are incidentally present today in the House. I must also say that this tradition of at least reserving one full day separately on a non-Sitting week to take up the Votes of Condolence that are piling up everyday is a very welcome move. A person of the stature of the Hon. Alick Aluvihare is indeed a big loss to the House and I am sure his children and the others who are in politics will carry on the good work that he started. Thank you very much.

[. . 11.36] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Madam Chairperson, I am privileged to say a few words on this Vote of Condolence pertaining to the demise of the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare who passed away at the ripe old age of 83 years, much beyond the biblical span of three score and ten.

The Hon. Alick Aluvihare had been a Member of this House, I am informed, for well-nigh forty years, for almost four decades and during half of this period, he had been a Minister in several Governments holding responsibility for very important portfolios, which have also been mentioned by speakers before me, including the portfolios of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Ports and Shipping, Plantation Industries and so on. As a Minister, it must be said that the Hon. Aluvihare did not earn the scorn of the people. I do not think anyone in this country would say that he enjoyed the reputation of being corrupt when he held those positions which had very wide powers and where I think a certain measure of moral rectitude was required to ensure that you discharge your duties without room for complaint against you.

I recall, Madam Chairperson, my days at the Ceylon Law College when I was a young law student in the early 1950s, in fact in 1951, when Mr. Alick Aluvihares unlce, Mr. Bernard Aluvihare, was my lecturer in the subject of the Law of Trusts. Mr. Bernard Aluvihare was a Gandhian who had also played a role in the independence struggle of India. I remember the good old days. I have seen pictures of Mr. Bernard Aluvihare with the Gandhi cap. He was a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He was one of the right-hand men of the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956 and I think he held Cabinet rank in the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes first Cabinet. Of course, Mr. Alick Aluvihare entered Parliament as a Member of the UNP and continued to remain with the UNP. I believe he was considered as one of the pillars of the UNP during his long career in politics.

[ ]

2009 16 2211 2212

He was a very genial person, a very upright person and when a tall person is also upright, he seemed to be even more upright than he is. I think the Hon. Aluvihare commanded respect amongst his Colleagues in Parliament, amongst the people in his own constituency and generally amongst the people in this country. There is no question about it, Madam Chairperson, that he must have been a very popular politician because he represented the Matale District for well-nigh forty years having been elected democratically several times over. There can be no question about it that he must have been a very popular person who had served these people with a great sense of loyalty and trust and that the people in turn reposed their confidence in him and gave him the privilege of representing them in this honourable House on very many occasions. As the Hon. Member, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem mentioned, Madam Chairperson, the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare was also looked upon as a friend of the minorities in the Matale District. In the Matale District, there is a famous Hindu temple, the Muttumari Amman Temple, which is held in deep veneration by the Hindu people all over the country, all parts of the country including the North and the East. It is a temple where religious activities and ceremonies are carried out with a great deal of devotion and with much splendour and I know that even the people from the North and the East go to the Muttumari Amman Temple to participate in those ceremonies because those ceremonies are conducted, as I said, with a great deal of splendour and devotion and people look upon worshipping the Muttumari Amman Deity at that temple as a great privilege. The Hon. Alick Aluvihare was a great friend of the minorities, the Tamil people in particular and also the Muslim people. It is often remembered that during the course of the communal riots in 1983, when a lot of people in this country went mad and when much destruction including the desecration of places of religious worship happened quite frequently, this reputed temple, the Muttumari Amman Temple, was saved as a result of the efforts of the Hon. Alick Aluvihare and I think the Tamil, Hindu people in the Matale District are beholden to him for that great service he rendered, not merely to the Tamil people, but to humanity by saving that temple. Mr. Aluvihare, Madam Chairperson, had served in this House so long that there can be no question about it that everyone in this House will miss him in the future and I think we have lost a very valuable Member. Fortunately, we have his son, the Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare, who also represents the Matale District, presently a Member of this House and I believe there are other younger members of his family who are also in local politics. I join the other Members of the House, Madam Chairperson, in expressing to the Aluvihare family our very deep condolences on the passing away of an upright,

distinguished politician and I request, Madam, that a copy of the Minutes of the proceedings of this House be transmitted to the members of his family. I thank you.

[. . 11.44] . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) Madam Chairperson, I desire to add my brief yet sincere tribute to the life and work of the late Hon. Alick Aluvihare, who was a Member of this House for 40 years until his recent demise. He represented the District of Matale, his birth place, where he was a towering figure amongst his countrymen both in politics and local leadership. He entered Parliament in 1961 as a Representative for Matale consequent upon the death of his uncle, the Hon. Bernard Aluvihare, who was also a distinguished Member of this House for many years. The Hon. Aluvihares working life was a total dedication to the District of Matale. He was not content to have recognition as the scion of a distinguished family, but threw himself tirelessly into the lives of those less fortunate, seeking out their problems and finding solutions to them. As we know, Matale is distinguished for its bountiful and varied agricultural produce. The Hon. Alick Aluvihare began his life as an agriculturalist on his family lands. This taught him first-hand the trials and tribulations of those who till the land. He, therefore, first took to local politics. His dedication and successful service resulted in his being elected the Mayor of Matale. The responsibility with which he entered and catered to the needs of the rate-payers of the town soon paid him with a seat in Parliament as a Representative of the Matale District. The Hon. Alick Aluvihare belonged to that earlier generation of politicians who were firm believers in the rule of parliamentary democracy. His steadfast adherence to this belief and his loyalty to the United National Party, soon saw him in the Cabinet of Ministers. Madam Chairperson, I consider it a privilege to have been a fellow Member of that party and a fellow Parliamentarian with him for several years. The Aluvihare family has been a long-established, well-respected and reputed family in the erstwhile royal city of Matale. The Hon. Alick Aluvihares name will stand out high amongst them. We are fortunate in having continuity of the presence of the Aluvihare family in this House in the person of the young and energetic son of his, the Hon. Rajjith Aluvihare. His presence here is fortunate in two ways. Firstly, we have here the continuing presence of a family which has given leadership to a distinctive part of the country and secondly, leadership in the correct direction.

2213 2214

The late Hon. Alick Aluvihares name was never associated with corruption or besmirched with any accusation or act of impropriety. That has been a strong ingrained trait in the Aluvihare family and also their capacity to dedicate themselves fully to the tasks they undertake. I notice and observe this with happiness in the person of the Hon. Alick Aluvihares son, Ranjith. We wish him well and have trust and faith that he will continue the noble traditions of his respected family. I thank you, Madam Chairperson.

( - , ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights)

Madam Chairperson, we are here to honour, acclaim as well as to pay tribute to a great son of Sri Lanka, a patriot, a very senior Parliamentarian and a Minister who had contributed significantly to the development as well as to the legal framework of the country by taking upon and understanding his responsibilities consciously as a legislator over the years.

2217 2218

The Hon. Alick Aluvihare had been representing initially his electorate and subsequently his district for many, many years and during these years, one can honestly say that he had performed in a way that his constituents, his voters could very clearly be proud of the representative that they had chosen. Despite the fact that he was weak and feeble in the last stages, I still saw him coming to this House, sometimes in a wheelchair, participating in important Votes and continuing to contribute to the work of this House. I also remember the immense amount of assistance that he gave me when I was the Chief Government Whip during the period 2001 to 2004 as well as during my tenure as the Chief Opposition Whip subsequently. There were many times that I benefited from the knowledge of the Hon. Alick Aluvihare about the Proceedings and the Conventions of this House as a result of him being a very senior Parliamentarian who represented this House for many years and also his very comprehensive knowledge of the Standing Orders of this Parliament. On many occasions he had advised me and I can very clearly say that that advice helped me to get out of difficult situations that I faced in this capacity.

The Hon. Alick Aluvihare, I am sure would be happy to see today that his son, the Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare continues to do justice to the good name of the Aluvihare clan. The Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare has inherited a lot of good qualities of his illustrious father. I have known him for many years and associated with him very closely and I have no doubt that he would make his father, the Hon. Alick Aluvihare, very proud in the years to come as he continues to represent his district on behalf of his party.

Finally, Madam Chairperson, may the Hon. Alick Aluvihare attain the bliss of Nibbana after his sojourn in Sansara.

Thank you very much.
