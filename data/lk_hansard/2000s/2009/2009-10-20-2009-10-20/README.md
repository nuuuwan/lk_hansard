RISK OF LOSING GSP PLUS CONCESSION : STATEMENT BY HON. MINISTER OF EXPORT DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE . . ( ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade and Acting Minister of Posts and Telecommunications)

Mr. Speaker, I ask your indulgence to respond to a Question in terms of Standing Order 23(2) of Parliament, on the current GSP Plus issue, which was addressed to me on 25th September 2009, on the Floor of this House by the Chief Opposition Whip. The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera correctly asserts that "GSP Plus is an autonomous trade arrangement through which the European Union provides non-reciprocal preferential access to the EU market". It may be added, for the sake of completeness, that implementation is subject to normative principles established by the World Trade Organization regime. The Governments position with regard to this issue is crystal clear. The Government will adopt all reasonable measures to secure for the country the benefits accruing from the requested extension of the GSP Plus facility for a further period of three years. However, we will at no time be prepared to acquiesce in any course of action which is inconsistent with the sovereignty and dignity of the nation. This is why we have steadfastly refused to submit Sri Lanka to an investigation carried out by a foreign government. While declining to be a party to, or to be in any way associated with, an investigative procedure, we have made explicit our willingness, and indeed eagerness, to engage in a

2009 20 429 430

continuing dialogue with the European Commission through regular diplomatic channels, and to place at the disposal of the Commission any information they may require. Throughout these consultations there is a central focus. This consists of sharp emphasis on the new situation in Sri Lanka, consequent on the eradication of terrorism after two decades. In discussion with the Commission at all levels, we have consistently underscored the reality that there is in Sri Lanka today a unique opportunity to be made use of, for the benefit of the nation as a whole. The vistas of opportunity now available are crucial in respect of economic development with particular reference to investment, trade and tourism. We have provided the Commission with detailed information relating to current initiatives by the Government with regard to the resettlement of internally displaced persons, the revival of the economy in those parts of the Island which have been ravaged by the conflict, measures directed towards the restoration of livelihood and the resuscitation of the democratic process with the holding of elections to local bodies in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

What about a political solution? . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

Underpinning these representations is the strong belief by the Government of Sri Lanka that any realistic appraisal of the evolving situation in the country must necessarily take into account the magnitude and complexity of the issues we are faced with, as we leave behind us the pain and anguish of a prolonged conflict and address urgent issues of economic and social development in an atmosphere of peace and stability. In these circumstances, the practical yardstick for assessment of the countrys situation, we believe, is the progress we have made, from step to step, on a journey embarked upon in earnest, in the midst of a formidable array of problems towards the goal of national unification and reconciliation. While comment on perceived deficiencies is admittedly legitimate, a sense of poise and balance requires that due credit be given for what has been achieved against overwhelming odds. To present the countrys situation in the darkest and bleakest of hues, with hardly any recognition of positive or redeeming features, involves an affront to basic values of fairness and objectivity. A helpful approach, we believe, must reflect understanding of the multi-faceted problems the country is grappling with at present, and the resolve to find a way

forward in a spirit of partnership. The Government, for its part, will reciprocate in the fullest measure towards the accomplishment of a variety of objectives which we regard as compelling. Nevertheless, we must confess to deep disillusionment with several developments we have encountered in respect of the decision making process. We find particularly disconcerting some attitudes directly linked to subjective views, expressed in formal discussions with surprising lack of restraint, by officials of the Commission with regard to a wide range of issues within Sri Lankas sovereign competence, including the acceptability of military action in the country. It is fundamentally wrong, and in any event demonstrably incompatible with the conceptual framework of this trade regime, to use GSP Plus as a weapon to correct the Government of Sri Lanka into making departures from core national policies which have been formulated, and are being implemented, with the overwhelming support of our people. Indeed, we have every reason to protest vehemently against the threatened use of GSP Plus as "a powerful weapon" against our country for any purpose whatsoever. The Government is currently engaged in a series of bilateral discussions with several countries of the European Union to set out our position with clarity. The GSP Plus concessions which Sri Lanka enjoys at present, serve as a powerful lever for attaining social equity and, in particular, womens empowerment. While the competitiveness of a large number of industries has been strengthened by this arrangement, the principal beneficiary is the garment sector. The significant majority of employees in garment factories, many of which are located in the rural heartland of Sri Lanka, are women who have become breadwinners for their families and are today major contributors to the upliftment of social and economic conditions in the remoter regions of the Island. We have no doubt that the States of the European Union share our conviction that the future of these persons who richly deserve empathy, should be one of promise and fulfilment, especially as we enter upon an exciting new phase in the contemporary history of our country. The need of the hour, clearly, is to use all the energy at our command to protect the livelihoods of the most vulnerable segments of the Sri Lankan community. This has to be done with perception and sensitivity. It is surely reasonable to try to relegate, at least in this particular context and for the time being, the pursuit of narrow political objectives in the domestic sphere. We believe that all citizens of goodwill, irrespective of political affiliation, will find themselves in agreement with this point of view.

431 432

[ . . ]

It has to be remembered that the decision-making process with regard to GSP Plus for Sri Lanka has not reached finality. The culmination of this process is a determination by the Council of States of the European Union. This determination has yet to be made. In these circumstances, it is not appropriate for the Government of Sri Lanka to take unilateral action to publish documents, many of which have been sent to us under cover of confidentiality. Since these are documents which have originated from the Commission, and the Commission alone is responsible for their contents, such an initiative by the Government of Sri Lanka, we are convinced, will potentially hinder, rather than serve, the national interest. The Government, Mr. Speaker, will continue its engagement with the relevant authorities in a spirit of commitment and dedication in accordance with the principles I have explained. I thank you, Sir.

: : News report tabled: Sampath to be sent overseas for medical treatment for burn injuries sustained when setting Range Bandaras house on fire 2009-10-17/ 4.30 PM The President has agreed to send one S.H.A. Sampath who was a member of the group of persons who set fire to UNP parliamentarian Palitha Range Bandaras office and residence in Madamape, for medical treatment overseas for the severe burn injuries sustained by him when setting the house on fire. Sampath, who resides near the school in Helambawatana, Arachchikattuwa was admitted to ward number 27 of the Kalubowila Hospital to receive treatment for the burn injuries. He was treated on bed number 11 in the ward. He was admitted to the Kalubowila Hospital by the owner of Kanagaroo Cab service Neville Ranjith who resides in Wijerama on the High Level Road. Neville Ranjith had told the doctors that the burn injuries were sustained due to a gas cylinder explosion. Sampath had however escaped from the Kalubowila Hospital a few minutes after Range Bandara had informed the police that one of the persons involved in setting fire to his house and office was receiving treatment at the Kalubowila Hospital. Range Bandara held a special pooja at the Munneswaram Kovil in Chilaw cursing those who set fire to his house and office. Several photographs of Sampath who sustained burn injuries are published below*.

Hon. Friends, I want to put on record that His Excellency the Prime Minister of India directly told the IMF, If you are not willing to give US Dollars 2.6 billion as the IMF standby credit facility to Sri Lanka, we, the Indian Government will provide that money. That is the type of friendship we have.

. , - - . ", , , " . . . , . . , . I want to say a few words in English because my good Friends from the North are here. We want to settle this question of the IDPs. They will be sent back to their villages and also, at the same time, please appreciate the amount of money the Government is spending on infrastructure development in the North and the East. Today, His Excellency the President is opening the Kinniya Bridge in the Eastern Province which is the longest bridge in this country. It is done with the USAID. It is to help the people of the Eastern Province. Whether they are Tamils, Muslims or Sinhalese, they all will use the bridge as my good Friends will acknowledge. We are spending a lot of money on the infrastructure development in the North and we are trying to help the poor farmers of that area. Please remember that this is an effort. The military effort is over. We are now interested in making a genuine contribution to improve the lives of the ordinary people in the North and the East as we are trying to improve the lives of the ordinary people in other provinces. Now look at the fantastic contribution made by the Eastern Province last year, the year 2008, while the war was on. In the East, there has been a tremendous development in agriculture. Sri Lanka recorded the highest GDP contribution to agriculture in the year 2008 and that was 15 per cent. That was because we were able to restart large-scale agricultural projects in the Eastern Province. I have a statement here regarding the contribution made by the East towards paddy production in this country. For the first time, we have been able to go up to 15 per cent of GDP in the agricultural sector largely due to the agricultural development in the Eastern Province as well as, of course, due to good climatic conditions. Even when there was a conflict, through the North East Irrigated Agriculture Project - NEIAP - we launched a US Dollar 50 million World Bank project to rehabilitate all the tanks in the Northern Province and to resuscitate agriculture. And, I want to say publicly that we all can learn a lot from the great industry and commitment of the Northern and Eastern farmers. We have to help them. My good Friends know that in the next decade, there will be a crisis in the Northern Province because of salinity.

2009 20 461 462

According to the studies done, because of the deep wells that have been sunk in the North, now the water is getting mixed with saline causing a threat to agriculture. Some of the experts from the UK told us that because of the 30-year war, agriculture was not developed fast enough, they could just manage with the water level and the water available. But, in the future, when you go for extended agriculture we will have to seriously tackle this problem of salinity and hard water in the Northern Province. Let us face that together. Let us do that for the Northern farmers without always talking only about conflict, only about differences. Some of the differences are perfectly all right. Democratically, those differences must exist, but we have a huge area, Hon. Members, where we can work together to see that there is rapid growth. So, what we are trying to do is, on one side, to clean up our accounts regarding the expenditure of the war. For some years we will have to do that because we cannot run without funds.

. . . , , , . , . , , , , . . , , . . , . . My good Friend from the East is here. As you know very well, all the rivers originate from the Kandyan hills, from the areas we represent, the Nuwara Eliya District and the Kandy District. The Mahaweli River, the Gal-Oya, all these rivers flow through the Eastern Province all the way to Trincomalee and to the boundaries of Yala. You know the problems that South India has about these riverine arrangements. They have tribunals; they have riots; they argue; they go and break dams. You know the problem between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu; their constant quarrelling about waters. We do not have any of those problems. Nobody in my electorate or my district or from the Central Province is ever denying that water should go to the Eastern Province. We say, It must go". We must impound water in the Central Province. Let it flow into the vast areas in the Eastern Province. They are integrated geographically. Politically we may be different. But, geographically and historically we are the same. We have to work like that.

For example, I want to tell you about the Moragahakanda Scheme, the last part of the Mahaweli Development Project through which a majority of the agriculture development in the Eastern Province will be targeted. Water impounded in the Matale District will be sent through the riverine system into the Eastern Province. The last phase of the Mahaweli Development Project is to irrigate the Batticaloa, Ampara and Trincomalee Districts. I can remember we had discussions that even the allotments under these schemes should be on the basis of existing ethnic ratios. Nobody will be denied their right to get a block of land on these schemes. , . . , . - per capita income - 10 2,000 . LDC ; . . We are a Middle-Income Country, not an LDC. . . , . we can achieve, in my personal opinion, the magical 10 per cent GDP growth per year which has been achieved only by the big countries of Asia, such as China, India; now Vietnam is coming close to that. We can have our democratic differences, that is perfectly all right, but we must work together and give all our people, whether they be the Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils or Burghers, the right to lead a decent, contented and safe life in this country. Thank you.

Hussain Ahamed Bhaila, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs has hosted a dinner for the Pakistan's Deputy Foreign Minister at the Colombo Hilton. This is what it states: Pakistan has expressed displeasure over a Cabinet Ministers remarks that destabilization in that country continues since late General Zia ul Haq staged a coup detat. It is very unfair to say that as your Government benefited most from that military regime, Pakistans Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nawabzada Malik Amad Khan told a dinner in his honour at the Colombo Hilton on Friday night. It was hosted by Deputy Foreign Minister, Hussein Bhaila. So, what I am trying to say is, - [Interruption.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is just a little blithe.

The Hon. Bhaila. He is the person who has hosted the dinner. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha)

That is a different matter. He has hosted a dinner for some of the delegates who came from Pakistan. So, they have just asked as to what has happened. Then, it is reported in The Sunday Times quoting the lead story of the Daily Mirror which is a newspaper from the same family. But, I must appreciate that their Sinhala newspaper Lankadeepa has not mentioned a word about it although they were there. The Lake House group, all the electronic media, all the print media and foreign media agencies, were there. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne)

Okay, fine. I accept it.

This has been published by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka.

That is, in this particular kanna. There are two kannas and there are so many years. So, due to climatic conditions, one particular -

You were very specific and you said, "In the last kanna, if you go through the figures, we had a superb yield". ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Absolutely, because that is absolute rubbish. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Then, you had better listen to this again. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne)

It is pointless because I see the ground situation. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Sri Lanka State of the Economy 2009 under "Sectoral Growth Performance" states, I quote: .. significantly higher production of paddy owing to a renewed harvest from the Eastern Province during the Yala season. The Yala season output grew by 51 per cent to yield 1.8 million metric tonnes - a result largely of a 62 per cent increase in the extent of land cultivated when compared to the previous Yala season. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne)

Hon. Minister, this is a classic example. There is going to be a huge dispute over these figures. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

You can have a dispute, but this is a published document. These are figures of 2008. You are talking about figures of 2009. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne)

Yes, I am talking about figures of 2009. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)
