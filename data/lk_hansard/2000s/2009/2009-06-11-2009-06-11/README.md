Ensure that there is no over-saturation. -[Interruption.] Now the problem is, you only want to rebuke rather than listen, but ensure that you diag-nose and do the job. The Minister, the Hon. Dr. Sarath Amunugama who was there prior to the Hon. Anura Pri-yadharshana Yapa, did diagnose the problem and attend to it. I am sure the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa has the same sagacity. I only gave an example. Ensure as the Ministers in charge of Investment Promotion that there is no over-saturation. Just because you give a licence worth US Dollars two million, it does not mean that you bring investment into the country. Ensure that you protect the industries. Now what will happen is, there will be disar-ray. You have two or three companies merging and instead of five companies, you come back to two companies. Now, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa eloquently quoted the figures on the job opportunities. I beg to differ, Hon. Minister, because you really quoted the information that had been given. I must say there is an innovative, business-oriented Chairman in the BOI, but that alone will not bring investment into the country. Now you men-tioned - I just made a note of what you said because be-ing the former Minister of Trade, I have this information in hand - that there are 86 companies operating in Katu-nayake today. We had 135. What has happened to the balance 49? You said that there are 59 companies in Bi-yagama today. There were 81 companies in 2005. What has happened to the balance? What has happened to Si-notex? What has happened to Laws? What has happened to Star Garments? These are companies that had over four or five thousand people working there. I am telling you this with hands-on experience because I have been in-volved in the process. I do not expect you to have the same knowledge but I know you are a person who will look into this matter. There are growing concerns. You said that there are 56,000 people working today in the Free Trade Zone but it has a potential for employing 120,000 people. But, nobody comes there. We are having a problem. If you can bring in people and put them to work, we will ensure that their employment is guaran-teed. The minimum salary offered is Rs. 5,600; there are no takers. Even on Grade IV which is given after two years training, you get Rs. 7,100. But, there are no

599 600

[ ]

takers because you have got to travel and the travelling cost alone is about Rs. 2,100. When that amount is de-ducted from the salary, you are unable to live on your monthly salary. So, Hon. Minister, these are the matters that you need to address. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Usually they draw a salary of around Rs. 9,000 to Rs. 10,000. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I think your Chairman, Mr. Dhammika Perera has done a study. You should call them and address the issue because I have hands-on experience in this field. Look at Marks and Spencer. We are the ones who assisted you to bring them into Sri Lanka. You know that. You all have helped; Dr. Sarath Amunugama helped because it is good for the country instead of them going to India, or to Bangladesh. We have managed to bring in British com-panies to Sri Lanka instead of having their operations in Philippines or in Hong Kong or in India. The biggest problem of the companies like Sinotex, Laws, and Des-mond Mercury is that they are unable to have good, pro-ductive labour coming from them because of the salaries they are paid. You said that there are 56,000 people there. That is absolutely correct. There were 89,000 people there. The potential is 120,000 but there are no takers. They bring in people from Kuliyapitiya; they bring in people from Pannala. That is why you have Dian Gomes' factory over there. But, they are losing their market share. Why are they going to Hyderabad? Why are they going to Ahmedabad? Why are they going to Chennai? Because there is no critical mass here. So, Hon. Minister, while you bring in a 10 per cent tax giving legislative effect to the Budget Proposals, these are matters that the investors are looking at. Yes-terday, I did mention when the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was there, that we have politicized this economy for 61 years. 61 . . . , . ? 15 . , Indian Raj System , bureaucratic system . , . . .

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) We were a war-torn country at one time. Now we are heading for a bright future. We are expecting certain changes. So, wait till that happens. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, remember that during troubled times we had more investments. During the JVP insurrection, we had huge amounts of investments. Why? Because the cost of production was cheaper at that time. So, do not think that that is the case. As soon as problems arose in Vietnam, investments came in because it was cheaper. When they started coming out of it and began developing, it became expensive. We will give you full support. Let us work together. Ensure that we have a national economy. I mentioned this yesterday also. You have the problem of the Labour. That is your problem. We told you one year ago, Let us work together, but you said, We do not need assistance. Now, you are going on your own. Let us work together and protect the Labour GSP. American Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Kit Bond wanted to assist the least-developed countries and 14 countries were given duty-free access to the USA. That is where 60 per cent of our garment products are sent. Now what has happened? They have excluded Sri Lanka by saying, Unless you comply with such and such regulations, you will not be able to get that benefit. We must work together. You, in the Government and we, in the Opposition must work together and protect that. Likewise, we say that it is paramount that you get the IMF loan. We told you that we would assist you. We told you, Do not go to the HSBC. We told you, Do not go to the ICICI bank. Let us work together. Go to the World Bank; go to the IMF. These are the multilateral agencies lending money to all countries. But what has happened? You went to the HSBC, paid an interest rate of 9 per cent and have got stuck in a debt trap today. So, work for the IMF loan. Let us work together. Do not scorn just because it comes from the Opposition. That is the problem. So, while it is being mentioned that the exchange rate is one effective mechanism, the next one is - as I said 35 , 35 . . , 105 . . . ? . 35 . . . .

An impetus was given for export diversification in 1977 which went through textiles, ceramic-ware, footwear, flora and fauna. But, there has been no diversification since then. Now, 61 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product of this country is coming from the service industry where the shipping industry plays a pivotal role. But, what has happened today? The shipping industry has been caught up with a competitor problem. Our port is a very competitive place for Sri Lanka. You have the Klang Port on one side, Singapore on the other and the Fujairah Port on another side. We have got caught up in this situation and have become uncompetitive. If we charge from a shipping line Dollars 250 per container and if Singapore charges Dollars 300 and if they do 50 containers and we do 30, then there is no point in our charging Dollars 250. That has been the problem. So, as the Minister in charge of the BOI, this comes under your purview. You must ensure that you look into this. The Indian Sethusamudran project is coming in and our shipping industry will be in dire straits. Likewise is the Airline industry. We must ensure that we take advantage of the open skies. India is going into that. India, a country that ensures that no foreign investments come into strategic investments, has permitted foreign airlines to come into that country. Our co-investments should be re-looked at. Our little Sri Lanka should only lay emphasis - from my point of view and our Party's point of view - on value addition and job creation. That is what you have got to do. What we are trying to do is what America and Europe are trying to do. That is to bring in strategic investments that will never come into Sri Lanka. Let us get on to the basics. Hundreds of jobs can be created by the small and medium industries. You should lay emphasis on that. You do not need to wait for a budget to bring in those things. You do not need to have separate investments coming in. You only need to correct the vast anomalies that exist on the investment side. All I say is, just visit the BOI investors. I am sure you will get the necessary answers that you require. Go to Biyagama. You will find that there are a lot of domestic problems. The local authorities are charging exorbitant fares. They say

4 PL 004077 (2009/06)

603 604

sometimes it is more expensive than what is being charged in Europe. Now, that is the problem because at the end of the day they bring in the labour input and when they have got to pay such a huge amount of charges, it becomes unproductive.

So, Hon. Minister, all we have got to say is, you are giving legal effect to one particular aspect, the film industry, that needs to be protected. But, I am sure you need to have a complete overall of what is in this particular Bill. This country has about 16 per cent of the taxes coming in from the GDP which is quite a high amount of revenue being generated. You should bring that down to around 12 or 13 per cent. The reason is that there are no investments coming in. You are only regenerating the savings in the country and that is what needs to be corrected. So, your export diversification should be looked at from the textile industry.

Another classic example is, as at 1st of January, 2005 - I am sure the BOI can give you information - my reckoning is that there were 785 companies in the apparel industry. Now, it has come down to 202 companies. Why is it? Because we are uncompetitive. So, we have to ensure that we become competitive. It is not that we cannot. We are supposed to be the best needlepoint textile country in the world because our efficiency, our labour input, our commitment and our knowledge are par excellence. But, what happens is, the additional cost which the Government puts in makes it uncompetitive.

There are artificial eyelashes being produced by a company in Sri Lanka. They had about 8,000 employees working at the SS International (Pvt.) Limited in Nuwara Eliya. What has happened? They have reduced the number of employees to 1,200 and 7,000 of them have gone to Indonesia. Indonesia has trebled that number to almost 21,000. Why has this happened to us? Because there is no competitiveness.

You impose PAL and all these charges and you get the money. Well and true! But, when you put 1/2 per cent on a billion and 2 per cent on a hundred thousand, then what is the purpose? Those are the things that need to be corrected. Now, the National Defence Levy can be taken off or you can give it to the forces as a salary increase because that is rightfully their dues. You need to get the anomalies corrected.

Hon. Minister, I think there is a necessity to ensure that you have a national economy drawn and that has to be developed with a political party that thinks alike. You cannot have extremist elements with you who want to see that you blast the Western countries and on the other hand try to export to the West. How ludicrous is this? You cannot tell Europeans, Do not come here, but please buy the exports from our country.

So, Hon. Minister, these are the problems. These are the differences. You have a political party that had seen the writing on the wall much earlier. Just because we are able to see that, Sir, it does not mean that you must stymie my voice at this moment. I am only assisting the Hon. Minister.

Hon. Member, please wind up. Your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, Hon. Minister, instead of bashing the West, you must get the Western countries to buy them.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Get the American support for duty-free access and ensure that you incorporate all this and bring in a new legislation. We will support this to ensure that the countrys investments are protected. Thank you. [. . 11.02] ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon.

We are drawing out capital from the open market through Treasury Bills. That is how we are financing the war. We are not financing the war through foreign grants. We are financing the war with capital that we get through open market operations, particularly through Treasury Bills being bought by the Government and the liquidity is sucked up by the Government. That is why the interest rates go up. You must have high interest rates to keep inflation down. So if you do not have a war situation, the liquidity that is there in the open market can be used by the private sector. So what is the Government doing? The Government is going and taking that money to finance the war. If you do not utilize that money for the war, you can have subsidies, you can have stimulus packages. But, what is the Government doing? The political direction, the political priority of the Government is the war. And, we have quite rightly addressed the war and finished the war. So now you are going into a situation where you can breathe normally, where the interest rates will come down and the Government will be in a position to offer stimulus packages because there will be a saving. If you have spent US Dollars two billion on the war during the last financial year, now we will at least save about 25 per cent. I am not saying immediately the war cost will come down because the recurrent expenditure is there to pay salaries for the Army and for the Navy. But, immediately there will be savings on the capital expenditure and you can offer a stimulus package. So I think - . stimulus package . . . - - .

ANURA PRIYADARSHANA YAPA Member of Parliament MINISTER OF ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT & INVESTMENT PROMOTION MINISTER OF MASS MEDIA & INFORMATION 05/03/2009 Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabral Governor CENTRAL BANK Janadhipathi Mawatha COLOMBO 01

My Dear Governor CONCESSIONS TO BE GRANTED TO MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY INCLUDING APPAREL SECTOR The Global Economic Crisis has seriously affected the industrialists and the economy which has resulted in severe reduction of export orders, cutting down costs, laying off of employees and closure of businesses and thereby slow down the economic activity. Having consulted the industrialists and considered the difficulties encountered by them, I wish to propose the following concessions for the manufacturing industry including apparel sector for consideration.

1. Grant a moratorium of six (06) months from March 2009 to April 2010, in respect of outstanding credit facilities to manufacturing sector companies and the holding companies of such industries, provided that the companies concerned retain their employees at levels prevailing as at December 2008. 2. Recover the capital and interest falling due during the moratorium period, from April 2010 onwards in thirty-six equal installments and a concessionary rate of interest be charged for this facility. 3. Waive the penal interest imposed on any defaulted credit facilities taken by the companies, and the holding companies of such manufacturing companies. 4. Continue to maintain any non-performing loans in the same category for provisioning purposes during the 12 months moratorium period. It is noted that similar concession has been granted to the Tourism Industry. Yours sincerely Anura Priyadarshana Yapa Minister of Enterprise Development & Investment Promotion

If they do not implement it during that period, we tell them that that is a bogus thing and we are not going to go ahead with it. We tell them that, because within the stipulated time they have to start the project.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)

That is what I am talking about. You said that you have approved 319 companies this year. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)

We have a programme; 300 factories programme. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)

I do not know. You said that 319 projects have been approved. 2009 . [ ] . This is not a bogus report. This is an actual report given by the people in your Ministry. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)

I think you are getting mixed up. Are you talking about the "300 Factories" programme or the 116 projects that have come to the BOI which have been suspended? ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)

Yes.
