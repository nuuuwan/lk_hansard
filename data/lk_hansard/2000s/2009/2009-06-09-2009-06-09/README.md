( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena - Minister of Mass Media) Sir, I would like to raise a matter of Privilege with regard to an attempt to deprive me of my Seat in Parliament. I table* two letters dated 24th April, 2009 and 29th April, 2009 addressed to me by the United National Party and the said letters are self-explanatory. I have been informed by these letters that the Party has sent corresponding letters to the Secretary - General of Parliament as well.

The contradictory positions taken up in the said two letters create an ambiguity with regard to my Parliamentary Seat and I apprehend that the said confusion is created deliberately in order to deprive me of my Seat in Parliament illegally and arbitrarily. In as much as my privileges as a Member of Parliament are affected by the aforesaid, I respectfully seek your indulgence to have the matter referred to the Committee on Privileges for a due inquiry into the matter. Thank you, Sir. * : : Letters tabled : United National Party 29th April, 2009

- . ; ; . . , . -2004 - . , . 2006 2008 . . , , . . At the beginning, Sir, I would like to quote what the President stated in his Address to the Nation. In that he says, I quote: As a nation we have to go very far to make our independence complete. Terrorists were able to get the world to bring pressure on us, a free and sovereign State. That was possible because the terrorists had the capability to bring pressure on those governments. Therefore, it is necessary to begin a new era in foreign relations to safeguard my motherland. Having won the freedom of our motherland, we must next establish our freedom and sovereignty internationally. We are not a carbon copy of any other country. Our country that gave courage to Asia by defeating terrorism that could not be defeated elsewhere in the world should be made the 'Pride of Asia'. , , . President Mahinda Rajapaksa heralded a new era in Sri Lankas international relations when he addressed the nation at the Victory Day Parade on 3rd June at the Galle Face Green, where he stated the words I quoted. I stand in this august House today to join our fellow Members to pay our collective and humble tribute to our brave security forces who have laid down their lives for the defence of our Motherland, in order to enable all of us to breathe the air of freedom once again after living under the dark shadow of terrorism that has plagued our nation for almost three decades. I take this opportunity to echo the sentiments of President Rajapaksa in his Address to the Nation to gratefully acknowledge the support of the international community in protecting our freedom and sovereignty. I quote His Excellency the Presidents words: We have also been able to build genuine good relations with the international community. These honest friends have carried out the

209 210

greatest responsibility towards our freedom and sovereignty in this era. We value very much the assistance we received from all these countries at this moment. Our people who enjoy the satisfaction of freedom together with them must always have in their hearts the friendship extended by these friends from overseas. Even at the risk of repetition, I believe it is incumbent upon me to recapitulate the action taken by members of the international community to curb the manifold activities of the LTTE abroad. India, the United States, the United Kingdom, the 27-member European Union and Canada have all proscribed the LTTE as a terrorist organization. The ready support we have been consistently receiving from our friends in the international community has enhanced the capacity for our nations heroes - the brave members of the armed forces ably assisted by the police and the civil defence force - to achieve this historic and comprehensive victory over LTTE terrorism. Our quiet diplomacy triumphed in being able to secure an uninterrupted supply line to meet the procurement needs of our armed forces, the diplomatic clearances that were vital in obtaining over-flight rights to transport urgent supplies by air, the intelligence received from friendly countries that made it possible for our navy to intercept and destroy the floating arsenals of the LTTE, which were a tangible manifestation of our highly successful and constructive engagement with the international community in eliminating the menace of terrorism from the shores of our island. As I pointed out at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, a high profile defence and security diplomacy forum in Asia, at the end of last month, Sri Lanka would undoubtedly enter the annals of history as a classic textbook example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism while tenaciously upholding our time-honoured and cherished values of democracy and human rights that have been so profoundly imbued in the lifeblood of our nation. Thus, we find it utterly despicable and quite frankly appalling to be confronted with wholly unsubstantiated and ludicrous allegations bandied about on civilian casualties and calls for a so-called "war crimes" investigation. For the record, let me boldly and quite categorically state that the conduct of our armed forces throughout the period of the latest and the most decisive phase of engagement against the LTTE, has been exemplary. We, as Sri Lankans, can be truly proud of our uniformed men and women, who are a role model for militaries around the world. Both in the prosecution of the hostilities against the LTTE as well as in the post-conflict operations catering to the humanitarian needs of the IDPs, our security forces have exemplified the noble and sublime values of all the great religions and cultures that co-exist peacefully amidst our people. The hallmark of the military operations has been the humanitarian

element that underpinned the successful outcome that we bear witness today and acknowledged by the Opposition. If there is an iota of truth in these fanciful allegations against our security forces, how does one account for the thousands of civilians who literally braved the bullets of the LTTE and fled across the frontlines in Mullaitivu during the final weeks of the armed conflict? The overwhelming support Sri Lanka registered at the 11th Special Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva last month is a clear endorsement by the international community of the correctness of our Governments approach in combating terrorism. Thus, the attempts by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to second-guess and call into question the majority vote for the Resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and friendly countries is quite unbecoming of the neutrality and impartiality of the high office she occupies. Clearly, the Commissioner has overstepped her mandate and it is our sincere hope that her personal opinion and prejudices would not cloud her judgment of issues that she may be less informed or familiar about. The Government of Sri Lanka has reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with international human rights standards and its own international obligations. In the Joint Statement issued by the Government and the UN - Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne, I am referring to the Joint Statement - at the conclusion of the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moons visit to Sri Lanka last month, the Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of the international humanitarian and human rights law while the Government stated its intention to take measures to address those grievances within the legal framework of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has a long and well-established tradition of a robust, independent and activist judiciary. Thus, our legal system is endowed with full powers to adjudicate upon any complaints brought to its attention by aggrieved parties and dispense effective remedies. The priority and the greatest challenge that confronts the Government right now is to address the humanitarian needs of the almost 300,000 IDPs who are being accommodated in the welfare villages and IDP centres and to expeditiously resettle them in their places of origin. This process of reconciliation will culminate in their political empowerment whereby they would be able to freely elect their own political representation after being denied their democratic freedom for almost three decades due to LTTE terrorism. Let me also go into the issues that have now come up for us in the international arena. Still, the LTTE activists the world over are targeting our Buddhist temples; they are targeting some of our Missions. The LTTE, internationally well lubricated by enormous amounts of resources at their command, at their disposal is finding

[ ]

2009 09 211 212

channels in order to highlight its terror character. This resembles the attacks on our Buddhist temples and Buddhist centres in Canada, France, the United Kingdom and also on our Missions in the Hague, France and also in Canada, where we were able to get adequate protection at the time from the respective Governments, for which we are grateful. We are also mindful of the need for us to go after the ones who have been responsible for generating funds for the LTTE. It is now public knowledge of our efforts seeking the arrest of K. Pathmanathan, a fugitive, a person wanted and is in the red list of the Interpol and who has been responsible for the LTTE's international network. We have called for his arrest. I have personally handed over the arrest documents to my counterparts in some of the countries during the past two weeks. We are also seeking for the other activists who are responsible for child recruitment, for decorating the youth of the LTTE, the cadres with cyanide capsules around their necks and also for giving a wider dimension to the terror activities both locally and internationally. In answer to what the Hon. Member asked, how we are going to engage with the Tamil community both here and overseas, I must state, , we are completely engaged with the Tamil diaspora. We want to encourage more and more Tamil people living overseas, who could not live in Sri Lanka due to the LTTE's presence in the Northern part, to come back and settle in pursuit of a life in Sri Lanka. Our Government has gone on record, our President has gone on record to say that he calls the international Tamil community of Sri Lankan origin to come back to Sri Lanka and this appeal was made from the House when His Excellency the President addressed the House the other day. This is the type of process we are currently engaged in. We do not want to be away from the needs of our people in the North and we cater to the needs of our people in the IDP camps. They will soon find permanent settlement in their respective villages. We also want to engage with the international community because we are transparent to the world at large. We want to have a wider engagement with the international community in terms of the national agenda our President has laid down for the settlement of this issue and total integration of our country as one nation. With these words I conclude and thank the Hon. Deputy Speaker for the opportunity extended to me. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . .

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

In the name of Allah, the most beneficent and the most merciful. Venerable Presiding Member, I am thankful to you for giving me this opportunity to participate in the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. Let me attempt to continue from where I concluded in my last speech in this House on the current situation in this country, where I quoted Winston Churchill as saying, In war : resolution. In defeat : defiance. In victory : magnanimity. In peace : goodwill. In the last few weeks we have seen celebrations of an unprecedented nature in this country and I started to question whether it is acceptable in a Buddhist land and if it is in keeping with the precepts of Buddhism. But, I decided to approach it differently after having listened and read many times the speeches made by President Barack Obama, both in Normandy and in Cairo. I was so overawed by them that I took it upon myself, with due credit to him, to take extracts from it and put it into a Sri Lankan perspective. Why is all this fuss about a war fought against our own brothers and sisters? What is it about the violent and brutal struggle that took place up North that brings us to celebrate the death of thousands of innocent and not so innocent citizens of our land? Part of it, I think, is the size of the odds that weighed against success. For three decades no government had ever seriously attempted to move into the Vanni, the heart of Tigerland and it had never been more difficult. The sheer improbability of this victory is part of what makes this victory so memorable. It also arises from the clarity of purpose with which this war was waged - to eradicate terrorism from our land. No man who shed blood or lost a brother or sister would say that war is good. But, we all know that this war was essential. For what we faced in LTTEs totalitarianism was not just a battle of competing interests. It was a competing vision of this country. The LTTE ideology sought to subjugate and humiliate and exterminate. It perpetrated murder on a massive scale,

fuelled by a hatred of those who were deemed different and therefore inferior. It was evil, and being a sworn opponent of war, I still salute the heroic men and women who made it possible. We live in a country of competing beliefs and claims about what is true. It is a country of varied religions but complementing cultures. We have made our share of mistakes and we have not always agreed with one another on every issue. But, whatever God we prayed to, whatever our differences were, we knew that the evil we faced had to be stopped. Citizens of all faiths and of no faith came to believe that we could not remain as bystanders to the savage perpetration of death and destruction. That is why I, being an opponent of war, always maintained that force had to be met with force. Some just refuse to heed to anything else as the LTTE showed. In the end I believe, these celebrations are meant to tell our stories. It does not have to be something big, just a little story about what happened - so people do not forget. We cannot forget. What we must not forget is that this war was a time and a place where the bravery and the selflessness of a few was able to change the course of our country. At an hour of maximum danger, amidst the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary. They fought for all of us. And, they fought out of a simple sense of duty - a duty sustained by the same ideals for which their forefathers had once fought together to attain our freedom from foreign rule. It is a story that has never come easy, but one that always gives us hope. For, as we face down the hardships and struggles of our time and arrive at that hour for which we were born, we cannot help but draw strength from those moments in history when the best among us were somehow able to swallow their fears and secure a victory over terror. Lyndon Johnson once said that there are certain moments when "history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in mans unending search for freedom". Having come to this historic moment, we now face the future, which is daunting, to say the least. If we let this moment pass and we flounder and fail to grasp the opportunity, we will be cursed by generations to come. President Barack Obama is quoted as saying: Human destiny ... is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance. Our history has always been the sum total of the choices made and the actions taken by each individual man or woman. It has always been up to us. I am a firm believer as I have stated on many occasions in the past that our fate is the cumulative result of all decisions taken by us in the past whether

consciously or unconsciously. My attention was drawn to the editorial on page 8 of The Island newspaper this morning captioned, "Ruining Lankas chances of finding a solution." It states, I quote: Nothing could be more unfavourable to democracy than the unbridled militarisation of a society. That a country faced with war against a formidable enemy is compelled to unleash extremely ferocious forces perhaps disproportionate to the real threat is only too well known. And what needs to be done immediately after the conclusion of any military campaign is to put the genie back into the bottle, look after the war affected civilians and remove the politico-economic causes of the conflagration so that it wont recur. Regrettably, instead of helping Sri Lanka achieve these daunting tasks, the western powers have resorted to a course of action that militates against her normalisation and conflict resolution processes. An aid blockade they have slapped as part of a witch hunt and their campaign to press war crime charges against some Sri Lankan leaders by way of retaliation are fraught with the danger of leading to the country's politico-economic instability in this crucial postwar period. The worst affected by their action will be the war displaced who would face a double whammy, should the economy suffer a debilitating setback. The Rajapaksa government must honour its promise to find a political solution and obviate the root causes of the conflict which plagued the country for nearly three decades. Indias support, without which Sri Lanka could neither win the war nor withstand pressure from hostile international forces aligned with the LTTE, was conditional upon President Mahinda Rajapaksas personal commitment to a political settlement, which also made the western powers wary of going the whole hog to scuttle Sri Lankas war aimed at removing the biggest obstacle to peace - LTTE terrorism. Reneging on his promise or taking India for a ride is something President Rajapaksa cannot afford. The elimination of northern terrorism has strengthened the hands of southern extremists with a history of plunging the country into bloodbaths."

Hon. Member, please continue. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Sir, I would carry on with the quotation: "They are now on the warpath vowing to defeat even the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment while having representation in Provincial Councils and contesting elections to them!" "One may not like or agree with President Rajapaksa but one should grant that by liberating the country from the scourge of terrorism he has won the public confidence unlike any other leader in Sri Lankas recent history and is, therefore, in a position to find a feasible political remedy acceptable to all communities and ensure its implementation. To trip him at this juncture is to ruin Sri Lankas chances of putting the conflict behind her. Unfortunately that is exactly what some western governments blinded by animosity towards Sri Lanka, are trying to do!" I would also like to quote from the article titled, Reappraisal of political attitudes needed by Milinda Rajasekera which appeared in the Daily Mirror of Monday, 1st June, 2009. Sir, it states, I quote:

"In any event, what is more important today is to forge unity among different political parties to put the country on a new progressive track. While President Mahinda Rajapaksa has appealed for support and cooperation of all parties to accomplish the task, leader of the UNP Ranil Wickremesinghe has offered it. The JVP has also offered its cooperation submitting a 14-point plan. It is for the government now to formulate a practical plan to be implemented with the cooperation of all parties.

What would hinder moves to achieve such unity would be the usual practice of political opportunism. The UNP has already complained that it is being sidelined while the government parties bask in the victorious conclusion of the war.The government has to stop its criticism of the UNP if it is honestly concerned about obtaining the cooperation of all parties. Similarly, the antagonisms that prevail among other parties also have to be curbed. The type of tirade that NFF parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa mounted in parliament against his erstwhile JVP comrades has to be avoided if the desired national ends are to be achieved.

Our political leadership would do well to have a dip into the famous Gettysburg Address delivered by US President Abraham Lincoln after the American civil war. His concluding words were: that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

As long as our relationship as peoples of this Island is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people to achieve justice and prosperity. This cycle of suspicion and discord which has existed long before we attained Independence together must end. I believe that our country holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion or station in life, all of us share common aspirations to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our families, our communities and our God. These things we share. This is the hope of all humanity.

This is a difficult responsibility to embrace. For human history has often been a record of nations and tribes subjugating one another to serve their own interests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one group of people over another will inevitably fail. So, whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners of it. Our problems must be dealt with through partnership; progress must be shared. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said, I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power, the greater it will be. Just as we can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter our principles. The LTTE was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that its actions provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our ideals and religious beliefs. We should now take concrete action to change course, lest we perpetuate the culture of impunity. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. But, it was not violence that won them full and equal rights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the centre of Americas founding. Too many tears have flowed; too much blood has been shed. All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when our mothers can see their children grow up without fear, when Serendib is the place of peace that God intended it to be and when Sri Lanka is a secure and lasting home for all its peoples. I know that there are many among us - Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims - who are sceptical and who question whether we can forge this new beginning. Some are eager to stoke the flames of division and to stand in the way of progress. Some suggest that it is not worth the effort, that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply sceptical that real change can occur. There is so much fear, so much mistrust. But, if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward and I want to particularly say this to the young people of every faith in our country - you, more than anyone, have the ability to remake this country. All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether to commit ourselves to an effort, a sustained effort, to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings. It is easier to start wars than to end them. It is easier to blame others than to look inward; to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share. But, we should choose the right path, not the easy path.

There is also one rule that lies at the heart of every religion - that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. This truth transcends nations and peoples, a belief that is not new, that is not black or white or brown, that is not Buddhist, Hindu, Christian or Muslim. It is a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization and that still beats in the hearts of billions. It is a faith in other people, and it is what brought us here to this House. We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make the new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written. The Holy Qur'an tells us, "O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another." The people of Sri Lanka, of our Motherland, can live together in peace. We know that is what our Creator wills us and it is now up to us to have the courage and the will to forge together, forget our differences and unite as one to make our Motherland worthy of living for the generations to come. Thank you.
