Hon. Minister, this is brought to your attention be-cause the Government owes this money to the two banks, which means the money for the assets belonging to the Government was not paid. They had paid Rupees one million for facilitation and we do not know where that Rupees one million went; to whom it was paid. So, we

only asked that Question because the information given to my Colleaue is not all that correct. As he said, it was started during President Chandrika Kumaratungas time and would have been recommenced in a different way at another time. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris)

If you have a Question about financial transactions and loans that were taken from banks, I can look into that as-pect of the matter and give you an Answer.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Would you be able to tell us the status of Labour GSP at this particular moment ? . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris) No, that is not related to this. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is related to this. Your are the Minister in charge. So, I am asking a competent Minister. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris) I do not want to enter into a debate on that. But, the present position is this: the Government has consistently adopted the position that we will not submit the country to an investigation by a foreign government or a group of governments. So, that is very clear. We are not participat-ing in an investigation. That is ruled out. But, we have made an application for the extension of GSP Plus bene-fits for three years commencing from the 1st of January 2008 and we have instructed our Ambassador in Brussels to continue a dialogue with the relevant officials of the European Commission in order to place at their disposal any information which they require for the purpose of making a decision. This is an ongoing dialogue. That is happening at the moment. And, the final decision is going to be made before December this year. So the Govern-ment is interacting with the European Commission. That

is being done through normal diplomatic channels. The only thing that we are not doing is, submitting a sovereign country to an investigation by a foreign government. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I want to further add that we together protect the La-bour GSP in whatever way possible. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , 23 (2) .

[. 1.14] . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) ! . Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I listened to the speech made by the Hon. Minister this morning. I myself was an Agricultural Officer in the Sri Lanka Agricultural Service. I was thoroughly impressed by his speech. I have a few things to say. The Daily Mirror of yesterday carried a news item under the heading, I quote: Help SL Tamils to revive farming - Swaminathan. I have heard of Mr. M.S. Swaminathan. He is a researcher of a very high calibre. He is the Chairman of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation and a Member of the Rajya Sabha. He has said this at a meeting of the Agricultural College Coimbatore Old Students Association at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. He has told the Central Government of India as well as the State Governments to help these people. Sir, we have a farm in Karandiyan Aru. It is a big farm of 500 acres in extent. This was opened by the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake. The portfolio of the Minister of Agriculture is very important. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is here. His father was one of the best Ministers of Agriculture we ever had. I still remember that he brought in the Paddy Lands Act and because of this the peasant farmers of this country benefited a lot. Similarly, we want the Minister of Agriculture to be a statesman irrespective of cast, community or whatever. I want to emphasize about the Karadiyan Aru Farm. This

[ ]

2009 23 3009 3010

was opened by late Hon. D.S. Senanayake. It is 500 acres in extent. There is a tank particularly built for this farm. Later this was made a Regional Research Station like research stations in Angunakolapelessa and Mahailluppallama. They had an in-service training centre for the Eastern Province. They had a seed farm and a seed processing centre. Now, Sir, all these are damaged. Now the time is opportune. We know that agriculture is of prime concern and has become very important now. With the industrial development and the open economy in the 1970s, agriculture was not given its due place. You must take action to reopen this Research Station. Now, because this farm lies fallow, all the rich and affluent people are encroaching on it. Once we lose the paddy fields in this farm, we will never get them. You must listen to my speech because after taking a lot of trouble, I managed to get seven minutes today. You have to link the Karadiyan Aru Research Station with the Research Station of Coimbatore. I have been to that place sometime back. I may be from the East and you may be from Polonnaruwa, the North-Central Province. But, you must work as a statesman because we want food; we all must eat and live. The Hon. Anura Dissanayake who spoke previously said, Do not give extensive research work to the private sector. They are only profit-making bodies. We must spend more money. You are a very influential Minister. We know that you are the General-Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. You must get more money, spend more money on research, extensive research, training and education. Sir, last week also I went to Vavuniya. I visited one of the farms. We know most of the farms are running at a loss. But, this small farm is running at a profit. I bought a lot of planting material. What I am trying to say is that farm manager or whoever is in charge must be given some sort of an appreciation; he must be given a study tour or something like that. I bought red onions at Rs. 40 a kilo. When I came back I saw an advertisement in one of the daily newspapers stating that one of the supermarkets sell red onions at Rs. 95 a kilo. That was the cheapest price. There, I bought it at Rs. 40; in Colombo it is Rs. 95. So, something must be done to bring these prices down. Sir, I represent the Batticaloa District. As far as Batticaloa is concerned, the agrarian services sector is a very important one. I think about 80 to 90 per cent of people in Batticaloa are farmers, like in your constituency. We have 17 Agrarian Services Centres there. But, unfortunately we have only five Divisional Officers. So, the issue of fertilizer is very important, because fertilizer should be issued in time. This basal application must be given before they sow paddy. So, only with these five officers it is not possible. You have taken action to recruit DOs - Divisional Officers. What I am asking is, in the meantime, during this Maha Season, why do you not recruit or appoint some officers on contract basis? We will identify good people, recruit them for five or six months and sack them when you recruit new people. Sir, you must use your discretion and try to help these farmers in Batticaloa. This Divisional Officers problem is a big

problem, Sir. We want an engineer also for the Batticaloa Agrarian Services Centre. I only spoke in English so that you can respond to what I say. Those are important matters. I have another matter; I have noted that in Tamil and I will say that in Tamil. Before that, I want to add another remark in English. That is with regard to the appointment of Agricultural Research Production Assistants. From the day I came to Parliament, I was agitating for their appointment. I thank you, you have already gazetted it. It is a great achievement for us. Earlier for the North and the East, no appointments were made. Only you have taken the trouble to advertise it and I heard that a lot of applications have been received. I request you to expedite the appointment of these officers. We are not interested in who will be appointed, but please expedite these appointments.
