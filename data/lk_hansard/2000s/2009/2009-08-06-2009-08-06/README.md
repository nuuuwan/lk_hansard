: : LEGAL STATUS TO SRI LANKAN EXPATRIATE WORKERS IN ITALY : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , .

4,000 40,000 - - , . , . . . .

Hon. Speaker, I take the Floor to inform the House that the President of the Republic of Italy on 3rd August, 2009 signed the Anti-Crisis Bill together with the corrective amendments, which will come into effect 15 days after its publication in the official Gazette, which will be by the end of August, regularizing illegal expatriate workers coming under the categories of caregivers and domestic collaborators. This law will have

733 734

a noteworthy impact on the Sri Lankans who have overstayed in Italy and who are holding the jobs coming under the categories to which the law applies. The Italian Government decided that the possibility of regularization would not be extended to other categories of irregular workers. As you are aware, there is a large number of Sri Lankan expatriate workers in Italy and they form an important component of the foreign expatriate workers community in that country. They have contributed significantly to the Sri Lankan economy and also enhanced people-to-people contact between the two countries, particularly in the recent years. This development will augur well for Sri Lankas labour relations with Italy, a friendly country with which we have maintained close, time-tested and historic relations. According to this legislation, between 4,000 to 40,000 Sri Lankans living in Italy have the possibility of applying for a stay permit. There is a large number of Sri Lankans working as domestic aides and caregivers in Italian households. It is understood that they are well sought after having earned the confidence of their Italian employers. Therefore, Sri Lankan domestic workers have been extensively recruited to Italian households and they would stand to benefit from this measure. The Italian Minister of the Interior, Roberto Maroni and the Minister of Welfare, Maurizio Sacconi, originally presented a Bill to Parliament, which decreed that all foreigners who were illegally staying in Italy were committing a criminal offence. This permitted the authorities to detain such overstayers for a long period of time in order to assess their identity followed by imprisonment and deportation. The Sri Lankan Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Sri Lankan Embassy in Rome initially made representations to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing concern with regard to certain provisions of the Bill. This was on the basis of their possible incompatibility with the European Constitution. When the Bill was submitted to the Italian President, His Excellency Giorgio Napolitano, for his assent, due to reservations it was sent back to the Upper and Lower Houses for reconsideration. There had been opposition on this Bill from some political parties on the ground that it would have negative repercussions on the Italian economy as the Government would be required to find alternative methods of caring for the elderly and the disabled in Italy. Culminating from the objections raised by the diplomatic missions and political parties and considering the impact on the aged in Italy, the Italian Government amended the original Bill to regularize the stay of thousands of domestic aides or caregivers from non-EU countries in Italy. The procedure for this purpose entails

applications to be tendered to the Ministry of Interior between 1st and 30th September, 2009. The amendment also allows one stay permit per family unit or two stay permits for domestic aides or caregivers assisting individuals with serious disabilities or suffering from grave illnesses. In order to obtain a stay permit, the employer must prove that the domestic aide or caregiver has been employed before April, 2009. As a significant number of Sri Lankan domestic workers and caregivers will be in a position to apply for a stay permit to regularize their stay in Italy, it is expected that between 4,000 to 40,000 applications for new passports will be received by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Rome. To facilitate the applicants, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has requested that the Embassy in Rome remains open until 10.00 p.m. on working days. I am also prepared to extend the working hours at the Sri Lankan Mission in Rome even on weekends to facilitate this requirement. The evolution of the Anti-Crisis Bill is a significant achievement for some of the Asian countries which, on their own, lobbied the Italian authorities, the Catholic Church and the major Italian trade unions, who also supported the initiative of presenting the amendment. The Asian representations that spearheaded this initiative were those of Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Also, I must place on record my appreciation of the Ambassador and our Embassy staff in Italy who worked tirelessly in obtaining these concessions. Sir, this is a new dimension in our engagement with the European countries, where we have been able to get recognized as a country that is now engaged in community-related development in those respective countries as well. The benefit out of this concession to around 40,000 Sri Lankans is a landmark achievement in human resource mobilization from Sri Lanka to overseas locations, particularly to the European locations. , - - , , . , .

Governments overall vision documented in the Mahinda Chintana. Such policies had already begun to show satisfactory results from 2006 to the later part of 2008, including high output growth, declining inflation and public debt ratios, and a strong buildup of external official reserves. However, the intensification of the global financial crisis in September 2008 has reversed many of these favorable trends, and has had an adverse effect on market confidence. At the same time the end of the decades long conflict with the LTTE in May 2009 provides new opportunities and poses new challenges for Sri Lanka. The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) presents the plans and policies of the authorities of Sri Lanka for 2009-2011. In Support of the policies in the attached MEFP, the Government requests that the Executive Board of the Fund approve a Stand-By Arrangement with exceptional access in an amount of SDR 1,653.6 million (400 percent of quota). The Government of Sri Lanka believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on the implementation of the policies contained in the MEFP, and in advance of revisions to these policies, in accordance with the Funds policies on such consultation. In keeping with its policy of transparency, the Government has authorized the publication of the attached MEFP. Sincerely yours, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya Ajith Nivard Cabraal Actg. Minister of Finance and Planning Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES The slowdown in the global economy, coupled with declining export prices and capital outflows, is placing Sri Lankas recent economic and social progress under strain. The balance of payments outlook has worsened while the continued weak revenue performance is undermining fiscal deficit reduction. As a result, international reserves have declined and the fiscal deficit has exceeded budget targets. In addition, strains are appearing in the financial system. Without significant policy measures, international reserves could decline further while the public debt dynamics could become unfavorable. The objective of our program is to cushion the impact of global financial crisis on our economy and in particular its effects on the most vulnerable, consolidating our efforts to bring down inflation, and maintaining Sri Lankas strong record of economic growth over the past few years. The Program will be guided by the political and economic framework underpinning the Governments development plans as outlined in the Mahinda Chintana. In particular, the programwhich is expected to run through 2011 envisages (i) fiscal adjustment sufficient to reduce the central Government budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2011, consistent with our target under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and also bringing the CPC and CEB to break even by 2011 ; (ii) continued flexibility in the exchange rate (as announced in October 2008), while building up reserves to at least 3 1/2 months of imports by the end of the program period; and (iii) measures to preserve the soundness of the financial sector. The quantitative targets and structural policies underlying our program are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. I. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

1. The economic outlook for this year is challenging. Growth is projected to slow from 6 percent in 2008 to about 3 percent in 2009 on account of the worsening global environment and the fall in domestic demand. At the same time inflation, after reaching a high of 28 percent on a year-on-year basis in June 2008, decelerated sharply to one percent in June 2009 and is expected to remain in single digits in 2009 as a result

of recent monetary policy efforts and significantly lower commodity prices. Relatively lower oil prices, a sharp decline in imports, a steady flow of remittances, and continued flexibility in the exchange rate will allow the current account deficit to recover from 9 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 1 1/4 percent by end - 2009. 2. The economy should begin to recover in 2010 and beyond. Assuming a recovery in the global economic conditions and gradual normalization of economic activity in the North and the East of the country, we expect growth in 2010 to increase, while inflation is expected to remain low. Over the medium term, the macroeconomic and structural policies set out in the Mahinda Chintanain particular the measures aimed at reducing the cost of living, boosting infrastructure development by attracting foreign direct investment, and increasing competitiveness and productivity-should help accelerate economic growth. While the unusual uncertainty about global economic prospects poses a downside risk, the rebound in confidence following the end of the war could contribute to a stronger recovery than projected.

II. FISCAL POLICY 3. effective actions will be needed to reverse the declining trend in tax revenues (in percent of GDP) and bring the fiscal deficit in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Act and Government policy. The Governments fiscal framework targets a reduction in the overall central Government deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2011 to maintain macroeconomic stability. Deficit reduction will be supported by a strong tax effort, which will allow for higher spending on infrastructure and the social sectors. Specifically, the Government is committed to increasing tax revenue by at least 2 percent of GDP by 2011 with measures to broaden the revenue base, significantly reduce tax exemptions, and further improve tax enforcement. These will be coupled with measures to rationalize expenditure in some areas to allow room for spending on reconstruction over the medium term. 4. We aim to contain the overall Government deficit to 7 percent of GDP in 2009 compared with 6 1/2 envisaged in the 2009 budget. Without action, the budget deficit for 2009 would worsen considerably compared to the 7 3/4 percent outturn in 2008 because of the effects of the global crisis and the stimulus package announced in January 2009. A strong fiscal effort is necessary to achieve the program target of 7 percent of GDP in 2009 and reduce the budgets heavy reliance on domestic borrowing. As revenue measures will take time to put in place and yield results, the Governments adjustment program in 2009 will rely more on expenditure restraint, while ensuring vulnerable groups are protected. In total, revenue enhancing measures are expected to yield about 1/4 percent of GDP relative to the 2008 level, while expenditure rationalization will result in savings of about 1/2 percent of GDP. In the event of a revenue shortfall or expenditure overruns relative to the amounts envisaged for 2009 under the program, we will take prompt action to contain other current expenditure - including on goods and services and transfersor raise further revenue to safeguard the deficit target. How ever, any additional expenditure as a result of higher than expected external grants from our development partners will be accommodated within the program. 5. We have already taken a number of measures that demonstrate our commitment to our fiscal targets. We have introduced a nation building tax and raised excise taxes on liquor, cigarettes, and other consumer items. Moreover, we have issued directives to Government institutions to maintain strict controls on budget and to justify all cost overruns. Expenditure restraint together with declining international commodity prices will result in expenditure savings of about 1/2 percent of GDP. The budget will aim to preserve the allocations for capital spending and expenditure to protect the vulnerable groups in society. We have taken steps to limit the length and the scope of tax exemptions granted under the Board of Investment (BOI) Act and the Inland Revenue Act with the intention of broadening the tax base. In particular, beginning April 2008, current tax holidays for most projects granted under the BOI Act and the Inland Revenue Act are restricted to a maximum of three years from fifteen years previously. Moreover, these tax holidays will not be extended after they expire. This process of limiting exemptions will be reviewed in line with the recommendations of the tax commission (8).

6. Consistent with the Governments objective of substantially increasing tax revenue, a number of tax policy and administration measures are envisaged during the program period to further reduce the budget deficit to 5 percent in 2011. This effort will be facilitated by the full-year effect of the new revenue measures introduced in 2009 and expenditure rationalization as announced in the 2009 budget. Further, the Government has formed a Tax Commission to review current tax policy and to make recommendations on a comprehensive approach to improve the tax system aimed at the strengthening of tax collection , improve tax auditing and enforcement, and simplifying the tax system. In its proceedings, the Commission will draw on the required tax expertise and submit an interim report by mid - October 2009. The report will contain proposals for base broadening including further rationalization of income tax holidays under the Board of Investment for consideration in preparing the 2010 budget. We also intend to phase out temporary taxes, including import surcharges, as new revenue measures yield results. 7. Given the difficult eternal environment, financing of the central Government deficit during 2009 is expected to come mainly from domestic sources. In addition, we have approached some of our development partners and are in the process of discussing significant budget support. We will continue to explore options for private market external financing to supplement donor resources. However, to keep this financing consistent with the Governments goals of ensuring the public debt sustainability, we will limit such borrowing to less than US$ 1,750 million during the course of the program. The CBSL will work with the Ministry of Finance to improve its management of the Governments cash flow. 8. The Government recognizes that key state owned enterprises need to improve their performance and make a greater contribution to economic growth. The Governments policy is to ensure that state owned commercial enterprises run efficiently and do not rely on subsidies from the Treasury. Specifically, the aim is to ensure that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) break even by end 2011. We have already taken measures toward the achievement of this objective. With respect to the CEB, we raised tariffs by 35 percent in March 2008, and passed the Sri Lanka Electricity At in March 2009 which established an independent regulator for the sector, which should also result in management improvements in this sector. Further improvements to the cost structure of the CEB will be realized by shifting toward lower cost electricity generation. With respect to the CPC, we fully passed through increases in international oil prices by raising the domestic price of petrol. We will continue to monitor developments and take necessary measures to bring these enterprises to break even by 2011. In this regard, continuous assessments will be made of the operational cash flows of these enterprises and required adjustments will be made including to management and operations. Any subsidies will be targeted to vulnerable groups and transparently reflected in the Government budget. The Government has established a Joint Review Mechanism through a committee consisting of high-level representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the CEB, the CPC, and the CBSL, which will make appropriate recommendations on an ongoing basis, including on cash flow management, to the Government. The committee is expected to submit their report by end - August 2009. 9. We are also committed to developing a plan to address outstanding debts between the key state owned enterprises. The plan, which we intend to finalize by end-December 2009, will clearly identify all elements of circular debt including the identification and reconciliation of debts owed and due among the two largest state owned enterprises and a mechanism and timeframe for settling these debts. The Ministry of Finance will monitor and coordinate this exercise.

10. Reconstruction of the North and East and the protection of vulnerable groups adversely affected by the conflict will be an integral part of our program. To this end the government has moved quickly to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict and to develop a post-war reconstruction plan. The immediate priority is addressing the humanitarian needs of the estimated 280,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). The government aims to resettle 70-80 percent of IDPs by the end of the year. The resettlement plan involves restoring basic services including water, electricity, health services, and education, and the development of economic and social infrastructure in

consultation with local officials and communities in the affected areas. Work is also underway on a broader reconstruction plan for the Northern province. A newly established Presidential task Force is leading this effort. A consultative committee of humanitarian assistance - which includes representatives from the international community - has also been set up to advise on issues relating to humanitarian assistance and the provision of basic services to IDPs. Key elements of the reconstruction plan include restoration of law and order, conducting local government and provincial council elections - the first of which are scheduled to take place in August and the rebuilding of essential infrastructure. 11. Reconstruction spending needs in the years ahead will be considerable. In 2009 the government intends to make room within the programmed deficit targets for spending on humanitarian assistance and the resettlement of IDPs using savings in existing budget provisions, redeployment of certain categories of military personnel for demining and for the provision of basic infrastructure, and any external grants from our development partners. About two percent of the projected government spending will be used for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the resettlement of displaced persons. A needs assessment is expected to be completed by end July 2009 to determine additional funds needed for the broader reconstruction strategy. Needed funds will be found both through savings in military spending beginning with the 2010 budget, and external financing in the form of concessional loans and grants from our development partners.

III. EXCHANGE RATE AND MONETARY POLICY 12. The Central Bank of Sri lanka (CBSL) has allowed greater flexibility in the exchange rate to facilitate the needed adjustment to the global financial and economic crisis while rebuilding its international reserves. Consistent with this objective, the CBSL intends to allow the necessary flexibility in the exchange rate to build up international reserve coverage to at least 3 1/2 months of imports by the end of the program, and will limit its intervention to smooth volatility in the foreign exchange market. the Government will continue to pursue other steps to build reserves including bilateral swaps and the sale of diaspora bonds. At the same time, the Government it committed to staying current on all its external debt obligations. Monetary policy will aim to control inflation while ensuring the adequate provision of resources to the private sector. 13. The CBSL will continue to implement and effective monetary policy framework, Reserve money will continue to be the nominal anchor and policy interest rates will also be adjusted as appropriate to signal the stance of monetary policy. We have already harmonized the penal rate for commercial bank borrowing from the CBSL and the reverse repo rate and removed restrictions on commercial banks access to the repo and reverse repo facility. This has established and explicit corridor for money market interest rates and has allowed the CBSL, to more effectively maintain stability in short-term interest rates. 14. During the program period we will not intensify existing exchange restrictions or introduce any new restrictions or multiple currency practices. Temporary restrictions imposed by the CBSL, in October and November 2008 on margin deposit requirements on importation of vehicles and selected consumer goods and on forward sales and purchases of foreign exchange were removed in March and April 2009.

IV. Strengthening The Financial System 15. We will put in place a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the financial sector, to build confidence, and to address recent problem. The swift action by the CBSL with respect to Seylan Bank restored confidence in the bank. As part of the ongoing process to deal with the Seylan Bank issue, the CBSL has directed the Bank to issue an appropriate number of voting shares to generate a capital infusion of around Rs. 3 billion by end-August. This would ensure that the bank meets the minimum capital adequacy requirement by end-December 2009. At the same time, the CBSL will continue to implement the eight point stimules package for finance and leasing companies with the aim of avoiding spillovers to healthy financial institutions.

16. The CBSL will continue to improve financial sector regulation. Prudential regulations have already been strengthened by adopting Basle II capital adequacy framework introducing a new share ownership policy for banks; issuing a mandatory direction on corporate governance; issuing a revised direction on loan classification, provisioning and income recognition including imposing a one percent general provision on outstanding loans; and issuing a direction on maximum amount of accommodation. To further strengthen financial sector regulation, the CBSL aims to ensure banks compliance with all regulations including capital adequancy, exposure limits and foreign exchange net open position limits by end-2009. Also, given the expected slowdown in economic activity and potential rise in non-performing loans, the CBSL, will instruct all banks to have adequate capital to cover future losses in line with international best practice in loss recognition. We have already taken steps to raise the capital requirement of finance companies, and intend to raise capital requirements in the insurance sector as part of the proposed Insurance Companies Act.

17. The CBSL will also address gaps in the supervisory framework. To that end, the CBSL intends to issue guidelines to improve banks integrated risk management frameworks and reinforce the ability of the CBSL to perform consolidated supervision. To broaden the scope of financial sector supervision, greater clarity for the CBSLs legal authority in enforcing regulations on the deposit taking financial institutions will be introduced through an amendment to the Finance Company Act by end-December 2009 and Banking Act by June 2010. With respect to the Banking Act, the Monetary Board will approve a draft amendment by end-September 2009 as an interim measure. The proposed amendment to the Banking Act will also strengthen the definition of large exposures and related party lending to better capture all meterial risks . The CBSL intends to issue prudential regulations and guidelines to credit card companies and payment service providers during 2009.

18. The CBSL intends to put in place a framework for the orderly workout of problem banks and finance companies to preserve financial stability. The proposed amendment to the Banking Act and Finance Company Act will address weaknesses in the current law with regard to the liquidation and acquisition processes to strengthen viable institutions, and introduce measures to encourage the unwinding of unviable ones. We also aim to make the Finance Company Act and the Banking Act compatible with the new Companies, Act. Finally, the

CBSL will further improve its contingency plan for addressing any future financial sector instability and further strengthen its intervention procedures. The improved plan will also develop an approach to dealing with potential stresses in banks and finance companies.

V. OTHER POLICIES 19. A safeguards assessment, which found that the CBSL, has developed its safeguards in many respects and has a relatively strong safeguards framework, was concluded in May. We welcome the findings and conclusions of the safeguards, report and the CBSL will work with the IMF staff in the coming months to implement the recommendations outlined in the safeguards assessment report with a focus on the priority recommendations in the areas of external audit and data reporting. VI. RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES

20. The current global economic environment is uncertain, bringing economic and financial risks to the program. Key risks include a sharper-than-anticipated economic slowdown in trading partner countries which would slow export growth further, a fall in remittances inflows, and capital outflows. If these risks materialize, the Government stands ready to adjust its polices, in close consultation with IMF staff, to ensure the achievement of a sustainable external position by the end of the program period. Finally, in the event of a potentially disruptive movement in the nominal exchange rate against the U. S. dollar in either direction, the authorities will consult with Fund staff on the appropriate policy response. VII. PROGRAME MONITORING 21. The program will be subject to quarterly reviews with quarterly performance criteria as set out in the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU), Completion of the first two reviews scheduled for September 2009 and November 2009 will require observance of the quantitative performance criteria for end-July 2009 and end-September 2009, respectively, as specified in Table 1. The first two reviews will also assess progress towards observance of the structural benchmarks specified in Table 2. 22. The Government authorizes the IMF publish this Letter of Intent and its attachments, Tables 1. 2 and 3.

(Quota) 400 . . International Monetary Fund IMF Announces Staff-Level Agreement with Sri Lanka on US$ 2.5 Billion Stand-By Arrangement Press Release No. 09/265 July 20, 2009 Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Managing Director of the Interna-tional Monetary Fund (IMF), issued the following statement on Sri Lanka today: An IMF staff mission reached agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on an economic program that could be supported by a 20-month Stand-By Arrangement for an amount equivalent to SDR 1.65 billion (about US$2.5 billion). The program is expected to be considered by the Executive Board on July 24. The approval by the Executive Board would enable Sri Lanka to draw an amount equivalent to SDR 206.7 million (about US$313 million) immediately. Persistently high budget deficits have forced the government to rely on short-term financing from international markets. The global financial shock resulted in a sudden stop to this financing, capital outflows, and a significant loss of Sri Lankas international reserves. Despite recent capital inflows, international reserves remain at low levels. The end of the conflict provides Sri Lanka with a unique oppor-tunity to undertake economic reform and reconstruction, which would be key to laying the basis for higher economic growth in the years ahead, To this end, the government has formulated an ambitious program aimed at restoring fiscal and external viability and addressing the significant reconstruction needs of the conflict-affected areas. The IMF staff supports this program, specifically The governments goals of rebuilding reserves, reducing the fiscal deficit to a sustainable level, and strengthening the financial sec-tor. It is also essential that the program cushion the most vulner-able from the needed adjustment. The reconstruction effort will be a large undertaking, with sig-nificant spending needs. The governments program aims to meet these needs while safeguarding debt sustainability by boosting revenue and reducing spending in other areas. This program will also provide a framework for International donors to assist the government in financing its reconstruction effort. The strong measures that the authorities are taking under the program Justify the exceptional level of access to Fund resources-equivalent to 400 percent of Sri Lanka quota in the IMF. I would like to call upon the Sri Lankan authorities to work with the donor community to ensure an adequate level of financing for the re-construction effort to lay the foundation for future growth.

Upon the Executive Boards approval, an amount equivalent to SDR 206.7 million (about US$322.2 million) becomes immediately available to Sri Lanka. The remaining amount will be phased in, subject to quarterly reviews. The total amount of IMF resources made available under the arrangement equals 400 percent of the countrys quota. The key objectives of the authorities economic reform program supported by the Fund are to strengthen the countrys fiscal position while ensuring the availability of resources for much needed post-conflict reconstruction and relief efforts. The program is also intended to

rebuild international reserves and strengthen Sri Lankas domestic financial system, and to protect the most vulnerable in the country from the burden of the needed economic adjustment. The program aims to lay a strong macroeconomic foundation that will help the authorities approach the broader international community for financial support in post-conflict reconstruction. Following the Executive Board discussion on Sri Lanka, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman, Stated: The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on Sri Lankas economy. Persistently high budget deficits forced the government to rely on short-term financing from international markets. The global shock resulted in a sudden stop to this financing. Capital outflows and intervention by the central bank to prevent the exchange rate from depreciating exacerbated by a decline in demand for Sri Lankas exports-resulted in a significant loss of international reserves which, despite the recent rebound in capital inflows, remain very low. The governments ambitious program, supported by the IMF, intends to restore fiscal and external viability and address the significant reconstruction needs of the conflict affected areas, thereby laying the basis for future higher economic growth. Reducing the central government fiscal deficit, while preserving spending on health and education and protecting the most vulnerable in society from the economic downturn, is a central goal of the governments program. To that end, the authorities have put in place revenue enhancing measures and intend to introduce reforms to reduce tax exemptions and broaden the tax base beginning in the 2010 budget. This, together with savings on military spending and possible concessional donor financing, should help finance the considerable reconstruction spending needs. The program aims to rebuild reserves to prudent levels while allowing the flexibility in the exchange rate necessary to boost the competitiveness of Sri Lankas exports. At the same time, the central banks policies will aim to control inflation while ensuring adequate credit to the private sector. The government has also moved quickly to address vulnerabilities in the banking system, implementing a plan to recapitalize the troubled Seylan Bank. The government intends to develop a contingency plan to deal with potential stresses in the financial system and put in place measures to improve regulation and address financial sector supervisory gaps. The governments program will require difficult economic reform measures. Nevertheless, the government should take advantage of the opportunity created by the end of the conflict to ensure national reconciliation, restore macroeconomic stability, and promote strong and durable growth, Mr. Kato said. Recent Economic Developments

ANNEX Sri Lanka has been hit hard by the global economic and financial crisis. After years of reliance on short-terms financing from international markets to cover its fiscal deficit, Sri Kanka experienced a sudden stop

of international capital flows as the global crisis hit. The central banks initial efforts to keep the exchange rate form depreciating led to a significant loss of reserves, Despite a rebound in short-term capital inflows following the end of the conflict, reserves remain low and foreign exchange needs remain acute. The economic growth outlook has deteriorated with growth of around 3 percent expected this year compared to 6 percent in 2008. The financial sector has also been put under increasing stress as the economic slowdown takes its toll. The end of the conflict further added policy challenges to the authorities. the reconstruction and humanitarian relief efforts are a large undertaking. Significant spending priorities need to be met while debt sustainability is maintained. Program Summary

Against this background, the Sri Lankan authorities have embarked on a program of economic reform and post-conflict reconstruction. They have requested IMF financial assistance to support their efforts.

The program includes the following key elements:

* Fiscal policy: The program aims at reducing the central government budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2011, from a target of 7 percent of GDP this year, in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Revenue increasing measures include broadening the tax base, reducing tax exemptions and improving enforcement, which are coupled with measures to rationalize expenditures. Cuts in military and other expenditures will help make room for post-conflict reconstruction and relief spendings. * Exchange rate and monetary policy : The program envisions strengthening the countrys international reserve position and restoring external viability. Allowing greater exchange rate flexibility is also needed to facilitate external adjustment and ensure export competitiveness. * Social protection : With 15 percent of the population living below the poverty line and a large number of people in the North and East of the country displaced by the conflict, the program envisions protecting expenditures on social transfers to the countrys most vulnerable. Spending on post - conflict humanitarian assistance will be also secured through savings from spending cuts and external financing and grants from multilateral institutions and the donor community. * Financial system : To build confidence in the local financial system, the program includes measures to strengthen the banking system by improving the current regulatory framework and enhancing bank supervision.

Sri Lanka, which joined the Fund on August 29, 1950, has a quota of SDR 413.4 million (about US$644.4 million).

1. This Technical Memorandum of Understanding sets out a framework for monitoring the performance of Sri Lanka under the program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). It specifies the performance criteria and indicative targets (including adjustors) under which Sri Lankas performance will be assessed through quarterly reviews. Monitoring procedures and reporting requirements are also specified. The first review will take place on or after July 30, 2009, and the second review on or after September 30, 2009.

I. Fiscal Targets A. Performance Criterion on Net Domestic Financing of the Central Government

2. Net domestic financing (NDF) is defined as the change in net credit to the central government by the domestic banking system and the net change in holdings of treasury bills and other government securities by the domestic non-bank sector. For the purpose of program monitoring, the central government is defined to include line ministries, departments, and other public institutions, The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), state-owned enterprise, parastatals and other agencies that do not receive subventions from the central government are excluded from the definition of central government, NDF of the central government is defined as the sum of (i) net borrowing from the CBSL (ways and means advances, loans holdings of treasury bills, treasury bonds, and other central government bonds minus deposits) and (ii) net borrowing from domestic commercial banks and the domestic non-bank sector (loans, advances, holdings of restructuring bonds, and holdings of treasury bills and other central government securities minus deposits). In 2008 , NDF of the central government defined in this manner amounted to Rs. 314.3 billion. Of this amount, Rs. 195.2 billion was net borrowing from the domestic banking system, Rs. 114.8 billion was net borrowing from the domestic non-bank sector, and Rs. 4.2 billion was net borrowing from other sources.

The following adjustment will apply :

3. If the amount of external loans to the central government-as set out in Table 1-is higher/lower in rupee terms than assumed under the program, the cumulative ceiling on NDF of the central government will be adjusted downward/upward by the cumulative difference in external loans in rupees.

4. If the amount of external grants to the central government-as set out in Table 1-is lower in rupee terms than assumed under the program, the cumulative ceiling on NDF of the central government will be adjusted upward by the cumulative difference in external grants in rupees up to a limit of Rs. 5 billion.

5. If the amount of external debt service by the central government in rupee terms-as set out in Table 1-is higher/lower than assumed under the program, the cumulative ceiling in NDF of the central government will be adjusted upward/downward by the cumulative difference in external debt service payments measured in rupees.

6. If the amount of privatization proceeds to the central government in connection with the sale of central government assets-as set out in Table 2-is higher/lower than assumed under the program, the cumulative ceiling on NDF of the central government will be adjusted downward/upward by the cumulative receipt/reimbursement of any privatization proceeds. B. Indicative Target on the Sum of the Overall Balance of the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

7. The balance of the overall profit or loss position of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) from their operating income statements is measured from above the line on an accrual basis. At end-December 2008, the sum of that overall position of the CEB and CPC defined in this manner stood at Rs. 50 billion.

II. MONETARY TARGETS

A. Performance Criterion on Reserve Money of the CBSL

Reserve money of the CBSL consists of currency in circulation (with banks and with the rest of the public), financial institutions domestic currency deposits at the CBSL, and the deposits of following government agencies : the National Defence Fund (General Ledger Acc. No. 4278), the Buddha Sasana Fund A/C (General Ledger Acc. No. 4279); and the Road Maintenance Trust Fund (General Ledger Acc. No. 4281). At end-December 2008, reserve money defined in this manner stood at Rs. 268.4 billion.

The following adjustment will apply:

8. If any bank fails to meet its legal reserve requirement, the ceiling on reserve money will be adjusted downward to the extent of any shortfall in compliance with the requirement.

9. Changes in required reserve regulations will modify the reserve money ceiling according to the formula :

M = rB0 + r0 B + r B Where M denotes the change in reserve money, r0 denotes the reserve requirement ration prior to any change; B0 denotes the reservable base in the period prior to any change, r is the change in the reserve requirement ratio; and B denotes the immediate change in the reservable base as a result of changes to its definition.

III. EXTERNAL SECTOR TARGETS

A. Performance Criterion on Net Official International Reserves

10. Net official international reserves (NIR) is defined as (i) the difference between the gross foreign assets and liabilities of the CBSL and (ii) the balance of State Treasurys (DSTs) Special Dollar and Yen Revolving accounts, both expressed in terms of market values. Gross foreign assets of the CBSL consists of monetary gold; foreign exchange balances held outside Sri Lanka; foreign securities (valued in market prices); foreign bills purchased and discounted; the reserve position at the IMF and SDR holdings; and the Crown Agents credit balance. Excluded from gross foreign assets will be participation in international financial institutions; holdings of nonconvertible currencies, holdings of precious metals other than monetary gold; claims on residents (e.g. statutory reserves on foreign currency deposits of commercial banks and central bank foreign currency deposits with resident commercial banks) pledged, non liquid, collateralized or otherwise encumbered foreign assets (such as the governments war risk insurance deposit with Lloyds during 2001/02); and claims in foreign exchange arising from derivative transactions (such as futures, forwards, swaps and options). Gross foreign liabilities are all foreign currency denominated liabilities of the CBSL to non-residents; the use of Fund credit, Asian Clearing Union debit balance and commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options. In addition, NIR will include the balance of the DSTs Special Dollar and Yen Revolving accounts. DST accounts are foreign currency accounts held by the Treasury and managed by the CBSL as an agent of the government. At end-December 2008, NIR defined in this manner stood at U. S. dollars 1,424.9 million. The following adjustment will apply : 11. If the amount of foreign program financing and the cumulative net change in the amount of foreign holdings of Treasury Bills or Treasury Bonds-as set out in Table 3-is higher/lower in U. S. dollar terms than assumed under the program, the floor on NIR will be adjusted upward/downward by the cumulative differences on the test date. 12. If the amount of official external debt service by the central government in U.S. dollar terms-as define in Table 3-is higher/lower than assumed under the program, the floor on the NIR will be adjusted downward/upward by the cumulative difference in official external debt service payments. 13. The floor on NIR will be adjusted upwards by any repayments for the foreign currency loan from the CBSL by the Bank of Ceylons and the Peoples Bank in excess of the repayment schedule in Table 4. 14. The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward for any increase in Sri Lankas allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) from the IMF. Sri Lanka s SDR allocation at the time of approval of this arrangement amounted to SDR 70.868 million. B. Performance Criterion on Contracting and Guaranteeing of Medium and Long Term Non-Concessional External Debt by the Government 15. A continuous performance criterion applies to contracting and guaranteeing of medium and long-term non-concessional external debt by the Government. For the purpose of this performance criterion, the Government is defined as the central government (as defined in 2) and the CBSL. The term debt will be understood to mean a current, i, e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:

a. Loans, i, e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future;

b. Supplies credit, i, e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and c. Leases, i, e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one of more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of this agreement, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. Under the definition of debt set forth above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt will not give rise to debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt will not give rise to debt. Medium and long-term is debt with a maturity of one year or longer. Excluded from this performance criteria are purchases under the stand-by arrangement of the IMF.

16. Non-concessional borrowing is defined as borrowing with a grant element of less than 35 percent, following the methodology set out in SM/96/86. The discount rates used to calculate the grant element will be the six-month and ten-year Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) averages, as computed by the Strategy and Policy Review Department of the IMF. Six-month CIRRs are updated mid-February and mid-August (covering the six-month period preceding the date of update) and the ten-years CIRRS averages are updated mid-December (covering a period of ten years preceding the date of the update). Six month CIRRs averages are to be used for loans whose maturity is less than 15 years while 10-years CIRRs averages are to be used for loans whose maturity is equal or more than 15 years.

C. Performance Criterion on External Payment Arrears 17. A continuoes performance criterion applies to the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government (as defined in 2) or the CBSL. External payments arrears consist of external debt-service obligations (principal and interest) on debt as defined in 13 that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements. However, overdue debt and debt service obligations that are in dispute will not be considered as external payments arrears for the purpose of program monitoring.

IV. DATA REPORTING REQUIRMENTS 18. Sri Lanka shall provide the Fund, through reports at intervals or dates requested by the Fund, with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress of Sri Lanka in achieving the objectives and policies set forth in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.

Sri Lanka - letter of Intent, Memorandum of Economic and Finan-cial Policies, and Technical Memorandum of UnderstandingColombo, Sri Lanka, March 28, 2003 The following item is a Letter of Intent of the government of Sri Lanka, which describes the policies that Sri Lanka intends to implement in the context of its request for financial support from the IMF. The document, which is the property of Sri Lanka, is being made available on the IMF website by agreement with the member as a service to users of the IMF website. Mr. Horst Khler Managing Director International Monetary Fund Washington, D. C. 20431 Dear Mr. Khler : 1. The government of Sri Lanka has adopted an economic program for 2003-2006, which aims to reduce poverty through private - sector led growth. This strategy focuses on creating the conditions for a vibrant private sector and a sound fiscal position and for helping to establish lasting peace by relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (RRR) efforts. Our economic program is set out in the attached Memorandum on Eco-nomic and Financial Policies (MEFP), and the poverty Reduction Strat-egy Paper (PRSP). In support of this program, we are requesting a three - year PRGF arrangement in the amount of SDR 269 million (65 percent of quota) and concurrently a three year EFF arrangement in the amount of SDR 144.4 million (35 percent of quota)) 2. The governments believes that the policies set out in the attached MEFP and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program. However, it stands ready to take additional measures appropriate for this purpose, and will consult with the Fund in accordance with the policies of the Fund on such consultations. The government will conduct the first review of the PRGF-EFF arrangements with the Fund no later than September 30, 2003. 3. The government will provide the Fund with all the information in a timely manner as might be requested to monitor progress in implement-ing policies and achieving the objectives of the PRGF - EFF supported program. 4. Given our balance of payments need, at this stage, we also request an extension of repurchase expectations arising in the period July 2003 June 2004 to the obligations schedule. Sincerely yours,

/s/ /s/ Hon. K. N. Choksy Governor A. S. Jayawardena Minister of Finance Central Bank of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka - Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies for 2003 Under The Three Year Program of the PRGF - EFF Arrange-ments I. Introduction and Background 1. Sri Lanka today stands at a pivotal point in its history. After two decades of conflict, the recent progress in the peace process has raised hopes throughout the country that lasting peace may be fi-nally within reach. However, securing lasting peace is inextricably linked with improving economic conditions, and we need to succeed on both fronts if the aspirations of the people of Sri Lanka are to be fulfilled. To this end, we have launched a comprehensive economic reform and poverty reduction strategy (PRS) - Regaining Sri Lanka - with the aim to alleviate poverty by widening opportunities for the poor to benefit fully from accelerated private-sector led growth, eschewing the previous unsustainable policies of redistribution and transfers. 2. In the 2001, when the present government took office, the country was in the midst of a serious economic crisis. A series of shocksa global slowdown, an attack on Colombo airport, a severe drought, and policy deficiencies had resulted in severe macroeconomic im-balances (including a runaway fiscal deficit and ballooning public debt) and intense pressures on the exchange rate. To stabilize the economy, the previous government entered into a Stand - by ar-rangement (SBA). Although, the SBA met some of its key objec-tives (stemming reserves losses), the program went seriously off-course, particularly with the marked deterioration in the fiscal ac-counts. Thus immediately upon taking office, our priority was to bring the SBA - supported program back on track. This was achieved through several policy and structural reforms - including cutting defense spending, broadening the tax base, and improving tax administration. The final review of the SBA was completed in September 2002. 3. This memorandum describes the medium-term economic program during 2003-2006, in particular the economic and financial policies for 2003. The economic program builds on the reforms initiated under the SBA, and is guided by the objectives and overall strategy laid out in the PRS paper. II Medium - Term Framework and Policies 4. Regaining Sri Lankaour poverty reduction strategy program (PRSP) - identifies several factors that underlie Sri Lankas high poverty. Chief among these are inadequate growth-reflecting the continued dominance

of the public sector in the economy and barriers to productivity growth; unequal opportunities available to the poor due to geographical isola-tion and lack of economic integration, limited access to high quality education and basic services, and social exclusion and powerlessness; and the effects of the two-decade long armed conflict. In addition, low labor productivity in agriculture-due to a lack of clear land tenure rights and continued environmental degradation; barriers to urbanizationparticularly due to an over-regulated labor market, which has stifled growth of employment in the formal sector; and problems with govern-ance-especially in the politicization of poverty reduction programs and incomplete decentralization, have also played their part in keeping pov-erty high. 5. To adequately address these issues, the PRSP contains a broad reform agenda. Within this large agenda, we have reached understandings on the broad areas that will be supported by the Fund, the World Bank, the AsDB, and our bilateral donor partners. Under the PRGF-EFF-supported program, the main focus will be on structural reforms that remove barri-ers to productivity growth and encourage private-sector led develop-ment, restructure the public finances such that scarce resources are freed to redress the lack of

III. The Current Economic Setting

8. The economy is beginning to recover from the downturn in 2001 In 2002, GDP grew by an estimated 3 - 31/2 percent, after declining by 1 1/2 percent the previous year. The rebound in activity was led by recovery in domestic demand and exports of services as progress toward peace revived business and consumer confidence and tour-ism. Inflation trended down (falling to 9 1/2 percent in 2002 from 14 1/4 percent in 2001), partly due to increased agricultural supplies from the North and the East. Despite soft commodity exports, re-flecting weak external demand, the current account deficit remained broadly unchanged from 2001, as inflows of remittances and tour-ism receipts strengthened. Gross reserves rose to $1'.6 billion (2 1/2 months of import cover), while the rupee remained stable in real effective terms.

9. Fiscal consolidation enabled a steady decline in interest rates. Despite revenue shortfalls - associated with the teething problems in the changes to the tax system (replacement of the goods and services tax (GST) and the national security levy (NSL) with the value-added tax (VAT), weak tax administration, and continued losses in the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), restraint on expendi-tures enabled the 2002 fiscal deficit to be limited to 8.9 percent of GDP-2 percent of GDP below the deficit in 2001, although more than the budget target of 8 1/2 percent of GDP. The fiscal adjust-ment and the decline in inflation allowed policy interest rates to be cut 300 basis points since January 2002, which has aided private sector credit to begin to recover.

10. Significant progress has been made on the reform front: * Fiscal, welfare, pension, A Fiscal Management Responsibility Act (FRA) was enacted in January that sets a medium-term fiscal deficit path, and mandates " pre-election budget reports" to discourage pre-election handouts. A new Board of Invest-ment (BOI) law was passed by Parliament, which eliminated BOI's power to grant tax holidays and incentives outside the regular tax legislation/tax code. A Welfare Benefit Law was enacted in September, which sets clear and transparent eligibil-ity criteria, provides guidelines for the termination of the bene-fits, and penalties to reduce politicization and mistargeting. A contributory pension scheme for all new public servants was presented to Parliament in January. * Public enterprises and privatization. The electricity reform bill was enacted in December 2002 to pave the way for restructur-ing the state electricity monopoly (CEB). The restructuring of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is progressing in step with the liberalization of the petroleum sector. Twelve percent shares of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) were sold through an IPO in December 2002, and the privatization of the bus companies is expected to be finalized in March 2003.

* Banking Amendments to the Monetary Law Act were enacted to provide the Central Bank (SBSL) more control over its monetary instruments. To strengthen the integrity of he banking system, the minimum CAR was raised to 10 percent for all domestic banking units from January, 1, 2003, and on a consoli-dated basis on all domestic and foreign banking units effective December, 31, 2003. * Labor. Labor reform bills on a new redundancy compensatory formula, time-bound resolution of labor disputes, eliminating restrictions on reasonable overtime work by women, and in-creasing penalties for child labor were enacted in January 2003. * Regulatory. A multi-sector regulatory bill was enacted in Sep-tember to establish a single regulatory authority for all public utilities. To enhance competition in the telecom sector, access to international gateways was liberalized this january. Amend-ments to the Securities Commission Act, which increase oppor-tunities and access of the poor, and provide a stable and ena-bling macroeconomic environment.. 6. While aiming for sustained growth of 8-10 percent in the long run, our medium-term macroeconomic framework envisages growth to average 6 1/2 percent in 2003 - 06. The higher growth rate will depend on both increased private and public sector in-vestment, as well as enhanced productivity growth. In the absence of major external shocks, a prudent monetary policy should help inflation fall to 5 percent by 2006. Despite an increase in export growth as external conditions improve over the medium term, reconstruction-related imports are likely to raise the current ac-count deficit to an average of 4 percent of GDP, Gross official reserves are targeted to rise modestly to 3 1/2 months of import cover by 2006. Given the projected current account deficit, net capital inflows, and reserve accumulation, we envisage substantial financing gaps during 2003-06 (averaging $400 million per year) that are expected to be filled by donor support.

7. To achieve these objectives, our policies will focus on four areas: * Restoring fiscal sustainability, Government debt has expanded dramatically in recent years to over 100 percent of GDP, while interest payments have reached 7 1/2 percent of DGP. To bring the level of dept to a manageable level in the medium term, the program aims to reduce the fiscal deficit by 1 1/4 percent, on average, per year through 2006. To achieve this, revenue, will need to be raised by 2 1/2 percent of GDP by 2006, by broadening the tax base mainly by simplifying the tax regime, rationalizing tax exemptions and tax incentives, and improving tax administra-tion. In addition expenditures will need to be rationalized and reoriented toward priority social and infrastructure spending. * Implementing structural reforms that remove barriers to produc-tivity growth and encourage private sector led development. In particular, increasing the efficiency of the banking and financial sectors (including by restructuring the state banks and the insur-ance sector); encouraging competition and private investment by ending state monopoly in various sectors, restructuring public enterprises (including through privatization), increasing labor market flexibility through labor law reforms, and by establishing a light-handed regulatory regime; and further liberalizing the trade regime (including by moving towards a stable, low, uniform tariff rate.) * Creating opportunities for the poor to share more fully the bene-fits of higher growth. Given the strong rural and regional bias in the incidence of poverty in Sri Lanka, revitalizing rural develop-ment by reforming agricultural policies and encouraging the growth of medium and small-scale enterprise is vital. In addition, improving access of the poor to markets through better transport and telecommunication infrastructures and access to better educa-tion and health services will also play a key role. * Garnering resources for reconstruction. The challenges arising in securing lasting peace are two-fold-immediately, the relief, reha-bilitation, and reconciliation (RRR) process will need to be ad-vanced, while in the medium-term, the destroyed infrastructure

789 790

and institutions in the North and the East have to be reconstructed and the regions reintegrated to the rest of the country. Significant resources will be needed to meet these challenges. The govern-ment will seek donor assistance and reorient public expenditures for these purposes, while ensuring that priority needs of the rest of the country continue to be met. the regulatory scope of the agency to a broader range of financial institu-tions, were passed by Parliament in January, 2003, IV. Macroeconomic Objectives and Policies for 2003 A. Macroeconomic Objectives 11. We except growth to reach 5 1/2 percent in 2003, underpinned by strengthened consumer confidence and a resumption of delayed pri-vate investment projects with the progress toward peace, increase in public investment, higher tourism, and a return to normal weather, Infla-tion is expected to decline to 7 percent by end-year. The current account deficit is likely to rise to 3 3/4 percent to GDP, as an export rebound is more than offset by higher imports related to increased activity and reconstruction needs. Gross official reserves are targeted to increase to $ 1.9 billion (over 2 1/2 months of imports). B. Post-Conflict Challaenges 12. Peace talks with the LTTE have progressed rapidly and the support of the international community has been heartening. How-ever, securing lasting peace also poses challenges for economic policy. Specifically, * Resettling our displaced populations; rebuilding the administra-tive and institutional capacity in the North and East; and recon-structing the dilapidated infrastructure will impose an immedi-ate fiscal cost. There will also be an increased demand on the governments normal programs, including the provision of an adequate social safety net. * While we have received commitments of US$ 70 million from donors last November for immediate relief, substantially more funds are needed. To ensure that such funds are properly spent, we have appointed the World Bank to manage the newly cre-ated North and East Reconstruction Fund (NERF). With the help to all stakeholders, we are preparing a comprehensive needs-assessment both for reconstruction-related spending as well as in support of the overall reform agenda, ahead of the donor conference slated to be held in Tokyo in June. C. Fiscal Policy. 13. Continued fiscal consolidation remains key to our macroeco-nomic program. The 2003 budget targets a deficit of 7 1/2 percent of GDP in line with the PRSP, of which 1/2 percent of GDP is related to post-conflict spending in the North and the East. If concessional foreign assistance becomes available for additional post-conflict spending (which we estimate to be 1/2 percent of GDP), we plan to incorporate the extra spending through a supplementary budget later in the year. 14. The budget includes several revenue augmenting measures, amounting to 3/4 percent of GDP. Among these, we have already extended the VAT to the financial sector at a rate of 10 percent; ex-tended the debits tax from current accounts to include savings accounts; imposed 2-10 percent duty on currently exempt imports; and lifted VAT exemptions on some items. However, we will not be able to extend VAT to the wholesale and retail sectors this year, due to complications arising from the revenue sharing arrangements with provincial councils, particu-larly in light of the ongoing peace negotiations. We are committed to extending the VAT to these sectors by January 2004, and will work to resolve the outstanding issues by that time. In addition, we are taking measures to ensure that the bottlenecks and procedures with respect to tax administration are cleared for a smooth implementation. To Offset the associated revenue loss in 2003, we will impose a levy on the Tele-communication Regulatory Commission (TRC), which will also raise future government revenue. The top income tax rate has been cut from 35 to 30 percent to encourage better tax compliance and investment.

15. In light of the pressures on public finances, expenditure rationalizing measures of around 1/2 percent of GDP are also in-cluded in the budget. These include a continued wage restraint and general hiring freeze of civil servants in 2003 (apart from filling some specific needs for technical, managements, education and health person-nel, closing of redundant cadre positions; a reduction in defense spend-ing; refinancing (e.g. overdrafts) with long-term bonds; and better target-ing Samurdhi program in line with the new Welfare Benefit law. The expenditure measures will not compromise public spending on social priorities. Also, to better track expenditures we will establish a medium-term expenditure framework by July 2003.

16. The government will carefully manage the financing of the budget and limit the use of nonconcessional funds. We will use the delayed privatization receipts for SLIC and the bus companies (slated to be completed last year but now expected in March 2003) to reduce net domestic financing from other sources, while keeping to the privatiza-tion plans already envisaged for 2003. Thus, with net external financing expected at 2 percent of GDP, net domestic borrowing will be contained to about 4 percent of GDP (compared with 8 percent of GDP in 2002). This will allow reducing outstanding credit from banking system by 1 percent of GDP. The government will also limit is contracting of new medium-and long-term foreign currency nonconcessional loans to $ 510 million. Most of this borrowing is related to loans from bilateral donors for projects with grant elements ranging form 20-30 percent. These projects are incorporated into the PRSP and are critical to reducing poverty and reconstructing the economy. We are fully committed to substantially reducing reliance on nonconcessional borrowing in future years, by avoiding excessive external commercial borrowing and work-ing closely with donors to increase the concessionality of bilateral loans.

17. Looking ahead, we plan to continue rationalizing tax exemp-tions and incentives in the 2004 budget. The existing exemption and incentive regime is outdated and has hindered the much needed broaden-ing of the tax base. In order to better understand the areas and dimen-sions along which the tax exemptions and incentives need to be rational-ized, we will undertake a comprehensive study of the cost and benefits of the current tax regime, including conducting an international compari-son of where Sri Lanka stands in this area. While the specific form of rationalizing and targeting of tax incentives ad regime will depend on the conclusion of the study, we will consider various options in the 2004 budget, including reducing the number and length of tax holidays, the level and duration of concessional tax rates, stricter limits on roll over of tax holidays; and limiting incentives to strategic sectors.

18. As envisaged in the PRSP, we intend to establish a revenue authority to strengthen tax collection, and provide better service. We have appointed a project manager (the interim chief executive offi-cer) and project team, who are entrusted with setting up of the authority. A workshop is being organized in April in Singapore to provide input to what would be the basis of the Parliamentary Acts governing the opera-tions of the Revenue Authority. By June 2003, we will present to Parlia-ment legislation for establishing the revenue authority and a detailed implementation plan. 19. With regards to quasi-fiscal policy, the key public enter-prises (CPC, CWE, and CEB) will limit their bank borrowing. In particular, public corporations are expected to reduce their overall out-standing stock of bank debt by Rs. 10 billion in 2003. In the case of CPC, petroleum prices will continue to be set by the existing automatic pricing formula, but to compensate for the removal of the debt recovery component in the formula, the corporations assets will continue to be sold to pay down its bank debt, However, given the recent increase in international oil prices, since mid-February, the government has subsi-dized diesel and kerosene prices (at an estimated cost of Rs 300 million per month), compensating CPC directly. These temporary measures were taken to ameliorate the impact of the price increase on the poor, to be fully offset by spending cuts in the Budget. From April onwards, if oil prices continue to remain high, we will protect the budget and pass the full effect of high oil prices on domestic fuel prices. CWE will use proceeds from its asset sales to also draw down its bank debt, while CEB (and its unbundled units) do not intend to increase bank debt during 2003.

2009 06 791 792

D. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies 20. Our monetary program will be based on a floating exchange rate regime, which has, thus far, served the economy well. In this regard, exchange rate interventions will continue to be limited to smoothing extreme short-term volatility or meeting net international reserves (NIR) target in line with the monetary program. The floating of the exchange rate has provided the CBSL an added instrument to absorb shocks. We are committed to make full use of exchange rate flexibility in responding to both short-and long-term exogenous shocks. 21. Monetary policy will continue to balance the need to support the economic recovery and keep inflation in check. Reserve money will remain the nominal anchor. In line with the anticipated increase in eco-nomic activity, broad money growth will be targeted at 13 1/2 percent in 2003. The current levels of interest rates appear broadly appropriate, but we might consider modest easing of rates if the pace of disinflation and fiscal consolidation picks up in the coming months. The CBSL also stands ready to use the existing stock of treasury bills or issue its own paper to sterilize any excess foreign inflows to adhere to the program targets. The CBSL launched formally its active open market operations in March 2003. To help smooth teething problems at the initial phase of active OMOs, a short-term IMF advisor has been stationed at the CBSL. E. Structural Issues 22. The Structural reform agenda for the 2003 program under the PRGF-EFF arrangements will focus on: Financial Sector Reform * To enable commercial banks to adequately deal with their non-performing assets, a draft asset management company (AMC) law is being prepared and will be presented to parliament by June 2003. * Given the magnitude of Peoples Banks nonperforming loans (estimated at Rs 23 billion at end-2002-a quarter of the loan portfolio) and poor cost structure, restructuring the bank is an urgent priority. To this end, the government has constituted a restructuring committee and appointed an investment consult-ant, and will complete an external evaluation of assets and liabilities by September 2003. Since any large recapitalization would impose a substantial burden to the population at large, the government would seek to commercialize the bank. To commercialize the bank as a single entity, an open and transpar-ent process would be initiated by September 2003. In case this option was not feasible, Peoples Bank would be separated into viable sub-units and commercialized, through an open and transparent process. In any case, it is intended that restructuring of the bank would be completed by March 2004, and would be in full accordance with the amended Banking Act. * The government will present the revised banking law and ex-change management acts to parliament by June 2003. These revisions are designed to enhance CBSLs supervision capacity, facilitate easier entry and exit into the banking sector, and mod-ernize the exchange market. The CBSL will also move expedi-tiously to resolve the problems of Pramuka Bank, whose license has been revoked. * To increase market penetration and efficiency in the insurance sector, the state insurance corporation (SLIC) is being privat-ized. Public Enterprise Reform * On the restructuring of loss-making enterprises, we have al-ready initiated the unbundling of CEB, consistent with the timetable agreed with AsDB. The power sector is intended to be unbundled into areas of generation, transmission and distribu-tion by October 2003. * We have decided on the list of enterprises to be privatized in 2003 (in addition to the sale of SLIC and the bus companies). Key items include the sale of CPC assets and market network, sale of 8 1/2 percent of government shares in Sri Lanka Tele-com (SLT), the Hilton Colombo hotel, and CWEs retail busi-ness.

Trade and Labor Market Reforms * Trade reform will focus on phasing out the 20 percent import surcharge and simplifying the tariff structure. In particular, the import surcharge will be cut to 10 percent by January 2004, and then fully eliminated by January 2005. This timetable will be announced in the 2004 budget. In addition, the 2004 budget will include interim targets for rationalizing the existing tariff struc-ture to a simplified three-band regime to be in place in 2005. * To increase labour market flexibility we will implement the recently enacted time-bound labour dispute settlement law, the redundancy compensatory formula and other laws relating to working conditions by April 2003. To provide a cushion against loss of income, an unemployment protection and retraining scheme is being designed with technical assistance from the ILO. Given the pressures on public finances, the budgetary resources to finance any such scheme will be minimized. The compensatory formula will be designed in line with interna-tional practices. Regulatory Reforms * In line with the recently enacted multisector regulatory bill, we have established three multisector regulatory bodies covering utilities, transport and communication, and envisage setting up a fourth for all financial services. To this end, we will complete the appointment of the Public Utility Commission by April 2003. F. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis and Monitoring 23. We will initiate a poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of our key policy reforms in 2003, in collaboration with the World Bank. We recognize that some of the proposed policies that are committed to in this MEFP, such as public sector restructuring, may have short-term costs for the poor. The government is committed to taking countervail-ing measures, such as voluntary retirement schemes and a possible un-employment protection plan, to ameliorate the impact of policies on the poor. Moreover, working closely With donors, we will update our pov-erty reduction strategy, after analyzing the household income and expen-diture survey, completed by the Department of the Census and Statistics in February 2003. 24. As indicated in our PRSP, we will put in place a monitoring and control framework to track and protect poverty-reduction expenditures. To start with, we have implemented an in-built monitoring system in the Samurdhi program to track improvements in indicators of poverty that will help identify movement of beneficiaries in and out of the program. G. External Financing 25. The policies described above and our commitments under the PRGF-EFF supported program would help to galvanize donor financing. The estimated financing gap of about $426 million in 2003 is expected to be filled by mostly concessional financing from official creditors. The World Bank has committed $110 million of balance of payments support under the PRSC facility, while the AsDB plans to provide about $60 million through their sectoral loans. Bilaterl donors are expected to provide $95 million, including $70 million that has already been com-mitted during the Oslo donors meeting in November 2002: The remain-der of the gap ($161 million) is expected to be financed by the PRGF/EFF arrangements. H. Safeguards and Statistical Issues 26. We remain committed to the Financial soundness of the CBSL, adhering to the principles of good governance and best practice as en-capsulated in the IMFs safeguards guidelines. In this regard, we will provide the IMF the requested documentation for the PRGF arrange-ment. Ernst and Youngs (New Zealand) will conduct an audit of CBSLs 2002 accounts on a full IAS basis in March 2003. 27. On statistical issues, we plan to migrate our publication of fiscal data in accordance with the GFSM 2001 methodology during 2003 with the help of IMF technical assistance. Sri Lanka is a participant in the GDDS, and we expect full compliance on SDDS by mid-2004.

V. Risks and Contingencies 28. There are risks to the 2003 program and, thus, a need for design-ing contingency measures. * Among the main risks are a slower global recovery and resump-tion of drought, which could lower growth, thus requiring revis-iting our macroeconomic framework. Disruptions in the Middle East could have a significant negative impact on the economy. With fiscal policy tied down by the need to reduce public debt, the exchange rate and monetary policy will have to bear most of the burden of the needed adjustment. Thus, if there were to be downward pressures on the exchange rate, we would allow the rupee to depreciate, intervening only to limit extreme volatility. However, in case the disruptions are protracted, some adjust-ment may also be needed in the fiscal stance. We will remain in contact with Fund staff to determine the appropriate policy actions. * There are also risks to the budget, both on the revenue and expenditure fronts. In line with the requirements of the recently enacted FRA, the government will conduct a mid-term review of the public finances in July 2003. At that time, we will also decide whether additional revenue and expenditure measures are needed to meet the deficit target. We do not intend to grant any general wage increase in 2003, unless during this review, a determination is made that additional resources are available to cover the consequent increase in the wage bill. The Government stands ready to take compensatory fiscal measures to keep to the budgeted deficit target, including reducing corporate tax exemptions and further cutting transfers to public corporations. VI. Program Monitoring and Review 29. To monitor policy implementation under the program, we have reached understandings on the prior action, a set of quantitative perform-ance criteria for end - June and end - December 2003, and a structural performance criterion and benchmarks (Tables 1 and 2). The Govern-ment intends to bring 90 percent of the shares of SLIC to a point of sale prior to Board consideration of the PRGF-EFF arrangements. There is also a structural performance criterion on the presentation to parliament of the Revenue Authority Act and the preparation of a detailed imple-mentation plan.

30. The government is aware that the first review under the PRGF-EFF arrangements scheduled to be completed by September 30, 2003, would be conditioned on the observance of end-June, 2003 performance criteria. Performance criteria, indicative targets, and precise definitions of quantitative variables monitored under the program are set out in the attached updated Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The standard clauses on overdue financial obligations to the Fund, accumula-tion of external payments arrears, exchange restrictions, multiple cur-rency practices, bilateral payments agreements inconsistent with Article VIII, and import restrictions for balance of payments purposes are also applicable as performance criteria.

1. Fiscal Targets A. Performance Criterion on Net Domestic Financing of the Central Government Budget Ceiling (In billions of rupees) Flows of net domestic Financing at the end of: January 1, 2002-December 31, 2002 (actual) 125 Flows of net domestic financing (cumulative balance from January 1, 2003): March 31, 2003 (indicative target) 29 1 June 30, 2003 (performance criterion) 44 September 30, 2003 (indicative target) 65 December 31, 2003 (performance criterion) 74 2. Net domestic financing is defined as net credit to the government by the banking system (I. e. CBSL plus deposit money banks) and the net change in holdings of treasury bills and other government securities by the non-bank sector. For the purpose of program monitoring, the flow of net domestic financing (NDF) of the central government budget would be the sum of the net receipts (in book value terms) of the following government debt instruments (a) Rupee securities, (b) Treasury Bills, (c) Treasury Bonds, (d) Treasury Certificates of Deposits, (e) Other rupee-denominated government paper, (f) Provisional advances from the CBSL, (g) and the net change in the stock of debt of other instruments-which consist of overdraft, import bills, syndicated loans with Peoples Bank and Bank of Ceylon less government deposits with the CBSL, Peoples Bank, and Bank of Ceylon. The reporting requirement for NDF appears in Table 6. The data on the instruments (a) through (e) will be provided by the governments public debt office an data on (f) and (g) will be based on the balance sheet data of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), peoples Bank, and Bank of Ceylon as provided by the CBSL, For program purposes, foreigncurrency denominated loans and bonds issued by the government during the program period and held by residents will be excluded from net domestic financing. Central government is defined here to include line ministries, departments and public institutions. The following adjustments will apply: 3. The ceiling on net domestic financing will be adjusted up ward/downward by the shortfall /excess of rupee equivalent of foreign program financing as set out in Table 2 (memorandum item) However, the upward adjustment for shortfalls in foreign program financing will be limited to the rupee equivalence of $100 million using the program exchange rate in Table 4. Moreover, foreign program financing that increases NIR of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) but does not affect net credit to government (NCG) from the banking system and net domestic financing (NDF) of the budget (such as the DSTs Yen Revolving balance), would be excluded from foreign program financing when determining the adjuster for both NCG and NDF.

4. The ceiling on net domestic financing will be adjusted downwards by the full amount of any excess privatization receipts beyond the programmed amounts in Table 1. In case of shortfalls in privatization receipts, the upward adjustment in the ceiling would be limited to 50 percent of the shortfall.

II. Monetary Targets A. Performance Criterion on Net Domestic Assets of the CBSL

Ceiling (In billions of rupees) Outstanding stock as of: December 31, 2002 (actual) 9.0 March 31, 2003 (indicative target) 9.2 June 30, 2003 (performance criterion) 2.4 September 30, 2003 (indicative target) 0.4 December 31, 2003 (performance criterion) -1.3 9.

Net foreign assets of the CBSL are the net claims on nonresidents, in all currency denominations and government (net). For program monitoring purposes, net foreign assets will be calculated using the exchange rate given in Table 4.

The following adjustments will apply: 10. The NDA ceiling is based on a baseline path of NFA that excludes reserve losses on forwards (III. A). The NDA ceiling will be adjusted upward/downward by the shortfall/excess of rupee equivalent of foreign program financing as set out in Table 2 using the program exchange rate in Table 4. However, the upward adjustment for shortfalls in foreign program financing will be limited to the rupee equivalence of $ 100 million using the program exchange rate in Table 4. Foreign program financing is as defined in subsection III (A) below. The NDA ceiling will also be adjusted for DSTs Special Dollar and Yen Revolving balance that are kept abroad and are included in the program definition of, NIR (see III. A below). 11. The NDA ceiling will be adjusted downward by the full amount of any excess privatization receipts beyond the programmed amounts in Table 1. In case of shortfalls in privatization receipts, the upward adjustment in the ceiling would be limited to 50 percent of the shortfall. Privatization receipts in foreign currency will be converted into rupees using the program exchange rates in Table 4. 12. Changes in required reserve regulations will modify the NDA ceiling according to the formula: NDA = rB0 + r0B + rB where r0 denotes the reserve requirement ratio prior to any change; B0 denotes the programmed reserve money base in the period prior to any change; r is the change in the reserve requirement ratio; and B denotes the immediate change in the reservable base as a result of changes in its definition.

15. For the purpose of monitoring the PRGF-EFF program, net international reserves of the CBSL is defined as the difference between its gross foreign assets and liabilities, both expressed in terms of market values. Gross foreign assets of the CBSL consists of monetary gold, foreign exchange balances held outside Sri Lanka, foreign securities (valued in market prices), foreign bills purchased and discounted, net IMF position and SDR holdings, Crown Agents credit balance, DSTs Special Dollar and Yen Revolving balance. Programmed exchange rates specified in Table 4 below to reflect valuation adjustment, Excluded from gross foreign assets will be participation in international financial institutions, holdings of nonconvertible currencies, holdings of precious metals other than monetary gold, and claims on residents (e. g., statutory reserves on foreign deposits of commercial banks) pledged, non-liquid, collateralized or otherwise encumbered assets (such as the governments war risk insurance deposit with Lioyds during 2001/02), claims in foreign exchange arising from derivative transactions (such as futures, forwards, swaps and options). Gross foreign liabilities are all foreign currency denominated liabilities, the use of Fund credit, and Asian Clearing Union debit balance and commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options. The following adjustments will apply: 16. The NIR floor will be adjusted upward by the full amount of excess privatization receipts in foreign currency compared with the programmed amount in Table 1 and downward by shortfall in privatization receipts in foreign currency, but the downward adjustment will be equal to 50 percent of the shortfall; adjusted downward/upward by the shortfall/excess of foreign program financing as set out in Table 2 but the downward adjustment for shortfalls in foreign program financing will be limited to $100 million for each test date. Foreign program financing is defined to include balance of payments support, including adjustment loans from multilateral creditors other than the Fund, balance of payments support from bilateral creditors, loans from private creditors (including commercial banks) and rescheduling of medium-and long term public and publicly-guaranteed debt. Thus, foreign program financing as defined above, is expected to augment CBSLs reserves without an immediate expected corresponding payment outflow. For program purposes, from January 1, 2003, foreign-currency denominated loans and bonds issued by the Government and held by domestic residents will be treated as foreign program financing. B. Performance Criterion on New Nonconcessional External Debt Ceiling (In Millions of U.S. Dollars) Cumulative balance from January 1, 2002 to : December 31, 2002 (actual) 242 Cumulative balance from January 1, 2003 March 31, 2003 (indicative target) 450 June 30, 2003 (performance criterion) 510 September 30, 2003 (indicative target) 510 December 31, 2003 (performance criterion) 510 17. Contracting or guaranteeing of new medium and long-term nonconcessional external debt is defined as contracting or guaranteeing new nonconcessional external debt by the non-financial public sector (all central and provincial government ministries and departments, public corporations and institutions, and the CBSL) with an original maturity of more than one year (valued at programmed cross exchange rates as defined in Table 4). The program ceiling of $510 million for 2003 includes a Citibank loan of $100 million and another $270 million of loans that Sri Lanka plans to contract with Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). Both loans are expected to be contracted by end-March 2003. This debt will also include Borrowing containing a grant element of less than 35 percent on the basis of currency specific discount rates based on the OECD commercial interest reference rates. For maturities of less than 15 years. The g rant element would be calculated based on six month CIRR averages, while for maturities longer than this, the grant element would be based on ten-year CIRR averages. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect of Foreign Debt )Decision No. 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000) but also to

commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received, Excluded from this performance criterion are credits extended by the IMF and program financing from IBRD and AsDB, and government counter guarantees on project loans from both IBRD and AsDB, as well as changes in indebtedness resulting from rescheduling operations or rollover. Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the contract is entered into, or guarantee issued. C. Performance Criterion on Stcok of Short-Term External Debt Ceiling (In millions of U.S. Dollars) December 21. 2002 (actual) 0 March 31. 2003 (indicative target) 25 June 20, 2003 (performance criterion) 25 September 30, 2003 (indicative target) 50 December 31, 2003 (performance criterion) 50 18. Stock of short-term external debt outstanding is defined as debt with original maturity of up to one year owed or guaranteed by the non-financial public sector (all central and provincial government ministries and departments, public corporations and institutions, and the CBSL) (valued at programmed cross exchange rates as defined in Table 4). This debt will also include foreign currency denominated loans and bonds contracted by the non-financial public sector with residents. The term debt is defined as set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Griteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000) but excludes normal import-related credits, forward contracts, swaps and other future market contracts. The ceilings also apply to debt instruments with put options that would be triggered within one year after the contracting date. 19. The programs performance criterion on nonaccumulation of external payment arrears is continuous throughout the program period. External payments arrears are defined as overdue payments (interest and principal payments) on shot-term debt in convertible currencies with an original maturity of up to and including one year (spot, money market, letters of credit) and medium-and long-term debt contracted or guaranteed by the government. As of end-December 2002, there were no reported external payment arrears. IV. Structural Conditions. 20. The term bringing to the point of sale (MEFP Table 2) means the authorities will have submitted to Cabinet a sale and purchase agreement, including the chosen buyer, final price and other financial and technical understandings by the relevant test date. That agreement will have been endorsed by the Cabinet. ( )

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , 22 ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I am talking about a Privilege matter. On the 22nd of July 2009, in this august Assembly there was a reference to the Press Council and in the process there was a statement that was made by a non-Cabinet Minister referring to the COPE meeting that there was a unanimous decision taken by the COPE to reactivate the Press Council. Hon. Speaker, we did not have information at our fingertips at that particular moment but within an hour we managed to get the verbatim report which I am at this particular moment tabling* in this House because there is a distortion that has taken place. The Executive Summary mentioned that there was a unanimous agreement to reactivate the Press Council. That is a complete distortion of the verbatim report. Sir, the verbatim report, which refers to the Chairman states: ": . . . : " : ... . " ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You take it from your time, not from my time. .

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The PRGF is not available to middle-income countries. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition does not know that. You can kindly ask it from the Hon.

(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Please listen to me. As far as the IMF, the Bretton Woods and the World Bank is concerned, the PRGF is available only to LDCs, not to middle- income countries. It is not available to Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Sri Lanka still qualifies for PRGF.

[. . 12.26] . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy)

Madam Chairperson, with the end of civil war, it occurs to me whether we should continue to call this Debate the Emergency Debate. Yet, there is good reason to do so. Earlier, the term was relevant since the civil war had to be brought to an early end. Now, the

term continues to be relevant in the sense of the need for an urgent reconciliation between the two major communities, without which there can be no peace or rebuilding of the country.

Sri Lanka attained Independence in 1948. Within the short spell of five years, the country witnessed the first outbreak of communal violence in 1953 and thereafter, again in worse form in 1959. The year 1977 saw it spread into the plantation districts, drawing the Indian Tamil Plantation Community also into it. The dragon raised its ugly head once again in 1983 and with that started the cry for Tamil Eelam and the 25-year long civil war.

It does not follow from the demise of Prabhakaran and the lull in the civil war that the cause he postulated and for which he fought - mistakenly though by force of arms - is also dead. Its roots have penetrated deep into the Northern soil, and its canopy has spread thickly across the Northern skies.

It is a hard and unfortunate fact that the relationship between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities has never been consistently cordial. However, the fruitless 25-year civil war has driven the message home to the nation at large that there can be no progress without reconciliation and peace. The country is presently at a momentous break or make point in its political history. To the credit of the TNA, they have not supported the LTTEs cry for Eelam. Their demand appears to be for a new Constitution based on federal lines. Whilst this may be a system of government suitable to a politically and socially highly developed country such as Switzerland, Sri Lanka is not yet ripe in every respect to follow suit. The country has been governed as a single unit with a Legislative Representative of all provinces and districts since the British unified administration in 1815. Governmental, police and political authority have flowed from the centre to the periphery. The nation's current Constitution of 1978 is also based upon the Unitary System of Government. And so, we have to base all our structures on this system, so long as it is there. In a sincere effort to achieve this, the President has set up the APRC and the All Party Committee on Reconciliation and Development. The establishment of a representative Second or Upper Chamber, not similar to the earlier Senate but vested with the Constitutional authority, to decide controversial national issues, such as language and land distribution should be considered. The President has brought himself to a position where he could boldly grasp the moment and bring about a fruitful political settlement. Each party does have Members who have the motivation to join together for this purpose. The President deserves their active support; he should invite them officially to join him in this effort. I am confident he will enjoy the support of the nation. This is not a political issue. It is a question that affects the lives of the people and the generations to come.

8 PL 004294 (2009/08)

841 842

Unfortunately, Madam Chairperson, the TNA had not been invited to the APRC. They should be. Hamlet cannot be staged without either the Prince of Denmark or Juliet. Presently relieved of the civil war and the LTTEs demand for Eelam, the President should spearhead negotiations with the TNA. All right-thinking citizens will support him irrespective of politics. The TNA must reciprocate; they owe this obligation both to the country and their own community. All Sinhala parties must give their ready support to His Excellency the President and the Government. The effort must be commenced by the Government straightaway and with vigour. Madam Chairperson, there comes a moment in the tide of affairs of both men and nations. Sri Lankas moment has come; let us not lose it for all times. Thank you. [. . 12.33]

The IMF gives two types of loans: one is the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the other is the Standby Arrangement Facility. When it comes to the present situation, the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning mentioned that Sri Lanka does not qualify to receive funds under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility owing to the fact that we have surpassed the US Dollars 1095 per capita income bracket. I think the Hon. Deputy Minister has not been properly guided and that is why Sri Lanka has not been able to get the maximum of the loan. The criteria on granting loans is based on two factors: one factor being the highly indebtedness, the poverty limit of the countries. There are 78 countries listed as eligible for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Sri Lanka is

listed at the 63rd position even though its per capita income is over US Dollars 1095. So, I would like to table* this document to show that the Government has taken the wrong step and they are not going to utilize the aid in a proper manner. 1,095 78 63 , . . . .

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, let me begin by thanking you for giving me this opportunity to participate in yet another Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. In fact, I had decided to basically speak on the way forward, but having heard the Hon. Prime Ministers justification of the need for the extension of the state of Emergency, I felt that I need to touch on that point before I get to what I wanted to speak about. We were told in the morning that the extension of the state of Emergency is basically required because the germ that had entered the Tamil body politic is still not removed even with the death of Velupillai Prabhakaran and that having defeated the LTTE militarily, it would not be a challenge anymore to face a similar threat in the future. This reminds me of the situation that arose basically prior to the promulgation of the Soulbury Constitution. In fact, I was reminded of what de Tocqueville quoted in the Left Curve. He said, I quote: When the past no longer illuminates the future, the spirit walks in darkness.

So, I think when we are at a historical moment in this country, when we have an opportunity to learn from the past and move towards a better future, we need to understand how the so-called "germ" entered the body of the Tamil population. If we do not keep reminding ourselves of the reasons why a world renowned terrorist organization grew from a grievance that the community had, we will not be taking the correct action to make sure that we do not have history repeating itself, because we have suffered for three decades and we know that we were on the verge of an economic collapse. Though the press gave so many versions of it over the last three months, today in the House we had admission that we were on the verge of an economic collapse mainly due to the amount of money we spent on the war and of course, in the global context as well. Now, we cannot afford to have this worm turn again. So, to prevent it from turning, we need to learn from the past. I am not going into too much of detail, but I would like to quote what Lord Soulbury wrote in 1963 in a foreword to B.H. Farmers study titled Ceylon: A Divided Nation", in which he declared, I quote: A Commission, of which I had the honour to be the Chairman, was appointed by the British Government in 1944, to examine and discuss proposals for the constitutional reform of Ceylon. It did not take long to discover that the relations of minorities to majorities, and particularly of the Tamil minority in the northern and eastern provinces to the Sinhalese majority further south, were in the words of the Commissions report the most difficult of the many problems involved. The Commission had of course a cursory knowledge of the age-long antagonism between these two communities, but might have been less hopeful of a solution had Mr. Farmers book been available to underline the deplorable effect of centuries of troubled history upon the Ceylonese of today. The Commission devoted a substantial portion of its report to this minority question, and stated that it was satisfied that the Government of Ceylon was fully aware that the contentment of the minorities was essential not only to their own well-being but to the well-being of the Island as a whole. And to quote the Commissions Report: If it were otherwise, no safeguard that we could devise would in the long run be of much avail. Needless to say the consequences have been a bitter disappointment to myself and my fellow Commissioners. While the Commission was in Ceylon, the speeches of certain Sinhalese politicians calling for the solidarity of the Sinhalese and threatening the suppression of the Tamils emphasized the need for constitutional safeguards on behalf of that and other minorities...As Sir Charles Jeffries has put it in his admirable book, Ceylon - The Path to Independence, The Soulbury Constitution had entrenched in it all the protective provisions for minorities that the wit of man could devise. Nevertheless, in the light of later happenings, I now think it is a pity that the Commission did not also recommend the entrenchment in the constitution of guarantees of fundamental rights, on the lines enacted in the constitutions of India, Pakistan, Malaya, Nigeria and elsewhere. Perhaps in any subsequent amendment of Ceylons constitution those in authority might take note of the proclamation made by the delegates at the African Conference which met in Lagos two years ago: Fundamental human rights, especially the right to individual liberty, should be written and entrenched in the constitutions of all countries. Nevertheless the reconciliation of Tamils and Sinhalese will depend not on constitutional guarantees but on the goodwill, common sense and humanity of the Government in power and the people who elect it.

This came from Lord Soulbury, who was responsible for the Soulbury Constitution and we know that the amendments to the Constitution of this country thereafter basically sowed the seeds for the germ of terrorism entering the body of the Tamil people. Having exterminated this, having squashed the terrorist threat to this country, now we need to make sure that the minorities in this country feel that they belong to this country, that they can also be proud of being Sri Lankans. In fact, I was a little amused at His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas comment in his interview to "The Hindu" with the Chief Editor, N. Ram, when he said, I quote: ... my theory is: there are no minorities in Sri Lanka, there are only those who love the country and those who dont.... No way for federalism in this country. For reconciliation to happen, there must be a mix [of ethnicities]. Here the Sinhalese, the Tamils and Muslims inter-marry. In my own family, there have been mixed marriages: Sinhalese with Tamils, Sinhalese with Muslims. This is Sri Lankan society... In fact, it is true. That maybe. If all of us can inter-marry and not divide ourselves on lines of ethnicity, we may in the future not see a division. But, unfortunately, we are human beings. I am reminded of what the Bengali poet and writer, Pramatha Chauduri, more than 80 years ago said, I quote: To love a country means to love its people because human beings love other human beings. If there is someone who loves, not humans but the soil, then we can conclude that he is no human but a slab of inanimate matter. Science after all, has discovered a law under which matter attracts matter inexorably and blindly... A Bengali is kin to another Bengali because, in the field of mind, the link of language is like a link of blood. So, I basically would like to go back to the position that I took in the last Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency where I said, we, Sri Lankans, must reconcile to be a fruit salad than trying to make it a mixed-fruit juice. If we can reconcile to the fact that we all belong to this country, we all have our own ethnic distinctions, we all want to preserve our identities, but we all want to belong to this country, then we must have the magnanimity to live and let live. We all must decide that we would like to be the many components of a fruit salad and not try to squash every other component to have the taste of the majority component. When it comes to a solution to this problem, we have been talking of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. That is a part of the law of this land and in fact, we all are guilty of not having sincerely tried to implement it. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . .

Mr. Presiding Member, we keep talking about the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution as a solution to this problem and we all know that a majority of us basically do not agree that the Thirteenth Amendment could be a solution to this problem. If that be the case, why is it that we continue to talk of the Thirteenth Amendment as a solution to this problem? Is it because we need to keep India happy or are we trying to use this piece of legislation, which has been the bone of contention for so many years since the day it was entered into the statutes of this land, in the current context to have agents of the Government installed in powers of position in the provinces. The manner in which these elections are held can have a situation which is similar to what is prevailing in the countries around Russia, where leaderships favourable to the Russian regime is installed in these countries so that you have the cake and you also eat it. You have basically satisfied India that the Thirteenth Amendment is in force and through the Thirteenth Amendment, you have your people running the provinces with the strings being pulled from the Centre. Anyway the Thirteenth Amendment is seen as being basically flawed because the executive power still is vested in the Governor who is appointed by His Excellency the President.

In todays post-war situation, when we are at a historical moment and when we need to make sure that we do not lose this golden opportunity, how should we approach this? How should we approach the way forward? Now, there are issues which need to be dealt with and this is nothing new; this has been discussed in

9 PL 004294 (2009/08)

873 874

this House and in many forums outside this House. We have the issue of resettlement and rehabilitation of the IDPs. We have the reparations for victims. We have the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants who are in the custody of the military. We have to acknowledge the truth of the past. If we do not talk of the past and if we do not have the past shedding light for the future, we will lose direction. We have to address the issues of past crimes, the crimes that were committed with impunity, addressing the political grievances and promoting reconciliation and peace-building. Traditional justice addresses the period of transition from conflict to sustainable peace or repression to democracy. During a period of transitional justice following an armed conflict or severe repression, efforts generally focus on three key themes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Sir, I am taking the time of the next speaker. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

I am taking the full time and I will take the time of the SLMC also. Firstly, is the imposition of the rule of law and human rights protection. Secondly, the reform of institutions in order to achieve transparency, structural equality and democracy and thirdly, social reconstruction and mechanisms directed at long-term national reconciliation. To reconcile, democratic compromise produces solutions regarding issues in conflict. Reconciliation addresses the relationships between those who will have to implement these solutions. Reconciliation is both a goal, something to achieve, and a process, a means to achieve that goal. Ideally reconciliation prevents, once and for all, the use of the past as the seed of renewed conflict. This is what we have to stress on. We have to use the past and make sure that the past is not used as the seed of renewed conflict. It consolidates peace, breaks the cycle of violence and strengthens newly- introduced democratic structures and institutions. We need to take the reconciliation in stages. So, how do you reconcile in stages? You have to replace fear by non-violent coexistence. When fear no longer rules, it builds confidence and trust. We need to empathize with the fallen people, the people who fear the future; you need to empathize with them. The past must

be addressed in order to reach the future. Reconciliation is the means to do that, to address the past in order to reach the future. Reconciliation applies to all. It is not just a process for those who suffered directly and those who inflict the suffering because reconciliation cannot be done to one party. The reconciliation has to be between the vanquished and the victor. You do not reconcile only with the vanquished. The "give and take" policy needs to be there. Reconciliation must be seen as a long-term process. That may take decades or even generations because we fought a war for three decades. We cannot reconcile in three months. No. But, we need to lay the foundation and accept, yes, we have erred, we have not done this, we have not done that and we have not listened to the people. So, to go forward, we need to first accept what we have not done. But, if we keep saying, Okay, we have hit them once; if they try again, we will hit them again What does that mean? That means you are building for another war which can come in different forms. It may not be an armed conflict. We may have something showered on us by forces beyond our control, like the IMF loans. From the time this Government came into power, the Opposition has been saying, Do not borrow from private banks. Go to the IMF, go to the World Bank. You can get them on more concessionary terms. Of course there will be conditions attached. But, as a country which cannot generate enough to pay back, we need to get money at the lowest possible interest. What did the Government say? No we do not want to go to the IMF and the World Bank. We can manage on our own. And, until recently the Governor of the Central Bank had been saying, No, we do not want to bow down to conditions. We know how to manage this; we will not go to the IMF. Now, we have realized that we have gone to a point; we have borrowed enough from the private banks where we cannot generate enough income to pay it back and we are on the verge of collapse. We are rescued by the IMF, the very body that we did not go to and we still take up the position, yes, we have got this only because we managed well. No. We got this and we are happy that we got this. As a Sri Lankan I am very happy that the IMF has bailed us out because all of us have to pay this back. It is not the Government that pays back the loan. The Government is the people. We pay back. So, if somebody can help us with concessionary loans, we are happy. We need to accept the fact, yes, we should have gone to them earlier; yes we felt threatened by the conditions that may be put on us and we have now realized it and now gone and got this loan. So, we need to basically be able to accept that these are long-term processes and we have to take these one at a time. All the steps in the process entail the reconciling of not only individuals but also groups and communities as a whole. Lasting reconciliation must be home-grown and there is something where I strike an accord with His Excellency the President when he says the solution that he will come out with will be home - grown. But, a home-

[ . . . ]

2009 06 875 876

grown solution cannot be tendered alone. When you have a home-garden, you do not plant a seed, water it and grow it on your own. No. Every part of the Sri Lankan polity, all of us, the Opposition, the Government, the people must all get together and find this solution that is home-grown. Only then all of us can proudly call it a "Sri Lankan" solution. It is not a solution of X or Y, but a solution born out of reconciliation where we all feel that we need to be proud to call ourselves Sri Lankans. And this may require education, a process, and maybe even amendments to the Constitution or even a new Constitution. Since my time is limited, I would like to table* for inclusion in Hansard, a set of constitutional principles which we should be considering. I feel we should think of a new Constitution in this country where the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers, the Malays, all feel that this is a product which is truly home-grown and this is a product that will ensure that all of us will be proud to call ourselves "Sri Lankans". Thank you. * : : Document table Constitutional Principles 01. Sri Lanka as a free, sovereign, democratic, independent and united country. 02.

, ! , , - - . . , , . , . ? . If I could put it in English, Mr. Presiding Member, I charge the Government Party, namely the United People's Freedom Alliance, for engaging in inducement, intimidation and also in preparatory steps leading to impersonation on a massive scale in regard to the forthcoming elections both in Jaffna and Vavuniya. I would like to use this opportunity to place on record, Sir, that it does not concern only the TNA, it does not concern only the people of Jaffna and Vavuniya, but concerns all the democratic-minded people of this country. It is a challenge to the democratic process of this country. This is exactly what happened in 1981 in the District Development Councils' Election that was held on the 3rd of June under the regime of the then President Junius Richard Jayewardene. The verdict of the people was sought to be throttled; there was an unabashed attempt on the part of the then government to distort the peoples verdict. Yet, the people of Jaffna asserted themselves in that the United National Party in spite of the physical presence of more than a couple of ministers in Jaffna, days before the election as well as on the day of the election failed to secure even one seat. Now, there is an attempt, a subtie attempt, to subvert the process of democracy in the forthcoming election. I would warn the Government with all sincerity and in the interest of the entire country, please stop this. Please, stop this. Let there be no repetition of 1981. In fact, 1981 did have its own consequences in that thereafter we all were forced to face a situation wherein there was practically a negation of all the democratic values and the democratic process came to a standstill during the years that followed. Now, Sir, I charge the Government that if it has even the slightest interest to solve the national question, it should realize even at this stage that definitely this is not the way to approach the Tamil people. The Government is trying to get a verdict using all the powers at its command. That is our charge. That is exactly why the candidates both in Jaffna and Vavuniya who are contesting under the banner of the United People's Freedom Alliance led by the Minister, the Hon. Douglas Devananda, the Leader of the EPDP in Jaffna who is now

eyeing Vavuniya too, are engaged in a process wherein we find inducement and intimidation being applied on the people of Jaffna in order to rob their verdict. Therefore, Sir, this is indeed a very serious situation, this is indeed a very critical situation. If the verdict of the people is subverted, then I warn the Government that the people would continue to have a reasonable and justifiable grudge against the Government. They will never believe the Government hereafter. Therefore, it is not a question of winning that Municipality or this Urban Council. It will not make much difference as far as we are concerned. The people are with us. If they are permitted to vote freely and without fear, you would see, Sir, that the people of Jaffna and Vavuniya would be returning a resounding verdict in favour of the Tamil National Alliance espousing the legitimate political aspirations to find a just political solution within the framework of a united Sri Lanka. We have been repeatedly stating on the Floor of this House that the Tamil National Alliance, as a responsible political party, is committed to the resolution of the national question through peaceful means, through political means. But, what is the reaction of the Government? You are not permitting us to compete with you on equal terms; you are not permitting us to have what is entitled to us under the law as a Party that is engaged in the democratic process particularly in regard to the forthcoming elections. Therefore, Sir, it is the duty of all the democratic-minded politicians cutting across party differences to ensure that the election in Jaffna are free and fair. It is not too late. I would appeal to the Commissioner of Elections to ensure that a team of independent monitors is sent to Jaffna and Vavuniya immediately in order to monitor the electoral process that is going to be in action on the 8th of this month. Sir, the Tamil National Alliance today is faced with a serious challenge in that we find that our people are subjected to a reign of terror. Armed gangs are roaming about in both the towns of Vavuniya and Jaffna. They are armed with deadly weapons. They are the quislings, they are the running dogs of any Government that is in power who have been engaged in suppressing the voice of the Tamil people for the last several years exploiting the situation that has been prevalent in this country till a couple of months back using the war as a pretext. Therefore, it is not only necessary for all of us to have elections. Of course, we do welcome elections. Elections must take place in an atmosphere where people should be in a position to welcome the elections in the first place and also to participate in the elections without fear or favour, without fearing anybody. That is not there. It is the duty of all concerned to ensure that a mockery of democracy is not perpetrated in the name of the people of Jaffna and Vavuniya. The people are with us. I would like to tell you, Sir, and to this august Assembly that having attended a number of meetings and having mingled with the people both in Vavuniya and in Jaffna, I can assure that if there is no interference, if there is no

885 886

intervention by the people and by the elements who care nothing for the law, the people of both Vauniya and Jaffna will return a resounding verdict in favour of the Tamil National Alliance. But, there is a question mark. That is our concern. Given the fact that the Government party and the Minister who is in charge of the propaganda campaign in regard to both these elections are bending over backwards and doing everything possible in order to steal the verdict - ( ) (The Presiding Member) ,- . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) I would cut short my speech. I am almost coming to the end of my speech. I am rather sad, Sir, that if the verdict of the people is throttled, if the verdict of the people is robbed, then the Tamil people would be forced into a situation where they would lose all hope in regard to any process that is aimed at solving the national question. Therefore, I again appeal to the Government; I know that there is no point in appealing to the Government but even for the purpose of record, I appeal to the Government and more particularly Iappeal to the Commissioner of Elections to step in and ensure that a team of eminent persons is sent to both Jaffna and Vavuniya as a group of independent observers to monitor the electoral process that would be in action on the 8th of this month. If that is not there, I do not know what exactly is in store for our people. But, yet we are prepared to face the challenge. We will face the challenge; the Tamil National Alliance will face this challenge and I do believe and hope that we will emerge victorious. I thank you, Sir, for having given me a few more minutes than what was in fact allotted to me.
