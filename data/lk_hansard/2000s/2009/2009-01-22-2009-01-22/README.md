MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PRESS RELEASE Indo-lanka relations have reached an unprecedented level of depth and quality today, says visiting Indian foreign secretary Indias relations with Sri Lanka have reached an unprecedented level of depth and quality today, observed Indian Foreign Secretary

Shivshankar Menon at his meeting with Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama on Friday, during his two-day visit to the island. The Foreign Secretary further observed that it is during difficult times that the true quality of a friendship becomes most evident, and that the Indo-Lanka relationship is one such friendship that has effectively withstood the test of time and adversity. Minister Bogollagama warmly welcomed Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon to Sri Lanka, and indicated that this visit is a reflection of Indias steadfast friendship with Sri Lanka as well as the maturity of the Indo-Lanka relationship. The Minister extended the warm appreciation of the Sri Lankan government for the continued understanding of India on issues of mutual concern. Reiterating that the Sri Lankan government perceives the Indo-Lanka Accord as the key to seeking a political solution to the conflict, the Minister observed that the present juncture offers a window of opportunity to implement the Accord, given the decisive victories gained by the government in combating LTTE terror on all fronts. In this context, he observed that the government is currently in the process of exploring several avenues of implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The Minister highlighted the governments sincere commitment to evolving a broadbased and an inclusive peace process in order to achieve a durable peace, acceptable to all communities living in the island. Foreign Secretary Menon expressed his appreciation of the sentiments expressed by Minister Bogollagama on the Indo-Lanka Accord and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Minister Bogollagama and Secretary Menon agreed that a moment of political opportunity has been made available to Sri Lanka today to bring about an inclusive peace process with credible political representation by the Tamil people within the countrys democratic process. Minister Bogollagama in this context thanked the Indian government for the humanitarian assistance extended during this period to further augment the steps being taken by the Sri Lankan government to ensure the welfare of civilians living in northern Sri Lanka. He welcomed continued humanitarian assistance by India to the affected people. Secretary Menon extended his appreciation of the proactive role played by Sri Lanka both multilaterally and in the regional context in combating terrorism, and extended the unstinted support of the Indian government in this exercise. Secretary Menon briefed Minister Bogollagama on the current status of the investigation on the Mumbai terror attacks and indicated that India would continue to work closely with Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice. He emphasized that concerted and collective international action is needed in combating the scourge of trans-national terror. Minister Bogollagama, in response, indicated that as a country that has itself been the victim of terror which had proliferated with international links and support, Sri Lanka is well placed to understand the gravity of the threat of trans-national terrorism. He reiterated Sri Lankas support in combating terror at every level in order to secure a sustainable peace within the region. The Minister also reiterated Sri Lankas interest in cooperating with India on maritime security in the Indian Ocean, both bilaterally and within the framework of regional groupings such as BIMSTEC. On Indo-Lanka economic relations several issues of mutual interest were discussed. Minister Bogollagama expressed Sri Lanka governments satisfaction at the increase in bilateral trade within the framework of the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement, and expressed the governments desire to work closely with India in upgrading the bilateral FTA to a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in the foreseeable future. The discussions also referred to the need to address Sri Lankas widening trade deficit with India in a meaningful manner. The two sides discussed the Indo-Lanka Joint Commission which last met in 2005, and agreed to look at the possibility of convening the forthcoming session of the Joint Commission after May 2009. It was agreed to convene the sub-committees of the Joint Commission in the interim. On the delimitation of the outer edge of the Indo-Lanka continental margin, the two sides agreed to further discus attendant legal issues, and

work closely in resolving outstanding issues, in a manner reflective of the close friendship existing between the two countries. The two sides discussed progress within SAARC, including issues concerning the Standing Committee and the Council of Ministers sessions due to take place in Colombo shortly. The Minister observed that he looks forward to a successful outcome at the SAARC Council of Ministers Meeting that would bring on board many issues that concern the region. Secretary Menon in response pledged the fullest support of the Indian government to SAARC and observed that it looked forward to playing a constructive role in the forthcoming Council of Minister Meeting. Minister Bogollagama expressed his sincere appreciation of the role played by the Indian government in releasing Sri Lankan fishermen captured in the Indian waters, and for providing them with safe passage. He appreciated the cooperation and flexibility shown by the Indian government in this matter. At the conclusion of the meeting, Foreign Secretary Menon informed Minister Bogollagama that Indias External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee looked forward to an early visit to India by Minister Bogollagama. This invitation was welcomed by the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister. Minister Bogollagama was assisted at the meeting by Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohana, Additional Secretary/Foreign Affairs Prasad Kariyawasam and other senior officials. Foreign Secretary Menon was assisted by Indias High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Alok Prasad, Joint Secretary/External Affairs T.S. Tirumurti, Indias Deputy High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Vikram Misri and other senior officials. Ministry of Foreign Affairs Colombo, Sri Lanka 16th January 2009

I have to advise that the provisions of the draft Bill are not inconsistent with the Constitution. The Bill is not subject to any of the prohibitions or restrictions imposed by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and may be enacted by Parliament. . . . , . . , 46. . . . . . ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Minister has taken an extra step.

. . ( )

( . . - ) (The Hon. D. M. Jayaratne - Minister of Plantation Industries) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) The matters contained in the Bill do not come under List III, the Concurrent List. I just looked at the Concurrent List. It has nothing to do with the provisions of the Concurrent List. In the Concurrent List, No. 1 is Planning; 2 and 3 are Education and Educational Services; 4 is Higher Education; 5 is National Housing and Construction; 6 is Acquisition and Requisitioning of Property; 7 is Social Services and Rehabilitation; 8 is Agriculture and Agrarian Services; 9 is Health; 10 is Registration of births, marriages and deaths; 11 is Renaming of Towns and Villages; 12 is Private lotteries within the Province; 13 is Festivals and Exhibitions; 14 is Rationing of food and maintenance of food stocks; 15 is Co-operatives, - Cooperative Banks; 16 is Surveys; 17 is Irrigation; 18 is Social Forestry and protection of wild animals and birds; 19 is Fisheries; 20 is Animal Husbandry; 21 is Employment; 22 is Tourism; 23 is Trade and commerce; 24 is Newspapers, books and periodicals and printing presses; 25 is Offences against statutes with respect to any matters specified in this List; 26 is Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List, excluding fees taken in any Court; 27 is Charities and charitable institutions, charitable and religious endowments and religious institutions; 28 is Price control; 29 is Inquiries and statistics for the purpose of any of the matters in this List or in the Provincial Council List; 30 is Adulteration of foodstuffs and other goods; 31 is Drugs and poisons; 32 is Extension of electrification within the Province and the promotion and regulation of the use of electricity within the Province; 33 is Protection of the environment; 34 is Archaeological sites and remains, other than those declared by or under any law made by parliament to be of national importance; 35 is Prevention of the extension from one Province to another of infectious or contagious diseases or pests affecting human beings, animals or plants; and 36 is Pilgrimages.

Therefore, the provisions of this draft Bill do not come within the Concurrent List. While the Hon. Member and the Minister were discussing this, I did happen to look at List I, the Provincial Council List of the Constitution which as follows : I quote : 18 - Land.-Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenure transfer and alienation of land, land use, land settlement and land improvement, to the extent set out in Appendix II. That is further set out in section 1:3 of Appendix II of Provincial Council List. It states, I quote : 1 : 3 Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province to any citizen or to any organization I will not read the whole section but it is very clear that land is not in the Concurrent List. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the section you referred to states, I quote: "Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province to any citizen or to any organization shall be by the President, on the advice of the relevant Provincial Council, in accordance with the laws governing the matter." ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) If you read how Appendix II starts, I quote : State land shall continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of in accordance with Article 33 (d) and written law governing this matter. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) That is right. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) So, this is not a Provincial Council matter. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

No, no. Can I read it ? You read 1:3 and then you come to 2:3 which states, I quote : "2 : 3 The principles and criteria regarding the size of holdings

2009 22 929 930

Then you come to the selection of allottees, distribution and so on. Now, if you take all these items which come under Appendix II of the Provincial Council List, this provision does not come under any of those. If you look at the draft - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It does not have any such policy. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

No, no. Let me come to that. I am just reading it out to you. Clause 4 of the Bill deals with land and it amends the disposal of land given on the grant subject to limited conditions. So then, you have to go back to the Provincial Councils. If you read all these sections set out there - this is not alienation. It is imposing a subsequent condition on alienation. It is on principle of criteria. If you go through this and see the exemption, it does not fall under the exemption also. That is the issue here. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Why not? 2 : 4 of the Appendix II of the Provincial Council List says, I quote : "The selection of allottees of such lands will be determined ..." But, it will be within the powers of Provincial Councils. You are coming in between. You are not falling under State land or Inter-Provincial Irrigation and Land Development Projects. I was reading on Inter-Provincial and Land Development, but some of these lands do not come under the Inter-Provincial Irrigation and Land Development Projects. It may be three acres or five acres of lands that have been distributed and all those lands come under State land. Section 1:1 of Appendix II of the Provincial Council List states, I quote : " 1 : 1 State Land required for the purpose of the Government..." It is a matter for the Central Government. It is for us, the Members of Parliament to decide. We have no problem on that. Then, Section 1:2 states, I quote: "1:2 Government shall make available to every Provincial Council.

It does not come under that either. 1:3 Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province It is not under that also. This was land that had been alienated or dispossessed to which you are attaching a condition. .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

It does not come under that. Section 1:3 of Appendix II does not put a condition subsequent to alienation or disposition. I think that is a matter -
