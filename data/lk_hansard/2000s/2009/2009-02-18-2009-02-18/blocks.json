This says that a reward of 5 per cent will be paid if 90 per cent of exports of previous year is attained. So, Hon. Minister, very well knowing that there is a world downward trend today, you are giving the impossible. This is like the Labour GSP. You have pundits in the Central Bank who basically said, Forget the Labour GSP. We do not want it. We will give you 24 billion for the loss of revenue. What happened? Is there a single company getting that today or is it at least proposed in the event that they lose it out? No. So, that is only theoretically. Then it says that employment levels should be declared by the EPF, ETF returns on the 2008 basis. So, if they do not comply with these requirements, this only becomes just another document. Tell us from where the monies would come to pay for this? Are you going to tax the people to pay this? You do not have a single cent. You have not reduced the cost of operational inputs like fuel. Today a barrel of crude oil is sold at US Dollars 35. If you effectively multiply that and deduce it and come back, the cost of a litre is only Rs. 24. So, Hon. Minister, petrol that costs only Rs. 24 a litre is being sold at Rs. 120. This is very much against the intended expectation of the Supreme Court - a flagrant violation of the Constitution. So, if a Rs. 24 item is being sold at Rs. 120, who is prosecuting a black market? The Government itself. - - . So this Cabinet- approved economic stimulus package just becomes a non-entity. -[Interruption.] Hon. Minister, if you can, tell me one company that is happy.

    "text": "giving for something that happened in 2009. We have got to solve it now. Now, you were saying that the US unemployment rate is 7.6 per cent. Well, that is a thing that is going on. What is Sri Lankas unemployment ratio? You are saying that there is under-unemployment. No way. The unemployment figures that the Central Bank Statistical Report shows is excluding the North and the East. So you have excluded three million people who are there in that area and have calculated the unemployment ratio and saying that the unemployment ratio is dropping. If 752 companies were there in 2004 and it has reduced to 237 in 2008, that reduction of employment has to reflect in the unemployment ratio. They cannot be going for gainful employment. Now, Sinotex, a company in Katunayake is closed; Laws Garments is closed and likewise Smart Shirts Lanka Limited is basically scaling down its Pallekele operation. So, these are the things that you have to look at and see how you can sustain them; how to fortify and strengthen them. There is no point saying that you have won this, you have won that. National operation that has got to pervade right throughout the country needs to be carried on. So on that basis, Hon. Minister, ensure that this economic stimulus package is made realistic. Just because Barack Obama speaks in the USA, that does not mean that similar things the Hon. (Prof.) G.L Peiris says here will be a robust operation for a change. There you are putting US Dollars 787 billion. They have put Rs. 300 billion into the failing bank companies. What have you put in here? Your Central Bank information itself reveals that the Peoples Bank is under-capitalized. So, technically that is why the stimulus package needs to be given. Last time it was given, I think in 1993. When the Hon. D.B. Wijetunga was the Minister of Finance, they gave Rs. 10 billion as a bond. That is what keeps the lifeline going on there. But, otherwise, if the depreciation factor and amortization factor are really applied as per the accounting practices of the Chartered Institute, both banks are in technical insolvency. I am only mentioning this for the simple reason that these are matters which need to be addressed. Sir, if you look at salaries, the fundamental factor, today the effective purchasing power of salaries has reduced. So, there is going to be a consistent increase in salaries. If the salaries are not increased, there will be a workforce that is not happy with it. You will have an unhappy workforce and that will lead to productivity reducing and getting dropped. Finally what happens is that the competitiveness of the company will become non-existent. So, then, it cannot compete with the region. Today, there are no boundaries for countries. There is no point in saying, we have the sea that borders India and Sri Lanka. The entire world is one trading body. There are about 210 countries in the world in five regional blocks",

    "text": "and these are what we have got to compete with. So, here, we have got to be in the same league as that of our competing countries. If India is giving loans at 4 to 5 per cent interest, Hon. Minister, you cannot be affording these companies in Sri Lanka to borrow at 21 per cent, 22 per cent or 23 per cent. That is what we have been trying to say. You have got the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris saying, Cabinet approves economic stimulus package. Today I read an article where the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama says, Bailout package for financial institutions soon. Then the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says, We do not have a financial problem. The all-pundit Governor of the Central Bank says, Even the world can crash but we are not crashing. So, then, what are these being given for? If we are not facing a problem, then why do we give financial bailouts; why do we give stimulus? So, do not give contradictory signals and make a mockery of what is going on. This is what needs to be corrected. I frankly say and my personal belief is that there must be a full-time Finance Minister. It can be the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa; it can be the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama; it can be the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris or anybody. That necessity needs to be there. My personal belief is that the President and the Prime Minister of this country should not hold any Cabinet portfolio, because they can supervise the rest. I brought up a Private Members Motion to this effect before this House, debated and it stands adjourned at this moment. So, do not give cross signals. You would see that at a meeting of G7 countries, the Finance Minister of Japan has apparently taken a little too extra wine and he has resigned over that. Here you have ministers who encourage committing heinous crimes and those guys are promoted. So, what is required is to instil discipline into the system. The economic climate is a classic case where we need to make a robust change. The other one is the depreciation in the dollar. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . . ( )",

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well, that is not reflected in the bill. You check the electricity bills of the companies. I am not saying this for the sake of saying so. I am saying that we have companies where there is no reduction in their electricity bills at all. The fuel adjustment has been made based on certain things but that has not been done effectively. So, the most important thing, the major component, is electricity . Then comes fuel. They think that only 4 per cent of the population use petrol. They are absolutely crazy. Actually, it is 50 per cent. Three-wheelers, bikes, vans, fishing boats, everything run on fuel. Compared to the Indian system, you are almost 60 per cent expensive. If an Indian competes with a Sri Lankan company, he will be in two different worlds. That is where the problem is. Then, the next problem is the Rupee to Dollar conversion. The biggest problem is the conversion factor. You have pegged the dollar artificially at high rates and you do not give the exporter an opportunity to compete with the rest of the world. Today, the dollar should be in the range of Rs. 130 to Rs. 135. All exporters urge the Government to please ensure that we have the dollar in its proper perspective. So when you do not have the dollar in its proper perspective, you are going to have the exporters paying the price for trying to control inflation. Inflation in this country is in the range of 20 to 25 per cent. They can stand on their heads taking the new Colombo Consumer Price Index. But, the real effective rate is in the range of 20 to 22 per cent. Otherwise Treasury Bills cannot be in the range of 17 to 20 per cent. That is artificially controlled. Today the dollar is - I would say not at the highest - at its weakest point. The rupee is at its lowest ebb. But, you are trying to defend it. Today there are 48 people who have gone out on roadshows trying to collect money. But, what is the effect in terms of the dollar? US Dollars 200 million have come from Malaysia as a three months rollover worth US Dollars one billion in actual rupee terms. That is enough for four weeks. The amount that you were trying to collect from the Tamil diaspora was US Dollars 600 million. How much have you been able to",

    "text": "collect? It is Rs. 13 million. We are not in the Government. But, we are getting this information. So, Rs. 13 million against US Dollars 600 million is going to be looked at. You are begging India for US Dollars 300 million but they are giving you US Dollars 50 million. With that, how are you going to keep the dollar at its proper place? Today the exporters are the ones who are cushioning the cost of living. . cost-push inflation , . . . ; ; . , . . ? , . . , taxes -Consumption Tax- . It is certainly a good tax. Anybody who wants to consume needs to pay. But, on the same score, if you are using that, the taxation must be in equitable terms with the revenue that you gain. If you are going to tax Rs. 50 out of Rs. 100, it is not sustainable. But, if you are going to tax Rs. 20 out of Rs.100, then it is sustainable. The intention when the UNP Government was there was to increase the turnover and to generate more taxes through that. But, now it has completely taken the reverse course. The turnover is declining and the taxes are being increased. That is where you are going to have a problem. Therefore, trying to protect the industries in this way will never take place. I have just mentioned about the new agreements that were signed. I will table an Agreement entered into on 16th February, 2009, towards the latter of my speech. This Agreement amounts to US Dollars 8.7 million. If this is all that has been signed for three or four weeks, it is hardly anything. You have only signed an Agreement. You do not crystallize any investment. This is the problem. If you look at the BOI, you will find that no investments are coming in today. Do not blame the world. There is a financial meltdown. But, investments take place. When one venture crashes, the next one comes. What is the stimulus that is there to attract the investors? Is there media freedom in this country? Is there a legal system? Today the Chief Justice of this country is saying that this is a lawless State. He himself confronted the problem with regard to the fuel matter. He gave an order, nobody carried it out. So, he had to revoke the order and say that this country does not have a legal system.",

    "text": "Then, look at what is happening today internationally. Sri Lanka is fighting the entire world. The USA Senator, Hillary Clinton and David Miliband issued a statement on the present condition of the country. It was rebuked. Then you had the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown issuing a statement. That statement was rebuked. Then, he appointed Des Browne as a Special Envoy to Sri Lanka. That was rejected even before the appointment was made public. Revised approach was also rejected. Today what is happening? The British are pushing, the Canadians are pushing, the Americans are pushing and the EU is pushing. The Indians have also joined them. The day before yesterday, the President of India stated that there should be an arrangement to work with all parties and named the LTTE. This was never there before. Now, India is naming the LTTE. It has become an unconditional partner in the future prospects of a peaceful negotiation. Investors are looking whether there is a conducive climate in this country. When it comes to the British approach, you have got to look as to what we are doing? Are we basically antagonizing the world or are we going to take them on? If we are succeeding in taking them on, there does not need to be an international community. The next matter that comes up is the inflation factor. The inflation factor is something which basically affects the body economy of a company; because if inflation goes up in a very rapid manner, the cost of production keeps increasing and the increase in the cost of production means that the effective competitiveness erodes. So, on that particular basis, all we have got to do is to ensure that we make ourselves competitive. So, I do not think the Government understands the sensitivity or the urgency in trying to control these things. Then, I am tabling* an article published in \"The Sunday Times\" of 15th February, 2009. It states, I quote: 2007 cost of corruption to government is Rs322 billion. This is something which has been brought out by the Transparency International of Sri Lanka. It basically shows that the cost of corruption in the Government sector is Rs. 322 billion. The total government revenue in the year 2007 was Rs. 750 billion. So, imagine, if they say that the cost of corruption in the Government is Rs. 322 billion in the year 2007, Sir, what has happened is, almost 42 per cent of the revenue in the year 2007 was wasted on corruption. That is what the Transparency International says. So, these are matters that need to be taken into consideration. I know the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, the Minister of Ports and Aviation, is vehemently trying to do his best to justify the promise he gave to Parliament.",

Now, this is something which the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali initiated. The motto he believed in was, \"Export or Perish\". After seeing the importance of the exports, he decided that an Export Council is needed in order to give the direction to the exporter in the country; that that is the most important aspect. But, what happened? For almost 10 years, Chandrika Kumaratunga played merry hell with that. The activities of the Export Council was just brought down to zero. Today, there is no Export Council to look after the exporter. That is legislated in this Parliament but nobody follows that. So, the exporters are wondering as to what importance is attributed to them. On that basis, whether it be the Export Council or the National Development Council - all sweet names are used - at the end of the day, none of the benefits accrue to the exporter. If the exporter is always going to be used as the engine of growth, we must ensure that we give priority to them. Then take the legal aspect on Prima.

    "text": "Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, who is accepting this responsibility at a critical juncture in the history of our country. There is no doubt that the Board of Investment has a critical role to play in the prevailing economic and social environment of our country. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the country is seeing the end of military action. We now have to prepare for the post-conflict situation. Ever since we attained Independence from the British in 1948, the one issue that has prevented this country from achieving its full potential in the economic sense is the problem of terrorism. As you would recall, Sir, in 1948, Ceylon as our country was then called, was looked upon as a model for economic development in the whole of the Commonwealth. We were referred to as the \"Switzerland of Asia\". The former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, publicly asked in his speeches why Singapore could not develop like Ceylon. Our per capita income at that time was way above the per capita income of Thailand, of Korea, of Malaya and of India and we were just a few dollars behind Japan. We had all the advantages which Nature in her abundance could confer upon us. But, we were not able to utilize those advantages to achieve the fullest possible economic development because of the problem of terrorism. That is the one thing that held us back. We are singularly fortunate in our generation to see the end of that problem under the dynamic leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose policies in that regard have won the overwhelming endorsement of our people on yet another occasion. That is from the results of the Provincial Council Elections that were held in the Wayamba and the Central Provinces. Now, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, once the hostilities are over we have to focus upon what needs to be done. The need of the hour is economic development, progress, prosperity not for one section of the people but for the country as a whole. There is today a unique opportunity and it is the responsibility of all of us, whatever political party we may belong to, whatever language we speak, whatever religion we profess and whatever cultural background we come from, it is the duty of us all, who love our motherland, to come together to support a national effort for vigorous economic development in the aftermath of the return of peace. Peace has to be stable. It has to be founded upon the foundations of justice and equity. It is only then that peace would be long-lasting. We have now achieved that. The only reason why investors were reluctant to come to this country was the fear of bombs, of violence, the uncertainty that prevailed in this country. When that uncertainty is removed there is no longer any obstacle. Investors will come into the country. The Hon. Pemasiri Manage rightly pointed out that this must not be an opportunity that should be available exclusively to foreigners. Our people also have very significant",

We must support local industries and the local entrepreneur must be given the fullest possible opportunity of participating in economic development in respect of which there is now no longer any constraint or impediment with the dawn of peace. I explained yesterday to this august Assembly the details of the economic stimulus package which His Excellency in his capacity as Minister of Finance, presented to the Cabinet. The Cabinet unanimously endorsed it and I am sure the Hon. Pemasiri Manage would agree that cumulatively that constitutes a very significant incentive, a fillip, for local industry. Among other things, so long as levels of foreign exchange brought into the country are preserved and there is no retrenchment of workers, there is a huge bonus, 5 per cent of the total value of foreign earnings. If there has been no reduction in the quantum of foreign exchange earned and if a 90 per cent threshold has been maintained in relation to the previous year, then 3 per cent of total foreign earnings will be paid to local companies. These are not benefits given to foreign companies. These are benefits that are fully available to local companies that export products out of Sri Lanka. So, I do not think it is fair to say that there has been an unfair emphasis on foreign entrepreneurs. We have certainly taken into account the needs of local entrepreneurs and in particular, we have imposed a cess on foreign products in order to protect Sri Lankas fledgling industries and to give an opportunity for local industry to achieve competitiveness in a hostile, global environment. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let us see as to what are the opportunities that are available. The Eastern Province is today a real window of opportunity and my Friend, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, has a singular role to play with regard to the very significant developments which are contemplated in the foreseeable future in that part of the country. With the dawn of peace, the entire vicinity of Trincomalee Harbour is becoming a hive of activity. Already there are industries there, in particular the cement industry. Companies, both foreign and local, are very interested in exploiting those opportunities to the full, now that peace is at hand. Then again, take the whole fisheries sector. The Eastern Province provides enormous potential with regard to fisheries. In my view, the most important event which has taken place during the last few months is the opening up of the A-9 highway. The oneness of the country is today not a theoretical matter. It is not just that we are paying lip service to an ideal. It has become a reality. This means that commodities which are produced in the North and the East can find their way into Colombo and through Colombo, into the markets of the world. Onions, chillies, potatoes are grown in profusion in the Northern Peninsula. In fact, the Northern Peninsula had a very prosperous agricultural economy before the scourge of terrorism. Now lobsters, crabs, fish, onions, potatoes,",

    "text": "all of this can find its way into the markets of Colombo and the economy of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces is being inextricably intertwined with the economy of the rest of the country. So, in a very practical sense, that is a demonstration of the oneness of the country, its territorial integrity, its indivisibility. All of that is demonstrated today more than anything else by the opening up of the A-9 Highway. Then, let us look at the potential for tourism that is available. The Eastern Province has beaches which are beautiful and unexploited. The Hon. Prime Minister told me that leading hoteliers, not only foreign hoteliers but also local hoteliers, who have a track record of excellence, have met him in order to discuss the development of the Pasikudah and Arugam Bay areas. That is a unique opportunity that is available. Today, Sri Lanka is going in, not for run-of-the-mill tourism, but for a degree of specialization with regard to tourism. I have myself seen in hotels up and down the country, the value of health tourism for Sri Lanka. The west is moving away from antibiotics and they want methods of treatment which are closer to nature. Hotels up and down the country are opening their doors to tourists from different countries, in particular tourists from Germany who come here year after year to benefit from ayurvedic treatments. Sri Lanka has a rich and varied tradition in oriental medicine - Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani. The nations of the west are today enamoured of the benefits that these treatments offer and they come in very large numbers to take advantage of the kind of treatment that is available in this country for a diversity of ailments. Then, there is eco-tourism. Take the Sinharaja forest. People who are interested in nature, the environment and conservation are looking at Sri Lanka very seriously. We can then offer religious tourism. We have a proud tradition of Theravada Buddhism and people who are interested in the Buddhist scriptures, the history of Buddhist civilization and the tenets of the Buddha Dhamma are coming to Sri Lanka. These are serious tourists. These are not people who just come here to enjoy the sea, the sun and the sand. But, Sri Lanka certainly has much to offer to serious tourists. Then, there is the immense potential for agriculture which is available in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. I went there myself three weeks ago to Ampara to start a variety of projects. Five hundred hectares have been set apart for saffron cultivation and 200 hectares for the cultivation of cinnamon. As you are aware, Sir, little Sri Lanka produces 80 per cent of the world's cinnamon and this cinnamon is of uniquely high quality. Then, the Eastern Province offers considerable potential for the cultivation of exotic fruits and vegetables. We have opportunities to export these into the Maldives, for example, whose economy is principally dependent on tourism, the hospitality sector. But, 70 per cent of the Maldives consists of water. So, there is no cultivable land. There is a major demand for Sri Lankan",

I was present when His Excellency Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran, met with our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. The President of Iran said that there is enormous scope for the export of Sri Lankan pineapples and rambuttan into Iran. Local companies have come to us and said that they are in a position to cater for the increasing demand for these goods in the world market. The only thing they want is land. They are not asking to buy the land. It is contrary to Government policy to sell land resources in our country. But, short and medium-term leases can now be made available, utilizing the thousands of acres of land in the Eastern Province which could not be commercially exploited previously because of the prevalence of terrorism. So, these lands are available. Now, there is a major exercise which has been initiated by the Board of Investment and I am sure the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa will take that forward with his customary vigour and enthusiasm. The essence of that project is this. Investors and companies come and say these are the lands they require: this is the elevation they want; these are the soil conditions; these are their requirements for water, electricity and so on. They come to us with a list of their requirements. The Board of Investment has collected data. In fact, it has set up something that is equivalent to a land bank. So, the Board of Investment has detailed information with regard to the land resources which are available in the different Mahaweli systems and in other regions of the Eastern Province. I am aware that the Department of Geography of the University of Colombo also played a role in identifying these lands and the attributes of these particular lands. So, the challenge that is faced today by my distinguished Friend, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, is to do a matching exercise. These are the lands that are available; these are the lands that are required by the investors and how do we do this matching exercise in order to fulfil the requirements of potential investors? So, that is a major challenge which we have responded to. The Hon. Pemasiri Manage who spoke just before I began to address you, Sir, will, I think be interested to know that the Government is particularly anxious that the fruits of this development should not be confined in the hands of affluent companies operating in Colombo and the environs, but these benefits should be available at the grass-roots level. So, we must not only enhance the volume of foreign exchange that we earn for the country, but also we must put in place a structure which enables these benefits to percolate down to the grass-roots level. That is an essential and integral aspect of the economic policy of the Government. That is why we have put such a sharp focus on the concept of export promotion villages, export agri-villages. Our people have creativity; they have enthusiasm, but",

    "text": "they need access to markets. We must bring the producers of primary commodities into direct access to exporting companies and that is what we are doing through the export promotion villages. On the 7th, 8th and 9th of March, we will be carrying out a major activity in the Polonnaruwa District. Two months ago we had a very successful exercise of the same kind in the Hambantota District. So, this is to support local industry, the small person. The small and medium-scale sector is one of the priority areas which the Government is concentrating on. I think the Board of Investment has another important responsibility to address problems connected with the packaging industry. There are commodities being produced in different parts of the country. For example, kiri ala and beeralu lace in the Southern Province, gems and jewellery, sapphires and rubies in Ratnapura, fruits and vegetables in the Tambuttegama area of Anuradhapura and aquarium fish in Polonnaruwa. All this is being done and these efforts are being stimulated by the Board of Investment and the Export Development Board working together. But, one of our problems is that there is a very considerable degree of waste. I think in some cases, about 40 per cent waste has been found with regard to our fruits and vegetables. So, we have to focus on the packaging industry in order to enable the farmer to get the best possible price and for these commodities to be available to the consumer at the lowest possible price. So, the packaging industry is important. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . . . . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) \" . . \" . , . . Question put, and agreed to. , . . .",

    "text": "the country - Monaragala, Hambantota, Polonnaruwa - this cannot be done only by offering tax advantages. Tax advantages may attract some people, but that is not sufficient. Nobody will go to these remote regions with investments unless the infrastructure facilities are adequate. The roads must be good; there must be water available; there must be telephone facilities; electricity must be available. All this is very important if we are to develop the country as a whole. If we are to get away from this tradition of concentrating exclusively on Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara and having a huge disparity between per capita incomes in Colombo and the rest of the country, that is not satisfactory. That is not an adequate yardstick of economic development. So, we have to ensure that the country as a whole develops and if we are to accomplish that objective, then there has to be concentration upon infrastructure facilities that are available throughout the Island. It is a matter of profound satisfaction to the Government that as we speak today in this august Assembly, it is going ahead with almost 660 projects in the power and energy sector - 660 electricity projects - while undertaking the huge expenditure that is necessitated by the war. No Government since Independence has spent so much and done so much work with regard to the construction of highways in this country. Then, take the irrigation sector. There are major projects like Moragahakanda, Deduru Oya and the Kalu Ganga project in the Kalutara District. Moragahakanda will serve so many districts in the country. Then, also Kumbukkan Oya project. So, major irrigation schemes are being started. Then, look at the electricity sector. Upper Kotmale, Norochcholai, Kerawalapitiya, all these are projects which have been put on hold for a very long time. No decisions were made with regard to Norochcholai and Upper Kotmale. But, now decisions have been made and the process of implementation has begun. So, infrastructure development now enables these resources to find their way into those parts of the country which have been neglected for a very long period of time. The Maga Neguma and the Gama Neguma projects enable a resuscitation of the rural economy. Through the Dahas Diriya programme, employment is being found for very large numbers of young people. And, we must remember that all of this is being done while money is found to prosecute the war satisfactorily and to produce results which are evident today to the country and the world. Therefore, Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to emphasize this point. There are those who argue that the Government is winning the war and that another group must be entrusted with the responsibility for developing the economy. I think that is a totally false argument. Economic development is part and parcel of the overall",

    "text": "strategy of the Government. Peace dawns upon us. That is a new beginning; it is not the end of things. It simply provides us with the opportunity of addressing ourselves to the tasks that lie ahead. So, peace is being made use of in order to promote economic development. Economic development is not simply a matter of theoretical plans being made, but a practical start has been made. The fact that today we have the advantage of a stable and lasting peace serves as a durable foundation for a whole variety of projects which cumulatively are going to enthuse and invigorate our economy. That is why I took the example of the Eastern Province. Look at what is happening in the Eastern Province. Brandix is going there to open a factory. That will provide employment for about 1,700 people. Hayleys are very actively involved in a whole variety of agricultural projects. Indian companies like Mahindra and Mahindra are looking at opportunities in that part of the country. USAID is investing almost 12 million dollars in a whole variety of programmes in the field of vocational training and skills developments. So, the whole place is becoming a hive of activity. None of these would have been possible if terrorism was reigning supreme in that area. Then, that situation changes. It opens up vistas of opportunity for economic development, which could not even have been contemplated in the preceding period. Consequently, Mr. Presiding Member, there is a close nexus between the dawn of peace and the development of the economy. The Government therefore adopts a multifaceted approach to these issues and we have given serious thought to the steps that we need to take to develop the economy, taking the fullest possible advantage of conditions of tranquility which are available to the country once the military action comes to an end. So, these two things cannot be separated. They are part and parcel of one coordinated and properly- integrated holistic strategy. Then, everything that I have been talking about, the objectives which we need to achieve, are facilitated by some other developments which have taken place, chief among these is the success of the Government in dealing with inflation. We are aware, Sir, that in July last year, the rate of inflation was almost 30 per cent. Now, it has come down to about 14 per cent and it is our hope and expectation that before the end of the year we will be able to achieve single-digit inflation in this country. This means that the cost of living comes down and also equally importantly it enables us to reduce the rates of interest. That is one of the recurring complaints, particularly by smaller and medium-scale entrepreneurs. They argue that they have to make very substantial provision for debt servicing which makes their product uncompetitive in the current market conditions. So, the reduction of the interest rate is certainly one of our priorities. It could not have been done if inflation was very high. But, now that inflation is coming down rapidly, the reduction of the interest rates is certainly feasible and that will be a particular boon to the small and medium-scale sector.",

    "text": "There is just one other point that I would like to refer to, Sir, before I conclude. It is this: that as part of the Governments initiatives upon the dawn of peace we are absolutely determined to take the fullest possible advantage of that opportunity. After all, that opportunity is coming to us after almost 30 years. For 30 years we could not develop; we could not attract investment; we could not take the fullest benefit of the advantages which this county had - its geographical location, its climatic conditions, the free trade agreements that we have with India and Pakistan, our traditions which were friendly to business and all of these. We had all these advantages, but we could not take the full advantage of them because of terrorism. Now that that is over, we can look forward to a resurgence of the economy and that is certainly a matter which has received the attention of the Government and we have constructed plans for that purpose and begun implementing those plans. Now part of those plans is an emphasis on the services sector. There is not doubt that that is the way forward. We are very proud of the performance of Sri Lankas leading companies in the field of services - banking, insurance and information technology. I would like to take the example of the construction sector. Our construction sector has done very well overseas, particularly in Kuwait, in Qatar and in Dubai. There is a construction boom in some of these countries and our people have gone abroad. I am not talking of just bricks and mortar; not just the physical side of construction, but particular skills like quantity surveying and landscaping. We work closely with the Chamber of Construction Industry. My Friend, the Hon. Rajitha Senaratne and I, several months ago, undertook a visit to Dubai and to Doha and on that occasion contracts worth very large sums of money, I think more than US Dollars 300 million, were signed in those countries. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has been particularly helpful in modernizing and streamlining their systems and procedures to enable Sri Lankan companies to compete in the world market and to demonstrate their skills which they have in profusion. In conclusion, I would like to say that all these exciting developments are possible because of the advent of a stable and lasting peace. That is an achievement of the Government. It does not stop there. It really gives us the opportunity to move ahead for the development of the economy. We are determined to ensure that every part of the county becomes a full and vigorous participant in that development process. That is the pith and substance of the export promotion village concept for which His Excellency the President in his capacity as Minister of Finance allocated as much as Rs. 500 million for the Export Development Board. Sir, as you are aware, we have already begun that programme in Bingiriya. We have then gone to Wattegama, Pathadumbara, the district represented by my",
