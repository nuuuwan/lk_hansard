( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I am sure you will agree that under Article 42 of the Constitution, the President and the Cabinet are responsible to Parliament. Furthermore, under Article 43(1), Sir, a specific Cabinet Minister is held responsible for discharging the Cabinet responsibility through Parliament. It is the accepted norm that in Parliament, you will be telling and revealing the truth because it is on behalf of the people. Mr. Speaker, I get up at this moment further with the Constitutional support buttressed by Standing Orders 84 and 85. Yesterday, the Minister, the Hon.Gamini Lokuge stated in this House a factually incorrect statement. I am at this particular moment taking full responsibility because the Prime Minister is here. I would not have taken it up if not for the Prime Minister because I know how the Leader of the Opposition and Prime Minister yesterday worked hand-in-glove and we appreciate the actions taken by the Prime Minister after the incident. Mr. Speaker, the website "guardian.co.uk" reports today "Warning of attacks on Sri Lanka cricket team was ignored". An article in the website "guardian.co.uk" reported by Mr. Saeed Shah in Lahore states, I quote: Police and administration officials met on 23 January to assess the threat, but before action could be taken, the government of Punjab province -of which Lahore is the capital - run by the party of the former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, was dismissed, following a court ruling. It further states, I quote: Intelligence reports said there might be an attack on the cricket team, said Pervez Rashid, a senior member of the sacked Punjab government. Furthermore, Hon. Prime Minister, the former cricketer and Pakistani politician in fame, Mr. Imran Khan has said, I quote: Its the government of Punjab which is responsible for this, because it is shocking - the sort of security they provided the Sri Lankan team after having given them guarantees that all the security concerns would be taken care of. A normal minister in Pakistan. would have got better security than was provided to the Sri Lankans. Hon. Prime Minister, why am I referring to this? As you know, the cricket team is being spoken of by everybody, not only in Sri Lanka, but around the world. "The Sunday Observer" of 28th December, 2008 states that the President and the Foreign Minister had looked into this matter and had given full approval. Hon. Prime Minister, the Indians who are even today saying IPL

should be cancelled in India, could not go to Pakistan. The Australians and the New Zealanders did not go to Pakistan. Hon. Prime Minister, the new organizer who has been appointed to Kotte, the Foreign Minister, has told untruths to the Cabinet. The Sports Minister also told us untruths yesterday by saying that all matters were looked into. I do not want to trouble you because you have enough trouble in your hands. But, the information that is being given to this House should be reliable. We have been supporting you all the way on many issues. When we raised this in Parliament yesterday, there was an uproar which was unfairly treated against us. What is the action taken when it is exposed in your own newspaper, "The Sunday Observer"? It is being mentioned by people of fame like Imran Khan. Furthermore, the information given by the Cabinet after the incident is also not true. Hon. Prime Minister, there has to be some concrete action taken. When the entire world knew that Pakistan was having problems; Nawaz Sharif was sacked; when security was assessed and when it was said that the Sri Lankan team was under threat, why should our cricket team be exposed to such threat? I do not want to make it a political thing. This cricket team is yours and ours like the armed forces. Today, some people try to think that the armed forces is part of the SLFP. But, the UNP and the SLFP are all there. So, I would greatly appreciate if the Prime Minister would take cognizance of this fact. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon.

JAYALATH JAYAWARDENA MBBS, FICS, MD Member of Parliament Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka February 20, 2009 H E Shri Alok Prasad High Commissioner for India in Sri Lanka Indian High Commission 36 - 38 Galle Road Colombo 3 Dear Your Excellency Expression of sincere gratitude to the Government of India With reference to the telephone conversation I had with you today. I would like to thank you personally for assisting and making arrangements to import the most widely used, pain killing injection called Pethidine. There has been a very severe shortage of Pethidine injections in Sri Lanka for the last couple of weeks. As you are aware, this strong pain killing drug is being used to reduce pain in cases of trauma, accidents and injuries inflicted on the battle front. Therefore, there is a great demand for this injection in the hospitals of the war-torn areas of Sri Lanka. I would also like to thank you for facilitating the basic humanitarian needs and medicines to Sri Lanka from India. As an Assistant Secretary of the UNP in charge of Human Rights and Relief, let me express our sincere thanks and gratitude to the Government and people of India for assisting the people of Sri Lanka by providing the basic humanitarian needs and medicines.

Sir, then I quote from the "Daily News" of 2nd March, 2009: A UN Security Council on Friday received a briefing by Under Secretary General Sir John Holmes who visited Sri Lanka at President Mahinda Rajapaksas invitation last week. The briefing did not result in a ceasefire call to Sri Lanka from the Security Council, but general agreement that the LTTE must lay down arms and ease suffering of civilians. Sir John Holmes told reporters that humanitarian concerns about the people held captive by the LTTE remains a major concern while the concerns about IDPs who have already come to cleared areas seem less than what was feared for. ? , , . . , .

It states, I quote: LTTE forcibly holding civilians No genocide in Sri Lanka - HRW The Sri Lankan government is not committing genocide in the North, said Charu Lata Hogg of Human Rights Watch.

It is the LTTE which is forcibly holding innocent civilians as a human shield and shoot at them when they try to flee. There are certainly international guidelines which have to be met in a conflict situation. Sri Lanka cannot just be accused of genocide. . . . . ; . . ; . , . . , , GSP plus ; ; ; . .

Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Presiding Member, I think it is the duty of the Representatives of the people to clearly state in this House the sentiments of the people whom they represent. So, as someone who represents the Muslim people of the Digamadulla District, I would like to categorically state in this House that in the history of this country no Muslim leader or no Muslim representative has ever supported separatism or condoned terrorism. We have always empathized with the sentiments of the Tamil-speaking people. But, we have categorically gone against separatist tendencies and also vehemently opposed terrorism. As history has recorded in this country, after the advent of militancy among the Tamil people, the Muslims have suffered as much as the Sinhalese people in this country. But, we must also understand and acknowledge that no Sinhala leader in this country has ever supported separatism. No one has supported separatism. But, their acts of omission have today led to the Tamil people to espousing separatism. We know the history of this country. We know that when we came together as one nation to win Independence in this country, we spoke of a

2401 2402

Sri Lankan nationalism. We spoke of a Sri Lankan identity and it is the political positions that we have taken that have been fundamentally divisive. Having come together to attain Independence as one nation, how did we come today to dividing ourselves on linguistic and ethnic lines and espousing various nationalism? This is something that we need to address because it is always very easy to keep on blaming the Opposition. We know that the late Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was the first politician to espouse federalism in this country. In 1926, when he set forth on this soil as an Oxford educated member of the elite of this country, he espoused a federal solution to this country. But, when he was at the zenith of his political power, he was basically forced to articulate against it in 1956. Thirty years after having first sown the seed of federalism, he opposed it because of the political compulsions of that day. .. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala - Minister of Consumer Affairs)

That is, the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) That is what I am coming to; hold on. Then, the issues of nationalism started, as the Hon. Minister rightly said, with the first Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact, where the majority agreed to disagree. Then, we had the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Agreement. Again we agreed to disagree. Then, we had the J. R. Jayewardene-Amirthalingam Understanding. There also we agreed to disagree. It is these political positions and the wavering of the majority that led the Tamil people to say, Look, this is not going to happen. They are not going to accommodate us into a Sri Lankan nationality. Therefore, we need to espouse our own cause and we want a nation of our own. [Interruption.] Do not interrupt me. I am coming to that. I speak here as a Sri Lankan. So, listen to me. Then we had the episode of the Premadasa regime, the Wijetunga regime and then again, a Bandaranaike came before this country and asked for a mandate of peace. Having got a mandate of peace and having made an attempt at negotiating peace, we went back to war. Again in 2001, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe went before the people on a mandate of peace, came to power and signed a CFA which we put all the blame on. But, we must understand it is only the events after the CFA that laid the ground work for the international support this Government has got after commencing this war. If we are to blame this war on, we have to blame it on all the Sinhala political leaders who ruled this country since

Independence. It cannot be left to one person. You cannot say that the UNP is the cause for all these. The SLFP has ruled this country, the UNP has ruled this country and they have sown the seeds for what we have reaped. You shall reap what you sow. Now, having gone through all this and having officially lost over 70,000 lives - I am sure unofficially that it has to be more than 100,000 - we have come to a situation where we are now caught up in a fixed mindset. What the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike strived to achieve in 1956 - he sowed the Sinhala nationalist seed in 1956 - he had to eventually pay with his life. Today, His Excellency the President has achieved that. What the Horagolla Wallawwa could not achieve, the Medamulana Walawwa has achieved. All credit goes to him but having achieved that and taken the Sinhala people to this mindset, how do you reconcile to form a Sri Lankan identity? I have spoken of this before. You have on your side over 13 Members of Parliament - Ministers and Deputy Ministers - who are Muslims. You have over eight or nine representatives of the Tamil people. So, you have in all over 20 Members of Parliament who belong to the minority communities. Despite that, we all know that the divisive mindset of the minorities have been clearly demonstrated in every election that has taken place after the advent of this Government. Why? When you have so many representatives on that side who are doing so much of development work - in fact, they feel that it is a waste of time on our part to be sitting on this side and talking while they are developing the community - I give credit to that. But, with all that development and all the power that they have in their hands, they cannot change the mindset of the people who brought them to this House. Except for three Muslim Members of Parliament who sit on that side - the Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie, the Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ismail Ashraff and the Hon. A. L. M. Athaullah - the rest of them came from this side. The rest of them were voted to power by the people who felt that the grouping that has come to power is not going to solve this problem. Now, having convinced them to sit on that side and serve the people and if service is what changes the peoples mindset, it has not worked. We have found that at every election, the majority of the minority has voted against this Government, not because they do not want development, not because they do not want jobs, not because they hate those representatives. No, that is because they still do not feel that this Government is capable of taking them into a Sri Lankan identity. They fear; they fear the unknown; they do not know what is in store.

We say that this Eelam War IV is a humanitarian effort. Yes, Mavil Aru was one. But, what happened between Mavil Aru and now is a pure war. We have nothing against it. Force has to be met with force. There is absolutely no problem. But, we are now in a huge

[ . . . ]

2009 04 2403 2404

humanitarian crisis because we dismiss numbers and say, No, in 56 square miles you cannot have 300,000 people. It is immaterial. There can be 30 people, but they are all human lives. So, you have to weed out the LTTE from the Tamil people. You cannot brand every Tamil a member of the LTTE. We have lessons in history. We have lessons in the history of the world in conflict resolution. Take the example of Ireland. The IRA was a terrorist organization, branded as a terrorist organization and represented politically by Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein was their political arm. But, that did not stop the British Government from talking to Sinn Fein. They did not say, Because you are representatives of the IRA, we cannot talk to you; you are as good as the IRA. No, you cannot speak to splinters of the major group and say, They are the representatives of the Tamils. We can speak to them because they are on our side and these people sit in the Opposition camp; they represent the LTTE. So, we cannot talk to them. They represent the Tamil people as much as we represent the people of our area. So, if you need to talk about a problem that affects our people, you need to talk to us.

We have been talking. The peace process has gone on for how long? For almost three years now; 104 sittings in two years. The TNA has not sat in; the Tamil people have not sat in to talk of a solution to this problem. So, when do we start talking? Do we start talking after we have killed each and every member of the LTTE or do we start talking after we have finished off the TNA as well? No. Then, whom do you talk to? Do you talk to the people who are in those concentration camps? No way! You have to talk to the people who sit in this House as the Representatives of the people who have voted them to power. Whether the LTTE picked them to come to Parliament is a different issue, but it is the Tamil people who voted for them. So, you need to take the Representatives of the Tamil people into your confidence and start talking. I am sure they are not going to carry a suicide kit or a grenade into Temple Trees. No way! But, yes, they will not sit and start nodding for everything that the Government proposes. No way, because they represent the people. So, if we cannot change our mindset and think okay, now we have finished the war, for once, we are in a positive mindset, we have a superiority complex now. For all these years, all these Sinhala leaders kept us in an inferiority mindset. Now, His Excellency the President has brought us to a superiority mindset and therefore, we shall now talk peace on our terms. This is what has brought us to this position. The fighters of the LTTE were not produced out of machines; they were not thrown out of a machine produced by Prabhakaran. All these suicide bombers were not robots. They were human beings. They were driven to a point where they felt convinced that what they were doing was right. So, how

do you change that mindset? How do you convince the Tamil people to forget the past because we have to forget the past? The past is always before us because all we can talk of is the past. But, it is the lessons of the past that we have to learn from. We have to take them in, absorb them and then sincerely make an effort at changing the mindset of the people whom you represent, the people whom you have taken to the zenith and those who are now downtrodden. We know that there was a time when the Tamil people felt that they were very strong because the LTTE was very strong. Today, they feel very meek because the LTTE is weak. But, that does not disqualify them from being citizens of this country. So, I appeal to this Government to basically start talking even now, by understanding their mindset, by understanding the root cause, to the Representatives of the Tamil people and understand what needs to be done at least now to ensure that we build a Sri Lankan nationality, a Sri Lankan identity and not leave room for the seeds of separatism to be sown once again. It can be among the Muslims, it can be among the Tamils and it can even be among the Sinhalese because we know that before we gained Independence, the Sinhala race was a divided race in this country. We had the up-country Sinhalese; we had the Karawa caste; we had all the caste divisions and it is Independence that brought us together. In fact, the Kandyans espoused federalism long before everybody else because they felt that the foreigners were not giving them their due place. So, as long as there is a reason, as long as the people feel that there is a reason, they will always go behind that. Therefore, take that reason out and let us all work towards forging a Sri Lankan identity. Thank you.
