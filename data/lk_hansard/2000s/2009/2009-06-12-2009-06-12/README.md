( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Petroleum is bought through a company the name of which is difficult to pronounce. That is an Iranian company based in the UK. Why is there a convoluted process to get aid to Sri Lanka? You did pronounce a name which I did not catch properly. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Naftiran Intertrade Company. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am informed that company is based in the UK. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes but it is an Iranian Company. The Government of Iran and the Government of Sri Lanka have agreed to trade through this company.

[ ] ? [ ] . . [ ] . , . You have a responsibility to get out of the limited space that you are in and look at the problem in the context of what has happened in Sri Lanka today. It is your responsibility. Unless you take the responsibility upon yourselves, we are going to find it very difficult to bring about a solution to the national question based on devolution of power and power sharing mechanisms because of the fact that there are people expressing various views in this country. If the so-called moderate representatives of the Tamil people do not take it upon themselves and get involved in an inclusive process to find a solution, then you are again playing into the hands of the extremists. Extremists in the North and the South were feeding each other. If you take the number of leaders killed by the LTTE, they were not people who were talking about a solution outside the power sharing mechanism. Starting from the late Hon. A. Amirthalingam - he believed a solution based on devolution - the Hon. Neelan Tiruchelvam, Mr. Sabharatnam, Mr. Uma Maheswaran, Mr. Padmanabha, the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj, the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar and the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, are all leaders who believed in a solution to the national problem based on devolution and those were killed. The LTTE never touched even with a catapult those who were shouting in the South saying, "No devolution". Why? The two extremist parties from each end were feeding each other. They were their friends, knowingly or unknowingly. So, it is up to the Tamil National Alliance MPs now to look at the problem in the context of what has happened and then to move forward from there onwards. Boycotting all discussions and not taking part in those are not going to help at all. It is neither going to help you nor the people in the South who are talking about a solution based on devolution. So, it is up to you if are really going to respect your Colleague who is no more among us, then this is the ideal time for you, to get together and start looking at the problem with a new attitude. , . . 100 , , , - -
