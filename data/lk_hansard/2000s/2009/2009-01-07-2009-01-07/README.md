Hon. Speaker, I would like to add to what our Deputy Leader, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya stated. Yesterday, when we were not present in this House, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage very shamelessly had mentioned our names and made wild accusations. It does not matter because we are used to being character-assassinated. As you know, I was out of the country till the 4th of January 2009, and on my return I heard that one of my friends Mr. Krishantha Cooray, the former CEO of the The Nation newspaper, which was bought

285 286

over by the Government, was in hospital from 1st to 3rd January, 2009. He had to almost leave the country owing to threats of being impartial. As a common courtesy, I thought it was my bounden duty to go and see him. So, once I went there and was speaking to him, I came to know that the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya was coming along. The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage had said that we were there at 12.30 p.m. and subsequently in the evening and various other things, giving the connotation that the MTV station had been gutted in fire in our presence in this skyline building. So, Hon. Speaker, this despicable act is now permeating right into the Parliament when the Government had done this. Are they trying to put the blame on Members of Parliament like the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and myself by fabricating nefarious stories like this ? ,

. . Question Proposed.

[.. 11.35] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Nation Building Tax Bill that has been brought into this House consequent to the Budget that was presented. This is yet another new tax that is going to be imposed. Amidst various forms of taxations that we have in this country - and ours is one of the highest taxations against the GDP in this region - another tax is being added on as a result of the dwindling revenue of this country. The Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning who spoke before me gave various excuses but could not address the heart of the matter as to what is going on in this country. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, first of all let me wish this House and all the people, through this House, a very successful and prosperous 2009. The year 2008 was, I must say, an economically disastrous year. I am sure the Government would look at 2008 with trepidation because they have not been able to fulfil any of the aspirations that they set out when they started the year. In 2009 once again, they embark on the same footing without proper macro-economic policies. One of the main things that I have been saying in this House is that the politicizing of economic affairs, the politicizing of the monetary authorities of this country is the biggest bane in this society, and I think if we continue doing so, we will only be putting more burden on our people. This, I think the Government seems to be doing with a great pleasure. They use State funds as if it is their own private property. That is the reason why I thought it is necessary to mention certain important matters that are affecting todays economy. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, you would see that the Nation Building Tax that you are going to bring in is another form of a turnover tax. You replace VAT or you substitute VAT and - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, you are going to bring in a new tax in the form of indirect taxation. Now, the popular mode of consumption oriented taxation has been basically replaced to a certain degree by VAT and it was deemed fit five or six years ago that the replacement of indirect taxation to the form of advanced VAT would help the revenue authorities to bring in one or two forms of taxation rather than a multitude of taxes. But now, Sir, you would see that while the expectation is being complied with, you also have forms of indirect taxation coming on to the turnover tax or a cascading type of taxation is coming back. Now,

2009 07 303 304

the Nation Building Tax is another similar form of that. I bet that it starts with 1 per cent today and probably tomorrow it will go up to 2 per cent and then you have another tax which is running parallel with VAT which is claimable and non-claimable. So, it is a very nebulous exercise by this unprofessional type of leadership. Owing to the fact that costs are going up the escalator and the revenues up the stairs, the gap between the two is being felt by the people. Now, various forms of words or nomenclature is being used in order to satisfy the egos of the Government in imposing this tax. The "Nation Building Tax" seems to be a very superlative type of a word which only goes to show how advanced this Nation Building Tax is. We only know that on one side you break the nation and on the other you tax the people through this Nation Building Tax. So, these are things that are being used for convenience in order to get revenue rather than anything else. The Nation Building Tax is being imposed even on house mortgagers and as a result, prices go up. Then, when tea and rubber industries have crashed, the Nation Building Tax is being imposed on them. So, there is no proper management of exercise as to when this tax has to be imposed. On this score, first of all I think it is necessary to say that the Budget for 2009 roughly estimated a revenue of Rs. 755 billion. It was once revised to Rs. 705 billion and subsequently during the budgetary process in the latter part of last month, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it was re-estimated to about Rs. 677 billion. But, now we have been informed that this revenue has dropped to almost Rs. 652 billion. So, there is a gap of another Rs. 22 billion. Where are these monies going to come from? This is the biggest problem we have because this is like a relay that is run. Every year the deficit is carried on to the following year. Now, they are very happy that one year is over and the headache has been carried to the next year. The previous year they promised to collect Rs. 750 billion on revenue and they re-estimated it to be Rs. 700 billion. Then, once again the real estimate was only Rs. 655 or 656 billion. From where is the deficit going to be found? Is it that you are going to tax again? Is it that you are going to print money? Is it that you are going to borrow money? All these are questions that come up. On one side the Government is ruining the nation development and on the other, the Government is taxing he people through the imposition of the Nation Building Tax. These are gimmicks being used on a daily basis. Sir, the Hon. Deputy Minister after presenting this new tax Bill to this House has left even without asking from the principal Opposition as to how this has to move forward. We, in our alternative budget proposals, mentioned that consumption-oriented taxes will be something that we intend collecting as revenue from the people in future and we showed that Rs. 282 billion will be used by reduction of interest charges, which is already

being used by the Government and also replacing VAT with a consumption-oriented tax. So, the Government is doing the third thing that we said, for which they laughed at us. Even ten minutes ago he said, Unlike the alternative budget the Opposition put forward. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, you can see that the spineless [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] who were even unable to come and listen to what we said, have stealthily taken our ideas and they had the audacity to come back and say that they cannot be implemented. When we said that petrol can be reduced to Rs. 65 or Rs. 70, they laughed at us. When we said that diesel can be reduced to Rs. 65 or Rs. 70, they said, cannot but they have done it now. When we said that kerosene has to be brought down to Rs. 50 they said, cannot but they have done it now. When we said that consumption-oriented taxes can be brought in; they asked, What you are talking? but now theyhave brought it. Sir, because the Government does not have any skills in going forward, they use the ideas of the Opposition to go forward. It does not matter. But, at least have the courtesy to come and listen to the questions and answer them. Everything is covered with a war euphoria that is being brought forward. Financial responsibilities are one of the key factors that this august Assembly needs to protect. Unfortunately, it seems to be eroded by the day owing to the fact that people who do not understand economic macro senses are in places of authority. Even in sacrosanct places where non-politicization needs to take place, political stooges are now being placed and they are singing hosannas for their dinner and are unable to prove or show to the country what the exact economic picture is. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, at the same time I would like to say that 1 per cent tax symbolizes - or in revenue terms yields in a revenue of - roughly Rs. 16 to 18 billion. The Finance Minister, the President of this country came and addressed the House on the 6th of November and presented the Budget. In the Budget you had a projected revenue of Rs. 855 billion and an expenditure of Rs. 1,755 billion making an overall deficit of about Rs. 890 billion. So, that budget deficit was what was going to be bridged through the budgeting process. Now, at that moment they estimated the expenditure to be so much and the income to be so much and with that deficit, they brought forward a budget that was going to be implemented from the 1st of January. Then, what happened was, owing to the country being extorted by the Government and black marketeering being pursued by nobody else but one of the Government institutions, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation on public

305 306

interest, Reverend Palitha, Mr. Ravi Jayawardene from "Corruption Watch" and myself decided that we go before the Supreme Court in order to have the inalienable right, which is public interest litigation. The reason for going before courts was that we found that the Government was extorting money from the people, almost taking 1: 5 type of return, and we wanted the benefit to permeate down to the people. In that process, what transpired? Today, Sir, you hear that petrol can be imported to this country at Rs. 24 a litre. I am talking of the rates that were prevalent as at 30th December, 2008. At that moment, petrol could be imported at Rs. 24 a litre. Now, what was the price before we went to court? It was Rs. 157. Then, in the Budget it was brought to Rs. 142. Then, from Rs. 142 owing to the fact that we went to court, they brought it down to Rs. 122. Now, Rs. 122 against Rs. 24 rupees shows a gap of Rs. 98 - a contribution that is going to be brought into the Government coffers on 40 million litres of petrol a month. If you look at that particular conversion factor, you will roughly bring in Rs. 80 billion per year only on one item called "petrol". Now, when you really look at 40 million litres yielding such revenue, the only thing that goes into the mind is, "Who is pursuing the black marketeering policy in this country?" We have the Consumer Affairs Authority under the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, Minister of Trade, Marketing Development, Co-operatives and Consumer Services. If you have a Consumer Affairs Authority which design prices - assume that Laugfs gas goes to get pricing - they will be given a profit margin between 10 to 15 per cent. Now, the Consumer Affairs Authority takes on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and asks, "What is your profit margin?" Then, can the Consumer Affairs Authority turn back and say, "Yes, you can charge five times your cost." No, you cannot. That is what this black marketeering Government is doing. I did my very best in trying to bring Government institutions under the Consumer Affairs Authority. Unfortunately, the Attorney-General decided otherwise. But, there was a necessity. We thought of bringing in the Government institutions because owing to the inefficiency, owing to the corrupt actions that were prevalent at that time, it was deemed fit and I thought that it was the bounden duty that we take these institutions in. But, as the Attorney-Generals Department thought otherwise, unfortunately, we were unable to bring in a mandate to bring the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation or the Ceylon Electricity Board under such an institution. But, today what has really happened? Exactly, what we thought would happen, is happening. The Ceylon Electricity Board makes a 200 per cent profit on its purchasing. Now, they are making a loss not simply because of the fact that it is a mismatch between selling and buying prices but, the mismatch is owing to the inefficiency and corrupt action taking place. That has

created a problem in the Ceylon Electricity Board. Unfortunately, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is the exact opposite. It is a cash cow. It is making money. As I said, 40 million litres is sold at Rs. 98 - that is the contribution; I have taken taxes and all profits off. That is, the selling price less the cost price is Rs. 98 and that multiplied by 40 million litres a month basically signifies that you are making Rupees four to five billion a month. Rupees five billion multiplied by 12 is Rs. 60 billion and that is the revenue earned only on petrol. Now, why is the Government acting in this way? Just because oil prices went down, are they taking undue advantage of that? When the oil prices were going up, they were blaming the world, they were blaming the Middle East; the oil-producing countries. We had Members of Parliament who were vociferously opposing the UNP by saying, What is the purpose of having a government when the world oil prices go up the price of oil in this country also goes up?" We must have a government that has the courage of conviction to change that. Where are those people who were there? They have not only jumped from the JVP, they have jumped on to the Government side and sitting in the Front Bench, they have the audacity to turn round to the people and ask, What is going on in this Government? In order to shield what they told earlier what do these Wansa people talk? The war is a convenient excuse. . . . , ? . , . . . . . , 75 . 75 . , . . , , , . . . ?

I am taking the highest cost factor that will be borne by the Government of Sri Lanka. It is Rs. 39 if you import diesel from Singapore on Singapore plus basis, refined, profit added on and with CIF to Colombo. Now, how much was a litre of diesel before we went to courts? It was Rs. 110. After we went to courts, it was brought down to Rs. 80. Sir, Rs. 80 was what we recommended in our alternate budget. The Hon. John Amaratunga, the Hon. Kabir Hashim, the Hon. M.Joseph Michael Perera, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake and I, under the instructions of our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, brought an alternate budget to show this incompetent Government as to how a competent Opposition can bring in ideas. It has been accepted; the price of a litre of diesel was brought down to Rs. 80. Now, with court action, another Rs. 10 was reduced. But, you can bring the price of diesel down to almost Rs. 55 to 60. We were very conscious, because when we went to the Supreme Court, the Judges of the Supreme Court said, Please, do not politicize this. Quite rightly we agreed. Sir, we gave a concession of almost 150 per cent for petrol, almost 100 per cent for diesel, almost 25 to 30 per cent for kerosene oil and 100 per cent for gas through our alternate budget. But, finally what happened? They went to the extent of taking the judiciary on. Now, there is a collision between the executive and the judiciary obviously. .. '''' '''' ? , ,

He is a minority who ensures that a majority feeling is brought into this country.

Presiding Member, I would also like to revert back to English. First, I wish to bring to the notice of this House that we condemn the attack on the MTV. What we saw yesterday was shocking. This country has had a history of respecting democracy, the freedom to speak and the freedom to express ourselves. Therefore, at this moment, we wish to express our solidarity with the Free Media Movement to say that we have to protect democracy. This was an attack against democracy and the Government has a responsibility to answer as to how this happened when there is a high security zone established in the city. I also wish to take this opportunity to briefly speak about the incidents that are taking place in the Gaza in the Middle East where we recall the numerous UN Resolutions calling for an end to the occupation of all

Palestinian territories and the oppression of its people by Israel. Today, we are affirming the democratic will and the rights of those occupied people guaranteed by the international law. The Palestinians in the Gaza territory are being bombed mercilessly and over 575 people have died; women and children are amongst them. As His Excellency the President who was also the former President of the Palestine-Sri Lanka Friendship Association, this Government must vehemently condemn this act and we must take action to support and bring a Resolution to the United Nations to immediately stop the aggression that is going on in the Gaza territory. This is something that Sri Lanka should do and the Government must take the lead in this. Before I move on to the real issue, the Nation Building Tax Bill, I would like to mention that in the last few months we have seen a lot of financial institutions collapse. It started with Sakvithi and it has spread to the Golden Key Credit Card Company. It is shocking to see that the Government seems to get out of every incident saying that the Government has no responsibility. We kept on telling in this House over a year ago that there were fundamental flaws in the economic policies, in the monetary policies and in the fundamental fiscal policies that the country was pursuing and we kept saying that the Central Bank is being politicized. Now, in the corrective measures that the Central Bank has taken, there seems to be some fundamental issues. When the whole issue of the Golden Key Credit Card Company came to light, there seemed to be a lack of supervision on the part of the Central Bank. Then, arising from that, the Central Bank used Section 30 (10) of the Monetary Law Act to move in and take over the management of the Seylan Bank to protect the Bank. That was good enough and they handed over the management of Seylan Bank to the Bank of Ceylon. In this instance, once they handed over the Seylan Bank to the Bank of Ceylon, four new directors were appointed to the Seylan Bank. Now, basically the Monetary Board has a responsibility to look into as to how these directors are being appointed. One particular director - we have no problem about who is being appointed, but then a bank, if it is in trouble, needs to have directors who have experience in banking, who have a sound background and who can protect the bank - is Mr. Narangoda who was on the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate into matters relating to failed finance companies. There was a Rs. 16 million budget allocation given to this Commission. This Commission presented its Report a few weeks ago to His Excellency the President. From what I hear, this Report is still not public knowledge but if this report had been timely and if it had carried substance, then the break-down of most of these institutions could have been stopped. From what we hear, this report is not complete; is not adequate; is not precise. Then, one of the members of that Presidential Commission is appointed to the Board of Directors of the Seylan Bank. Another director by the

337 338

name of Mr. Neomal Gunawardena has been appointed from a legal firm and his legal firm apparently has been advising the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation on the hedging deal. When you bring in such people on to the Board of Directors of the Seylan Bank, does it not create further implications? Section 42 of the Banking Act very clearly states that the Monetary Board should adhere to some guidelines in appointing directors. It clearly says this. How has the Monetary Board appointed these directors? On what grounds? Have they adhered to these rules? I think that on behalf of the Central Bank, the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning has an obligation to reply to this question in this House. When you take the Nation Building Tax, it is another one of the series of frauds which is being perpetrated on the people of this country on the pretext of taxes. By saying that the Nation Building Tax is only one per cent, people think it is a small amount. But, it is a tax upon a tax. In other words, it keeps adding up at various stages. When someone buys the output of one industry and sells it to another, it becomes double taxation. In other words, this Nation Building Tax can become a cascading tax. So, this is very dangerous. It can have a huge impact on the economy and on the prices of goods. What happens when you add this to the import duties and to the existing VAT? Then it can becomes more and more higher. I would like to look at some angles of the tax itself. Of course, there was a Defence Levy and a National Security Levy during the time of our Government. So, the Nation Building Tax is similar to the Defence Levy. These are normally brought in for short times but the usual trend is that it will never stop. On the one hand, this new tax further complicates the existing tax structure in the country because individual taxpayers, today, including professionals who are struggling to pay or to have filed their VAT returns without the aid of a tax consultant, would now find that compliance of the Nation Building Tax will require specialists to help them with their tax compliances. This becomes a problem for the people. On the other, you have to give quarterly returns and monthly payments. So, they are complicating an already complicated tax structure. Another problem with the Nation Building Tax is that there are service providers such as distributors in business and agents who receive only a small margin through their businesses. They actually collect the total amount of a payment on behalf of the principal but they have only a marginal profit. They too would be liable to the Nation Building Tax on the total amount that is due on the liable turnover. This has not been looked into. Now what will happen is, the distributor operation or that business of being a distributor becomes uneconomical and a certain group of people might not be able to carry on their businesses. Take the Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Act which also imposes a charge on liable turnover. In

recognition of this, it has given relief to distributors pursuant to their lobbying with the Government but unfortunately, when the Nation Building Tax has been brought in, they have not drafted this adhering to the lessons that should have been learnt from the Economic Service Charge. So, by imposing this tax, the distributors are going to get into difficulty. The Nation Building Tax would have an impact also on price-controlled goods because under the Consumer Affairs Authority, there is a list of exempted goods on which the Nation Building Tax will not be effective. But, unfortunately there are some items which have not been put under those exempted goods. They are price-controlled. For example, take cement. Today cement is a price-controlled item but it is not in the list of exempted goods. Therefore, those who are dealing in cement will have to pay the Nation Building Tax. Another serious flaw in the Bill which can be seen is Clause 6 of the Bill which allows manufacturers to claim input credit for purchases and imports. However, the Bill is silent as to whether the Nation Building Tax should be shown separately on the face of the invoice or not. As such, if the supplier opts not to show the Nation Building Tax amount on the invoice, the manufacturer would not be able to claim that input credit. So, this affects the manufacturer. In other words, he cannot claim his input credit if the supplier does not show the Nation Building Tax on his invoice. There are serious issues in this Bill which have to be corrected or amended and I am sad that the Hon. Minister is not here to listen to us. , . , . . : '' , .'' . , , . . 2008 . . . , 2009 , , , , . , . , 2008 520. 2008

What really happened the other day at the MTV studio complex is nothing but a clear manifestation of the criminalization of politics in this country. Every Member of the Government should be ashamed of that for the simple reason that the culprits are yet to be traced. I am sure, Sir, that the culprits would never be arrested because they are politically protected and politically patronized. When I saw the political personalities who were there to console the MTV administration on the tragedy that has befallen that institution, I was wondering as to whether not even one of them knew who were the real culprits behind that. I am pretty sure, Sir, at least one of the honourable men who went there to the MTV studio to express his solidarity at the hour of need, should have been aware of the identity of the criminal elements who planned and perpetrated this cold-blooded, cowardly and barbaric act, which is nothing but a direct assault on the independence of media. Not only that, it goes far beyond the very existence of the free media in this country. , ! . , , . , . . . , - Constitutional Council - ! ! , ; . . . . , , , - something - ,

nation

. Nation ; . Now I will switch on to English so that my Friends on the Government side also would understand me. Mr. Presiding Member, the term nation is totally different from what we really mean by the term country. Sri Lanka is a country. Sri Lanka is a sovereign State. I do not dispute that. I do not deny that. But, Sri Lanka is yet to become a nation. Sri Lanka is inhabited by the different communities such as Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers. Different people of this country posses different religions. Yet, even after 60 years of Independence, please remember that Sri Lanka is yet to become a nation. To be a nation, the people concerned should have the feeling that we all share a common destiny; we all have a common identity and we all are the partners in search of a common future. That is not there. That is yet to come in this country. In this situation, Sir, we are talking rather quite interestingly and at times seriously, about nation building. , . ; . ; . , . , , ,
