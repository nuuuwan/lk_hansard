decided that, do not go and change it on the basis that it is Government Business and that you can change it within 24 hours. Do not do that. Now you are taking up Opposition business also. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I agree with you. We do not want to change it within 24 hours, but if the Government wants to take up urgent Government Business, there has to be provision. That is in the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We were in principle, against this Bill. ( ) (The Hon.

[.. 10.57] ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) , . , . . , , . Venerable Presiding Member, monetary policy is not a subject that most people are familiar with. But, it controls every aspect of our lives. The price of all goods that we consume and the services that we make use of is determined by monetary policy. The economic well -being of our people is determined by monetary policy. The stability of a country and its economy is determined by monetary policy. Venerable Presiding Member, we are living in interesting times. This is a time when prices are falling worldwide; there is deflation. Even in Sri Lanka, we saw inflation falling by about 0.7 per cent a month, for three months. This is in spite of the massive money-printing and limited currency depreciation that we have seen in the same period. We are living in interesting times because most of the myths, the lies and the deceptions that we have been fed by very learned people, have been blown wide open and blown to pieces. A few months ago, the Government told us that there was a huge food crisis and that there was an energy crisis. But, now food prices are falling and oil prices are falling. This proves to us more than anything else that prices and inflation, and indeed deflation, is monetary in nature. If costs increased inflation, we cannot be having deflation today. If wage increases caused inflation, we would not be having falling prices today.

Another honoured myth that has been fed to us for decades has now been blown wide open and that is the myth that oil imports caused the rupee to depreciate. Venerable Presiding Member, today oil prices are falling. The countrys entire import bill is falling. Yet, the rupee is under severe pressure. Why is this? In the space of five months we have lost about US Dollars two billion in foreign reserves. Why are we losing reserves and why is the exchange rate under so much pressure if oil price or imports are the cause of balance of payments pressure? I would like the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance to answer that. Venerable Presiding Member, to understand why these things happen, we need to first understand what type of monetary regime we have in this country. We have a pegged exchange rate system. Or, more correctly called a soft peg. If you look at the history before 1950, we had what is called a hard peg to the Sterling via the Indian rupee. It was also called a currency board or a board of commission for currency. Why I have to speak of history is because it is important to understand the context. People of this country do not really know what is happening. A currency board cannot print money. Therefore, the exchange rate is fixed. Our exchange rate like much of the British Empires Sterling area was fixed. It was fixed from 1885 after the currency board established by the Paper Currency Ordinance, No. 32 of 1884 began operating. Venerable Presiding Member, under a currency board, a balance of payments crisis is not possible because all the rupees in the country will be created by incoming dollars. If we import more, the currency board will exchange dollars for rupees until the supply of rupees decreases. If we export more, we will get more dollars and rupees. When we have more money, we will spend it. Then, our rupees and also reserves will fall until we stop spending. In 1950, we created the Central Bank. From then on, we started to print money. We sold Treasury Bills to the Central Bank and printed money. Each time we did that, we found that the amount of rupees in the country was greater than the dollars in the Central Bank. Then, we had a currency or balance of payments crisis. Before 1950, our inflation level was low. But, as we started to print money, our inflation levels went up. In the outside world also, changes were taking place. While we had fully foreign reserve-backed currency, countries like Britain had currencies backed by gold. But, this link broke during wartime or when budget deficits rose. England printed money and found that food prices and gold prices went up. Then, the government stopped converting sterling for gold. Price controls were imposed but that caused shortages. Then, rationing was introduced. Foreign exchange controls were also introduced. But, we did not address the root cause of the problem. The root cause of the problem, Venerable Presiding Member, is bad monetary policy. In two words "money printing" or another word that is synonymous with money printing is "Nivard Cabraal".

After World War II, the world got together and set up a new exchange rate system. The gold standard was abandoned. The sterling area currency boards were dismantled and the Bretton Woods system was born. The US Dollar kept to the gold standard at 35 dollars per ounce. Other countries were supposed to keep parity with the dollar. But, unlike the sterling area of currency boards, this system did not endure. The architects of this system which included John Maynard Keynes knew the shortcoming. The problem was that each country could individually print money, unlike the sterling area currency boards. Recognizing this problem, the IMF was created. The IMF was supposed to help countries get back to the system if excessive money printing broke the link. But, ultimately the system collapsed, not necessarily because other countries printed money but because the United States did. During the Vietnam war, especially the expenditure from 1968 onwards was crucial. By 1971, free market gold prices were going up at an alarming rate. The US lost tons of gold, just like today we are losing foreign reserves. In 1971, the US stopped converting dollars for gold, just like Britain had done during the two world wars. Then, we had the oil shock. Food prices shot up, a massive bubble, in other words. By 1973, there was floating paper money. No longer was money backed by gold. The Brettenwoods Agreement collapsed. We have a similar situation since 2008. There is an oil shock and a food price shock. Venerable Sir, monetary policy then is a deadly weapon. Monetary policy then is a high sounding name for a very cheap trick. It is nothing more than a tool to create inflation. It is therefore, a deadly weapon. You make one mistake and the entire population pays for it. It is like giving a Uzi submachine gun to a person who is mentally unbalanced and he would blow everybody into pieces. Giving the Central Bank to people who cannot handle the monetary policy is a situation where they will destroy the poor, and the economy of this country at the same time. High inflation will cause negative real rates. It will destroy the lifetime savings of old people, of pension funds and of the EPF. That is why in 2002 and 2003 when the UNP was in power, we brought interest rates down to 11 and 7 per cent. We first brought inflation down to 2 per cent before we brought interest rates down. Inflation went down to 2 per cent and then interest rates came down to 7 per cent. Venerable Sir, we did not say the inflation index was wrong. We did not falsify the index. We brought inflation down by economic management. True, we did not give massive salary increases. When we gave a 10 per cent salary increase, inflation was only 2 percent. So, there was a real increase in salaries. House

prices were stable. Housing loan interest was brought down from 22 to 11 per cent during that short UNP regime. We did not give low interest rates to only Government servants. We gave reasonable interest rates to every single citizen in this country to develop their business and entrepreneurship. But, most of all we did not commit the great sin of stealing from the old people and the poor people of this country, as this Government does. I can proudly go to my grave today, knowing that I was in a government, under the "Regaining Sri Lanka" policy, where we did not steal the hard-earned savings of the grandfathers and the grandmothers of this country. We did not steal the same money through 29.9 per cent inflation and then change the index to hide the fact that we were stealing from the wage earners and the old people. I know my colleagues in the JVP are also concerned about the poor. Therefore, I hope you will look at how economics really works. This is not about capitalism or about communism. These are basic facts. What I have told you is the history of the monetary system. Now, we come to the present or more importantly, the future. That is if we have one. We are today at the brink of a disaster. Our politicized Central Bank is trying to gloss over the fact. But, Venerable Sir, let me enlighten you on some ground realities. The starting point to most of our troubles began in 2004. I have a graph here which I will table* to be included in the Hansard. This graph really shows the picture. This is what happened to our interest rates. After 2004, what you can see is the 12-month Treasury Bill interest rate and the 12-month CCPI inflation index rate. The Treasury Bill interest rates have been climbing steadily. Money was being printed. Along with Treasury Bill rates going up, the inflation index has risen up very sharply and inflation went to unprecedented historical highs within the last year. Before 2004, interest rates were higher than inflation. We kept interest rates higher than inflation. So, a saver got an interest income higher than the interest rate. But, from 2004, after this Mahinda Chintana Government came to power, this began to change. How did that happen? The Government increased spending. We were told that spending was better than cutting budget deficits. We were told that reducing budget deficits was old fashioned. These were the speeches that were made by the Hon. Ministers, the Deputy Ministers and the Central Bank Governors. But, whose money was being spent? It is the peoples money that was being spent. It was taken from the people or borrowed from the people or stolen from the people of this country or from abroad. But, there was not enough of it. They took from everybody and everywhere, but there want not enough money. So what did the Government do next? They created money out of nothing. They printed.

771 772

They sold Treasury Bills to the Central Bank and got printed money. They spent that also. That was not enough. Then, they borrowed from abroad. Then, they borrowed locally and then they printed again. So it went on. So what happened? The inflation increased and the rupee fell and by November 2004 itself our reserves were falling. From November 2004 itself, our reserves were falling. Venerable Sir, on December 2003, our foreign reserves were US Dollars 2.3 billion. In November 2003, the Central Bank credit to the Government was only Rs. 42.8 billion, but by November 2004, when the Mahinda Chintana "Rata Perata" Government came back to power, the Central Bank credit to the Government rose from Rs. 42.8 billion to Rs. 107.2 billion. Within a year there was an increase of Rs. 64 billion that was printed. Venerable Sir, why was this Rs. 64 billion printed? The Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has been the Deputy Minister of Finance since that time. For what did they print? To finance Government wastage and the so-called benefits of Rata Perata. I do not know to whom the benefits accrued. Now, we have a Government which is not reducing the oil price even when it falls abroad. What happened to our foreign reserves? In 2003, our foreign reserves were US Dollars 2.3 billion but by November 2004, within a year and within six months of a change of Government, our foreign reserves dropped to US Dollars 1.8 billion. That is, US Dollars 456 million vanished into thin air. The Government busted it up. By November 2004, our foreign reserves were down and we lost more than US Dollars 450 million. We would have lost more if not for the tsunami. Foreign aid came and we got dollars. So, we survived 2005. We must thank the tsunami because it saved the country during that period. In 2006, the Government again printed money. Inflation went up, back to the 20 per cent level. Then we borrowed from abroad. We sold Treasury Bills to foreign speculators. In 2007, you printed money again. Inflation was again at the 20 per cent level. In October, 2007, you borrowed US Dollars 500 million in sovereign bonds. The rupee was saved but inflation went up above the 20 per cent level. You kept borrowing; you kept printing. So, what happened? Land prices went up. A perch of land which was Rs. 50,000 went up to something like Rs. 300,000. When there is inflation, this happens. People who had land gained but not the others. People would lose 15 to 20 per cent by investing in the National Savings Bank because of very high inflation and low interest rates. Poor people who had invested in the National Savings Bank lost. There was a dissaving because of the high inflation and low interest rates. So, when you create a situation like that, Hon. Minister, you create monsters such as Sakvithi, "Danduwam" and various other organizations. So, people went and invested with Sakvithi and other questionable schemes because of this. By giving negative

real rates, this Government paved the way for people to fall pray to scammers. Land owners got rich. Landless people had to pay six times what they paid for four years ago. This was the cost of inflation. Then we had 2008, a year to remember. In 2008, again we printed money. It may interest the House to know that since September 2008, about Rs. 148 billion has been printed. Hon. Minister, if you think I am wrong, I want you to correct me when you speak or even now. Since September 2008, Rs. 148 billion has been printed because in September there were zero Treasury Bills stocks. In November, there was Rs. 92 billion of Treasury Bills. From November to 20th January, there is Rs. 148 billion of Treasury Bills stocks. In other words, between November and today you have printed Rs. 56 billion. You had been printed Rs. 148 billion since September. How can you do this? I will go back to the relevance of this when I talk about the foreign reserves. All this printing was for two reasons. One of the reasons was that on several occasions, this Government which has wasted public money on Mihin Air and other grand schemes printed money to repay Treasury Bills. These monies did not accrue to the people. The tea smallholders suffered; the rubber smallholders suffered but Mihin Air and other great schemes were to be subsidized. Another key reason why this printing went on was to intervene in the foreign exchange market. They had to intervene to keep the rupee up. They did not want to devalue the rupee. So, there was intervention. It is true that in the beginning of the year 2008, the Central Bank was not printing money. That was a good thing. The rupee got stronger and the economy was getting better but interest rates were high. But, it was too late and too little because four years of bad monetary policy, of printing money was catching up on you. That is what really happened. In the meantime, the accumulated inflation was having another effect : our rupee was overvalued. What do you mean by the rupee being overvalued? Overvalued means our inflation was higher than that of all our trading partners in the world or the rest of the world. So, what happens? We are not competitive. I am tabling* a document, Venerable Presiding Member, to be included in Hansard. This table shows the real effective exchange rate and the overvalued exchange rate that Sri Lanka has. , . Like the CCPI, this was also changed from time to time. But, no matter even if you changed and played around with the index, by the Central Banks own index, the rupee was overvalued to an unprecedented level.

By October, 2008, the rupee overvaluation was at 27 per cent. Our rupee has been overvalued by 27 per cent, which means that we are less competitive by 27 per cent compared to all our trading partners. So, how can you

help the tea industry, the rubber industry and other industries of this country? In our time, the rupee appreciated. Venerable Presiding Member, when the UNP was in power, the rupee appreciated; the inflation was also low. Therefore, the competitiveness of the country's industries was maintained. Domestic producers were protected. This Government talks so much about patriotism and local industries but has been the biggest betrayer of the local industry and the domestic sector by adopting bad monetary policy. As I said, it is a dangerous weapon, a razor-sharp weapon. They have managed to destroy the domestic industrial sector of this country. Now, the domestic producers who were protected are exposed to importers. This Government protects the domestic industry with high taxes by hurting the poor man on the street. But, our producers who are proud people, who gave goods at good prices to the people, are competing with the importers and are now running only a tax arbitrage business. They are there only to pay taxes and not to serve and develop this country. So, our exporters too could not compete with the others. When you look at the international arena, you could see that we are not competitive. Our domestic producers could not compete. From about September, again this Government started to print, print and print more money and the rupee has started falling. And, this is being sold to the people as a protection for the domestic industries. People are naive; people are innocent. That is why I had to delve into the history of monetary policy and explain to the people what monetary policy is about. Venerable Presiding Member, we have been through this before. In the 1970s, this same strategy was adopted, but it did not work. It happened to Argentina; it happened to a number of other countries. We are concerned that it should not happen to our country like this. It was in this backdrop, Venerable Presiding Member, that in September, 2008 money printing and currency defence began very seriously again. The Central Bank started to defend the rupee by spending all our reserves and at the same time, money was being printed. If the Central Bank had made the rupee strong in the first half by not printing money and indeed by taking away money printed earlier from September, the opposite would have happened. I would like to ask, Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, what is the foreign exchange reserve today? Can you tell us what is the foreign exchange reserve today? , . ( ) (The Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya) . ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) ? . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya) . ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim)

Venerable Presiding Member, I think it is his duty to educate me on the figure. But, he says he cannot give me the figure. I will tell you why I asked that question. It is relevant. I have said in this House today that the Treasury Bills stock is Rs. 148 billion. The Treasury Bills stock in November last year was Rs. 92 billion. Between November, 2008 and today, Rs. 56 billion has been printed. Then, if you go back to our reserve money balance, according to the Central Bank, on 15th January this year it was Rs. 259 billion. But on 4th December, the reserve money balance was Rs. 255 billion. Between 4th December last year and 15th January this year, the reserve money balance has increased only by Rupees four billion, maximum by Rupees five billion. But, the Government is supposed to have printed Rs. 56 billion between November and now. If they have printed Rs. 56 billion, this money should have gone into the reserve money balance. The reserve money balance should have gone up by Rs. 56 billion. But, it has gone up by only Rupees four billion. What happened? I would say that there was an outflow of this Rs. 56 billion. In other words, when you convert it, it is about US Dollars 500 million. I am saying that it is more than US Dollars 500 million, but safely a minimum US Dollars 500 million has gone out of this country within the last few weeks. That means that our foreign exchange reserves are not at what the Central Bank says or what the Government says. I would like to say that our foreign exchange reserves have fallen to a much lower amount. I would say that the foreign exchange reserves are something like US Dollars 1.5 billion or even less. That is not enough even to finance four weeks' imports into this country, which is precarious, which is dangerous and which amounts to treachery on the part of the Central Bank and the Government. That is why I try to make this point clear. That is why I took up the history of bad monetary policy, the current context and I am talking about what will happen in the future.

Venerable Presiding Member, I did not make a political speech. I removed myself from politics. I spoke about the subject matter because I love this country, because my party loves this country. We need to live in this country. We need to protect this country and we can protect it only if we have a strong economy and good economic fundamentals. That is very important. Therefore, I would like to ask the Government to explain

775 776

the situation categorically, because yesterday the Central Bank said in a public statement that our foreign exchange reserves are higher than in 2004. Yesterday, Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal has said that the reserves are higher than in 2004. Now, we can see with our own eyes that it is much lower. If Rs. 50 billion was printed from November to yesterday, where did the money go? It should have been in the reserves, but it is not there. This is a game of deception. But, this time we can no longer borrow from abroad. There is no tsunami to give us any more aid. This administration has burnt all our boats. The goodwill that was established with the international community through decades of diplomacy by the UNP and likewise the SLFP governments, have been squandered in a matter of months just like the foreign exchange reserves. Our banking system is weak; bad loans are rising; industries are collapsing. You cannot protect industries only with taxes especially in foreign markets. At the rate we are losing our reserves, in about how many months will we run out of them ? Two months? Three months? We are being told now that the diaspora is coming in with money. Now, we are told that a team of the Central Bankers are going on a world tour to get the money, to get dollars into the country. This is the next big joke. But, will it flow in? I am wondering whether, when the Central Bankers finish their world tour, the remaining little dollars will be be spent on that tour. Venerable Presiding Member, this is very dangerous. In the 17th Century in France, they even guillotined central bankers for doing treacherous things, for printing money. They guillotined central bankers. I hope we do not have to come to that. I hope they would realize before that what their responsibilities are. I hope before that the Ministers in charge of finance would come to know that finance is as important as defence. They are both equally important for the well-being of the people and the sovereignty of this country. Venerable Presiding Member, we are at one of the darkest periods of our history. We are facing absolute bankruptcy. When we could not repay local people, we printed money. But, we cannot print money when we have to pay foreigners. We have to find dollars. We have massive foreign loans to be paid. By the Central Banks own admission, we had to repay foreign loans in 2008 on a net basis. Our rating has been downgraded. The untruths that are told here can no longer be told abroad. We will be facing international bankruptcy maybe in two months or three months and this august House does not even know the real numbers of foreign exchange reserves. This is sad.

I asked the Hon. Minister very decently to give me an answer and he refused. I do not know why. I have a right to know it because I am a Member of this House. I have a right to know it, Venerable Presiding Member, and this Government cannot give it. Venerable Presiding Member, the poor will pay for this. The rich can get away. It is always the poor who will pay for all the mistakes the Rata Perata and the Mahinda Chintana makes. It is finally the poor who pay the price and they do not know that because this is not capitalism; this is not communism, but the dark force of ignorance, of sheer stupidity, of bad monetary policy. Venerable Presiding Member, I would like to finally say that there is something known as the Monetary Board, which is responsible for monetary policy. Remove politicians out of that. When you take the Monetary Board, there is the Governor of the Central Bank who sits on it and there is the Secretary to the Treasury who sits on it. In 2002, under our Government, we amended the Monetary Law Act and made its composition five members. The three other members should be appointed by the Constitutional Council and approved by the President. Unfortunately, there is no Constitutional Council because the Seventeenth Amendment has not been amended yet. So, then what happens? The President appoints the three other members. I have no doubt about the integrity of the people who have been appointed. They are fine people of very high esteem. But, if you look at this team in the current Monetary Board, except for Mr. Sumith Abeysinghe, who is the Secretary to the Treasury, who understands economics and has a very fine background, the rest have no background in economics, monetary law, monetary activity, monetarism or anything. How would you expect them to understand what is going on? How would you expect them to understand that the Central Bank is being politicized? How would you expect them to know that we have come to a precarious situation that our country may slip further and further into danger, into a balance of payment crisis? Venerable Presiding Member, when the Central Bank was established, it was envisaged to give operational independence to it with a mandate for achievement of low inflation targets. A central bank should be independent and autonomous. Some central banks are prohibited from subscribing to Treasury Bills in the primary market as it causes monetary expansion. However, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has been increasing the holding of Treasury Bills, thus causing monetary expansion. It has been found that the Central Bank is highly politicized. Venerable Presiding Member, with this, I rest my case. Thank you.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. I was quite amazed to hear the Minister, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane saying that a situation is being created in this country where all the people in this country - to put it in the order in which he mentioned it - the Sinhalese, the Muslims, the Tamils and the Burghers can live in peace and happiness. I will deal with this statement of his as I go along. It is primarily the purpose of my taking part in this Debate. I am not going into the question of statistics in regard to the countrys monetary situation or the economic situation. But, I want to deal with the situation prevalent in respect of human beings, particularly the Tamil civilian

human beings living in the North-Eastern part of this country, who are living under military rule. They are not persons who are living as normal civilians should in a civilized way. What you are planning to do is to take over the North and the East and subject the North and the East and the Tamil civilian population living in the North and the East to military rule. You think that you can subjugate us, you can suppress us, you can subdue us and you can rule us in that way. That is precisely what you are trying to do. I am surprised that a Member of the JVP has moved this Adjournment Motion in regard to the countrys economic situation or the monetary situation. In whatever situation the country is today, economically or monetarily, it is primarily on account of the war. There can be no question about it. The war that has raged in this country for many years has been the primary reason for the most depressing situation pertaining to the countrys economic policies or monetary policies. I am not exculpating the others. I am not saying, others are not responsible. But, the JVP as a party has a major role to answer for the prevalent situation because the JVP was responsible for the proposals pertaining to the Interim Self Governing Authority which could have been discussed; had not been discussed, it had not being pursued. When there was a possibility of P-TOMS arrangement, a Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure in the North-East, the JVP was once again primarily responsible for that arrangement being scuttled. It is my submission, Mr. Presiding Member, that if either one of those institutions had come into being - the Interim Self Governing Authority in the North-East or the P-TOMS arrangement in the North-East - this war would not have broken out. It was the primary purpose of my party and the Members of my party, we tried our very best to bring about either the ISGA or the P-TOMS arrangement because we were convinced that if we were able to get the LTTE involved in implementing the Interim Self Governing Authority or in implementing the P-TOMS arrangement, where the Tamil refugees as a result of the war and the tsunami could have been resettled, could have been rehabilitated; where there could have been reconstruction, there could have been development and the LTTE involved in those activities. Then, we would get the LTTE more and more into the political mainstream and a political dialogue; there could have been a negotiated resolution for the Tamil question. That was not possible, Sir, on account of primarily the JVPs attitude. They held the major political parties to ransom. They saw to it that they were successful in scuttling the possibility of those two institutions emerging and you did not want either institution to come into being because you did not want to give the Tamil people their rightful place in this country. You did not want the Tamil people to take part in any measure of rule pertaining to the affairs of governance in their own country. You wanted to treat the Tamil people as second class citizens because you regard the Tamil people as being second class citizens. That is the reason why I say, without any fear of

799 800

[ . ]

contradiction, the JVP adopted that attitude with which the major political parties went along and neither of those institutions came into being. You are talking about the economy of this country. What has happened to the economy of the Tamil people in the North and the East? What has been happening to the Tamil people as a result of the war that is being waged in the North and the East? There is constant aerial bombing, continuous aerial bombing, sometimes several bombings per day. There is constant multi-barrel rocket launcher fire, constant artillery fire, all into civilian-populated areas. Is this happening in any part of the world? Are civilian-populated areas being bombed aerially and are multi-barrel rocket launches and heavy artilleries being fired into civilian populated areas in any other part of the world? People are being killed in several numbers everyday. I have got some statistics here - several statements - of some recent killings between the 31st of December, 2008 and 5th of January, 2009 and between the 6th of January and 13th of January where constantly, everyday, as a result of aerial bombing and shelling, people are being killed and substantial numbers are being injured. That is the plight of our people. There is death; there is devastation; there is destruction; our houses are being destroyed. We are losing both our residential and occupational assets. Our farming equipment, our fishing equipment, our livestock, our plantations have all been destroyed. We have been reduced to a state of penury and destitution. People who lead normal, respectable, contented lives in their own houses, in their own gardens have been driven out of their houses. They have been driven out of their villages. They have lost everything they owned in this world and they have been reduced to a state of destitution and penury where, like beggars, a large number of them live under trees and have to depend upon food which is given to them by various organizations such as the World Food Programme. Recently, India has come to their help to some extent. They are short of food; they are short of medicine; they are short of shelter; they are short of drinking water; they are short of sanitation facilities. People are undergoing immense difficulties in the Vanni. There are about 350,000 to 400,000 people now in the Mullaitivu District, in a part of the Mullaitivu District, running helter-skelter from one place to another depending on where the bombing is taking place, where the shelling is taking place. You are talking of the economy of your country. How can your economy ever prosper when you are doing this to a segment of your own people? Merely because they have a distinct identity and they are Tamil people, you think that you can do this and get away. I recently read with some amusement, a statement made by the President in regard to the Gaza Strip in Palestine. What is happening in the Vanni is not any better than what is happening in Gaza. I think they have now come to a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. But, there

can be no ceasefire agreement in Sri Lanka because you feel that you must subjugate the Tamils completely. So, this is the position, Sir. When these people talk about rebuilding the economy of this country, it sometimes raises several questions in my mind as to whether the economy of this country can ever prosper, ever move forward in any constructive way when you continue to treat a segment of the people of your own country who bear a distinct identity, the Tamil people, in this most brutal, most atrocious way. How can your economy ever prosper? You are committing genocide of the Tamil people on the one hand and you think that your economy can prosper and progress in this situation. I do not think that can happen, Sir. The Tamil people are fleeing this country. They are either running across the Palk Strait to South India or if they are people who possess some resources, they try and find ways and means to go across to other parts of the world. The worst thing is this, Sir. Nobody knows exactly what is happening in the Vanni. Everybody is going to depend upon the information that is supplied by Government communiqus either by the Military Spokesman or the Political Spokesman. There is no free media. The media cannot go there. They are sometimes taken on guided tours as per the restrictions imposed by the armed forces. The media cannot go there independently and freely and report on the prevailing situation. There are no UN agencies in the Vanni now. There are no International Non-Governmental Organizations in Vanni now. They were all asked to get out of that place in September last year and since then, they are not stationed there permanently and they cannot act freely and independently as they wish. There is no independent information. You have placed the 350,000 to 400,000 people in this pathetic, miserable plight. There is no possibility of anyone independently reporting as to what is happening to these people. Surely, Sir, the world must know the truth. We must know the truth and the truth cannot be something which comes from the mouth of either the Government Military Spokesman or the Government Political Spokesman. They must be having a lot of things to conceal and one cannot expect them to speak the truth in this situation. India has expressed concern. The National Security Adviser for India, in fact, expressed concern first and there were demands issued by the Indian Government. There was the Foreign Secretary and the Foreign Minister of India who expressed concern about the civilian situation of the Vanni. They made statements. If the Sri Lankan Government is speaking the truth, Sir, the Hon. Minister Bandula Gunawardane with some degree of audacity stated in this House just a while ago that the Government is creating the political space for all the people in this country - the Sinhalese people, the Muslim people, the Tamil people and the Burgher people - that was the order in which he mentioned the different

2009 21 801 802

communities, to live, as he said, with peace and dignity in this country, then, I think they should be quite willing to allow some independent persons to go there and really ascertain for themselves what the present situation in the Vanni is: why the people cannot live in their houses, whether the houses exist or do not exist, whether the people have lost their assets, whether they are able to carry on with their occupations, if not, why they cannot, is it because they have lost all their fishing equipment, all their farming equipment and all their assets have been destroyed? Why do people have to depend upon other assistance? Our submission, Sir, is that this war in the Tamil civilian populated areas in the Vanni has been prosecuted with a disproportionate degree of force pertaining to the Tamil civilians and with total unconcern and total disregard for the safety and security of the Tamil civilian population in this country. By reducing the Tamil people to this miserable position, the Sri Lankan State is, in fact, committing genocide against the Tamil people. In this situation, Sir, I wanted to pose this question. Why does Sri Lanka not invite an independent multiparty group of Members of Parliament from India to come to Sri Lanka, go to the North-East, to the Vanni and see what has happened and what is happening now and also go to the Eastern Province, to the coastal areas of South Trincomalee and North Batticaloa and see for themselves what happened in those areas when the war was prosecuted in the Eastern Province? After all, you are talking to the Indian Government. The President of this country is engaged in telephone conversations with the Indian Prime Minister. A special envoy of the President has gone to India on behalf of the Government. The Foreign Secretary of India has come here recently. They are very much in touch with each other. Why can you not in this situation invite a multiparty group of Members of Parliament from India to come, go to those areas and see for themselves what exactly has happened and let the world know what in fact has happened? In the Eastern Province, Sir, in the South of Trincomalee, in the so-called High Security Zone, in the Grama Sevaka Divisions of Sampur East, Sampur West, Kadakarachchenai, Kunativu and Navaratnapuram, people are not being permitted to resettle and every single house in these areas has been destroyed not merely by the war, but after the people were evicted, every single house in every one of these Grama Sevaka divisions has been destroyed to prevent the people from going back and now the area has been declared a High Security Zone. I am told that an ancient historical temple called Bhadrakali Amman Temple in Sampur is in ruins. That is one of the most famous temples in the Eastern Province. That is the position, Sir. We want the truth in regard to this battle to come out. Nobody can go there. No civilian can go there. It is out of bounds for everybody. This situation, when the

Government imposes blanket secrecy in regard to what is happening in these areas, must not continue. We want to make an appeal to the international community that they must intervene and ensure that this complete blanket secrecy that prevails in these areas, except such information at least made available by the Government, must come to an end and the truth must be known. Therefore, I want to appeal, Sir, to the international community that they must prevail upon the Sri Lankan Government to ensure that. There are independent people who are able to go into these areas and see the situation for themselves and who are able to come out with the truth in regard to these matters so that there can be decisions made based upon truth. Despite the fighting in Gaza, the media was able to go there. We were able to see on CNN all that was happening in Gaza. They were not stopped by anyone there. What the Israelis did in Gaza or the Gaza militants, the Hamas, did to Israel was all well shown on TV and reported in the print media because there was a free possibility of the media going into those areas. But, that is not possible in Vanni, that was not possible in the Eastern Province. This, I say, Sir, is unacceptable. In fact, in the editorial that Mr. Lasantha Wickramatunge, the late Editor of the Sunday Leader had written, which had not been published until he died, he has referred to this situation prevailing regarding the Tamil people. He has talked about how the Government is prosecuting this war; how Tamil civilians are being harmed; how they are being shot and killed; how their property is being destroyed. He has gone on further and said, having alienated native people in this way, if you think that by some reconstruction, by some development you can win them back, you are making a sad mistake. You are alienating these Tamil people for all time. This is what Mr. Lasantha Wickramatunge had to say in his editorial which he had written just before he died, Sir, which was published after his death. I think the Government just cannot be allowed to go on in this way. We must warn that if this war is prosecuted this way, in the same way it has been prosecuted with aerial bombings and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire, heavy artillery fire and other military attacks in these areas where there are 350,000 to 400,000 Tamil civilians, there will be immense casualties amongst these people; there will be deaths; there will be a large number of persons who will be injured and we have a right to make an appeal to the international community to take adequate steps to ensure that such a major catastrophe of disastrous proportions is not allowed to occur in that small portion of Vanni, a part of the Mullaitivu District where these people are held up presently. Sometimes some people raise the question, why can these people not come out? I am not saying that they should not come out and I also think that if they want to come out, they should be allowed to. That should happen according to their free will. But, you people who

803 804

go and bomb their houses, who fire multi-barrel rocket launchers into their houses, into the areas in which they live, in which they are populated and drive them out of their houses and make them refugees, cannot decide for them where they should live. Particularly, in regard to the persons who came into Government-controlled areas, there have been several complaints of lack of adequate care, lack of adequate attention, lack of freedom and movement and harassment as reported by international human rights organizations. Therefore, I do not think, Sir, that position can be accepted and I would appeal to the international community to make sure that this grave impending disaster in that part of the Mullaitivu District is averted by sending an independent group of persons into that area to see for themselves exactly what has happened and also to find out the truth of what happened in Vanni and the rest of the Eastern Province. It is not without significance, Sir, that this Debate takes place today on the day after the inauguration of Americas first African-American President, Barack Obama. When he was watched on TV last evening, the Inauguration Ceremony of President Barack Obama, I made a note of some of the things he said, Sir, because I think they are very relevant to our country. He said that the American people must be true to our founding documents, the documents on which America came into being. Do you have any founding document in this country - any constitution to which you can go back and say, This is our founding document, this is the document on which our country is built, our society is built, which we cherish, which we value; which is the ultimate law of the land ? Do you have any such founding document? He said that we must be humble. We must be grateful and we must be mindful of others. Are you being mindful of your Tamil brothers and sisters, men, women, children and infants in the Vanni? How many infants are you killing? How many infants have you put to starve? He further said, Sir, that collective failure to make hard choices must be avoided. When the JVP raises its flag and shouts against the ISGA and the P-TOMS Agreement, the major political parties in this country go into hiding. They are worried that they will lose the Sinhala vote. We are not prepared to make hard choices. That is the reason why this country is in this position today. Its economy is in this position today primarily because you have not been able to make hard political choices in regard to what this country needed. He further went on to say, Sir, that all are equal, all are free and all must be given a chance to seek their happiness. Can you say that in this country today that all are equal, that all are free and that all are being given a chance to seek their happiness? How can you ever build this country? How can you ever make this country when you want to keep the Tamil-speaking people, the Tamil people in particular as second class citizens under your heel and think that you can write a success story. I think

you are just day-dreaming. It is not something that will ever happen. He said, Sir, that he would be concerned about peace and dignity of every country, however small, of all people, and that peace and dignity must be preserved, must be protected. Are you able to say that the Tamil people in this country are being treated peacefully or with dignity? Can you say that? And, we hear sometimes even the President of this country talking about liberating the Tamil people. I have dealt with it at some length, Sir, in one of my earlier speeches, where I have even quoted some statements made by some international human rights organizations in regard to the so-called "liberation of the Tamil people". You kill the people; you injure the people; you destroy their assets; you make them live under trees; you starve them. There is no sanitation; no drinking water; no medicine; and you call that "liberation". I do not think, Sir, anything can be more disgraceful than this situation. I would once again repeat my appeal to the Government and also to the international community that the time has certainly come for an independent group of persons to go to Vanni, to Mullaitivu in particular and to the other areas in Vanni where the war has taken place and to the Eastern Province, the South of Trincomalee and the North of Batticaloa, and see for themselves what is happening and what has happened in these areas. I thank you, Sir. [.. 12.59] ( ) (The Hon. Achala Jagodage) , . . , , . . . . . , . . . . , . , . , . . , . Multi Barrel Rocket Launchers . . [ ]

Mr. Presiding Member, yesterday and the day before, one of the most significant international business events took place in New Delhi, India. It was jointly sponsored by the Government of India and the Confederation of Indian Industry. The Indian Minister for External Affairs, the Indian Minister for Commerce and Industry and the Indian Minister for Science and Technology, all of them were present with 1,400 leaders of the entrepreneurial community in India. I served as a Panelist on that occasion and my distinguished Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, was also invited to attend those

proceedings. Throughout that seminar, Mr. Presiding Member, there was unqualified admiration expressed for the manner in which Sri Lanka is dealing with the economic and social problems that we have to contend with today. Therefore, this atmosphere of gloom professing nothing but darkness, certainly was not reflected in those proceedings. In assessing the Adjournment Motion before the House today, Mr. Presiding Member, we have to point out that there are three fundamental fallacies. The first of these fallacies is that any country can be totally isolated from the consequences of the global economic meltdown. If anybody is making the criticism that Sri Lanka is affected - of course, Sri Lanka is affected - not only a small economy like Sri Lanka but the most powerful economies in the world are affected by the adverse consequences of the economic meltdown. It is, therefore, a relative matter. Are we affected to the extent that other countries far more powerful, far richer than we are affected? The facts speak for themselves. It is not a question of an assertion by anybody. It is demonstrably the case that Sri Lanka has been largely insulated from those adverse consequences. It is not a fortuitous matter; it is not a matter of coincidence; it is a result of policies which have been constructed and put in place by a far-seeing Government. This country has achieved a growth rate of 7 per cent consistently in its economy during the last two years and this year, we have every confidence that the economy will grow by 6.4 per cent. When I said that, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Shri Kamal Nath said that the Indian economy will also grow by about the same amount, not more than that, and many countries in this region, I think India and Sri Lanka are probably the only countries that would grow by between 6 and 6 1/2 per cent and that is a very considerable achievement. The second fallacy, Mr. Presiding Member, is that it is wrong to borrow money. If we make use of resources that are put at our disposal by foreign governments or multilateral agencies, that is nothing to apologize for. If we do not wish to have resources from the outside world, then we cannot develop, we cannot improve the standards of living of our people. It is because money is borrowed, money is utilized and spent to secure the economic well-being of our people that progress is possible. I think in two or three weeks time, the flyover in Nugegoda would be inaugurated. So, there is visible evidence of activity both in the urban environment and the rural environment. Mega projects are being initiated with regard to highways, electricity and irrigation systems. All these require investment. Investment means borrowing. Borrowing per se is, therefore, not by any means a compelling criticism of the Government. Money needs to be found and it has to be utilized in a beneficial and productive manner. The third consideration is this, Mr. Presiding Member. We have to be conscious of context. Everyone is aware that an unprecedented quantum of resources is being

2009 21 829 830

expended on the war. Everybody concedes that the progress during the last few weeks has been far in excess of expectations. At the partnership summit in India which I referred to, the keynote address was delivered by His Excellency Pranab Mukherjee, Indias Minister for External Affairs. The Indian Minister emphasized that, to deal with the scourge of terrorism effectively in this part of the world there cannot be isolated action by governments but there has to be collective action; there has to be resolute action and from that point of view, they have nothing but admiration for the progress which has been made in Sri Lanka with regard to combating terrorism. Mr. Presiding Member, the situation in this country is that we are making every effort to protect the vulnerable sectors of our economy. We are fortunate to be in a situation where there are tumbling commodity prices: fertilizer prices are dropping, milk food prices are dropping and oil prices are dropping. Now, we are utilizing the resources that these developments put at our disposal in order to do things that are necessary to stimulate local production. The Government would be initiating a move on the 4th of February to call upon patriotic citizens living abroad to contribute substantially to Sri Lankan coffers. We would be raising money abroad. It has been a very systematically-structured initiative. Six banks have been identified for this purpose and we have every expectation that a substantial amount of money will be forthcoming as a result of this endeavour. What a government can do in this situation is to identify the principal needs. What is it that a government can do to help the economy at this time? Three weeks ago, Mr. Presiding Member, the Cabinet of Ministers unanimously endorsed a proposal by His Excellency the President, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, to present the country an economic stimulus package. These are not handouts. It is not an ad hoc operation. We do not believe that ad hoc measures will be useful at this time. It is a series of measures that are intended to inject vigour and vitality into vital sectors of Sri Lankas economy. There are several objectives which are contemplated in that exercise. The main objective is to enhance competitiveness in order to deal with the adverse consequences which are so evident amongst us in the world. President Barack Obama of the United States referred to this in his inspiring inaugural address yesterday. Even a country like the United States is not spared the consequences of the economic meltdown. We, therefore, in dealing with the situation in our own country, have to ensure that our industries remain competitive. This means that we have to do everything possible to reduce the cost of production. We have to give every encouragement for the addition of value. Fiscal policy has to be constructed in order to facilitate the attainment of that objective. We have to try to find new markets for our goods. While consolidating existing markets, we have to make every endeavour to find new markets. We have succeeded to a remarkable extent. For example, we

are having some very productive discussions with Russia with regard to export of our tea. We have at the moment, a huge trade imbalance with China. But, China is also eager to do everything possible to try to narrow down this imbalance. Then, we are finding new markets, particularly in Trukey and in Vietnam. It is not that we are forgetting old friends but, we have to develop new markets in order to stimulate our industries. So, I think in fairness, Mr. Presiding Member, we have to look at what the Government has done for these different sectors. Take the apparel sector which is by far the largest foreign exchange earner for our country. As far as the apparel sector is concerned, consider what the Opposition said a couple of months ago. The Opposition was quite certain that by this time the country would have lost the GSP Plus benefit. We were quite certain that that would not happen. So, again this mood of despair was whipped up in the country. We were told that hundreds of thousands of people would be out on the streets, there would be social revolution, there will be unemployment on an unprecedented scale and all of this was going to happen because GSP Plus which we had enjoyed for three years was going to be withdrawn from Sri Lanka. Nothing of the sort has happened, Mr. Presiding Member. I have personally spoken to the leading apparel companies in this country and they told me that the spring orders are coming in just as they have done during the last three years that there is not one iota of difference. The leading companies in the United Kingdom who are buying our goods like Marks and Spencer, Next, Tesco and one of the largest companies in Italy, Intimissimi, have placed orders with us and those orders are being serviced and business is going on as usual. So, nothing has happened which in anyway has shaken confidence in that industry and there is no question of unemployment. That has been a spectre in the minds of some people. But, it has certainly not been translated into reality. Then, in order to assist this industry we have put in place a series of measures. For example, the exemption from the 15 per cent electricity surcharge. The apparel sector will not be called upon to pay the Economic Service Charge this year. Then, there is another factor that is worth mentioning, Mr. Presiding Member. That is, the very significant achievement of this Government in reducing inflation. Last year, in June 2008, inflation was as high as 29 per cent. It has now come down to about 15 per cent and our expectation is that it will come down to single digit level in the course of 2009. Now, this has made it possible for the Central Bank to move very rapidly towards the reduction of interest rates. I think my Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama will agree that this is one of the significant problems confronting our economy. The small man in particular, if he has to pay these high rates of interest, cannot really make a profit from his business because once he has made such large provision for debt servicing, he is really placing his product out of the market. Now, because of this phenomenal achievement with regard to reduction of

831 832

[ . . ]

inflation within a brief time span, it will be possible very soon to reduce interest rates by 2 or 3 per cent and that would be only a start. That will be a considerable stimulus to the entire industrial sector, particularly to the small and medium-scale sector. Then, we have granted incentives where we think that those incentives are called for. If a company that exports apparel products does not retrench labour and if it is able to maintain production at the 2008 level and bring foreign exchange into the country at that threshold, then we are making available to those companies 5 per cent of the total value of the foreign exchange that they bring into the country. Now, the apparel sector is very pleased with this package of incentives. It is the most that can be done; it is much more than many other countries in the region have done. And, again I get back to my fundamental point that all this is a relative matter, nobody is wholly protected from the consequences of the global crisis but situated as we are in a very difficult situation, the Government had done everything in its part to look after the industries which are responsible for bringing valuable foreign exchange into the country. Then, Mr. Presiding Member, we have also been innovative in our thinking with regard to exports. We, no longer think that exports consist solely or even principally of physical commodities like tea or rubber or gems and jewellery. That was the traditional attitude. Today that is no longer the case. Take for example what we have done with regard to the construction sector. The chamber of construction industry is very appreciative of the steps that have been taken to make it possible for them to win large contracts abroad and to do work in countries like Qatar and in other countries in the Middle East. In order to do this, we have taken action to modernize some of the rules and regulations of the Central Bank. The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Nivard Cabraal, has been very supportive. He attended several meetings with representatives of the construction industry and we have taken action to make it possible for our leading companies to win large contracts abroad. I know that some of them have signed contracts worth around Rs. 500 million. The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne and I led a delegation of our leading people in the construction sector to Dubai and to Doha and on that occasion, more than Rs. 500 million worth of contracts were signed. So, we have made use of our natural resources. Sri Lanka produces a large number of quantity surveyors - I am not just talking of bricks and mortar but quantity surveying, landscaping, plumbing, air-conditioning, in all these areas we have much to offer and Sri Lanka is today earning very valuable foreign exchange by exploring these avenues which are a departure from the tried and tested methods of the past. Then, Mr. Presiding Member, take what we have done with regard to the jewellery industry. Now, there we have pursued very vigorously the concept of branding. You are

aware that when the country changed its name in 1972 from Ceylon to Sri Lanka, we continued to speak of Ceylon Tea not Sri Lankan tea that is because Ceylon Tea was indelibly etched on the conscience of the world in terms of quality. Now, we are in a position to do something similar, for example, with Sri Lankan sapphire and with Sri Lankan cinnamon. This country produces 80 per cent of the worlds cinnamon. Now, the Government is encouraging the spices sector to do everything that is possible to improve and modernize their methods of production, for example, cinnamon peeling. We have got assistance from GTZ in Germany, from various other organizations and considerable progress is being made with regard to modernizing the entire spices sector. The Export Development Board is in constant communication with representatives of that sector to ascertain from them their own priorities and requirements. It is not a top-down approach. We talk to them, we find out what they would like done, we also find out from them what is the sequence in which they would like the Government to address these issues and all of this is being done. Then, Mr. Presiding Member, I think I should also mention the fact that our aim is not just to increase the volume of foreign exchange that we earn for the country. It is equally important to ensure that there is a trickle-down; that the remoter regions of the country also benefit. I have seen for myself the progress that has been made with regard to the export promotion villages situated in the less- developed parts of the country. This weekend I will be in Polonnaruwa and in Ampara. We have seen there how the farmers had benefited from the arrangements which had been made to bring them directly into contact with the exporting companies. Otherwise, we end up with a situation where the farmer works hard, he produces fruits, vegetables and other things and at the end of the day he derives only a very small part of the benefit that should be his. So, backward linkages are important even in the stimulus package that I referred to, Mr. Presiding Member. We have done everything possible to encourage companies like Loadstar, for example, which make highly sophisticated rubber goods, to purchase high quality latex from the Sri Lankan producer, so that the trickle-down effect is enhanced. So, this is true of the rubber sector; it is true of the tea sector. We have ensured that the smallholders who sell their green leaves to the local factory will get at least Rs. 45 per kilo. Then, at the point of export there is value addition to the threshold of Rs. 300. We have taken action to ensure in the Kalutara District, for example, that the rubber producers get Rs. 150 per kilo. All of this has been done as a result of Government intervention to deal with the crisis, that is not only Sri Lanka but the whole world is facing. So, in conclusion, Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to say that, one has to be fair, one has to be objective, one has to look at the total picture and these are matters which have to be dealt with not in a partisan spirit, not

2009 21 833 834

7 - PL 003668 - (2009/02)

Government and Opposition, not different political parties. These are matters of concern and importance to the nation as a whole and what is required is a concerted attempt in which we all join to find pragmatic solutions to these problems in 2009. Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member. [.. 2.37] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion on the economy of the country, which our Colleague, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna has brought in today. I am very happy that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna has decided to ensure that they put their weight on the economy - which is a major change. I guess it is a very timely change and I appreciate and hope that in future also, you would act in the same way. I was listening to the speeches made by the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti and his Colleagues and I am even more pleased to follow the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of Export Development and International Trade. Let me at the outset congratulate the Deputy Minister of Finance. I think the "deputy" part should be cut off and he should be called the "Minister of Finance". But, I guess our marketing obviously seems to be helping him. He is moving from left to right to centre and we can see even at the present moment, the representation of the Government is only from the Opposition. People at least who had the callousness to leave the UNP; the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne, the Hon. P. Radhakrishnan, all of them are representing the Government and we could see that this is the real thing that is going on. I am happy to take the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris words, we should not colourize this. This is something which we have been telling for the last 15 years and it only seeps into people who have the concern, at least a little interest regarding it. But, Hon. Minister, it does not seem to be going beyond you; does not seem to be going into the minds of the major people who are taking decisions. Our critical comments on the craziness of the economy only leads to people trying to point fingers and trying to kill the messenger. You have the media being suppressed. You have MPs like us being harassed, intimidated and stymied. If they think that they can bring fear in and try to stop us from doing what we have got to do, that is a great error. But, I guess today the problem is not that crazy men do crazy things but, Hon. Minister, it is good people not doing the correct thing or distorting the correct thing and giving it a different twist. This is where I call upon you all to take it seriously. Let us not colourize the economy. We are in dire straits. This

is not something unique to Sri Lanka. We have been telling this for the last eight - nine months. But, when the world has hit into a bad patch we, Sri Lankans, thinking that we are out of the patch is absolute asininity, stupidity. That is where we need to act together. Our stock exchange market has moved down from 3,700 down to 1,500 and if there is no problem, there has to be something radically wrong with people who say so. If we are in a problem, let us work together. That does not mean the Opposition which says this in the correct spirit is anti-patriotic. The guys that hide it are the ones who are anti-patriotic. That is the difference. So, Hon. Minister, if I may get into the subject matter without deviating into other matters, you mentioned about the textile industry. I do commend the very prestigious labels you mentioned: Marks and Spencer, Tesco. I must say, you and the Hon. (Dr). Sarath Amunugama, have been contributory and we, from the Opposition, tried to help the Government and I am sure you will not say, "No" to that. But, I must say that is not the correct picture, Hon. Minister. Marks and Spencer has put the challenge on the Government. Please get the Labour GSP. We have been telling that. There is no need to worry, we are with you all to protect the Labour GSP, it is the correct thing. There was the Minister of Mass Media who said that we got the Labour GSP. What a preposterous untruth? Now, when that happens, you feel that that is the actual case and we are only making a bad case worse. Let us ensure that we really make it happen. They have given time up to 18th February and anybody can complain. And, if they complain and if we do not have a sizeable opinion formed against that, then there is going to be an examination on the country. Now, all we have got to do is to ensure that we work together and throw that examination away. Why should we have that? That is our view from the Opposition. Do not take us on board on this. When you say that Marks and Spencer is placing orders, it is not right. There is a contraction from there orders, not only from Sri Lanka but their orders themselves, because they are also caught in the onslaught of the financial meltdown. [Interruption.] Yes. But, our market share for Sri Lanka has moved down. They have moved to Rumania; they have moved to China; they have moved to India. We were basically working along with you and I must thank the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama for being able to realize the service industry pivotal for Sri Lanka and he gave certain things; we managed to get something out of India. Basically, I do not want to challenge you because I respect you for what you said. But, tell me of one textile industry person who says that the textile industry is in a tickety-boo situation. I spoke to Mr. Ashraff Omar on something else today and he said, "What a precarious plight I am in". I am quoting him only because I am making a sincere effort for the textile industry. I think they are spineless, to be very frank. They are worried thinking a white van will come and make a mess of it. They want us to make that noise. Never mind, we will do it on behalf of the country and on

835 836

your behalf. I have got a document - I must thank the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti for giving it. He has showed a document from Orit Apparels Lanka (Pvt.) Limited. Orit Apparels belongs to our good friend, Mr. Channa Palansooriya. Who is he? He is the owner, the Managing Director of this company. Where is he working? He is a Director of BOI. He, in his own communication says to his workers, "I am sorry, I cannot make payments to you because the country is not providing us a correct export atmosphere. We have got to ensure that your overtime payments are cut off. You have got to work two - three hours more". So, if he, as a BOI Director says this - and there is nothing wrong with his saying that - I mean, he has got to survive. There is no point in his saying, "I will do everything" and then the company crashes. So, he is making actual economic sense. If you, say, Sir, that this is not the case, I must correct you; somebody is bluffing you. My telling this is not that we are anti-government. We would love to see the Government falling because we do not want to see you getting into a bigger mess. But, that is not the question. Let us together protect the economy. We can do politics later. But, your burning Maharaja TV-MTV does not help that. Killing your good friend and my friend, Mr. Lasantha Wickramatunga would not help that. Look at our colleagues, our friends in the Media. Iqbal Athas who has gone out of the country, not for a holiday but in fear of life. Look at Upul Joseph, another fearless writer. Where is Keith Noyahr? Where is Namal Perera? Where is the examination that has taken place? I am only telling this, because there is a brutal fear existing everywhere. Look at the free publicity that ITN and Rupavahini give you. Everyday they put Ranil Wickremasinghe, Mangala Samaraweera, Lakshman Kiriella, Johnston Fernando and myself, and basically try to say that these are the traitors and the others are the true patriots. What a humbug is this? I hope you will change this. We have got to ensure that we change the political culture in this country. Let me quote something from Barack Obama. Look at the sense of optimism that was born yesterday. There were two million people who have physically come to see him and I am sure every one of us looked at this first African-American who became the President yesterday. What did he say? He said that all men are equal; all men are free; all men have the right to reach out to their full potential. What would Sri Lanka say? No. you have got to be "X"; you have got to be from the Southern end; you have got to be in this town; you have got to be in this creed". What is this? We, Sri Lankans are multi-talented people. Ensure that the best of our potential comes out. Look at what he further says: "We have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord". He was telling the crowd, "We must pick ourselves, dust ourselves off and look at the way forward". Why can we not do that? You can dust yourself off, but if there is nothing left in you, what is the purpose? That is what you all are doing.

Everything is coming from a war-point of view. Look at the way it is being spoken. Look at the way the Members of Parliament act? I am sometimes ashamed, as a Member of Parliament, to say that our Colleagues are doing such things. Let us, at least the few of us who are here, make a change; make a difference. Making a difference at any level, at any time is not too late. And, I guess this is the time. If good people do nothing, that is worse than crazy men doing crazy things. I repeat that once again. So, let the erudite politicians who are on that side - I see couple of them before me - get together and make a change. If the guys are going the wrong way, show them the correct path. Power is not eternal, it changes. Today you are in Government, tomorrow we will be in Government. Do you want the wrath that is put on us, put on you all as well? We have got to have the courage of conviction to say this. This will be aired on Rupavahini and ITN that this is what we are saying. We have told you to ensure that these terrorists are taken out, destroyed; do what you want. The UNP has not stood in the way of doing so. You catch one or two matters that are outside, extraneous sources, and put that and say that this is the difference. What is the meaning of that? The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is the best of people. You were on our side doing the peace process. You know how it went forward. You know who torpedoed it. Blaming the UNP does not help in anything. There is Karuna, we call him, "Hon. Karuna" now. He is here because of what you started, the peace process. Now all what we want to say is, let us not colourize any of this. This is like a relay. Everyone has to pass the baton on to the next person. Look at the way how Obama started his speech: "I congratulate George Bush for the eight years of yeomen service he did". That was not what he said in the platforms when he was contesting. That is the sense of American maturity in democracy. That does not seem to be even in the nurseries of the political schools here. So, Hon. Minister, I only countered since I spoke just after you. Otherwise, I would not have even bothered to mention these things. But I think, Hon. Minister, you should tell the people who told you to tell all this, not to lead you up the wrong garden path. There is not a single textile industry person who would say that there is growth. Yes, the Spring orders are coming in, for the simple reason that they though this will be over in December, everybody knew that Labour GSP does not come to an end just like that. Why do we not protect this? We were given this open challenge last year. Going on further, Sir, look at the tea industry, the rubber industry, the coconut industry and the cinnamon industry. Look at the gem and jewellery industry. These are not things which we mystically pull out from the air and say, here it is. This is something which we are saying with responsibility. The Hon. Minister of Plantations is here. He is obviously in a very pensive mood because he knows that we are telling the truth. ? 70

2009 21 837 838

. 285. 235, 240. ? . . .. . , , .. . . . So, I am only saying that. Look at the tourism industry. It is in disarray. Look at the areas of service industry, the banking sector. The confidence is shattered. Sakvithi Ranasinghe is one rogue. Look at what happened to the Golden Key Credit Card Company. See at what is happening to the Danduwam Mudalali. Look at what is happening to Okanda Finance (Pvt.) Limited. There are supervisory bodies in the country. What are they doing? The Central Bank has published a newspaper advertisement three or four days ago about certain companies that have been registered. This is what they should have done on a monthly or a quarterly basis. Once the horse has bolted, there is no point in saying, These companies are the only ones that are registered When somebody advertises and says, I will pay you 48 per cent interest, Hon. Minister, you must ask whether he is peddling in drugs or involved in some illegal activities. How on earth can you pay 48 per cent? In order to pay 48 per cent, you must make 75 per cent. So, that alone should have made this supervisory unit of the Central Bank to ask How the hell are you doing this; where is your interest; where is your tax component that is paid up? I do not want to be going on a voyage of discovery because we all know what the economy is. I have been repeatedly telling so. I guess this will only irritate further. But, I can keep doing that because the passion I have for the economy far overrides the intimidation and harassment directed against us. Look at the attempt in trying to reduce cost of living. We went; we told the Ministers; we gave an alternate budget; we told you, Please, ensure that you reduce the price of petrol, diesel and kerosene. You said, Cannot. But, you reduced it. How? You applied the same formula we gave. Why do you not reduce the petrol price to Rs. 65 or Rs. 70? Today, petrol can be imported to the Port of Colombo at Rs. 24 a litre. Thereafter you add taxes, levies and all what you want; add 150 per cent; add 200 per cent. You do not need to sell petrol at Rs. 120. Who on earth says that only 4 per cent use petrol? There are 1.5 million owners of motorbikes. When you reduce the fuel charge for the trishaws, you said that one million travel a day. So, how can you say that only 4 per cent of the people use petrol? Your own statistics disprove you all. On the same basis, there are almost 400,000 vans. Even the people who go fishing in the night use petrol, not diesel. So, there are almost 50 per cent of petrol users. So, do not whimsically just throw this aside. You

should take the advices given by the Opposition in good spirit and that is the way forward. You were blaming and making a big fracas over the Thirteenth Amendment. Now, you are hanging on to those because you think that is the only correct way. Just because it comes from the UNP, it is not a cyanide capsule. It is something we say in a positive spirit. I think this is a Government that is an interim Government. You have a cricket board that is an interim cricket board. You have a rugby board which is an interim rugby board. You have a volleyball board which is an interim one. I was made to understand the situation that squash and badminton boards are also the same. Your Government is also a proxy or an interim Government because what was elected in 2004 is not what it represents today. I think the Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries wants to say something because he has got up or it is a sense of humour or he has heard enough and is going off. Hon. Minister, all we want to say is, let us change this political culture. This is a curse for society. This is a bane for our country. We are happy about the type of euphoria that is being created through the military success. Do not think that this is the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys armed forces. The UNPers are in a bigger number than any other party. The JVPers are in a smaller number. There are other Tamil and Muslim parties in it. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is obviously there. When there is military success, you do not need to ride on their shoulders. Obviously the army is there to fight a war and not to propagate religion. On this score, you all are mesmerized and go beyond all boundaries and then make such a mess that at the end of the day you only politicize the good work that is being done by them. I would like at this particular moment to say something on the international conspiracies which you are trying to propagate. These international conspiracies are something plucked again from the skies by people who are absolutely bankrupt like the JVP representatives who have crossed the Floor now. They basically have been saying this for the last couple of years. Once they said that they are the guarantee card. Then they said, Petrol prices are going up. We will ensure that such things do not happen. They are the guys who created it and the people are made to live through that. The media gives unwanted attention to such things. What is this international conspiracy? You all are internationally exposed, Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris, Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama. We all know what the international phobia is which they are trying to suppress. What is it? Like the Indian Government told the Pakistan Government, Here are the guys, the international conspirators or like the Israel Government said, Here is the terrorist organization or like the Indonesian Government said, Here is a problem, why can Sri Lanka not do it? So, I think we have got to re-look at it. Let the searchlight be directed into the Government itself. Is your conscience

839 840

not pricking on what happened to Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunga? Is it not pricking on what has been done to MTV? Look at what they say? The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage tells in this House that the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and myself burnt the MTV. Mr. Killy Maharajah is a very good friend of mine. So, can you imagine such a preposterous thing? Only insane people would say so. What is the meaning of this? When that finishes, you basically arrest the Opposition leader of the Sri Jayewardenepura Municipality and accuse him as a party to that incident. Then, the courts gives a repugnant answer saying that this is done just to distract the attention of the people. Does this help the economy, Hon. Ministers? We should fight the economic battle that is before us. Look at the pressure that is being put on those guys. They were released by the Gangodawila Magistrate. When they came out, you say again that Sri Jayewardenepura Municipal Council was gutted by them. There are various other facts also. I do not want to mention those things since it is before courts. But, now the Government people who had done it have been exposed. This type of harassment does not help at all. White vans are following the Opposition Members of Parliament like the Hon. Mano Ganesan, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and ourselves. What is the culture that is going on? Who does this with impunity? Does that help the economy? Does that help the economy to grow by two per cent more? Or, is it that you need to stymie something or you need to suppress something artificially? With the success of the armed forces, how proud you and we are. This is our armed forces, not yours or mine. They are ours. That should be the spirit. But, if the same effort can be put in by all of us to the economy, I am sure we can get over the tremors being felt in the economy today. That is the hope we have got to bring in. That is how we have got to assist the new generation to move forward. Today, the younger generation is helpless. They are haplessly wondering as to what is there for them tomorrow. They get up in the morning and think, can we live in this country? How many people call us? So, do not let the fate of the UNP befall on to you all as well. Do what is correct. Move forward with the correct spirit. We are there to support. Do not think that just because it comes from the United National Party, being the principal Opposition, that that is something which is detrimental to you. No. That is completely wrong. That is not the case. The problem is that we have been too democratic, we have been too statesmenlike, we have been too accommodative. That is why you think that we are weak at this particular moment. Let us change this. We are there to move forward. I, at this particular moment, would also like to talk about the external reserves because it was mentioned and I think it is dubiously being messed around. I may be wrong but I am subject to correction through more knowledgeable people, from you all. I got this informaton from the relevant section of the Central Bank, which is

very responsible in giving so. They said that the external reserves stand at US Dollars 1,500 million at this moment. I may be wrong. That amount is sufficient only to meet five to six weeks' imports. Please correct me because if that is the case, we need to be serious on this. We have as Government reserves US Dollars 1,500 million. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . The private sector too brings in a reserve which is supposed to be US Dollars 2,100 million. The Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance, who should really be the Minister of Finance, knows that that is very dangerous in todays context. Certainly, oil has not hit rock-bottom. It will come back again to US Dollars 70, 80, 90 per barrel, but why do you not give the benefit at this moment? With regard to hedging, you cannot go on an ad hoc mechanism. You have got to take a stand. You might suddenly find tomorrow morning an international bank saying, I am sorry, I cannot open LCs with the banks of Sri Lanka. Now, we are telling this in advance because we want you to get involved, get prepared. That is the duty of the Opposition. If we are singing hosannas for the Government, why the hell are we in the Opposition? That is the courage of conviction that we have. That does not mean that you have white vans following, so that Members of the Opposition suffer the same fate that befell Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunga. Change that culture. We need to do that. This is not something which is expected of a Buddhist country, Sri Lanka. Look at what Mr. Udaya Gammanpila said. What an absurd, heinous crime he is committing? He goes and tells that Lord Buddha did not come to Sri Lanka. Do we need the Jathika Hela Urumaya to say so? What is the Jathika Hela Urumaya propagating? Is it propagating war or religion? I am quoting the Lankaenews which reported Mr. Udaya Gammanpila saying that Lord Buddha did not come to Kelaniya. Did the Lord Buddha not come to Mahiyanganaya? Did the Lord Buddha not come to Adams Peak? I am saying this because I feel ashamed that this religious party is talking nonsense. Where is the media? I was happy that at least the Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero has said that it is only lunatics who say so. At least, he has the audacity to say that. He is frank enough to say that besides being one of their party members. But, this is what the Jathika Hela Urumaya said. They are the people who run the economy. They distort history. They say that the Mahawansaya is absolutely a lie. I mean, it is a shame for such people to be involved even with the Government.

* . . Produced at end of speech.

Why is the Government not saying anything? I know the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, must be burning internally for having such lunatics. Those are the lunatics who are running this system. That is why I say with sincerity, "Stop all these various mudslingings directed on the leading Opposition Party Leaders and the people of the United National Party". You all have to do that at least because you had been with us and gone to that side; because tomorrow it can happen to you. Man proposes; God disposes. Our fate today will befall on you all tomorrow. Then, what would you think? So, Mr. Presiding Member at this particular moment, I would like to, owing to lack of time, table* a letter written by Venerable Thiniyawala Palitha, who with us went to public litigation on petrol prices. He has written to the IGP regarding the death threats that he has received. He is not in the country anymore. I am tabling this document for the simple reason of protection and for the people to know as to what is going on. I was to make a statement on the recent MTV attack and killing of Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunga and on the intimidation and pressure that has been put on the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Members of the Kotte Municipal Council since then. I also table* this statement for inclusion in the Hansard, and not to be placed in the library. Mr. Presiding Member, I will conclude as time is a problem for you. But, before that, let us come back to the main issue. Economy cannot be colourized. We are there to ensure that we get together and make a difference. But, that does not mean that harassment, intimidation and trying to put pressure on the media would basically help the situation. So, ensure that we change the culture and let us work together; ensure that we have an economy which is strong and resilient during the financial meltdown that is taking place in the world. Let us ensure that a new future dawns and gives the inspiration like what Obama had said. Let us ensure that we choose hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.

Finally, Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity and I think this is a very timely Adjournment Motion that has been moved by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Very rarely do I give this treat to the JVP but I thought where there is credit due, it must be given. I appreciate this and I hope this change is permanent rather than interim and ensure that this moves forward for a better tomorrow. Thank you, Sir.

* : Document tabled Sirasa attacked on 6th January at 3.00 am 1. 6th of Jan 2009 Mahinda Aluthgamage in Parliament accuses Karu Jayasuriya and Ravi Karunanayake 2. 7th January 2009 Maharagama Police tries to arrest former Deputy Mayor of Kotte, Chinthaka Udayashantha on the pretext of Devuranvehara Priest was to be abducted by them and Sirasa attack also took place by the similar team. This attempt failed. 3. 8th January 2009 8th January Morning : Suraj Jayasuriya - Leader of the opposition of the Sri Jayawardenapura Council is asked to come to the Police on a call made by an unidentified number to 119 two days after the attack, calling Suraj as the attacker or accomplice. This leads to him being taken to custody. While the Maharagama Police say that a Land Rover was used for the attack on MTV, MTV security reveals that it was white vans that was used for the attacked. While Suraj Jayasuriya was accused for such an attack, the informant was unable to provide information on the white van. That was supposed to have transferred certain weapons for such an attack 4. 14th January 2009 Maharagama Police once again tries to question former Deputy Mayor on the Devuranvehara Temple attack. 5. 15th January 2009 The lawyers mentioned in open court that baseless charges were framed to take Suraj into custody and also reveald to court that pressure was brought on for them to implicate Ravi Karunanayake for such an attack. 6. 14th January 2009 14th January : Gotabaya Rajapaksa says MTV was attacked by themselves for an insurance claim. Chevaan Daniel is responsible for such irresponsible statement for accusing the Government - that it was the Government was behind the scene. Threatened to have Chevaan arrested. 7. 15th January 2009 Kotakadeniya says, during a war, such attacks are common. 8. 15th January 2009 15th January : Udaya Gammanpilla says it is the work of the CIA. 9. 15th January 2009 Wimal Weerawansa indicates it is a western European conspiracy attacked by the LTTE.

10. 15th January 2009 Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena maintains it is the work of anti-Government elements and he exhibits to the general public that the claymore mine is not of the military making and investigations will reveal before long that it is the job of the Opposition. 10. 15th January 2009 Whilst Mahinda Rajapaksa says that the investigations are going on, the CID has not been given the task or investigating on the MTV attack. NOTE - TODATE CID HAS NOT BEEN CALLED IN FOR THE MTV ATTACK Investigations are being carried out by the Maharagama Police. Given the magnitude of the attacked investigations should have been handed over to the CID.

* : Statement tabled Honourable Speaker, I Seek your permission to make a statement regarding certain serious incidents that has taken place during the past two weeks where unscrupulous attempts have been made to link my name with them. The year 2009 dawned with the joyous news of the capture of Killinochchi by our heroic soldiers. However, the news that immediately followed was the horrendous pre dawn attack on the SIRASA Television Studios by a group of unidentified goons on the 6th of January 2009. I was one of the first persons, along with my friend late Lasntha wickramatunge who visited the scene of the crime and saw to our own eyes the massive damage caused to the equipment and to the morale of the independent media. Two weeks has gone by, but no significant attempt has been made by the authorities to apprehend the culprits. It was a very well executed and well planned professional attack which could have been carried out only by a well trained unit of people with patronage from the high & the mighty! I say this because, the second stage of the plan commenced immediately, within few hours after the attack. On the 6th of January when we met, in this House, Hon. Mahindanada Aluthgamage, making a responsible statement said that our Deputy Leader, Hon. Karu Jayasooruiya & I, plotted & planned this attack on SIRASA. He came out with a bedtime story of how we met at a house in Borella with some underworld thugs etc; to plan out this attack. Hon. Speaker, no body with an iota of intelligence would believe such a far fetched story. Both Hon. Karu Jayasooriya and I immediately denied this story. However, we must not forget the fact that it was a government Minister making a irresponsible statement in the Parliament. Had he been privy to such valuable information we should also ask as to and as to why he did not warn the authorites of the impeding danger prior to the attack! After this irresponsible statement, the perpetrators set the plan rolling. On 8th January 2009, the Leader of the opposition of the Kotte Municipal Council, Mr. Suraj Jayasooriya was arrested by the Maharagama Police on the pretext of having received an anonymous call on the 118 that the vehicle in his custody was involved in the SIRASA attack. This information had been received by the police two days after the attack. To date, this so called unidentified telephone call is the only evidence available to the police against him. Futher, the Maharagama Police once again attempted to arrest Mr. Chinthaka Udaya Shantha MMC & former Deputy Mayor of Kotte MC on an incident involving the Chief priest of Devram Viharaya trying to implicate him in the SIRASA attack.

[ ]

2009 21 845 846

At the same time another MMC of the Kotte Ms. Mr Ranil Saman received an anonymous telephone call few days ago asking him to leave the UNP for which he will be rewarded. When the case of Suraj Jayasooriyas arrest came up for hearing before the learned Magistrate, the Lawyers appearing for him informed the Court that their client is being pressurized by the Police to implicate Ravi Karunanayake in his statement!! It is also relevant to mention that the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence speaking on the State television few days ago accused the Head of sirasa News - Mr Shevon Daniel for this crime and said that it was an inside job with the aim of claiming insurance!! Can You believe that responsible Government officers coming on State Media and making such unsubstantiated statements! The Police arrested Mr. Chinthaka Udayashantha on the 18th. However, The Court granted bail to all suspects on 19th January 2009. Those who are behind this plan are still on the move. Immediately after bail was granted to the two MMCs another false complaint has been made against them with the connivance of the Police to get them behind bars once again. I do not know how long this harassment will go on. Hon. Speaker, I enumerated these incidents to show you the pattern how this plan is being executed. All these so called suspects are linked to the Kotte MC and the government is using the state Media to make immature but malicious accusations. The ulterior motive of these efforts is to cover up the real culprits of the crime by diverting the attention of the public in to fancy theories and thereby paving ways and means to take revenge on their political adversaries. I fear that there is an unscrupulous attempt to bring discredit to me personally as well as to the UNP by spreading malice and hatred and to suppress the free media. If we allow this path to continue it will surely lead this country towards a military regime or a dictatorship. Thank you. [.. 3.04] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon.
