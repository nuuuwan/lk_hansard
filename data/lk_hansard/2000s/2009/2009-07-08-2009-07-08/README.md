Minister, I am trying to get the point but only you and my Friend, the Hon. Tissa Karalliyadde are there from the Cabinet. I would appreciate if these matters are deliberated and ensured that financial discipline is brought into the country. When you say that the revenue for this year is reduced by 10 per cent, I am sure that is only an initial intimation. You would find that the reduction would be around 12 to 15 per cent. So, you are going to lose about Rs. 100 billion. On that score, you are having even a worse situation. The expenditure is off the track, it is up by 28 per cent and normally it is in midstream. That will be around 35 per cent and you will have an excess of Rs. 600 billion in expenditure and a reduction of Rs. 100 billion in revenue, the total being Rs. 700 billion. Sir, Rs. 700 billion is an astronomical figure. Now in this House, are you telling us just to accept what you say and then debate on that particular score? We need to have a deliberation as to how to depoliticize the issue. That is what we are basically saying. On the same score, I would like to say that the Auditor-General has very categorically castigated the Parliament where you and I are represented. We brought this matter up at the COPE yesterday. The Auditor-General has slammed Parliament for disregarding the financial procedures. He has the right to do so and he has done it in the correct spirit because Parliament, the very institution that is supposed to be an emulation to the rest of the world, is eroded. He says that we have not collected the one-third of the foreign revenue that we have got to get and we have not given the relevant corroborative evidence for expenditure incurred by Parliament. So, we must ensure that the searchlights are turned inside Parliament itself.

, , . . . , , '' ?'' . . . . . . ? . . . ? . ? , . ? Have you given a Letter of Intent to the IMF? Surely, no bank will rush and say, Sweetheart, here is the money for your country. They will not say so. You must ensure that the basic ingredients are given. You must say, Yes, we require; these are the ways that we intend doing it. Then a Letter of Intent should go. Last time, when I asked the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, he said that no Letter of Intent had been sent. So, if that is the case, the starting point lies there. Do not blame the world. This Government has a peculiar habit of pointing the finger at the United National Party, pointing the finger at the very friends from whom they expect to get it done and they think that intimidating and whipping them is the only way to get it done. As you know, those are good for village thugs. But, that does not help us. Let us ensure that we work together. If you say that you are having a problem with the IMF, we, the United National Party, are ready to say, Let us work for the national cause. But, what do you do? When we wanted to extend our support for the Labour GSP you said, We do not require assistance. But, at the end of the day what has happened? The country is losing the Labour GSP. We cannot be rest assured and have not got it in our cap. Let us ensure that we work together. Likewise, to the IMF you say, We do not need it; without the IMF we can manage that.

I saw you for the first time reading off a document. You are so sensitive that you do not want to put a word out of place unlike other people who go and tell different things. Normally you are a person who speaks off the cuff and I was surprisingly wondering why you were extra cautious. Are you trying to stymie them or are you trying to be extra cautious? So, Hon. Minister - [Interruption.] There is a positive direction as my amiable Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella says. This small miracle has many performances. You have one minister who tried a small miracle and got messed up. This one is a little bigger than that small miracle. He is a miracle by himself. I hope he will not be removed and put into the Ministry of Cultural Affairs or something like that. You always paraphrase it with Chintanaya. If Chintanaya wants it, you will not have any problem. That is how it is. The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala is also laughing. That is how we have got to do it. Let us take it in that spirit. Let us work together for the Labour GSP; let us work together with the IMF. That is what we have got to do. Thereafter, you can say why it is not happening. Look at the way the media is harassed. Look at the plight of the IDPs. Whether the tsunami disaster was in the South or - . . . . " "

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I think the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti was perfectly correct in his description of the basic objectives of the Stimulus Package that is now being discussed in this august Assembly. The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti made the point that the principal purpose which we are attempting to accomplish is value addition. We are responding to a crisis of global proportions. It is not by any means specific to Sri Lanka. It would,

2009 08 1693 1694

therefore, be an idle expectation to think that Sri Lanka can isolate herself from trends which are manifesting themselves in the world economy as a whole. What we need to do is to strengthen our industries, as the Hon. Member said, to give them incentives which would enable them to add value and to preserve their competitiveness in a hostile global environment. So, that is what we are attempting to do. At the United Nations Conference in New York where I represented His Excellency the President at a high-level discussion of the global economic crisis and its impact on the developing world, I had the privilege of interacting with Prof. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate who made the point very convincingly in New York that what is needed at this time is for the State to invest resources; a very ambitious public expenditure programme is required at this time. That is what we are trying to do. The Government wants to protect employment. That is the main purpose of the Government. We are making this Stimulus Package available to companies that have not retrenched their workers even under difficult conditions. There are two criteria: one is that they must earn for the country a volume of foreign exchange comparable with what they were able to earn last year. The second consideration is even more important. Security of employment is one of the most important things in our country as we leave terrorism behind us and as we address the imperatives of economic development. We are confident that the Stimulus Package will achieve these objectives. Applications are already in the process of being received and we are processing those applications to make certain that these benefits will be properly awarded on the basis of objective criteria. Then, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to indicate to you very briefly what the world thinks of recent events in this country. During the last two months I have visited several significant capitals including New Delhi, Beijing, Tokyo, London and Washington. I would summarize the situation like this. There is genuine appreciation of several things. First of all that little Sri Lanka has been able to achieve something that the most powerful and the richest nations in the world have so far not been able to do. In other words, to defeat terrorism militarily and to give the people of the country the benefit of an environment without fear, without duress so that they can live their lives with dignity and self-esteem. That paves the way for economic development. This has won the appreciation of the world. Secondly, Mr. Deputy Speaker, at the Economic Summit which was held in Colombo about ten days ago, Yasushi Akashi, the special envoy of the Japanese Government publicly said in his address that he knows of no other situation where a Government in the post-conflict phase has been able to deal so effectively with the problems of displaced persons. In my own presentation to the Economic Summit, I pointed out that the Government has to provide as many as one million

meals a day. That is not by any means an easy undertaking. It is easy to criticize; nit-picking is not difficult. But, Yasushi Akashi said that he had been there; he had seen for himself the conditions in those camps and having regard to the magnitude and complexity of the task he makes bold to say that there is no comparable situation where so much has been achieved in such challenging circumstances within so short a period. Then in foreign capitals, there is a great deal of appreciation for the Presidents resolve to revive the democratic process. Elections are taking place on the 8th of August not only in the Uva Province but also in the Northern Province to Local Authorities. Now, one of the most heinous things that the LTTE did was to destroy the legitimate leadership of the Tamil community. We are now providing the space for the Tamil community to elect their leaders without intimidation. So, what we are seeing is the resuscitation of the electoral process and that would enable us to move the political process in that region forward. So, it is a new opportunity and this is warmly appreciated in foreign capitals. Then, they have stated very clearly that they are prepared to join hands with us to make available whatever assistance we need for the strengthening of the economy particularly to provide livelihoods, restoration of livelihoods for people who have suffered so much pain and anguish during two decades of the military conflict. So, the Governments desire is to exploit the massive potential that is available in those parts of the country. For agriculture, hundreds of thousands of acres are being opened up particularly in the Eastern Province for the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, all of them for which there are abundant markets today in the world. In Dubai, in Singapore and particularly in the Maldives the hotel industry requires much of what we can produce in the Eastern Province. Then, the potential for tourism which could not be exploited because of violence in that area and also the fisheries resources in the Northern waters which were neglected for the last 20 years, we are in a position to exploit that potential without restriction at this time. Already companies are beginning to make use of these opportunities. Sri Lankan companies are going there. Hayleys are very active with regard to agricultural activities. Companies like Tri Star garments and Brandix are opening apparel factories in that part of the country in order to provide employment opportunities for people. So, as peace returns and as the political process is activated, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are focusing upon the economy because the idea is to make conditions as comfortable as possible for people in the camps while they are in the camps and more importantly to enable them to resettle in their own homes as early as possible and when they are resettled, they must have jobs, they must have an earning capability in order to resume their lives.

1695 1696

So, these are the circumstances in which this Stimulus Package is being brought before Parliament and it is a matter of deep satisfaction to us, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that Sri Lanka although undoubtedly affected by the global crisis, as indeed all countries are, we have been able to minimize the impact of the crisis. So, with those words, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to commend this Stimulus Package to the House. It is a measure that is absolutely necessary and as the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said, this should not be a matter of partisan politics and I am confident that all sections of the House will join in supporting this measure which is for the economic well-being of our country at the present time. Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

The Sinhalese and the Tamils have never been enemies. We have never been at each others throats. Yet politically, at war and at various things, yes, but we are also people who have fought for human rights. We also have sacrificed for human rights and we will not allow your human rights to be taken away or be violated by anybody. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Thank you very much. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is what we have to say because we have to build up this country on the basis of equality and fairness. I just said, my dear Friend, that there are no first -class citizens, second -class citizens and third-class citizens in this country. All are the same. We can have debates; we can argue, but not on the basis of ethnicity. I paid a tribute to the JVP. Whatever ideas they may have, economic or political, we can have debates. But, they have taken a

very good stand. I saw their posters where they have said that there must be equality for everybody in this country; there must be equal treatment for every person in this country. That is why we are in politics. So, please take that message. Let us forget all these things; let us go forward. We have respect for the Tamil people. They are wonderful cultivators. They are wonderful people who love their culture and language. So, let us start afresh. His Excellency the President - if you read The Hindu newspaper - has given an open invitation to the Members of the TNA: "Please come and discuss". Why should you be afraid to talk? I am very glad that you went and had a discussion with him. Have you become a lesser man today than one week ago, my good Friend? No, because you have to discuss. We can have different points of view. That is why we are in a democracy. But, I want to appeal to you. I can give you an assurance that the majority of Members of Parliament, irrespective of whatever party they come from, are dedicated to the idea that all Sri Lankans have equal rights. I ask the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake, is it not correct? He agrees. So we have a lot to build up. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) . Please do not drop out of this chance. Please engage in discussions. As Sir Winston Churchill said, To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war. So, now the time has come to jaw-jaw. Please come, we will discuss. His Excellency has requested you to help him in working out a political arrangement. So, please respond to that. I want to take this opportunity on the Floor of this House. We have won the war. We are happy that we won the war. We are proud of our defence forces. But, at the same time, we are strongly for the equality of everybody and for the equal rights of the citizens of this country. So, I want to make that request as a dear friend. Let us all get together in the post-war period because what is now important is post-war reconstruction and not pre-war archaeology. Thank you.

[. . 2.24] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Mr. Deputy Speaker, though I never expected that I would participate in this Debate today, in deference to the wishes of my Colleagues who wanted me to express the views of our party, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi also known as the Tamil National Alliance and in the light of the noble sentiments that have been expressed a few moments ago by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, a well respected politician as far as my party is concerned, I thought that I should rise to the occasion and place on record the considered views of our party in regard to some of the matters that he thought it necessary to refer to in the course of his speech. Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are indeed a pathetic lot, I mean my party, in the sense that more often than not, we have been generally misunderstood particularly in regard to our stand in respect of the question of the resolution of the national question of this country. Since the formation of the Tamil National Alliance encompassing the Tamil United Liberation Front, the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization - TELO, the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front - EPRLF and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress - ACTC, as far back as the latter part of 2001, it has been our consistent position that in regard to any negotiations between the Government in power and the Tamil people in respect of the question of finding a political solution to the national question, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - LTTE - should represent the Tamil people at such negotiations. We took the stand not because we love the LTTE. We had been prior to that and even at the time and also thereafter, fully conscious of the deeds and misdeeds of the LTTE as a politico-military organization. I think we too were in fact fully conscious of the fact when we took the stand that three out of the four parties in our Alliance lost its top leadership at the hands of the LTTE. But, we took the decision nevertheless for the simple reason that with the ethnic conflict culminating into a military conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka on the one side and the Liberation Tigers of the LTTE on the other, it is nothing but logical, nothing but political for these two warring sides to meet at the negotiating table in order to find a political solution with a view to ending the military conflict, the off-shoot of the ethnic conflict and in the process to find an everlasting solution to the root cause of the military conflict, namely, the ethnic conflict. It had been our position at the General Election of 2001. We got the support of the Tamil people living in the North-East for that stand in clear terms, in no uncertain terms. That verdict was reinforced at the following General Election held in April, 2004 when our party was returned with 23 Members to this august Assembly. But, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the noble hopes, the fond hopes we placed in regard to the question of finding a political

solution were shattered in mid-2006 when we found that again the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were engaged in a war or rather in a no-holds barred war. Now the war is over. The Government is victorious. The LTTE has been defeated and decimated. That is a fact. As realists, as a responsible political party, we are mindful of the fact that we should take into consideration the realities as they are and also we have now, after due consideration, decided to assert ourselves in full measure on behalf of our people with a view to find permanent peace in this country through the peaceful resolution of the ethnic conflict. That is exactly why, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that our party accepted the invitation extended by His Excellency the President the other day when he called for an All Party Conference on the 2nd of July this year. I am happy to state on the Floor of this august Assembly that it is our assessment that it was indeed a very good beginning, a beginning in the right direction, the first step in the right direction to find a permanent resolution of this perennial problem, namely, the ethnic conflict that has consumed thousands and thousands of noble lives cutting across the ethnic divide in this country in the last several years. We all are responsible to our people. When we say "our people", Mr. Deputy Speaker, I mean not only the Tamils, not only the Tamil-speaking Muslims, but also our own Sinhalese brothers and sisters. That is exactly why, Mr. Deputy Speaker, shouldered with the responsibility of leading a delegation in the absence of our leader, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, who was away in Trincomalee on that day, I, during the course of my very short submission, mentioned whenever I had to refer to Sri Lanka as our country. So, now we have got to ensure that our people living in our country, whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays or of any other ethnicity, would get their due, are getting their due, in that they would have every opportunity to contribute to the national development of this country and for that to be accomplished in the first place, there is national unity and national reconciliation. I would say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the Tamil National Alliance, fully conscious of the trust and confidence placed on it by the Tamil people inhabiting the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, will never hesitate to throw its might together with all the democratic political parties of this country in the democratic process that has now commenced with the noble purpose of solving this problem once and for all. But, when dealing with this question, I must say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we should not live in our own world. I do not mean anything disrespectful to anybody but at the same time, I should say that for the simple reason there are some hard and harsh realities when we deal with this question. The Tamil people being a minority, being denied their fundamental rights since the time of Independence by successive Governments, feel alienated in their own

1723 1724

[ . ]

country, in that today we find about 300,000 of our own brothers and sisters placed behind barbed wire fences in what is known as "IDP camps". We have got to deal with this problem first. I am not blaming the Government for that. We all have to take the responsibility for that, from the Government side as well as from the Opposition, for the simple reason that we have permitted this problem to remain with us till now. There is no question of running away from that; we have got to own it up. We have got to find a solution in the first place to this pressing problem. There are elderly people; there are sick people; there are injured people. There are pregnant women; there are children; there are infants; there are babies. I can personally say that even my own younger sister, the one and only younger sister I have, a graduate teacher, too is there with her youngest son, a 14-year old boy, as one of the persons in the IDP camp in Vavuniya. So, I can personally understand the feelings of the kith and kin of these people. They want an urgent remedy for this problem. We have got to ensure, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we put all our might in order to ensure that these people are speedily rehabilitated and resettled. But, I must say that we can have a practical approach in regard to the whole question. There are thousands of people in the IDP camps who have their own relatives and friends, who are in a position to give them temporary accommodation whether it be for months or years till they decide to resettle in the areas from where they got displaced. There are also thousands of people who were forced to leave the Jaffna Peninsula in October, 1995 when the Sri Lankan Armed Forces recaptured it and moved into various parts of the Kilinochchi District and who are now there in the IDP camps in Vavuniya. These families owned houses, properties in various parts of the Jaffna Peninsula. They can very easily return to their ancestral homes without being a burden on the Government any longer. There are thousands of public servants who are serving the public, drawing salaries every month from the Government and they had been and they are public servants in every interpretation of the term. They too are there behind barbed wire fences in the IDP camps. So, we have got to deal with this problem in a practical way. That is exactly why the Tamil National Alliance wishes to press the Government that top priority should be given to this question of resettlement of these people. We cannot shirk our responsibility. Till we keep these people in the IDP camps, there would continue to be a humanitarian problem in all its manifestations. Let us not forget that. In regard to the question of dealing with this problem, we are there with you. We are ready to support each and every constructive effort, each and every meaningful effort the Government would undertake from now on in order to deal with this question. Therefore, I take this opportunity, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to plead with the Government with all humility, with all responsibility I can command as a Member of the Tamil National Alliance,

who has been entrusted with the task of participating in this Debate on behalf of my Party, that it should - I would wish to emphasize the word, should - act now. Now is the time to act. Secondly, Mr. Deputy Speaker, there is the question of finding a viable solution. I find that His Excellency the President in his much-publicized interview given to one of the leading English dailies published from India, namely The Hindu, a few days back has stated that he would be in a position to announce a political solution only after the next Presidential Election. We can understand the political constraints, the political compulsions or rather the electoral compulsions that His Excellency the President faces in this regard. But, at the same time, we wish to state that without waiting till the outcome of the next Presidential Election, which can be held any time after November this year, the democratic process of a dialogue between various democratic political parties of this country with a view to evolve a just and viable political solution to the national question should commence without any delay. Let us start now; let us exchange our views without any inhibitions. That is exactly why, on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance, I wanted to go on record the other day and in fact, I went on record saying that we were there at the All Party Conference on the 2nd of July with open minds. Let us not be prisoners of our own mental making. Let us shake off all the misinterpretations of history or rather the distorted versions of history from our minds. That is a must. Some of us even do not know the recent history. I can understand that. But at the same time, in this country the pathetic fact is that we all talk of different versions of our own history in relation to periods as early as 1,500 years ago or 2,000 years ago and so on and so forth. I do not want to delve deep into that but let us as a people, as a nation welded by a common heritage, a common history in addition to various struggles between various kingdoms of this country that included the Sinhala kingdoms and the Tamil kingdoms at different periods of time, also record very many instances when there had been close collaboration and co-operation between the Tamil community and the Sinhala community as such at very many different periods in our recorded history. We have fought against each other; we have fought together. That has been the fact. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as one who is still proud of the eminent sons of this country in the calibre of the late Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam and very many others, who are still remembered by the Sinhala community for the noble achievements they were able to make in the struggle for Independence of our own little, beautiful Island, I wish to state that we all should rise above petty political considerations and instead of concentrating on the next elections or rather instead of concentrating our minds on the question of next elections, let us now think about the

2009 08 1725 1726

next generation. We can be an example to the whole world in regard to the question of finding a just, political solution to a conflict that raged on for a few decades in a multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic country. As expressed by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, I would like to stress the fact that there are very many common strands between our cultures, our heritages, our languages and also between our religions. For instance, there are a number of common features, common characteristics and common elements between the religions: Buddhism and Hinduism. If you take up Christianity, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you will find Christians in both the communities. You find Catholics in both the communities. When it comes to the Muslims, whose mother-tongue is Tamil, they are in fact the common link between the Sinhalese and the Tamils, more particularly in the South. So, there are very many things that unite us rather than that divide us. I am not talking of this matter for the first time. You can check up the records. On the 5th of May, 1994, I entered this august Assembly and made my Maiden Speech on the very same day - you can check up the record, the Hansard of 5th May, 1994. I am sure of my memory - I have stated the same sentiments; I have talked about the commonalities between the two communities rather than the differences and emphasized the need and necessity to think about what that unites us rather than what that divides us. Therefore, I must assure the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama that we are there with you. We are there with you as sons of this country, as proud sons of this country who have every right to compete with anybody in this country in regard to the protection of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. All what we need is this. Within our own parameters, within the territorial boundaries of our little beautiful Island, we can devise a political administrative mechanism in clear-cut constitutional terms. I think the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris would be in a better position to understand it being an expert in political science. We should endeavour to find a political administrative mechanism in clear-cut constitutional terms to deal with the question of the resolution of the national conflict. Names do not matter, I am not interested in terminologies. What matters is ultimately what we are going to achieve together. That is what is important. If the fears and apprehensions of the majority community are in regard to the question of sovereignty and territorial integrity, I would say, let there be no fear. There is no reason whatsoever for the majority community to entertain any fear, any suspicion and any apprehension in this regard. This country will remain united. We have expressed the same sentiments during the last several months, during the last several years. Please check the Hansard. Members from the Tamil National Alliance have pleaded on a number of occasions for the resolution of the national question through political means and when one says that this should be resolved politically, definitely that person would not have meant anything other than finding a solution within a united Sri Lanka.

I have in recent years, in 2007 and 2008, after entering this august Assembly, had a number of occasions to deal with this question on the soil of India, in the UK and in Geneva. I have said repeatedly that the Tamil people are ever-willing to find a solution within the framework of a united Sri Lanka. All what you want is a politico-administrative mechanism in clear-cut constitutional terms. I do not want to use this controversial term, "a traditional homeland". I would rather prefer to use "in our own areas of historical habitation" as used in the Indo-Lanka Accord. All what our people want is a mechanism whereby they would be able to manage their own affairs within a united Sri Lanka in accordance with their own wishes and aspirations. Is it apprehensible? Is it illegitimate? Definitely no. I would further say, rather it would be adding to the unity of this country. As long as Sri Lanka remains a united country, finding a politico-administrative mechanism to devolve powers to the people of this country in accordance with their political aspirations, based on their own ethnicity, on their own history, on their own culture and also on their own identity, cannot in any way run counter to the concept of unity and territorial integrity of this country.

Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are really at a turning point. This is a historic moment. This is now available to all of us, not only to His Excellency the President. It is available to all the political parties and I wish the main Opposition, the United National Party, my good Friends of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, other Members of the parties represented in this august Assembly as well as those parties which had been represented here but not here now, and also the other parties that are outside this august Assembly will rise to the occasion bearing in mind they owe it to our people - they all owe it to our people.

I would conclude my speech, Mr. Deputy Speaker, by saying that, "United we stand; divided we fall" and I think we shall remain united. We were united when this country was ruled by aliens. We were united against the Portuguese; we were united against the Dutch and we were united against our friends from the United Kingdom. I cannot understand as to why we cannot be united again provided there is a proper atmosphere for all the people to believe that we have our rights recognized in equality with that of the others.
