Mr. Speaker, there is a need to restrict the import of petroleum products from overseas because, as we all know, we do substantial value addition in this country in respect of petroleum products in our refineries and in order to encourage and stimulate that process of value addition, it is necessary to restrict imports into the country. The second Gazette notification has an effect of imposing a Cess Levy ranging from 1 to 35 per cent in respect of various items which are brought from abroad.

    "text": "luxury items and the practice of bringing these items into Sri Lanka without restriction is harmful to the development of local industry. It is one of the main objectives of the Government to create conditions which are conducive to the development of local industries. This necessarily means that some measures have to be taken to curtail and restrict the import of these items from overseas. So, that is the objective which is sought to be accomplished by the Gazette notification of 6th of November, 2008. I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, that the Government attaches considerable importance to the set of proposals that was announced to the country soon after the Cabinet Meeting that was held last week. It is the duty of the Government to take measures to protect Sri Lanka from the consequences of the global crisis. The global crisis is something that is affecting countries which are far more affluent than ours. I would like to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that in the Report of Bloomberg which was issued on the 29th of December, there is some very revealing information. Bloomberg says about the records relating to Christmas sales and the amount of money that people spend at Christmas time. These records began to be compiled in the year 1969. Throughout that period from 1969 to the present day, according to the Bloomberg Report, the lowest amount of Christmas spending has taken place this year. That is from 1969 to-date. This means that people do not have money to spend. The recession has affected the most affluent countries of the world. From 1969 to-date, the least amount of money that people had in their wallets to spend on Christmas shopping was this year. In the whole history of Toyota, they have never declared a loss. But, for the first time, Toyota is now declaring a loss. Up to last week 67,000 factories have closed down in China. I am stating these facts to this august Assembly simply to make the point that the magnitude of this crisis is beyond question. From 2008 to 2009, the expenditure at Christmas time has declined in the United States by as much as 20 per cent. So, these are consequences that a small economy like Sri Lanka cannot hope to control. Nevertheless, the Government has a duty to take this situation into account and to decide what are the measures appropriate to protect the Sri Lankan economy to the maximum extent possible from the fallout of the global crisis. It is in response to that need, Mr. Speaker, that the Cabinet of Ministers studied the situation in depth and decided what form of intervention would be appropriate. Mr. Speaker, as a student of contemporary political and economic developments, you will be aware that the thinking of economists all over the world has undergone a dramatic transformation. The man who ran the economy of the most powerful country in the world for 30 years was Alan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan throughout that period was guided by a certain philosophy which he did not hesitate to articulate on appropriate occasions.",

    "text": "Alan Greenspan believed that the market is the best guide; that it is wrong for governments to intervene. The market will determine prices, demand and supply. All these must be left to the uninhibited interplay of market forces. Alan Greenspan expressed the view that if there is government intervention, it is necessarily a distortion. It is something harmful and to be avoided. But, about a month ago in the testimony which he gave the United States Senate, Alen Greenspan swallowed every word that he had uttered throughout his 30-year career. Alen Greenspan said that that theory is no longer compatible with contemporary economic circumstances and he now has no hesitation in saying that he made a mistake. There are factors that he did not take into account and the correct attitude today for a government to adopt, is to intervene selectively, not indiscriminately and not on all occasions. But, that there are times that a government needs to intervene. Now, this has been done in the United States, in the United Kingdom and all over Western Europe. The Secretary to the Treasury of the United States, Hank Paulson did that. Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has unveiled a package of relief that is totally inconsistent with the orthodox views that they have been expressing for a long time. Indeed these governments have been telling Sri Lanka and the countries of South Asia for a long time, Do not interfere with the market. It is wrong to utilize State funds to support enterprises. But, what has happened today? In the United States and the United Kingdom, the money belonging to taxpayers is being utilized to strengthen the banking system. Banks are collapsing; countries are collapsing. We have heard of companies collapsing; we have heard of banks collapsing, Mr. Speaker. But, very seldom have we heard of a country collapsing. That has happened in Iceland. So to meet with unusual circumstances, the economists and the political leaders of the West have said that they must come up with unconventional approaches, and one of these unconventional approaches is a larger scope for State intervention. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France addressing the United Nations said that the time has come to re-visit the basic assumptions of the Bretton Woods Regime. Bretton Woods Regime was appropriate in the 1940s. But, he says today it is absolutely necessary for Governments to adopt aggressive policies to intervene in markets, to support banks, to protect the community, to protect depositors. Now, that is what the Government of Sri Lanka is doing. I think, Mr. Speaker, everyone will agree that the timely intervention of the Central Bank with regard to Seylan Bank has been very salutary. It has injected confidence. It has enabled us to restore stability to the banking system. If that had not been done there would have been a contagion effect. The results would have spread right across the spectrum and that would have done untold harm particularly to small people, to small depositors.",

    "text": "So, it was absolutely necessary in those circumstances, Mr. Speaker, for the State to intervene. Now it is in keeping with that emerging trend that the Cabinet of Ministers at their meeting last week took stock of the situation and announced a comprehensive series of measures to deal with problems which have arisen in different sectors of the economy. I wish to state, Mr. Speaker, that this has not been done ad hoc; it was not a question of providing relief here and there on the basis of expediency. That was certainly not the intention of the Government. What we wanted to do was to come up with an economic stimulus package to stimulate the different sectors of the economy. In order to do this, the first requirement is that we must determine what the money supply is going to be for the year 2009, by what amount is a quant of money going to grow. We have decided, Mr. Speaker, that money in this country will grow by 15 per cent in 2009. That means, there will be more money in circulation. I think, Mr. Speaker, you are aware that one of Englands great Economist, John Maynard Keynes, once made the statement that in a time of recession it makes sense to pay people to dig holes in the ground and it makes sense to pay other people to cover up the holes which have been dug. That of course is an exaggeration but he was trying to make the point dramatically that you must not pump money into the system. There has to be infusion of resources at a time of recession in order to uplift the economy. This means there is a circulation of money. It will stimulate business. Land values, other values will go up. People will engage in various transactions and there will be a sense of vibrancy and enthusiasm with regard to the economy. In recognition of that reality we have decided that the money supply in the country should grow by 15 per cent in the course of the year 2009. There is another decision which is equally important and that has to do with the level of the overall budget deficit. Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the fact that in spite of all the turbulence which the world is experiencing, the economy of Sri Lanka has shown a consistent growth of 7 per cent during the last three years. A very few countries are able to say that. They may show 7 per cent, 10 per cent in one year. But, very few countries in this region have been able to maintain an uninterrupted unbroken 7 per cent growth throughout that period. And, today in spite of the problems that we are encountering, we have every confidence that the economy will grow by approximately 6.5 per cent . So Government expenditure has to be controlled. That 6.5 per cent budget deficit cannot be exceeded. That is absolutely necessary to maintain monetary and fiscal stability in the country. It is necessary to provide money for infrastructure projects to manage the welfare of regions of the country such as the region that you represent, Mr. Speaker. The rural hinterland prosperity, the livelihoods of people, gender equality, all of this necessitates the containment of the overall budget deficit at the level of approximately 6.5 per cent. So, that is one of the basic assumptions underpinning the comprehensive",

Now, the Government does not propose to deal with any commodity in isolation. It is not our intention to deal with petrol or any other commodity in isolation. We want to look at the total picture. Petrol is coming down by Rs. 2, but other commodities like diesel, kerosene, furnace oil are coming down much more significantly by Rs. 10 per litre. We think that is absolutely necessary. Take diesel for example. The fishing community will derive very considerable benefits from the reduction of the diesel price by Rs. 10 per litre. Diesel is also used by lorries which transport fish, vegetables and other essential commodities from one part of the country to another. Then, Mr. Speaker, the reduction in the price of furnace oil is going to have very beneficial consequences for the economy at large. It is absolutely necessary for us to do everything possible to nurture and support the competitiveness of local industries. That is the key to Sri Lankas future. Take for example, the apparel sector which has really done this country proud. Twenty five years ago, Mr. Speaker, in the early stages of your own political career, nobody would have predicted that the apparel sector would have reached the magnificent heights in this country that they have done today. Today, some of the apparel companies like Brandix and MAS Holdings in Sri Lanka are global leaders. But, we cannot be complacent about the past. We have to ensure that those standards will continue into the future. We cannot leave these companies to fend for themselves. They require some support from the State. So that is why, Mr. Speaker, we have come up with proposals in respect of every sector. How many jobs have been lost in the United States, in France and in China? In Sri Lanka, those consequences have not arisen so far. That is not fortuitous. It is not a matter of coincidence. But, rather it is a result of structured policies which has been devised and put in place taking into account the particular circumstances and requirements of our own country. We are very proud of the fact that there has been no significant loss of employment in this country and it is our firm determination to ensure that that state of things will continue. If that is so, we have to support local industry. Far from job being lost, Mr. Speaker, Brandix is going to open a large factory in the District of Batticaloa which will provide employment for 1,700 people - mainly girls in the District of Batticaloa, a part of the country which has gone through periods of untold anguish. Now, the need of the hour is a restoration of livelihoods in areas such as agriculture, tourism, fisheries and small and medium sector industries. So, these companies are creating employment in those parts of the country. In order to do that, they require assistance from the State. Now, Mr. Speaker, some of the companies are doing very well in the export sector bringing in large volumes of foreign exchange. For example, the apparel sector",

The quality of their products is recognized all over the world. Now when we reduce the price of furnace oil by Rs. 10, we are giving a major boost to some of these industries, in particular, the apparel industry and the ceramic industry. So, Mr. Speaker, the Orders which are being debated in the House today must not be seen in isolation. They fall into place as part of an overall framework of economic and social policies which are crafted deliberately and with matured thought to make it possible for Sri Lanka to withstand the challenges that arise from the global situation. Now, I would like to indicate some of the measures that we have taken in respect of the key sectors of Sri Lankas economy. Take the apparel sector. The apparel sector will be exempt this year from the 15 per cent electricity surcharge. The 15 per cent electricity surcharge adds very considerably to the cost of production. If they are to compete today under these adverse circumstances, we have to find every method that is available to enable them to reduce their cost of production, to make them competitive to give them access into new markets while consolidating existing markets. Now, the reduction of the electricity surcharge by 15 per cent will be a measure of very considerable relief to the apparel industry. They will also be exempt throughout the year 2009 from the Economic Service Charge. It will also be possible for us to give them the benefit of a reduction in the interest rate. Representing the Uva Province, Mr. Speaker, you will be aware that some of the entrepreneurs in that part of the country are greatly hampered by the high interest rates. If they go to a bank to obtain capital to start an industry, they have to pay very high rates of interest. This means that their product ceases to be competitive because the provision that they have to make for debt serving is so large that they are in effect pricing their product out of the market, Particularly for the smaller and medium sector, I would say that the most important single measure which is necessary today is a reduction of the interest rate. That will make it possible for the small man to stand on his own feet, to utilize his own talents and creativity and to make good in the world of finance and industry. Sometime ago, the reduction of the interest rate was not really feasible. There were many reasons for that. The main reason, Mr. Speaker, was the high rate of inflation. The Government is very proud of its achievement in bringing down the rate of inflation at a rate which is in excess of what is being achieved in any other country in this region. In the month of June, 2008 the rate of inflation was 30 per cent. In December 2008,",

That is why I say that this was a significant achievement on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka in reducing inflation by as much as 17 per cent during the latter half of the year 2008. That is only a beginning. We are happy about that achievement but that simply provides us with the foundation to adopt various other measures which are going to be demonstrably beneficial from this standpoint, again particularly of smaller people who engage in business and commercial activity in this country. The deceleration that has occurred there, the substantial reduction of the rate of inflation, now makes it possible for the Central Bank to contemplate a significant reduction in the bank interest rate. So, Mr. Speaker, when you take all these things together comprehensively, as elements of one package, you will see that every sector of Sri Lankas economy has been very significantly supported. We have done something else for the apparel sector in recognition of the contribution they are making to the economy and in particular, the employment that they are providing in Sri Lanka, particularly in the rural areas of Sri Lanka. Three hundred and fifty thousand people, mainly women, are directly employed in garment factories in this country. But, if you take into account indirect employment as well, then the figure is as high as approximately one million. If you add the dependent members of families and households, then you are talking of almost three million people in a population of nineteen and a half million. Because of that, the need to retain that stability and to ensure that there is no retrenchment, the Government has done something which we consider to be particularly timely and opportune. What we have done, Sir, is to give an unprecedented concession to the apparel sector. We have told them that the Government will, as a special incentive, give apparel companies 5 per cent of the total value of their exports out of this country in the year 2009, provided that they comply with two conditions. The first condition, Sir, is that they do not retrench any employees. That is absolutely vital having regard to what is happening in countries with economies which are far stronger than ours. A company that produces apparel products and exports them should be able to show that they have not retrenched workers in the year 2009. The second condition is that they must maintain the level of production at least at the 2008 level. If they comply with these two conditions, Sir, then they will get from the State 5 per cent of the value of exports out of the country. So, here is a practical demonstration of what Alan Greenspan is saying; what Hank Paulson is saying; what",

    "text": "Gordon Brown is saying. These are imaginative ways in which the State needs to intervene in order to protect an economy in the face of adversity and turbulent conditions which prevail in the global economy. So, we think that the package of proposals which the Cabinet of Ministers considered and announced last week will go a very long way towards mitigating the problems which have afflicted the world. His Excellency the President, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, has made a deep study of the problems of each sector and the proposals that he presented to the Cabinet as Minister of Finance received the unqualified endorsement of the Cabinet last week. This has happened in respect of some of the other vital sectors of the economy as well. The Hon. Member from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna who asked me a question this morning referred to some of the problems in the cinnamon sector. Sri Lanka produces very high quality cinnamon and, as I said, we produce 80 per cent of the world's cinnamon. I think there is a need to expand these markets. At this moment, our principal markets for cinnamon are in Latin America: countries like Chile, Brazil, Argentina and in particular, Mexico. But, we also need to explore avenues for opening up new markets in Western Europe and elsewhere. The problem about cinnamon is that the methods of peeling are very anachronistic and archaic. Much of it is done manually. I have seen that for myself. So, we need to modernize the methods of production. For that purpose, the Government has obtained substantial aid from GTZ, that is from the Government of the Republic of Germany, and from other sources. There is today a rather ambitious programme for upgrading the quality of cinnamon in order to make it possible for Sri Lankan cinnamon to find its way into the sophisticated markets of the world. So, there is a programme for dealing with spices - nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, pepper. Pepper is a subsidiary source of income in the plantations in Kurunegala, Kandy, Matale and elsewhere. So, all of that is catered for as aspects of the proposals which were presented by the Cabinet of Ministers last week. Then, Sir, the fall in the prices of tea and rubber has resulted in significant problems particularly for smallholders in Kegalle, Kurunegala and Galle in particular, and the Government has taken note of those problems and come up with a series of measures to extenuate the problems of the smallholders. With regard to tea, these proposals have the effect that the tea grower, the small person who sells his green leaf to a factory in the area, will get a minimum price of Rs. 45 per kilo for green leaf. Then, in order to protect the tea industry from falling world prices, a commercial entity that will be established by the Sri Lanka Tea Board will do its best to stabilize Sri Lankan tea prices at approximately Rs. 300 per kilogram. But, other measures are also required to support the tea industry at this time. After all, this country is very well known for tea. As you well know, Sir, when we changed the name of this country in 1972 from \"Ceylon\" to \"Sri Lanka\", one area in which we did",

    "text": "not do this officially was with regard to tea. With regard to tea, we continued to talk of \"Ceylon tea\", not \"Sri Lankan tea\". That is because of the importance of branding. The quality of Sri Lankan tea had been indelibly etched on the conscience of mankind as something that had attributes, which had no parallel in the teas that were produced in any part of the world. It is true that today tea is not the main foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. If I might give you the figures approximately, Sir, last year, as I said, we earned Rs. 3.1 billion from the export of apparel products. The next was the Sri Lankans working abroad. Contributing their toil, their sweat, their labour, they brought into the Sri Lankan Exchequer approximately Rs. 2.8 billion. Tea was only the third. Tea brought in a little more than one billion Sri Lankan rupees, about Rs. 1.1 billion. But, the Government has identified several industries as thrust industries and the definition of a thrust industry, in our opinion, is an industry in Sri Lanka which has the potential to be developed up to the one billion rupee threshold. There are several such industries. Apparel and tea have already qualified and they have, in fact, surpassed the one billion mark. But, there are many other industries which, given suitable Government support and sensitive and discriminating intervention, can be developed up to that same level. One of them is rubber. Rubber last year brought in US Dollars 750 million. The gem and jewellery sector, on which the economy of the Sabaragamuwa Province, for example, is particularly dependent, brought in US Dollars 450 million last year. So, in our proposals we have targeted each of these sectors, placing particular emphasis on tea and rubber. We want to encourage tea factories to develop. They cannot be complacent and simply adopt the technologies and the methods that they introduced 25 years ago. So, we are encouraging them to get loans from the banks for the purpose of expanding and modernizing their factories. In this year, there will be no penal interest, Sir. I referred earlier to the problems arising from the high rates of interest which were largely tied to rates of inflation in this country. The result of that is that people who borrowed these sums of money have found it difficult to make these repayments and they had been burdened with penal rates of interest. As a gesture of assistance to these industries struggling against overwhelming odds for no fault of theirs, we have decided that penal interest will not be charged and there will be no pressure applied on bona fide companies that are performing at an adequate level to pay back these loans in a desperate hurry. So, that will be another measure of assistance that will be available to the tea industry. My Ministry has been charged with the responsibility of initiating special discussions with Iran and Russia in particular, to try to expand markets in those countries for Sri Lankan teas. Today in Europe, Russia is the largest buyer of Sri Lankan tea. We have some issues with Russia with regard to duties that are being imposed on Sri",

    "text": "Lankan teas. We have already started discussions with the Government of Russia and we are satisfied with the progress that has been achieved. With regard to rubber, the District of Kalutara is particularly affected. During the last few days, there has been a marginal improvement with regard to the tea and rubber prices. But, with regard to rubber, Sir, the impact of the proposals which were announced by the Cabinet is to enable smallholders in the rubber sector to obtain a minimum of Rs. 150 per kilo of rubber. But the important thing is to do this as part of a structured and comprehensive goal, not just as handouts ad hoc to particular sectors of the countrys economy. With regard to rubber, one of our main objectives is this. We want to encourage exporting companies to make use of high quality latex that is produced in Sri Lanka itself. Two years ago, Sir, the company that brought in the largest volume of foreign exchange into Sri Lanka was a company called Loadstar. Loadstar is today a world leader in heavy tyres. I am sure, Sir, that you will share my legitimate sense of pride in the fact that little Sri Lanka has produced a company which commands 20 per cent of the world market, not the regional market, in heavy tyres. Companies like this must be encouraged to utilize as much as possible latex that is derived from local sources. In order to do this, we have imposed an additional cess of five rupees on rubber that is imported from abroad. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary, Sir, whether we are talking of tea or rubber, to ensure that local material is used and that there is value addition. In my view, value addition is the most important element of a pragmatic policy with regard to the development of Sri Lankas industries and exports. As you know, some time ago we used to export out of this country bulk teas and bulk rubber. Today, we do not do that. We are concentrating on packeted teas and tea bags. That has made it possible for Sri Lankan companies like Dilmah to shine as world leaders. Today, Dilmah is a world leader in tea. It is the Rolls-Royce of teas, the upper end of the market. If you go to any country, any capital in the world or if you go to the most expensive hotel, they will offer Dilmah tea. The Waldorf Astoria in New York or the Dorchester in London will offer Dilmah teas and the label says, This is tea coming from a single source\", that it is coming from a plantation in Haputale, Badulla or Kandy. The plantation is named and the customer is told, You know what tea you are drinking; it is from a single source; it does not consist of a hotchpotch, a blend of teas. Otherwise, the practice was to send our teas to Dubai. For example, in Dubai, they are mixed with teas from Kenya, India and various sources. But, here was an entrepreneur who had the vision, the creativity to chart a course which has made it possible for Dilmah to take its place today with pride as one of the leading tea companies in the world. So, value addition is important. They have done that through value addition.",

    "text": "With regard to rubber also, Sir, we do not want to send our latex in a raw form abroad. We want to work with it. We want to make tyres. We want to make surgical gloves, for example. Take the Australian company, Ansell. They buy the Sri Lankan latex. They add technology from India. They use the Free Trade Agreement that we have with India and the product is so sophisticated as to be of interest to the leading markets of North America and Western Europe. So, value addition is very important. It is important for two reasons, Mr. Speaker. The first is that it enhances the threshold of foreign exchange that we earn for our country. Secondly and more importantly, in my view, it provides opportunities for employment generation. Young people can be absorbed into gainful employment, if these companies in these different sectors of the economy are encouraged to engage in value addition on a structured and systematic basis. All this, Mr. Speaker, will not happen automatically. Tea companies, rubber companies or apparel companies are not going to do these necessarily on their own initiative. Some have done so in fairness to them. But, they require some support from the State. That support has come, Mr. Speaker, in the form of these comprehensive proposals that the Government unveiled last week. So, these are some of the things that I want to bring to the notice of the House. The Government has done everything in its power to protect this country, to protect employment, to protect standards of living and to protect levels of income. We are very happy and we are gratified about the results that we have achieved, that we have been able to avoid the worst consequences which have arisen in other countries. Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make particular reference to the impact of these proposals on reducing fuel costs. The Government considered that it is appropriate to reduce fuel costs with a greater weight for diesel, kerosene and furnace oil to ensure that the benefits of international price reductions are available to the wider economy of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the price of petrol is being reduced by Rs. 2 but diesel, kerosene and furnace oil will be reduced by Rs. 10 each. During the past two months the price of diesel has been reduced by Rs. 40, the price of kerosene by Rs. 40, the price of furnace oil by Rs. 35 to 40 and the price of petrol has now gone down by Rs. 37. These price reductions will help to reduce the cost for train, bus and vans which account for 85 per cent of the transport service providers and also to reduce the cost of goods transport service providers for lorries and trucks. The reduction of the price of furnace oil will lead to a reduction in the cost of industrial and electricity sectors. The reduction in diesel and kerosene prices will help to reduce the costs in agricultural and fisheries sectors. I must also mention the reduction in the gas prices. The reduction in the gas prices has been very significant in deed. The price of a household used 12.5 kilogram gas cylinder has been reduced as follows: Laugh Gas Cylinder",

As the price of diesel and fuel has been reduced by Rs. 35 to Rs. 40, a fuel surcharge of 15 per cent on all industries and hotels will be removed. Action will be taken to reduce bus fares by 4 per cent as the diesel price has been reduced. Then, one other matter that I would like to mention, Mr. Speaker, is the relief that has been given by the Government with regard to VAT repayments. As you know, Sir, every six weeks we have a meeting of the Exporters Forum over which I preside. That is, exporters from all the different fields come there with their problems. The Treasury and all the other key Government institutions are represented, and we make every effort to solve the problems of exporters on the spot. One of the problems which has kept recurring is the problem with regard to VATValue Added Tax - refunds. Many companies have complained that delays with regard to the refund of VAT payments has created acute liquidity problems for those companies and greatly impeded their initiatives with regard to the expansion and development of their export oriented activities. The Government has taken that into account and has now announced that quite definitely without any doubt whatsoever that all VAT refunds will be completed within a period of six months. So, Mr. Speaker, those concessions with regard to the relationships with the banking sector not charging penal interest, giving time for the repayment of loans which have been genuinely applied for the expansion of hotels or factories, all that means that greater latitude will be available to these companies in respect of these payments in the course of 2009. Now, let me conclude, Mr. Speaker. There are some, not everyone in the Opposition - this is not a criticism of everybody - but there are some who have deliberately tried to paint a picture of gloom and doom, that everything is lost; economy is crashing. We were told about two-three months ago that hundreds of thousands of people are going to be on the roads, that GSP Plus will not come; that we will not be able to export our apparel products to Europe. There is nothing staring us in the face except unmitigated darkness. That is a philosophy of pessimism which has been propagated with a vengeance during the last few months. The apparel sector was supposed to come crumbling down like a pack of cards. Nothing of the sort has happened. We were told that the economy is in dire straits; the collapse of the economy is round the corner. Like Mr. Micawber, some people are waiting for these things to happen. Now, certainly from the point of view of the public of this country, it is a great fortune that nothing of the sort has occurred. What is the position with regard to GSP Plus and the apparel sector? Orders are coming in. Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Next - these are the largest companies in the United Kingdom, Intimissimi is one of the largest companies in Italy - they are placing their orders for the Spring purchases. So, those orders are coming in. We have not lost GSP Plus. It is only some",

Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear that under no circumstances are we prepared to sacrifice the dignity, the sovereignty and the independence of this nation. We have made an application for the extension of the GSP Plus benefits and we have indicated to the European Commission that we stand ready and willing at all times to engage in a dialogue with them on any issues that arise from our application. But, we will not submit to an investigation of this country by a foreign power. That is only inconsistent with the inherent dignity of this nation. So, it has been a combination of approaches. But, of course we are engaging with them in a candid dialogue. We are not saying that the door is closed on discussion and it has gone exceedingly well. We have made progress. They understand. They were not born yesterday, Mr. Speaker. They are men and women of the world. They understand the realities of these situations. Diplomatic dialogue is necessary because there are differences. If everybody agreed about everything, there is no need for ambassadors, there is no need for diplomatic relationships. The whole thrust of diplomacy is to enhance common ground, to find consensus, to forge some kind of agreement out of diversity, which is an aspect of the contemporary world. Now, it is a source of great satisfaction to us that the Government has succeeded in that objective. Up to now there has been no problem with regard to GSP Plus; it has not been withheld from us. Equally with regard to the economy the prophets of doom said, Just wait till January, February, March\". Of course this date has kept constantly receding. It goes back every few months. But, today the economy of Sri Lanka is one of the strongest in this area. I am not saying that we are totally unaffected by world conditions. No country can live in isolation. We all suffer from the fallout of the global crisis. But, it is a relative matter, Mr. Speaker. It would be invidious and wrong for me to refer to particular countries in the region. But, there are countries which are facing very serious problems. We have been able, not by coincidence, not gratuitously, but as a result of properly structured policies and vigorous implementation of those policies, to insulate this country from the worst of those consequences. In order to stimulate that effort and to carry it further, the Cabinet of Ministers has come up with this set of proposals which has been characterized as a mini-budget. We rely on all Members of this House and indeed on all persons who love this country to extend to us their unqualified cooperation with regard to the implementation of the proposals that are contained in that package. With those words, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend to this august Assembly, the Orders under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act which I have presented and I would like to assure the House that not only through those two specific Orders but through the entire range of initiatives that we have put in place, we are carrying the economy of this country forward and we",

Mustapha P.C., for the 1st Respondent Ikram Mohamed P.C., for the 3rd Respondent. DECIDED ON : 17th December 2008 Sarath N Silva, C.J. We have heard these applications filed in the public interest and made orders on 28.11.08, 1.12.08. and 15.12.08 The alleged infringement of fundamental rights which deny to the People the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution relate to impugned executive or administrative action in two respects. They are : i) Hedging Agreements that had been entered into by the 3rd Respondent, purportedly on behalf of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC - 2nd Respondent) ; and ii) the price of sale of petroleum products, in particular, of petrol The applications have been filed in the public interest on the basis that the price of sale is not commensurate with world market prices. In that, with the reduction of the world market prices the People have not derived the benefit thereof at the point of sale due to the illegal Hedging Agreements on which over 32 Million US$ had been paid at the time the Applications were filed with a further imminent of US$ 46 Million and a total payment of US$ 675.72 Million for the operative period of 9 months calculated at the price of US$ 50 per barrel and ; the arbitrary and irrational government taxes and levies that have been imposed. We made an interim order on 28.11.2008 suspending payments on the Hedging Agreements for the several reasons that were stated. The Monetary Board being the proper Authority, on whose licence the Banks have been operating was directed to investigate these matters and to take action according to law. In the order of 15.12.2008, considering the submissions made by the Intervenient Petitioners supported by documents that benefits have been provided to the 3rd Respondent, being the former Chairman of the CPC by certain banks involved in the Hedging Agreements, we directed the Monetary Board to investigate these matters with the assistance of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police. The Monetary Board is now directed to refer the results of the investigations to the Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption. The next aspect of the alleged infringement relates to prices. Considering the evidence adduced of the price of petrol in particular being highly excessive, it was decided to lay down a pricing formula to be addressed As a national issue above party politics and the 2nd Petitioner being a Member of Parliament in the Opposition agreed to co-operate in such exercise. Accordingly the Secretary to the Treassury who was present in Court was directed to submit a report on the taxes and levies with the suggested pricing formula. A copy of the Order was sent to the Secretary to His Excellency the President. In the order of 1.12.2008, we set out the 3 components of the pricing formula be considered only with regard to petrol. In the Order of 15.12.2008 having considered the report submitted by the Secretary to the Treasury and submissions of parties we directed that the benchmark figure should be taken at US$ 56.05 per barrel of imported refined petrol. The Secretary was directed to compute a formula on the basis of this benchmark price on the premise that the revenue component would not exceed 100% of the price per litre of imported refined petroleum and of overhead costs. According to the report of the Secretary at the benchmark importation price of 56.05 US$ per barrel the cost of a litre of refined petrol is Rs. 39.06 and the overhead costs and profit margin of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is 9.71 totaling Rs. 48.77. The Current selling price of a litre of petrol is Rs. 122/-. Hence a total of 7 Government and fiscal levies amount to Rs. 73.23. Accordingly, when a consumer purchases a litre of petrol of which the total cost is only Rs. 48.77 he is imfact paying Rs. 73.23 by way of Government taxes and",

Deny to the Petitioners and the People the equal protection of the law and excessive prices have a serious impact on the cost of living hence the Petitioners are entitled to the grant of interim relief Accordingly, we made order on 15.12.2008 that the Secretary to the Treasury should prepare a price formula in terms of which at the benchmark referred above the totality of Government and fiscal levies will not exceed 100% of the cost (i. e. cost of import plus overhead and handling charges) There has been a downward trend of the prices of the petroleum products. In view of the submission of the Secretary to the Treasury that there is a revenue expectation from the sale of petrol and that the formula should not diminish the revenue expectation, we made an order that where the price descends below US$ 56.05 per barrel the reduced amounts be absorbed by way of a customs duty adding to the volume of revenue. On the same besis that where there is an increase of the price from US $ 56.05 upto US$ 100 per barrel, there should be a decrease in government levies coming down to a minimum 75%. Based on the aforesaid directions the Secretary to the Treasury has now tendered two options for the formula to be adopted. Having considered the submissions of counsel, we are of the view that option No. 1 which is annexed marked A to this order would be just and equitable and assure to the People the equal Protection of the law. The Secretary has recommended that Government and fiscal levies be reduced to three instead of the previously applicable six. On the basis of the formula only following Government and fiscal levies would be imposed. (i) Excise duty Rs. 40/- per litre which would remain constant : (ii) An effective customs duty of Rs. 30/- per litre which would be adjusted by waivers being granted depending on the imported cost of a barrel of petrol taking the benchmark at US$ 56/05 per barrel. Annex A sets out the particulars of the price formula that would be applicable. Secretary to the Treasury submitted that there would be an undue reduction in the Government revenue as a result of this formula. On the other hand the Petitioners contend that since Government revenue would not descend below 75%, when the cost per barrel goes upto 100 Dollars the Price per litre would be as high as Rs. 142/- Per litre. We are of the view what whilst there is some degree of merit in both contentions the formula at annex A adequately meets the requirements and would be reasonable as well as equitable considering the interests of revenue as well as the aspect of the consumer. The Secretarys Submission that there has been a high expectation of revenue from sale of petroleum is not well founded According to the chart given in page 6 of his Report the percentage of taxes in relation to the total petroleum bill is as follows : 2003 - 39.23%; 2004 - 27.58%; 2005 - 19.52%; 2006 - 14.11%; 2007 - 13.89%; 2008 till September 8.7%. Hence the Estimates for the year 2009 could not have been prepared on a revenue estimates significantly higher than 8.7. The presently applicable rate of 180% on the sale of petrol would have been way beyond any reasonable expectation. That has become possible only because of the downward trend of world prices and most importantly due to the interim relief staying the prime facie illegal Hedging Agreements being the executive action which infringed the fundamental rights of the People. Hence it is just and equitable that the People should derive the benefit of the interim order they secured from Court. 6 - PL 003656 - (2009/02)",

An adjustment of the Excise Duty, Customs Duty, Port and Aviation Levy (P.A.L.) being an increase, should be effected in terms of Annex A in the manner suggested by the Secretary. As noted above the imposition of the Excise Duty in terms of Section 3(1) of Act No. 13 of 1989 and the imposition of Customs Duties and the grant of partial waivers as stated in Annex A in terms of Section 10A and 19A of the Customs Ordinance, are executive functions that come within the purview of the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court. The alleged infringements result from illegal arbitrary and unreasonable executive action. The Secretary being the appropriate functionary and the Attorney General who represents the President in terms of Article 35(3) of the Constitution have been heard on the several days this matter was considered. Accordingly we direct that necessary orders be made in terms of the applicable law to give effect to the content of Annex A which has been prepared by the Secretary to the Treasury. A submission was made that the difference in price between the superior grades of petrol that is 95 octane and other superior grades and the ordinary rate of petrol is unreasonable. The Secretary to the Treasury is authorized to obtain the necessary particulars from the CPC and LIOC and to make a sutiable direction as regards the difference in the prices be levied in the aspect of the superior grades of petrol. Once that direction is made it should be notigfied to the CPC and the LIOC who would be bound to comply with it and adjust prices accordingly.",

A submission was also made when the percentage of tax operative at 100% goes up due to lowering of prices from the benchmark price the excess revenue beyond 100% should be credited to a stabilization Fund. We are of the view that this is a suggestion to which the Secretary to the Treasury was in agreement is reasonable since such funds would be a useful source to meet with Government expenditure where assistance is required for different aspects of the economy. Accordingly the Secretary is directed to make necessary arrangements to have such amounts credited to a Stabilization Fund to be used on the basis of the direction given by Government.
