. . . . ? , - - , . . . , . ? , , , ? ? ? ? . Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in fact I want to address this House on some salient features in regard to our current engagement in the post-conflict scenario. In that context, may I seek your indulgence to come out with a detailed account in response to the statement that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition made today in the House about the GSP issue. I would like to cover all these aspects. Also there were other developments with the United States of America where there was a statement made by the Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton on Sri Lanka and also the other areas that we are currently engaged in addressing the critical issues that concern the country as one country in the post-conflict scenario. After 30 long years of unbridled terror, as we are aware, our valiant forces have neutralized what is quite accurately described as the most ruthless terror outfit the world has ever known. Over the years, the people of this country have withstood with great resilience this terror and the threat posed to our domocratic way of life. The events of the last three years, especially the period leading up to the proclamation of defeating terrorism, will be acclaimed widely as a singularly exemplary achievement in the annals of both the countrys and the world's history. No community, political party, social strata or religious group in our multi-ethnic, plural society were spared by this terror. Today, Sri Lankas successful

defeat of terrorism has provided the surest opportunity for the establishment of a permanent and durable peace in this country, which the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa is pursuing with vigour. Having achieved this monumental task, there are still some critical challenges this country faces presently in the post-conflict scenario. After some three decades of wanton destruction, the resettlement and rehabilitation processes concomitant to achieving peace, present some of the most critical challenges this country has faced in our recent history. Relief to the internally displaced is top-most. We are extremely aware that it serves the Government immensely to see an end to the presence of the internally displaced in the welfare villages. There is simply no question - resettlement is the Governments foremost priority. Last month, some important developments have taken place with regard to our engagement on these issues with members of the international community, on which I wish to brief this House. I had the opportunity on the sidelines of the 64th session of the UN General Assembly to engage some key members of the international community, and brief them one-on-one on the constantly-evolving situation on ground in the North of Sri Lanka. As this House is aware, there has been unparalleled emphasis and attention on the Government to overcome some of the key challenges in the areas of re-settlement and rehabilitation of the IDPs and parallely envisioning the future livelihood and sustenance of the people most affected by the conflict. Much has been done, but it seems to go unnoticed by the international community for whatever reason.

During my interactions with several countries in the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, I sought to provide a briefing to lead to a greater understanding on Sri Lankas grapple domestically on the post-conflict challenges. My interactions also included some regional players as well as development agencies and humanitarian organizations. These included substantive discussions with my counterparts from Jordan, Denmark, Australia, India, Fiji, Portugal, Austria, Spain, Morocco, Turkey, Cuba, France, UK, Oman, High Officials of the UN, Secretary-General of the EU Council, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Deputy Foreign Minister of Czech, President of the ICRC among others.

There was appreciation of the steady progress made with regard to the conditions in the IDP welfare villages, and resettlement of IDPs as having commenced, with the progressive current returns to Jaffna, Mannar and the Eastern Province. Dismissing the misconceptions of the so called internment camps, I briefed my interlocutors on the several initiatives taken to provide freedom of movement for special needs such as weddings, visits to local banks outside the facilities; go and see visits of

[ ]

2009 08 125 126

their intended places of residence which are being conditioned for resettlement and day-passes being issued. I impressed on them that such terms as internment camps as propounded by anti Sri Lanka lobbyists were erroneous and unfounded. It was explained to them that having received only a disappointing 2,000 applications for the host family programme which provides certain categories of persons to be hosted by families outside the facilities, I informed of our desire to have a broader, more intensive campaign to have a more positive response. Another notification to serve this end is under preparation. Further, I referred to the partnership we have with the 54 humanitarian organizations working in the North and the needs based access accorded to them to provide for the people in the IDP welfare facilities.

On the target being worked towards resettlement, I shared the difficulties such as the paucity of adequate equipment for de-mining whilst having trained personnel. I emphasized that this had a direct impact on the speed of resettlement and that if the Government had the necessary equipment, this process would be quickened or accelerated.

Whilst articulating the firm commitment of the Government to address these issues of critical concern which our people in the IDP camps are currently facing, I made a strong appeal to my interlocutors for tangible assistance for the rehabilitation and resettlement processes including permanent shelter and livelihood programmes so that these Sri Lankans too will be helped to have the rightful opportunity to rebuild their lives.

From our perspective, some members of the international community have taken unfairly critical postures on Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the neutralization of the terrorists. While there has been broad appreciation of the magnanimous efforts made by Sri Lanka in overcoming some of the post-conflict challenges, there are sadly others who, for some indiscernible reason, continue to have a skewed perception of what really has been achieved and what is continuing to be achieved in Sri Lanka on ground. While some of them have yielded to reason, balance and fairness, others - and I do not propose to name them in this House - choose to ignore that achievement and unduly pressurize the Government to work at their pace and behest.

This, I believe, causes constriction of the space Government needs in servicing the requirements for post-conflict development.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . However, as responsible members of the global community and founded on our traditional foreign policy values of engagement, we must and we will continue to engage even those who entertain these distorted perceptions. I believe that the day will not be far away when they too will join hands with us in tangible ways, to address the very issues which mutually concern us. Constructive engagement on related issues rather than chiding and imposing unrealistic conditions, which exacerbates scepticism, is in my view, the way to move forward together in equal partnership.

I also wish to refer to the incident which occurred last Friday concerning the Sri Lanka High Commission in New Delhi where a group of protesters forcibly entered and caused some damage to the High Commission premises. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka High Commission in New Delhi made representations to the Indian Government.

The Indian External Affairs Ministry whereupon issued a statement deeply regretting the unfortunate incident and subsequently that evening, the Indian Minister for External Affairs, His Excellency S.M. Krishna initiated a telephone call to me informing that immediate steps had been taken to strengthen security at the High Commission and that action will be taken against the perpetrators. He emphasized that the incident is contrary to the co-operative relationship that exists between the two countries and certainly is not a reflection on the close and warm bilateral friendship that exists between India and Sri Lanka. In keeping to his word, a police team is being sent to Tamil Nadu to pursue the offenders with a view to their arrest and the security for the Sri Lanka High Commission in New Delhi has been further strengthened. I appreciate the efforts of the Indian Government in this connection. I am confident that all necessary steps are being taken by the Indian Government to deal with the matter adequately. Let me emphasize here that Indo-Sri Lanka relations have reached an unparalleled maturity. I wish to assure this House that incidents of such nature will not detract from or strain the warm, abiding friendship which exists between the two countries.

As this House is aware, much to the discomfiture of Sri Lanka, the European Union proposed an investigation to precede the extension of the GSP Plus trade facility, citing initially inadequate implementation of three conventions, namely the Convention Against Torture - CAT - the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the ICCPR. Consequently, there have been suggestions in the public domain that the GSP Plus facility for Sri Lanka may be withdrawn.

127 128

The Government did not accept the process of a GSP Plus investigation and in this context, also a request for experts to visit Sri Lanka, as it was felt inappropriate, the basis being that the Government is not willing to compromise on Sri Lankas sovereignty with the intrusive procedure of an investigation. The Government, therefore, has not involved itself in any procedure which has even a hint of an investigation process. While we have stood our ground that Sri Lankas sovereignty will not be compromised, we have continued to engage the European Commission on the relevant human rights conventions and concerns through meetings at ministerial and senior officials levels, both in Brussels and Colombo, by providing material which demonstrates Sri Lankas compliance with these conventions, refuted unfounded allegations and by the provision of periodic reviews to the UN bodies which monitor the implementation of these conventions, which become public in time.

Signalling the importance the Government places on the GSP Plus issue and the seriousness with which we are addressing it, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed a ministerial level committee to oversee matters relating to our engagement with the European Union. Guided by this committee comprising the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon. Milinda Moragoda and myself, we have considered ways and means to intensify our efforts and engagement with the European Union to secure the facility. I wish to inform this House that the issue of the GSP Plus facility featured prominently in my discussions in New York with my European counterparts. There was direct sympathy and understanding on our position on the part of some quarters of the EU Member States. Undoubtedly, Sri Lanka and the EU still have more to do on this score in order to have a mutually acceptable position. The Government is confident that our transparent, open engagement with the European Union has facilitated a higher level of understanding on both sides. We are also confident that the EU will yield to reason and believe that this transparent engagement will lead to a more informed position on the issues faced by Sri Lanka. This important process of engagement will, undoubtedly, facilitate a positive decision on the part of the EU to continue with the GSP Plus facility for Sri Lanka. Let me reassure this House, as we have done before, that every effort is being made by the Government to secure this facility and I am confident that the outcome will be favourable. During my visit to New York, I also had the opportunity to engage more -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) -

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . . I engaged more closely with my counterparts from the Commonwealth countries and also the other relevant organizations associated with assisting Sri Lanka in our post-conflict scenario and we have made our presence known in the most appealing manner in terms of the post-conflict scenario whilst, at the same time, engaging widely with the international community. I also want to bring to the notice of this House that soon we will be hosting the Ministerial Meeting of the Asia Co-operation Dialogue, the ACD, comprising 31 countries, which Sri Lanka will be chairing on the 14th and the 15th of this month. That itself shows the reflection of the international community in looking at Sri Lanka as a centre-point in terms of future development both in Asia and in the global context. I also must bring to the notice of this House the inaccurate references made by the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton, that rape was used as a tactic of war in Sri Lanka, in her opening remarks in connection with the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution to Combat Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict. Naturally, we were disturbed by such unsubstantial allegations and I summoned the US Ambassador in Colombo and handed over an Aide Memoire to be submitted to the US Government. In the Aide Memoire, I categorically denied the allegations and stressed that the members of the armed forces maintain the highest level of discipline and such allegations would have been due to false and malicious anti-Sri Lanka propaganda. I requested for the retraction of the reference to Sri Lanka in that statement. I am pleased to inform this House that the US State Department has responded to me by a letter stating, We have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in the proper context. I also want to bring to the notice of this House the irresponsible statements that are getting circulated. This is very important. Today, the Hon Prime Minister has been quoted in a website as casting some aspersions on the Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton. I have consulted the Hon. Prime Minister and I wish to state right here before this House that those aspersions have been misconstrued and the Prime Minister has not cast any aspersions on the conduct of former President Clinton in any manner. I would like this to be placed on record because the irresponsible media circulations could unnecessarily dampen our good relations with countries, especially with the United States, with which we have the best of relations and we hope to continue the co-operation between the two countries.

I thank you, Sir.

[. . 12.29] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to follow the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama. I must say, Sir, that in the course of his speech, he endeavoured to explain in some way the relationship that Sri Lanka has with the international community generally and also made specific reference to some countries. I do not wish to go into Sri Lankas relationship generally with the international community, but I shall, Sir, in the course of my speech today, be dealing primarily with the situation that prevails in regard to the IDPs and I propose to confine myself to the IDPs only in Vavuniya, who have now been transferred to Jaffna, Trincomalee and so on. Though there are several other concerns in regard to the North-East, indeed very major concerns, I think the position of the IDPs is so desperate, particularly with the possibility of the monsoon setting in very shortly in the course of the coming days and getting worse in the months of November and December. I think I need to concentrate, Sir, on the IDPs' situation, particularly in Vavuniya and also, while so doing, I would make reference to the role that the International Community has been endeavouring to play in regard to some matters pertaining to the IDPs. It would seem to me, Sir, that the Government has not been able to utilize the possibilities of being aided by the international community in a very practical way to alleviate the sufferings of the IDPs and in order to resettle them and rehabilitate them. The primary cause for the delay, Sir, in the resettlement of the IDPs, it would appear, is this question of de-mining. Whatever one might have to say, of approximately 280,000 IDPs, up to now I do not think not more than 25,000 or 30,000 people have left the camps. The main reason for this delay appears to be the question of de-mining which unfortunately is painfully slow, and it would be my submission, that all assistance in regard to de-mining has not been utilized by the Government. In fact, the Government has shown a reluctance to permit others to de-mine in certain areas; particularly in the Kilinochchi and the Mullaitivu Districts. I must confess that we play no direct role in regard to the question of the IDPs because we have no access to the IDP camps though we are Members of Parliament. Many of our Members of Parliament do represent these IDPs in this House and have been elected to represent them in this House, but we have no access to these camps. It would appear, Sir, according to the information that we have been able to gather, that there were several teams representing the international community- the Danish team, the Swiss team, the Australian team, the Japanese team, the American team and in fact the HALO Trust - who were all offering to play a role in the de-mining themselves, using their

personnel and their equipment. But, unfortunately, because of the Governments reluctance to permit outsiders, others, to go into certain areas and do the de-mining in those areas by themselves, the Government has not been in a position to utilize these teams to carry out that work. This is so unfortunate. This has resulted in immense delay. The Government desires to use only the armed forces to de-mine in some of these areas, particularly Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. As a matter of fact, de-mining in those areas, in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, had not commenced until about late September. In the months of June, July, August and in a good part of the month of September it would appear that de-mining in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu had not commenced. According to the information that we recently had, that has only now partially commenced in some parts of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu where the Government Armed Forces are involved. I believe the HALO Trust has also gone into Mullaitivu in some small way. It is indeed very sad that all the assistance that was available to expeditiously carry on the de-mining in these areas has not been utilized by the Government effectively and efficiently to complete the de-mining process so as to enable the people to be resettled in those areas. It would appear to me Sir, and I think the time has come for us to state quite publicly and raise the question with the Government, why the Government has been reluctant to employ these foreign teams to work in some of these areas. The first reason, in my submission, Sir, it would appear to me, is the possibility of evidence emanating of the massacres of civilians in these areas when de-mining is done by outsiders. In fact, if such evidence becomes available about the massacres of a large number of civilians in these areas, then there could be some consequences of those discoveries. I think it is my duty to raise this question on the Floor of this House, that the Governments reluctance to de-mining in some of these areas, particularly in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, has been for this particular reason that I just mentioned. The second reason, Sir, which occurs to me, and which I think I must also mention - in fact I raised this matter with His Excellency the President when we met him on the 7th of September and also referred to it in the course of my earlier speeches in this House - are the activities that are being carried on in these areas to promote majoritarian ethnic and religious interests in these areas and the possibility of these matters becoming a matter of public knowledge if others were to go into these areas and engage in de-mining. Now, Sir, it would be my submission, very respectfully, that if there has been a delay in de-mining in these areas for these reasons, that must be considered as

131 132

extremely unfair and extremely unjust by the large number of IDPs who are languishing and suffering in what everybody has today come to accept as not "relief centres", but instead "internment camps". After all, Sir, what is the need for such a lack of transparency, for all the activities in these areas to be shrouded in a veil of secrecy? What is the need? We need to ask that question. There is secrecy to an extent where even the Members of Parliament of the Vanni, elected by those very people, cannot go and work in those areas, cannot go into those camps, cannot meet the people. Even the voluntary organizations working in these areas are unable to converse with the people. That is the position. So, Sir, even if one looks at the totality of this situation, one cannot but come to the conclusion that there has been some very compelling reasons for all the secrecy that has been sustained thus far and those reasons as far as I can visualize must be the reasons that I have just mentioned. I want to mention something further, Sir, in regard to this question of de-mining. I have been talking to several knowledgeable people on de-mining and it would appear to me that the normal procedure in regard to de-mining is not being observed. The normal procedure in regard to de-mining is that surveys are carried out to demarcate areas which have been mined and also demarcate areas which have not been mined. Once the surveys are done and the areas which have not been mined have been demarcated, all activities in those areas can commence. People can be resettled; people can be rehabilitated; employment can commence and people can lead normal lives. The areas which have been demarcated as mined are left aside until the de-mining is over. On the contrary, what the Government is engaged in doing, I am informed, is taking up the position that every bit of land must be de-mined and as a result of the Government taking this position of trying to de-mine the whole area without carrying out a survey and demarcating the mined areas and areas which have not been mined, there has been a colossal delay in the execution of this task. In fact, somebody was telling me, Sir, that even in Cambodia, de-mining is being done even today. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)

In Vietnam also. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) De-mining is still being done in Vietnam also. But, people have been resettled; people have been rehabilitated and normal activities have commenced many, many years ago. That is because the survey has been done and the areas which have been mined and the areas which have not been mined have been demarcated.

The second matter, Sir, which I think has been causing some delay in regard to the resettlement of the IDPs is this so-called "screening". Off and on, I find Ministers also talking about this and the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister, has come out with some very disingenuous statements on the question of screening. It appears to me, Sir, that a large number of persons have in fact been screened and they have been cleared as having no links with the LTTE and that they are being looked upon as normal citizens. In fact, I would like to read an article written by Mr. Jehan Perera, one of our much reputed columnists, appearing in "The Island" newspaper of 6th of October, 2009. One of the positive things is, he states, I quote: the screening of about 150,000 of the approximately 250,000 persons still confined to the welfare camps. This means that these people have been cleared by the military authorities of connections with the LTTE and who ought to be permitted freedom of movement, as in the case of ordinary citizens of the country. If 150,000 people, Sir, have been screened and if they have been cleared of involvement with the LTTE, then I want to ask as to why these people cannot be released. You surely must release them. I want to very clearly state, Sir, that the Government confining these people in camps in this way without their consent amounts to wrongful restraint and wrongful confinement and it is a criminal offence under the Penal Code. You cannot restrain the freedom of people who are not required by you for any offence in this way and when you restrain them in this way and keep them confined in this way, it is clearly an offence under the Penal Code of both wrongful restraint and wrongful confinement. In fact, I might refer to a statement that has been issued recently by the UN Secretary-Generals Special Representative on the Human Rights of the IDPs, Walter Kaelin. When he was in Sri Lanka recently, he went to Vanni and after he concluded his visit, he issued a statement and I want to quote from that statement to demonstrate what I just said.

, , (.) . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. (VEN.) UDAWATTE NANDA THERO took the Chair. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Venerable Presiding Member, this is what he said in his statement. The "Daily Mirror" newspaper of 1st October, 2009 states, I quote: According to international law, legitimate and imperative security concerns may justify the internment of civilians during the height of a conflict, but it must not last longer than absolutely necessary to respond to these security concerns. Internment decisions must further be made on an individual rather than a group basis. Those who are not released must be informed about the reasons on an individual basis and be given a genuine opportunity to have the decision reviewed by an independent body. Here, what have you done? You have taken tens of thousands of unarmed, non-combatant innocent Tamil civilians and incarcerated them; you are holding them in custody. You have no right to do that. In fact, this gentleman, Mr. Walter Kaelin goes on and suggests parallel options of return to homes, to host families and open relief centres in transit areas. He is saying that you cannot violate the international law in this way. When the Minister was speaking, he mentioned about the international community passing strictures on this Government and on this country. I am not for a moment happy about that. But, I want to say that when you keep repeatedly violating international humanitarian laws and international human rights laws, what else do you expect to receive, particularly when you desperately need assistance; they naturally pass strictures. So, this is the position that even he has suggested and in this context before I go any further, I think I must also read out a statement that has been issued by five political parties signed by Mr. V. Anandasangaree, Leader of the TULF, the Hon. Mano Ganesan, Leader of the DPF, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Leader of the SLMC, Dr. K. Vigneswaran, Leader of the AITUF and myself as the Parliamentary Group Leader of the ITAK and the TNA. We have stated - I want to just read this part and I would table* this statement and ask that it be included in Hansard at the end of my speech. I quote : "We state that the forcible detention of hundreds of thousands of Tamil citizens of Sri Lanka in camps for Internally Displaced Persons is illegal, without basis in the Constitution and in gross violation of international human rights norms.

These people should be released immediately to return to their homes and permitted to resume without hindrance their traditional livelihood activities such as farming and fishing, or to take up residence with friends and relatives, or to exercise their lawful right to abode elsewhere at their discretion. Those likely to face criminal charges should be produced in a court of law without further delay. We strongly urge that the camps, for so long as they exist, should be open to relatives, religious functionaries, parliamentarians, provincial councillors, civil society, UN agencies, journalists, and national and international aid and humanitarian organisations. We urge that immediate arrangements be made to allow the Muslim people who were evicted from the North and have suffered acute hardships for nearly two decades to return to their homes and to resume their economic and social activities without hindrance. Similar arrangements must be made to re-settle in their original homes all those in the East, who remain displaced and continue to suffer greatly." This is the statement, Venerable Presiding Member, signed by five political parties representing the Tamil-speaking people; both the Tamil and the Muslim peoples. Does the Government pay any heed to appeals made by persons who have a right to speak on behalf of these people? We consider it very sad that when we make these appeals, they fall on deaf ears and you keep violating international law and when strictures are passed on you by persons who are concerned about your violations, you complain. You sometimes even abuse them. I do not think this is the way to go. I would respectfully request that this statement be tabled. I table* this statement and I would like it to be included in Hansard at the end of my speech. Now, Venerable Presiding Member, when the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services was speaking this morning, he answered a question I asked him; whether all the persons in Vavuniya, presently in these camps would be resettled in their lands in their respective districts from which they were displaced, he was very positive in his answer and he said Definitely yes, they need not have any doubt about it". But, I am a little concerned about what Mr. Jehan Perera, the reputed columnist, a fairly well-informed columnist, who, I think has information from various sources, has stated in his article that due to security concerns, about 30 per cent of the IDPs may not be resettled in their original areas. Taking the entire IDPs into account, 30 per cent of the IDPs will be something like 80,000 to 90,000 people. They would not be resettled in their original areas. That is a disturbing thing. Why should this happen? Why should 30 per cent not be resettled for security reasons? When we had a meeting with His Excellency the President, a meeting which lasted for two and a half hours, from 5 p.m. to 7.30 p.m., we discussed the question

* . . Produced at end of speech.

* . . Produced at end of speech.

135 136

of resettlement and rehabilitation at great length and there was His Excellency the Presidents Senior Adviser, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament who was also present and various things were explained to us. Nobody ever told us that there will be some people who will not be resettled in their original lands. The entire discussion proceeded on the basis that everybody will be resettled in the lands from which they were displaced. In fact, I must mention that I raised this question in Parliament when this Adjournment Debate came up on the 22nd of July, 2009. I was very concerned about this question and in fact the question I raised is contained in Column 288 of the Hansard of 22nd of July, 2009. It states, I quote : I want to deal with certain fundamental questions relating to the future of these people. These people, in my respectful submission, need to be resettled at the earliest and they need to be resettled in the lands from which they were displaced. People have been displaced in Mannar, from Vavuniya, from Kilinochchi and from Mullaitivu. All the displaced people must be resettled in the lands from which they were displaced in their respective districts. That is fundamental. This is what I said. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister and Leader of the House, who replied to me in the course of that Debate had this to say in answer to me which is in Column 331 of the Hansard of 22nd of July, 2009. He spoke in Sinhala and this is exactly what he said in Sinhala. It states, I quote :

" ." which means in English that "all people will be definitely resettled on the lands originally occupied by them". That was the position of the Hon. Minister when he replied me in Parliament on the 22nd of July, 2009 and the Ministers reply is contained in Column 331 of the Hansard of that date. That position has been confirmed by the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services today. But, Mr. Jehan Perera, who is a well-informed and reputed columnist raises this point of view: Is there some difference in thinking between the Government, the civilian administration and the military authorities, in regard to this matter? That is the question, Venerable Presiding Member, which, I think in the interests of our people has to be raised on the Floor of this House. Does what Mr. Jehan Perera has stated in this article reflect the thinking of the military? And, if that be so, is it not the duty of the Government to make it very clear to the country by a positive statement on the Floor of the House today, in the course of this Debate, at some point of time, confirming the statements of both the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister and the Leader of

the House, and the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister, this morning that the people will in fact be resettled on the lands from which they were displaced in their different respective districts. We are concerned about this because we know that there has been some talk of people not being settled in Mullaitivu. We know that there has been some talk of people not being settled on the East of the A-9 highway, which means that they will not be resettled in Mullaitivu and in that part of the Kilinochchi District on the East of the A-9 highway. So, we are concerned about this and if it is going to be non-resettlement of only people from a particular area, then it would not be 30 per cent of the total IDPs but at least 50 to 60 per cent of the IDPs from that particular area and that would be totally unacceptable. These are lands on which these people lived for centuries and for generations where they have not merely resided, but where they have carried on their occupation, their farming, their industries, their animal husbandry and they must return to these lands, re-commence their lives and be rehabilitated. The Government said that you were liberating them. If you were liberating them and if you have liberated them, then they must at least go back as liberated people to the lands from where they were liberated. That is their fundamental right and I want to make it very clear that the Government must not leave room for any doubt in regard to this question and we would insist that the Government comes very clean on this question and make it very clear that Mr. Jehan Perera is wrong; he has been misinformed and that the Governments position is as stated on the Floor of this House both by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister and Leader of the House and by the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister. Now, Venerable Presiding Member, what is happening to people who have been taken out? Some people have been taken to Jaffna. Some people have been taken to Trincomalee. The people who were brought to Trincomalee are being kept at the Sembaha Tamil Mahavidyalam at Eachchalanpattu, Tampalakamam Tamil Mahavidyalam at Tampalakamam, Mathummai Ammal Tamil Vidyalam at Allesthottam and the Kuchchaveli Tamil Mahavidyalam at Kuchchaveli - where the conditions, I am told, are even worse than the conditions in Vanni. Nobody can go and see them. No access to them. Nobody can give them anything. Friends and relatives are keen to go and help them, give them food, give them some help, give them some milk food. But, no, they cannot go. They are locked up in these buildings, and I am told that the assistance being rendered to the people in these areas is even worse than the position that prevails in Vanni. So, I do not know, Venerable Presiding Member, as to why you are doing this to us. Are you doing this to us because we are Tamil people? Are you not engaged in a policy of oppressing the Tamil people to such a degree that you are even compelling them to flee the country? Is

[ . ]

2009 08 137 138

this fair? Now, even people are taken out of Vavuniya; they have been cleared obviously, no further screening is required. They cannot even join their friends and relatives in Trincomalee or in Jaffna; they cannot be seen by anybody. I think the Government is totally unprepared and ill-equipped to undertake this programme and these hapless Tamil civilians are being kept under army occupation and are being oppressed. Are we not entitled to live like equal citizens in this country? We are obviously not entitled to, Venerable Presiding Member. That is the only conclusion one can come to from the way our people are being treated. I want to refer, Venerable Presiding Member, to the shooting incident that happened in the Vavuniya Camp some days ago. People were not being given cooked food. They have to cook their own food and for that they need firewood. They did not have firewood and they went to some adjoining camp or adjoining area to collect firewood for the cooking. When they returned, the army confronted them and challenged them for having left their camps without permission or authority and they were fired at. Unarmed, innocent Tamil civilians, men, women and children who went to collect firewood and came back with firewood to cook their meals were fired at. I saw a report in the newspaper that somebody tried to throw a grenade and that is why the firing took place. I do not have to talk much about that. But, this is the way you treat our people. On the one hand, it clearly indicates the state of exasperation, the state of desperation in which the Tamil people in these camps are. On the other, it indicates the animosity that the Sri Lankan Armed Forces bear towards innocent Tamil people when they seek to assert their legitimate rights. If we are prepared to kowtow and acknowledge the second-class citizenship, we will not be shot at. Well, if you say, I want to cook my food, I am entitled to collect my firewood, come back and cook my food you will be fired at. Therefore it clearly indicates, Venerable Presiding Member, that the Tamil civilians in this country are indeed being treated as second-class citizens, and for how long, may I ask, must this continue and for how long can this continue? You deny us our right to internal self-determination in the areas of our historical habitation. That is all that we want. We want regional autonomy and self-rule in our areas which you cannot give us. You deny that to us. And, then you keep us locked up in internment camps, deny all movement to us, there is no freedom of movement; people cannot see us; people cannot meet us, people cannot help us; we cannot give any information to anybody; we cannot talk to anybody. It is worse than being kept in a prison. It is much worse than being kept in the Welikada jail. And, when we try to go even to collect some firewood, you shoot at us. Little infants were injured and one infant was transferred to the Vavuniya Hospital, consequent to serious injuries that the child sustained. If this is not oppression by your Government and by your armed forces what else can oppression be?

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Venerable Presiding Member, I believe I started at 12.30 p.m. Okay, I would not take much time. When we met the President on the 7th of September, one of the matters we raised with His Excellency the President and the Government was that the Government must publish a list of all the persons detained particularly after 1st of January 2009, when the people started coming out of the conflict zone into the Government-controlled territory. And, when the people came out of the conflict zone into the Government controlled territory, some of them were taken into custody, and I believe the figure is as large as 10,000 to 15,000. The figure I am told of the people who were taken out is as large as between 10,000 and 15,000. They were taken into custody as they came out of the conflict zone into the Government controlled territory. They were taken into custody at Kilinochchi, where the original screening took place. They were taken into custody at Omanthai which is a checkpoint and they were taken into custody from the camps in which they were housed. Nobody knows where these people are. Nobody has a list of these people. The next of kin, the parents, the families are concerned about them; they want to find out. We spoke to His Excellency the President and the Government and we urged them to come up with the list of persons who have been detained, so that everybody will know what has happened to these people and where they are being kept. I am sorry that up to date this has not been done. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I am finishing in two minutes. I started at 12.25 p.m. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Okay, I am finishing up, Venerable Presiding Member. So this list must be made available and the next of kin who are suffering, who are agonizing over the fact that their dear ones have gone missing, must know where these people are and that information must be made public. I want to make that request on the Floor of this House.

And, before I conclude, one last thing; a few words. What happened to the ship called, "Captain Ali? There was a ship sent to Sri Lanka with a whole lot of goods for the displaced people; 800 tons of goods for these internally displaced people, from their friends and relatives in various parts of Europe. The Sri Lankan Government initially sent it back. They could have taken that and given it to these people. Then, subsequently the Indian Government took charge of it and gave it to the Sri Lankan Government and told the Sri Lankan Government to kindly distribute it to the IDPs. For the past several months, it has not been done. People are starving in the camps. People have no food. People have no medicine. Children have no milk food. But, various things, a shipload of things that have come are in the custody of the Sri Lankan Government and the Sri Lankan Government is not taking any expeditious action to have these goods distributed to these people. I think this is extremely unfair. It shows how insensitive the Sri Lankan Government is to the hardships and sufferings of our Tamil people and I want to make an appeal to the Government, at least now to ensure that the goods in this ship are delivered to these people at the earliest. I thank you, Venerable Presiding Member.

: : Document tabled: Let Our People free! The Tamil speaking peoples of Sri Lanka have suffered great hardships for many decades since Independence. They have faced discrimination and had to suffer ethnic riots, pogroms and ethnic cleansing; in the pogrom in 1983 sections of the state were involved. In the last thirty four years Sri Lanka was consumed by an ethnic civil war in which the Tamil and Muslim people and others in the North and East and elsewhere were victims. The Tamils in particular bore the brunt of the suffering. During the last stages of the war the people of the Vanni suffered traumatic pain which, despite the conclusive end of the war, has still not abated. While we are deeply concerned about the human rights violations everywhere in our island such as death threats, the killing of civilians, and the disappearance of journalists and others, we feel the need to prioritise in this communiqu such collective and unbearable pain of large numbers of our population as compels immediate intervention. We the undersigned affirm the following and call for an immediate end to these intolerable conditions, and in particular: We state that the forcible detention of hundreds of thousands of Tamil citizens of Sri Lanka in camps for Internally Displaced Persons is illegal, without basis in the Constitution and in gross violation of international human rights norms. These people should be released immediately to return to their homes and permitted to resume without hindrance their traditional livelihood activities such as farming and fishing, or to take up residence with friends and relatives, or to exercise their lawful right to abode elsewhere at their discretion. Those likely to face criminal charges should be produced in a court of law without further delay. We strongly urge that the camps, for so long as they exist, should be open to relatives, religious functionaries, parliamentarians, provincial councillors, civil society, UN agencies, journalists, and national and international aid and humanitarian organisations.

We urge that immediate arrangements be made to allow the Muslim people who were evicted from the North and have suffered acute hardships for nearly two decades to return to their homes and to resume their economic and social activities without hindrance. Similar arrangements must be made to re-settle in their original homes all those in the East, who remain displaced and continue to suffer greatly. The restrictions on movement in and out of the Northern Province and some locations in the East should be lifted and the need for permits to enter or leave should be rescinded forthwith. In particular, any form of quarantine of the Northern Province is a violation of basic rights and should be lifted. The curfew and other restrictions on normality in many parts of the Northern Province and elsewhere are unjustified and we demand that normality be returned without delay. People in certain parts of the country live in fear, avoid even essential travel, and are inhibited in employment related and social activities. We call for an end to military administration and restrictions placed on civilians, and we urge the restoration of full civilian administration to facilitate return to economic and social normality.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Venerable Presiding Member, when we continue to debate the extension of the state of Emergency, it becomes my duty, as a Representative of the Muslim people of this country, to keep reminding this House and the country of the plight of the forgotten IDPs of the Northern Province. We all know that way back in 1990, we had over 63,000 Muslims of the Northern Province being ethnically cleansed from their villages and asked to vacate within a period of few hours. Now, with the end of the conflict or the war - I believe the conflict is still on and therefore, I would say the end of the war - these people are still living in squalor in the camps they occupied or they have been occupying for the last 19 years. The Government came up with a resettlement plan of 180 days and unfortunately, these people were not included in the exercise. I am told that now there is a very elaborate document that is being circulated among international agencies, seeking funds for rehabilitation, which, I believe this House has not seen, where again these people have been ignored. We know that if we need permanent peace in this country, all citizens of this country should feel that they are equal and that they are being treated equally. Unfortunately, the exercises that this Government has undertaken under the rehabilitation process have had no consistency. We have had a lot of political show being conducted while materially, very little was being done to ensure that the people of the North were duly resettled in their places of original habitation. We know that the people of the Mannar District are now mostly living in the Puttlam District and for them to go to Mannar right now, they have to spend approximately Rs. 1,300 and over seven hours on the road through Anuradhapura. If the Puttalam - Mannar Road, the coastal access road which they had been using for centuries, is re-opened, this journey could be made at the cost of Rs. 150 and in a matter of two hours. So, why is it that after so many months of liberation, we are still unable to give these people access to their places of original habitation? If we continue to delay this, if we continue to keep these people in the camps, if we do not allow them to go back to where they originally came from, we really cannot call them IDPs because IDPs are people who have been forced out of their places of habitation for no fault of theirs, who have been compelled to leave. If we say that today this country has come back to normalcy, then these people should have the freedom to go back to where they came from. In Jaffna we have had an election to the Local Authority or the Municipality. We have peoples representatives who have been chosen by the people but, they have no people to represent because the majority of

187 188

them are living in other districts. If Jaffna is normal and if the Municipal Council Election could have been held, then the people of Jaffna should have settled or should be able to go and settle in their own places. But, that is not permitted and they are still living in Puttalam; they are living in Anuradhapura; they are living in Negombo, they are living in Panadura and elsewhere. But, they have their representatives elected to the Municipality of Jaffna. This is the sad plight.

Now, if we want the world to believe that we are reaching normalcy then every action of ours should confirm that. We go around canvassing for support for the rehabilitation process with an elaborate 112-page document which this House has not seen and which has excluded over 70,000 - 80,000 Muslims who were expelled from the North. Now, His Excellency is on record saying that he will ensure that these people are resettled the way the Muslims of the East were resettled. We believe him. But, he has also stated that the more pressing problem is the current IDPs situation and that the former IDPs or the IDPs per se will only be settled after that. We cannot let this happen. We have to ensure that where normalcy is prevailing, the people of that area should have the freedom to go. Maybe we do not have the funds to facilitate the resettlement process, but, we must ensure that there is no barrier for these people going back. If the people of Mannar are willing to go back to their villages with no State aid, then the Government should allow them to go there. Now, in the Mannar District, we have the village of Silavathurai - we have three naval camps in Mannar; the Silavathurai Camp, the Puthuveli Camp and the Veppamkulam Camp and all these camps basically block the livelihood of the original people of that area.

If you take the Silavathurai Naval Camp, basically the mosque, the school, the hospital, the post office, the Pradeshiya Sabha and all the business places come within the Silavathurai camp. Now, if that is going to remain a camp there, then what happens to the people of Silavathurai? Do they continue to live in squalor in the IDP camps in Puttalam or are we going to resettle them somewhere else? Will they be able to get about their livelihood as they and their ancestors have done? We need clarity for all these. If we do not have that, then we are once again sowing the seed of dissension.

We do not want that to happen in this country. We want this ethnic conflict to end once and for all and to end it once and for all, we have to learn lessons from the past. We cannot now say that we have defeated terrorism and therefore there are no minorities, everybody is the majority because still the will of the majority prevails. This does not take us anywhere. We are getting back to square one. We are getting back to where we started way back in 1926 or when we came again together in 1948 agreeing to disagree.

In the case of the Northern people, we also have an issue of the impact of secondary occupation of land and property. We know that for over 19 years, over 30,000 acres of land belonging to almost 11,000 Muslim individuals are left abandoned. Over 12 per cent of houses belonging to Muslims in the Jaffna district are subject to secondary occupation. In the other districts in the North too, secondary occupation of property is very much prevalent though accurate details are not available. Long-term abandonment and secondary occupation of land and property may render such property being subject provisions of the Prescriptions Ordinance. In terms of the Ordinance, an owner of land and property may lose title to such property in favour of a third party in possession in certain circumstances. Now, this is the prevailing law of this country. Though we have been talking of a resettlement process of bringing things to normalcy, we have not looked at the legal impediments that we may face when we start to move people to the places which they originally occupied and which are now being occupied by others, for no fault of either party. I would like to table* in this House a document prepared by an eminent lawyer, Mr. M.H.M. Salman of the Peace Secretariat for Muslims where he spells out a series of recommendations to address this issue. In this document, he says, in order to address issues arising out of abandonment of property and secondary occupation all parties must think innovatively and also act fast. Following are some thoughts for policy and law reform. For purpose of clarity, the envisaged policy and law reforms are set out in three stages, but all stages are interconnected. He says in the immediate, * initiation of a dialogue involving all parties, * vesting of abandoned land and properties of displaced people in the State, * preservation of documents of title to property, * conducting of land survey and photographing of property, * creation of awareness among the displaced population. In the intermediate, he suggests, law and policy reform, * enactment of new laws and amendment to existing legislation, * setting up of special tribunals/courts to inquire into property claims, * laws to nullify land transactions under questionable circumstances, * formulation of a special land policy for the Northern Province, * strengthening of law and order, * restoration of civil administration

One of the incidental issues arising out of secondary occupation of property is the impact of restitution that will have on the secondary occupant. Although the occupation of property belonging to others is an unlawful act, there are other circumstances that necessitate a more flexible approach to the resolution of this complex issue. Accordingly, in the long-term, he advocates to formulate policies and introduction of legal framework for restitution of property. Here, he also refers to compensation. Then, with regard to relocation he says, I quote: "Government must consider relocation of the displaced only in the event resettlement is not feasible or at the request of the displaced individual." Why I brought this up, though I do not represent the people of the North, is because it is important that this House and this country do not forget these people because otherwise, they would end up like the Palestinians as everybody feels they do not have a voice and therefore, they have been ignored at every step. I plead with this Government to make sure that in every step they take to rehabilitate or resettle the people of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, all three ethnic communities are equally looked after so that we do not start reinventing the ethnic wheel where we feel that the border villages are getting more attention than those in the IDP camps or those in the IDP camps are getting more preference than the people in the Puttalam camps. We need to ensure that all these three angles are looked at simultaneously. As much as we are eager to ensure that the border villages or the maim gammanas are developed, we must also ensure that the Northern Muslims get back to their places of ancestral domain and those in the IDP camps are released as early as possible. Thank you. : : Document tabled: Number of international organizations and policy institutes has conducted number of surveys and studies to assess the impact of secondary occupation of land and property in the North and East. The studies have found that secondary occupation of land and houses raises the following social issues among others Potential to create fresh disputes Competing claims and protracted legal/administrative procedures Hindrance to orderly re-settlement of the displaced However the State policy or the law reforms have not been very responsive to the outcomes or to the actual needs that have been identified. According to a survey conducted by the Muslim Rights Organization a total in excess of 30,000 acres belonging to 11,058 Muslim individuals are left abandoned. The land in question is residential, agricultural and bare land owned and possessed by them until they were expelled in 1990. Even after the lapse of nineteen long years and the defeat of the LTTE displaced Muslims are not in a position to take a full stock of the status of their property. Reasons are inaccessibility due to security,

hostile environment and the presence of mines etc. Those who had managed with difficulty to visit and inspect the properties had witnessed that the land they had abandoned has undergone physical changes and in some cases third parties are in possession.\ Surveys have revealed that 12% houses belonging to Muslims in the Jaffna district are subject to secondary occupation. In the other districts in the North too secondary occupation of property is very much prevalent though accurate details are not available. The true extent of the status of land and property will only be known when normalcy is restored and the displaced individuals are permitted to visit the areas without restriction. Long term abandonment and secondary occupation of land and property may render such property being subjected to provisions of the Prescription Ordinance. In terms of the Ordinance an owner of land and property may lose title to such property in favour of a third party in possession in certain circumstances. The basis of such loss is founded on the principal of negligence on the part of the owner of property. If the owner of property fails to assert ownership to property and take action to recover same from a third party who is in possession within a stipulated period of time, the person in possession (secondary occupant) acquires ownership to such property provided certain legal requirements are fulfilled. In the current circumstances the operation of prescription may adversely affect evicted Muslims and cause irreparable loss to them. Large number of displaced Muslims is likely to lose ownership of their traditional land and property if remedial measures are not taken soon. For instance in a lawsuit where an evicted Muslim from the North is a party to an action where land and property belonging to him was the subject matter of litigation he is at a definite disadvantage vis-a-vis the secondary occupier. The Northern Muslim lives outside his original home and the properties are inaccessible to him. He is also compelled to face a hostile environment. He also may not be in a position to submit documents or present evidence through witness in court. On the other hand the secondary occupant is placed in an advantageous position by virtue of his possession and the unrestricted access to witnesses, documents and the friendly environment. Now that military operations have paved the way for re-settlement of Muslims of the North the time is ripe for the government to introduce policy and law reforms to address the issues arising out of abandonment and secondary occupation of land and property. The Government has also taken several positive steps in this regard. However no attention is paid to resolve the issues arising out of secondary occupation of private property in the North. In order to complement the efforts of the government the following broader issues are identified in respect of issues relating to secondary occupation in conflict areas Non availability of credible and comprehensive database pertaining to the land and property issues Total inadequacy of laws and policies deal with secondary occupation Absence of cost effective and enforceable alternative dispute resolution mechanisms Inability of the authorities and the non-state actors to resolve these issues in a just and peaceful manner; Potential for future tension between individuals and communities Sensitivities and genuine concerns of secondary occupants Instead of strategies, successive governments were keen to set up multitude of ministries, departments, institutions and ad hoc mechanisms creating fresh problems. Issues of co-ordination, overlapping of functions and responsibilities have often created delays, confusion if not conflict among the institutions themselves to the detriment of the displaced people.

Recommendations In order to address issues arising out of abandonment of property and secondary occupation all parties must think innovatively and also act fast. Following are some thoughts for policy and law reform. For purpose of clarity the envisaged policy and law reforms are set out in three stages, but all stages are interconnected. Immediate Initiation of a dialogue involving all parties The government must initiate a dialogue with all stakeholders. Vesting of abandoned land and properties of displaced (Northern) in the State Enactment of a new legislation or regulations to grant legal protection to abandoned private property in the North and East. Such law or regulation should have the effect of vesting the properties of the displaced automatically (by operation of law) in the State without any encumbrances. Laws can be enacted through an act of Parliament or under regulations under Public Security Ordinance. Soon after July 1983 riots REPIA was created through regulation and all affected properties were vested in the State by operation of law. Land and properties vested as such were divested to legal owners after inquiry. Preservation of documents of title to property Immediate action must be taken by the authorities to preserve and protect documents of title to property such as deeds, permits issued by government and also survey plans, agreements, license and other document relating to approvals issued by local authorities or government institutions. Issue of copies of documents destroyed or lost too should be expedited. Conducting of land survey and photographing of property Due to abandonment of property for long period of time all identity marks and other evidence have been lost or destroyed. The original owners will not be able to identify their properties due to lack or non existence of surface marks or signs. Therefore the Government must facilitate displaced persons to obtain ruling on boundaries of their property under relevant law or practice. A comprehensive report of property of the northern Muslims is available using new and advanced technologies. A survey too should be carried out to obtain details of land ownership of individuals. Creation of awareness among the displaced population Lack of awareness and ignorance has affected most of the displaced persons. They are not very much aware of their legal rights and entitlements. Most of them have hopes of returning to their homes in unsafe neighborhoods. Most of them are also unaware of legal consequences arising out of abandonment of property. Intermediate Law and policy reform Enactment of new laws and amendment to existing legislation A serious danger is likely that the legal owners losing ownership due to the operations prescription. If a displaced person loses title to property in such circumstance it will be a travesty of justice and will also reflect poorly on all stakeholders. Therefore the Government must seriously consider introducing necessary amendments to the Prescription Ordinance and other relevant law without further delay. The law Commission of Sri Lanka has already drafted amendments to the ordinance and had also held several rounds of discussions with several interested parties.

Setting up of special tribunals/courts to inquire into property claims The Government should give serious consideration to set up special courts or tribunals to hear and determine applications in areas where displace live on matters relating to land disputes. These courts or tribunals could be set up under special law. The special courts or tribunals must have jurisdiction to hear applications on wider range of subject and should also have powers to expeditiously settle disputes relating to property. Such courts or tribunals must be given jurisdiction to inquire into testamentary cases and disputes relating to land between persons (displaced persons or one party is a displaced person) that were pending at the time of displacement. Similarly pending cases with regard to tenancy rights, servitudes or any right or obligation arising out of land too should be transferred to these special courts or tribunals for determination. Laws to nullify land transfers under questionable circumstances Several instances have been reported that Muslims of the North had been compelled under coercion or force to dispose land and property at a far below price than the prevailing market value. The Government should appoint a committee to investigate such instances and to recommend necessary law and policy changes to grant relief to affected individuals. Policy reform and executive & administrative action Formulation of a special land policy for Northern province Land use and demography of the entire Northern Province have undergone irreversible changes due to the conflict, the resultant displacement of people. Therefore action must be taken to inquire into and recommend necessary action to identify future land requirements for development, settlements and livelihood activities and to ensure security. Strengthening of law and order Government must strengthen law and order situation in and around settlement areas. Improved security and the sense of safety will encourage the displaced people to return and re-settle. Restoration of civil administration Government must take immediate action to restore civil administration in the North to facilitate the return of displaced people and to claim abandoned property. Alternative plans One of the incidental issues arising out of secondary occupation of property is the impact of restitution will have on the secondary occupant. Although the occupation of property belonging to others in an unlawful act, there are other circumstances necessitating a more flexible approach to the resolution of this complex issue. If a secondary occupant is ejected from the property, more often than not it will give rise to fresh problems. That is because in the North most of the secondary occupants are poor landless and belongs to the Tamil community. In such circumstances the ejectment of a secondary occupier will also lead to more tension in the society. Authorities also must consider providing realistic solutions such as providing land for re-location and building of houses for both the displaced and the secondary occupiers. Legal advisory services According to survey conducted majority of northern Muslims are not aware of the legal consequences of abandonment of property and secondary occupation.

195 196

Therefore the Government should spearhead a campaign to create awareness through legal advisory services to the displaced people and the secondary occupiers with the active participation and assistance from non state parties. Land mediation In order to avoid further escalation of tension and acrimony the issues arising out of secondary occupation should be settled through an inclusive process involving all parties concerned. One of the tested approaches is mediation where all concerned sit with a mediator to discuss and find ways of resolution. Therefore the Government should consider enacting a body of laws similar to laws existed in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.

Long term

Restitution of Property Formulate policies and introduction of legal framework for restitution of property.

Compensation Government must formulate policy and procedures to pay compensation to the affected individual in lieu of restitution only in the event of restitution of property is not possible or at the request of the displaced individual. Relocation Government must consider relocation of the displaced only in the event of re-settlement is not feasible or at the request of the displaced individual. Muslims live outside Sri Lanka. Accurate figures and where they currently live are not available. According to a survey conducted by the Muslim Rights Organization in 2003-2005 a total in excess of 30, 000 acres of land belonging to 11,058 Muslim individuals are left abandoned in the North. The land in question is residential, agricultural and bare land owned and/or possessed by them until they were expelled in 1990. Surveys have revealed that 12% houses belonging to Muslims in the Jaffna district are subject to secondary occupation. In the other districts in the North too secondary occupation of property is very much prevalent though accurate details are not available. The true extent of the status of land and property will only be known when normalcy is restored and the displaced individuals are permitted to visit the areas without restriction. Over the years number of international organizations and policy institutes has conducted surveys and studies to assess the impact of abandonment and secondary occupation of land and property in Sri Lanka. Though the findings have been made public State policy or the law reforms have not been very responsive to the findings or to the actual needs that have been identified. The studies and surveys have found that secondary occupation of land and property raises the following social issues among others a Potential to create fresh disputes

b Competing claims and protracted legal/administrative procedures

c Hindrance to orderly re-settlement of the displaced

The subject of abandonment and the secondary occupation of property have been subjected to extensive discussion and research in other parts of the world. Countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Guatemala that experienced armed conflicts and mass displacement have successfully implemented land and property restitution plans.
