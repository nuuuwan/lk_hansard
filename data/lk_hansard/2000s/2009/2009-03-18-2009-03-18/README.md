( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . . . I think the Hon. Member will agree with me that this entire question had been framed in such a way that we cannot give a proper answer. That is my problem?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

What is the problem.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

In fact I will now dirrect you to your own question Hon. Member. You are asking for the total direct and indirect cost for holding the 15th SAARC Conference or the 2nd hosted by Sri Lanka. Now, 15th was not the 2nd. So, how am I to reply to that? You must know what you are asking for. That one. The second part of the question is relating to another ministry altogether. It says, I quote: Will he state, (i) whether the alternative lands, houses and shops have been given for the owners of the houses and pavement hawker shops which were broken down in Colombo Central, Kotte, Kaduwela, Kandy and Colombo City limits. What has it got do with the Foreign Ministry?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

It was done because the SAARC was going to be held. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

You have not said that anywhere. You have not said that because of the issue of the SAARC Conference, these had been done. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Surely you are living in Sri Lanka, you are not living in some other place. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

No, no. I am living in Sri Lanka and you and I are in Kotte.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Now, you are in Kotte not in Nikaweratiya. Is that so? You will understand that. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Now, Sir, ? . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , 15 , ? . . ( )

I also could have given the same answer my learned Friend gave me, saying that being in Sri Lanka, we should have known when it was held. In 1976 . . - [ ] you frame this question and forward it. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No, no. I do not need to frame the question. You say either, yes or no. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

No. There is nothing for me to say, yes or no. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

You do not worry about that.

2009 18 343 344

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I will leave it to the Chair, Sir to make a Ruling on that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

You leave it wherever you want. I have asked the question. Either you have the character to answer it - if you do not have it, you just, no. That is all. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

This is an improperly structured question for which an answer cannot be sought. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Then say so. If you think that it is improper, go ahead and do so. That is all. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I said that. There is no answer that can come from me. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Management Accountants of Sri Lanka Bill. I am happy to take part in this Debate more so as I myself am an accountant, representing Parliament on behalf of the people since 1994. The Minister of Trade, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, mentioned the requirement and the necessity for the incorporation of this Institute. I do not think that there is any dispute or doubt about the necessity for doing so. However, there is the need to seek certain clarifications. The motive should be pure and not to devalue the existing accounting bodies that are functional in Sri Lanka. I, being a FCMA of CIMA, want to ensure the upgrading of the quality which is required at this moment and not just establish another institute to bring out people with another equivalent qualification. I must at the outset mention the keenness with which Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala has been pursuing this because it was inaugurated during the period of the late Hon. Kingsley Wickramaratne, the then Minister of Internal and External Trade, Commerce and Food. I happened to succeed him and I had the opportunity to push this forward into a direction that was accepted by the rest of the accounting bodies. Sir, as you know, there are three accounting bodies that are of repute in the world. The CIMA is one of the most sought-after institutions which has about 13,000 students in Sri Lanka. Roughly about 4,000 of them have qualified and are working overseas. Likewise, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, which is one of the most prestigious institutions in Sri Lanka, has about 18,000 students with about 1,800 students operating as chartered accountants and to my reckoning, another 1,000 are overseas. Likewise, you have the ICMA, the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Australia and the ACCA of the United Kingdom which basically add on to the ever- increasing requirement of accountants in the world. I basically mention this because if the intention of this Bill is to give legislative powers to run an entity that is going to bring professionalism to this country, I think then we are going in the same direction. But, if it is for the purpose of utilizing this as a tool in order to relegate the quality of the other institutions, then we will have a major problem. Unfortunately, I could not take part in the Consultative Committee Meeting yesterday owing to factors beyond my control. But, I would have loved to have seen a little more amendments, to bring in more statutory rights in order to ensure that professionalism is protected in this legislation. Let me start off by giving an example on that basis. As a member of the CIMA, I know that Prof. Watawala ensured that I have an honorary title coming from the CIMA of Canada. How will this happen in the future? I was just running through this with my Colleague, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti as well. We were talking about this. He is also very passionate on these types of areas. I do not see any network. I mean, suddenly you find at the drop of a hat, professors coming out. The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala is different from the professor

409 410

who is his neighbour. You know what type of professors I am talking of. Now, these types of people are entitled and entrusted to give honorary titles because it is incorporated. In the amendments, you have the Central Bank Governor coming in. Why on earth are those types of guys coming into these types of institutions? If it was the Minister of Higher Education coming in, I do not mind.

( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , . - - . , . , . . . , , . . . , . . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I was not referring to that. I was referring to Clause 5 (3) relating to an honorary title being bestowed to members. If I may read that, I quote: Any Member of the Institute who satisfies the Council that he has been an Accountant, Management Consultant or a lecturer in a Higher Educational Institute for not less than five years with a minimum of three years Senior Managerial or equivalent experience and who has fulfilled such requirements as may be prescribed by the Council shall be eligible for registration as a Fellow of the Institute by the Council. Any person eligible for registration may forward an application to the Council for registration along with the prescribed fee. A member shall, upon registration by the Council as a Fellow of the Institute, be entitled to use the addition FCMA after his name. Now, this is the problem. I call upon the Hon. Minister of Higher Education to comment on this because at least he, is making a contribution. I guess this is something which is detrimental. Now, you can have a nonentity. He may be lecturing in some place for five years. Now, you bring that guy and give an FCMA. You are equating him to an FCMA that I have. I have slogged, gone through the accounting systems, gone through the debits and credits and come here. Now, here you are equating some person who has no such qualification to come in and take that. So, I would appreciate if necessary amendments are brought in to rectify these. , 5 3

. . " " . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ,- If it is an accounting body, let it be coming from the chartered accountants or the CIMA or reputed international organizations. If not, let it be from an accepted university but not from a university where you go and buy titles over the counter for Rs. 50. So, Hon. Minister, I would appreciate if you could ensure that this type of amendment is made. It fortifies the necessity to protect professionalism. In a country that is going through economic chaos, caught up with the financial meltdown in the world, after all, it is the accountants who are basically going to protect the economy of this country. You cannot get a medical doctor to attend to the financial institutions of this country. So this is where I think special attention has to be given. I do not know how this Bill has come so far without such a basic matter being looked into. There is no way. I know for a fact that it happened even in the Institute of Chartered Accountants where there were certain political pressures to obtain entry forms and reduce certain minimum qualifications as the applicant happened to have a political backing. I think it is our bounden duty to protect professionalism for the future generation. I do not want to labour too much if Clause 5 (3) is amended today. , , , . . Hon. Minister, furthermore you would also have - . . . , . Also, going on the basis of AAT - now there must be no AAT because today you have FROG ( ) (The Presiding Member) " " ? ? ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . . . counter . ( ) (The Presiding Member) Not that. ICMA, Chartered Accountants and -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. The ICMA is not a problem because that is accepted as a university worldwide. That equivalent title is there, but not for something you go to Congo and get, and with that Chartered Accountant title you come and try to qualify here. It has to be a local institute or an internationally recognized chartered institution. CIMA, Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, or the Chartered Australian Accountancy or the Chartered Canadian Accountancy, all those are accepted. I am sure the Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala has more experience than me on this subject. I would appreciate your input on this so that the necessary requirements to fortify professionalism is ensured. Now, you also have got to differentiate these titles. You have this AAT which is of a lesser value. AAT is of a certain degree or standard. Now, if you have AATs, FCMAs and FROGs and all these things, it makes a mockery because at the end of the day certain people have titles which have three or four lines. Now, you can get a degree over the e-mail for US Dollars 200. So we have got to ensure that such things do not happen in Sri Lanka. . . Professor Wiswa Warnapala - [ ] [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . . . , . . Hon. Minister, I would also say that this is a step in the right direction, because today there is a huge dearth of accountants in this country. I think one of the biggest problems is that we have incorporated many financial regulations that need to be complied with. But, the very compiling of all these has become a problem because the required support staff is not available. That is the reason why you basically have substandard people who are coming in. Now, with regard to the auditors, there is a huge problem in this country. The auditors are not socially responsible. If you take the insurance companies there are certain requirements that have not been complied with. Look at the state of certain institutions that have fallen by. They have not done the required work with diligence and also the accounting standards have not been complied with; the reason being the monitoring authority in this country is not doing what is expected to be done. Now, this particular Institute will come under the Trade Ministry. If it works the same way like the Chartered Institute is working I will be quite happy. I am sure that would have been taken care of by Professor Watawela

413 414

because his keenness in doing so will basically ensure that this is brought into existence. But, the continuity has to be through a succession rather than getting this body incorporated and then let it to float from there onwards. So, I think those need to be brought in immediately in order to ensure protection. Going on that basis, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has a prestigious value because from 1959, the Institute has been producing fantastic accountants. Today, the Chartered Accountants in Sri Lanka are more respected and more professional than a Chartered Accountant from London because there about 5, 6 or 7 per cent coming out. Now, that is a huge respect for them. Most of our Sri Lankan Chartered Accountants go to the African countries and demand salaries that are equivalent to or much higher than the salaries which the accountants holding ACF title from UK are drawing. So, that is the type of quality people that we need to bring in. This is one of the reasons why when I was the Trade Minister, the BPO concept was brought into this country because the Business Process Outsourcing is necessary as we have the competence. Today literacy in our country is a mere joke. The difference between literacy of 98 per cent and the functional literacy is the problem. I guess if you really look at the index of functional literacy, I do not think we have more than 30 to 40 per cent. That is the working ability, the comprehension factor of it. Those are the problems we have. So, I propose that even at this moment even another layer like the AAT is brought in for the lower end. I think it is a good thing rather than students doing professional exams that they basically apply for and dropping out at the second or third level. Today, you have a lot of students. Even though they aspire to be chartered accountants, they drop off after the first and second parts. Then, they become half-baked accountants. But, if you have one for book-keeping and a separate one for auditing, I think the service industry in this country will become more advanced and demanding. So, on that score, if you have education to gear up to this type of thing, I think we are doing a favour to the society and also guiding them in the correct way. Otherwise, some person, because he has half knowledge, goes and puts a small chop certifying the accounts of certain companies and makes a mess out of it. So, I think if you give an opportunity, at least one will qualify to a certain degree. A lack of English knowledge has been a major problem for some of the students. So, if we are able to ensure that they have a Sinhala stream doing book-keeping, auditing or management, I think it will to a certain degree - ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , . . , , ,

( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) . . . , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . . . So, on that basic assumption, Sir, what we have got to do is to ensure that we create the climate for this because when these types of things are legislated, peoples eyes and ears will open. In todays financial condition, this is one of the best. When the VAT was going to be legislated in this country, one of the biggest problems was whether there was sufficient people to carry out this exercise. The VAT fraud resulted because of this. Some guy comes into the middle and says, Okay, I will ensure that you get a VAT refund, and he creates a huge mess in the company system. Most of the people who are in jail were caught up in this system. The businessmen have said, Okay, I will get you 15 per cent. He comes and meddles with the books, shows a fudged-up graph of export figures and robs State money. That is because there is a lack of professional people to administer this. So, I do not want to labour too much on those types of issues. Once again, I am happy that such a legislation has been brought in and I request that the amendments suggested by me are effected. The other matter is that once these are incorporated and become operational, then the necessary functional facilities must be put in place. Now, I may move from that to another matter. Yesterdays "The Island" newspaper carried a news item under the caption, I quote: House sleeps on AGs critical report on public finance. So, what on earth are we doing if we are going to legislate this and create accountants and when accountants come to positions like the Auditor-General of this country and his report is completely neglected in this House? This is the institution that brings in public finance to this country. If this institution appoints the

Auditor-General and his opinion is completely ignored in this House, what are we basically legislating all this for? That is the difference. This is the countrys biggest problem today. The bane of society is the lack of professionals. Today, into an educational institute, you put a farmer; into a farming place, you put a nurse or to where the accountants need to come in, you bring in a health service person. Now, if we are able to bring professionalism in and ensure that that is legislated into these places, that is what is important. , . ? . . ? . . . . ( ) (The Hon.

Ravi Karunanayake) On that basis, I would like to even at this last minute, recommend that the Minister of Higher Education appoints a person because he knows the deficiencies in the university system. Then you could say, No, I would prefer to ensure that the Council which is incorporated has the input". That is why I was asking questions from you in the morning as to how many universities are there in the country, how many students are passing out and how many of them are dedicated to the accounting area. What I have found is that there is a shortage of about two to three thousand accountants in this country. So, if you are able to produce at least two to three hundred accountants a year, that will help satisfy this need. , ,- ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) . , . . . , . , . . , - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

. . I think it will be helpful if you add it on to this one. Going on further, when these types of accountants are produced and when auditors-general and professionals are appointed and factors that are reported to this House are not administered and acted upon, what is the purpose? Mr. S.C. Mayadunne, the then Auditor-General of this country, worked tirelessly and was able to prove that there were many problems such as frauds taking place in this country. When those were highlighted, Parliament did not take cognizance of such reports. Then, suddenly there was a VAT fraud in 2005. That originated with the report that Mr. Mayadunne gave in 2004. These are things that need to be looked into. Once again I am drawing your attention to The Island newspaper of 17th March, 2009 where the present Auditor-General, Mr. S. Swarnajothi stressed a point at a press briefing held yesterday. So, these are matters that need to be taken up. I see the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama walking into the House. When he was the Chairman of the COPE, we brought out certain things. Where are those? No action has been taken on them. These were brought up in the year 2000. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I am very much in agreement with the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake that action must be taken on all COPE reports that we have submitted. Otherwise what is the idea of submitting these reports? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is the purpose? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) This is something I fully endorse. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) That is the attitude of the Government as well. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Yes, we have to take it up. I think we have to bring in a form of a resolution seeking the implementation of these COPE reports. I am very much in agreement with the Hon. Member.

2009 18 419 420

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is right. Otherwise, it becomes only an academic exercise. So, ensure that you bring this in. Now, you have 110 ministers; bring this as a suggestion. I am proposing this. You take it up. I have already put up a Private Members Motion on this. Anything that is coming in should be administered and action should be taken within six months. They take a month or so to bring the report out. When it comes, it lies in a particular place owing to political reasons without necessary follow-up. Then what is the purpose? This is not for political persecution. There needs to be some follow-up action. So, on that particular score, I would greatly appreciate if it is taken up. Now, the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka intends to put out these types of professionals. It also needs to have a system where the countrys economy permeates the necessity to ensure that these people are fully engrossed in the economy. What is happening today? However, I salute it; I support it and request that the amendments suggested be brought in. I need to move away from the subject now and take up the economy in todays context. When I was the Minister of Trade, I encouraged such a thing to ensure that we have more representation in the accounting field. Most of the bills brought in say that you must have a lawyer or an engineer but it does not speak of accountants. That is another thing that should be looked into. When the Consumer Affairs Authority Bill was presented, I made it a point to ensure that accountants play a role. ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) . . . , . . . , , , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . , Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala, you must ensure that the University Grants Commission intervenes in bringing in accountants from the CIMA, now the CMA. Bring in people. Now, most of the government-owned companies do not have an accountant. But, political johnnies are there giving

financial prognoses on what is going on in the institution. So, I think these are things that need to be brought into the modern world society. Then, look at the present situation. I must at this moment refer to a statement made by the Hon. Milinda Moragoda. About a week ago in "The Sunday Island" he discussed this in an article titled "The Way Forward" giving a critical assessment, for which I salute him. As a Minister, he has gone into it and given a report on the economy prevalent today. Without fear or favour, he has basically dicussed the mess in the economy. I do not know with what intention he did that but I think at least he had the audacity to come out and say what the real problem in the economy today is. What is Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal saying to that? Hon. Minister Milinda Moragoda is coming out with a factual statement. When we say this, it is basically looked at as if we are telling something against the Government. When an Hon. Minister of the Government says that, then it is taken as a ministerial statement. But, what are the people who are behind it saying? What is Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, as the Governor of the Central Bank, saying to what Minister Milinda Moragoda has said? I am not saying this to put one against the other. But, I have been saying this relentlessly, as to what the Governor of the Central Bank is doing. The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane also stated from that side as to what is going on. I am sure there is no difference between then and today. If the Minister, the Hon. Milinda Moragoda has said so - we must salute him for saying so - ensure that corrective actions are taken. Otherwise, we will run into a bigger mess. Now, look at the situation in the country today. The Fitch Ratings have downgraded the country. It went up very substantially to the positive end and now it is down to the negative end. If the countrys economy is doing so well like it is professed in the "Daily News" and the Rupavahini, why are negative sentiments expressed? Why is it necessary to have a positive outcome? Then, your borrowing factor becomes less. Why are you bringing in the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka Bill? It is because, you want professionals to come in. Then, why is professionalism not there in the economy? Today, I read in the "Daily News" that two Senior Assistant Secretaries to the Ministry of Finance have not been appointed. There is a Secretary to the Ministry of Finance. Two Senior Assistant Secretaries out of the three have not been appointed. If you do not appoint them, you must be having some clerk in that particular place running the scene. That is the problem in this country. So, we need to ensure that such a thing would not happen. The Fitch Ratings ensured that they downgraded us after seeing certain things going on in the country. Look at the economy that is taking a heavy toll. You have the business sector saying, "We cannot work for five and a half days a week; we can work only for five

421 422

[ ]

days a week". So, what has happened? Most of the people in the tea estates - I can see the Hon. P. Radhakrishnan, the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam, all of them here - today are plucking tea only for two or three days a week. What is happening there? It is because the economy is not able to withstand the pressure due to the cost factor. Is that not a tremor in the economy? If the Chambers and the representatives come and say, Please, give us a five-day week instead of a five and a half-day week", do the people who run this economy not feel that there are tremors in the economy? Why are you saying that the economy is tickety-boo when there is a problem? So, that is one area. Then, look at the impact caused by tourism. Now, one of the three areas from which foreign exchange is coming into this country is from the people working overseas. Today, one of the biggest problems is that the US Dollars 2.8 billion that was coming in as foreign exchange has reduced to almost US Dollars 2.2 billion. So, there is about a 25 per cent drop in the foreign exchange coming into the country through the people who have sacrificed their social lives in Sri Lanka and gone overseas to work hard for their families. Why? Because this country cannot afford to give them jobs so that they can live comfortably in this country. When we, the UNP, were there we ensured that we Sri Lankanized the economy. , " " . . . - - ; ; . . . camp , . . . "" . . ? . ; . , first of all, ensure that the countrys economy is able to absorb the professionalism that is going out. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I mentioned the first factor for the erosion of foreign exchange into this country. That is, the reduction in the monies that are coming in from the Sri Lankan people working overseas, their hard-earned money coming in. The second area is tourism. Tourism brings in quite a big exchange revenue into this country. What has happened? , . . , hotels

, , " , ?" . So, tourism is one of the areas where exchange revenues coming into this country have reduced. The third area is the textile industry in this country. Those are the three areas which are basically the foundation or the fountain of the foreign exchange coming into this country. The textile industry had 752 garment factories when we, the United National Party, were in Government. Today, what has happened? The 752 garment factories have reduced to almost 225. It is owing to the loss of employment and the loss of foreign exchange in these triple areas that today the country is facing a drop in the foreign exchange reserves. The reason why I laboured this point was to show that today the Government is cash-strapped. One reason is, it is owing to the fact that there is a balance of payments deficit. The second thing - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) 40 . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , 40. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ,- ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) 11.19 . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) 10 , . . . So, what has happened is, owing to the fact that foreign exchange has reduced, you have a balance of payments problem. On the second score, owing to the budget deficit, you have a cash problem. So, when you put both together, you have an economic problem in this country. Now, we are demanding an explanation as to who is responsible in handling the economy in a manner that is acceptable to the people of this country.

2009 18 423 424

Today, the total debt in this country has zoomed up to Rs. 4,100 billion as of 1st of March, 2009. I may be subject to correction because we get information from limited sources. But, professionals give us the information. I want to take up one glaring situation. From the day we gained Independence up to 31st of December, 2004, the total borrowing in this country was Rs. 1,783 billion. By 1st of March, 2009, the total debt was Rs. 4,100 billion. So, From the 1st of January, 2005 to 1st of March, 2009, within four years and two months, you have gone into debt by Rs. 2,317 billion. Hon. Minister, is this not a heinous crime? From 1948 to 2004, it was Rs. 1,783 billion, but from 2005 to 2009 it has gone up by Rs. 2,317 billion. That means, during four years you have expended almost 140 per cent more than the amount of debt taken from 1948 to 2004. ? 2004 1,783 , 2005 2009 2,370 . . , , . . shock . . 2,01,000. 2008 15 , 1,58,000 . 2,01,000. , . . . , " . . , , " . . . , ", " .

The present trade balance is US Dollars 2,200 million. You have got to pay US Dollars 1,200 million for Iran oil. For arms and ammunition you have got to pay US Dollars 1,500 million. That is what is told. I am not too sure because that has not been made public. Then, roughly for two months of foreign reserve of this country, you need about US Dollars 2,000 million. When you add up all this, you will roughly need about US Dollars 6,900 million. But, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today the amount we have as cash in hand for foreign reserve is only US Dollars 775 million.

On that score, we roughly need another US Dollars 6,200 million. So, assuming that the request from the IMF for the full US Dollars 3,200 million is granted - forget the US Dollars 1,900 billion - and if we are given a 100 per cent facility, still you will have a deficit of US Dollars 3,000 million. Who is going to be held responsible for this? When you go for one condition and before you come out, you will have to go back again to find the balance money. As responsible Members of the Opposition who have been contributing to the development of the economy of this country, when we ask this question we do not get a satisfactory answer.

The Bottom Line of 11th, February, 2009 states, I quote: Central Bank says Lankan Diaspora keen to invest in TBills, Bonds

This was stated on the 11th of February and on the 14th of February, 48 members from Central Bank went on roadshows worldwide. Their intention, Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala, was to bring in US Dollars 600 billion. I do not need to tell this to you because you are there in the Cabinet. US Dollars 600 billion was their target. But, finally they came back bringing only Rs. 70 million. Only US Dollars 700,000 was brought in. That was not even 1 per cent of the intended amount. That is why now you have to go to the IMF. But, now you are saying that the IMF is not putting any conditions while you are begging them. I challenge you to put forward the conditions that they have put in. How are you going to take on these conditions? One of the outcomes of the IMF conditions is the CEB privatization.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . [. . 12.13] . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I would like to remain within the subject which is under discussion in this House. The purpose of this Bill is to establish an Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka. According to the Bill which has been placed before this House, the declared objectives of the Institute are as follows: (1) to provide for a professional organization for management accountants; (2) to promote and develop the study of Management Accountancy in this country. (3) to establish Accountancy Standards; (4) to encourage the use of correct principles and techniques of Management Accountancy; (5) to promote the profession of Management Accountancy in industry, commerce, education, finance and public service; (6) to undertake the education and training of Management Accountants; The country needs Management Accountants, as my good learned Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake stated in the course of his speech; (7) to conduct the examinations in the relevant field. (8) to assist the universities and higher educational institutions in the study of Management Accountancy. I would like to look at this piece of legislation from the point of view of the Ministry of Higher Education. In my capacity as the Minister in charge of Higher Education, I welcome the establishment of this Institute. In my view, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this is an attempt to establish a professional organization for the Management Accountants in Sri Lanka. Management Accountancy as the Hon. Minister explained, is a well-developed field of study in the developed countries where a variety of industrial and commercial organizations function. The Society of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka is a professional organization engaged in the education and training of Management Accountants for industry, commerce and the financial sector. It, though not an Institute, was engaged in the task of training Management Accountants and its programme

was supported by the Canadian International Development Agency, which means it has an international relationship. Though business houses and commercial enterprises came to be developed with the development and expansion of the plantation industry in this country, no powerful business elite came on the scene till the 1960s. It was in 1962 that the need to teach Commerce as a subject at the university came to be recognized and the universities thereafter began to introduce courses in Commerce and Accountancy. I can remember Accountancy was taught as a part of the special course in Economics at the University of Peradeniya. In fact, it was the same at the University of Ceylon. Today, Accountancy including Management Accountancy with its different specialties or different specializations has developed as a profession, which in the last five decades has made a major impact on the management of business, commercial enterprises and financial institutions. The growth of industries and public enterprises demanded Management Accountants. In other words, there was a need for professional education in Accountancy. It was true that the private sector organizations made an attempt to train Management Accountants and they dominated the system of professional education in the field of Accountancy for number of years. As the Minister, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane mentioned, all universities in the country have degree programmes in Accountancy, Commerce and Management. There are faculties teaching Management. The establishment of these courses in Management and Commerce has attracted a large number of students; a large number of undergraduates. They prefer to study these subjects as they offer better employment opportunities in the country. They can find employment outside the country if they have the right qualifications. Mr. Deputy Chairman, Higher Education has been regarded as an important element in the economic and social development of our country and all higher educational institutions including universities, need to produce graduates with advanced knowledge and skills required for various positions in Government, business and industry. The emerging knowledge economy demands the creation of new disciplines which have an immediate relevance to the process of economic and social development in a given country. Therefore, a system of diversification is necessary in the higher education sector and the establishment of this professional Institute is, in my view, an aspect of that kind of diversification in the higher education sector. The Society of Management Accountants was formed to fill a vacuum, in other words, to create a local Organization of Management Accountants. There were similar Organizations of Management Accountants in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada. The purpose of this

2009 18 431 432

Bill, the objectives of which have been explained by the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, is to give legislative recognition to the Society of Certified Management Accountants. Now, it is to be converted into a professional organization with a wide range of powers. It would undertake the training of professional Management Accountants and in that sense, this organization is a non-university tertiary institution providing higher educational opportunities in this country. This is I want to emphasize. The Hon. Minister of Trade, Marketing Development, Co-operatives and Consumer Services needs to be congratulated for introducing this Bill for the purpose of establishing a professional Institute of Management Accountants. It, apart from helping the profession of Management Accountants, would provide the Management Accountants with a better status; they are going to get a better status, a better recognition. In addition, the country could be provided with professional Management Accountants. An expanding economy needs the services of Management Accountants, who, as professionals, are certain to contribute to better management of industrial and commercial enterprises. The Institute of Certified Management Accountants proposes to conduct courses in four stages with a three-year period of training. This course is open to those who have passed the Advanced Level Examination, to the undergraduates in the university and also to those graduates who are already in employment and those who are employed in the private sector as well. In my view, Mr. Deputy Chairman, this is a non-university tertiary institution offering higher educational opportunities. The policy of our Government, the policy of the Ministry of Higher Education is to create more and more non-university tertiary institutions offering higher educational opportunities. Our biggest problem is how to expand the access to higher educational opportunities. Today, 131,000 students have qualified to enter the universities, but our annual intake is within the range of 20,000. In order to expand the access, we need more and more non-university tertiary institutions specializing in employment-oriented subjects. In other words, the tertiary sector needs to be diversified with new institutions so that more and more opportunities could be offered to those aspirants who want to obtain higher educational qualifications. A variety of new institutions are necessary along with the traditional universities, and they can create new opportunities to meet the growing social demand for higher education in this country. In this country, there is a massive social demand for higher education. In all the countries, enrolment in non-university institutions has grown in the last two decades. It is only through such a scheme that we can expand the access. The reforms within the universities alone cannot solve the problem - the provision of additional access. The expansion of the non-university tertiary institutions can tackle this problem of access. It is only through such a programme that higher education could be made more responsive to the demands

of the labour market. According to the World Bank, Mr. Deputy Chairman, a strong correlation exists between non-university tertiary institutions and the level of economic development of a given country. Tertiary education has, therefore, become an important agent of social change and an instrument for the realization of aspirations of a society. Non-university tertiary institutions constitute an alternative sector - an alternative to the conventional university. Most countries have established non-university tertiary institutions to provide more higher educational opportunities. This sector in Sri Lanka has nearly 50,000 students - you will be surprised to hear this - whereas the formal conventional university sector has 73,000 students. In this sector, there are private institutions which we cannot see. In other words, Mr. Deputy Chairman, there is an invisible private sector operating in this country and giving various opportunities in the field of higher education. It is also in this sector that recognition has been given to professional courses which, to a large extent, are tied to partnerships with foreign universities or universities outside the country. This means that the non-university tertiary sector specializing in professional education, specializing in professional studies is emerging in the country. Such a network of higher educational institutions do not come within the legal framework. Now, this is an attempt to give the Society of Certified Management Accountants a legal framework and this legislation is for a similar purpose. A mechanism has to be set up for quality assurance of this tertiary institutions engaged in professional education. Many of these institutions offer training facilities useful to the labour market. We need to look at from the point of view of the employability of the person; we need to look at from the point of view of the needs of the labour market. In other words, men and women can find employment because of the nature of the qualifications they possess. I mean, we need to produce people with proper qualifications. That is why the university sector needs to break away from the traditional disciplines. We inherited a series of traditional disciplines from the colonial times. These institutions have influenced the new generation to change their perception on scholastic education which came to be institutionalized during the colonial period. We were interested in scholastic education. We need to break away from the scholastic educational tradition which we inherited from colonial times. We need to break away from that tradition really because of the fact that we need to produce a person who is employable. In other words, all disciplines in the universities need to be guided by the concept of employability. The institutions which we establish as professional educational institutions should not be viewed as second rate institutions. This is another matter which needs to be given recognition. Whatever institution we establish should not be treated as a second rate institution. It has to be on par with the universities of the country.

433 434

[ . . ]

Then only the ultimate product could be sold in the labour market. In a country where there is a developed system of universities, such a perception is likely to arise. Some people are likely to treat a particular institution - I do not want to name it - as a second rate institution. We had a similar experience. I am sure you can remember that the country established affiliated university colleges at one stage. But, the students never agreed to go through the courses in the affiliated university colleges because they thought that they were of second rate, that they were not on par with the universities. Therefore, what happened? I can remember the former President, Her Excellency (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appointed a special Committee to look into it. I was the Chairman of that particular Committee which studied about the affiliated university colleges and decided to upgrade them into provincial universities.

, () , (.) . Whereupon THE HON.(MRS.) RENUKA HERATH left the Chair, and THE HON. (VEN.) UDAWATTE NANDA THERO took the Chair. [. . 1.42] . . ( ) ( . . - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Venerable Presiding Member, I think the House should appreciate the substantive criticisms that were made by the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti about the content of this law. He pointed out various shortcomings and deficiencies in this legislation. I do not maintain that this is a perfect piece of legislation; that is not the case. It also needs to be pointed out, Venerable Presiding Member, that the success or failure of an institution will not depend on the content of legislation. Statutory provisions can only set out the bare bones, the basic framework of an institution. How it works in practice depends not on the black letter law that is contained in the Bill that is the subject of Debate in this House today, but the important consideration will be the attitudes, the commitment of the people who make this institution work. So, this is only a starting point. But, as far as the actual content of the law is concerned, I would like to say that there are many reasons why this piece of legislation is appropriate having regard to social priorities in our country at the present time. I do not think that the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti will contest the proposition that there is a dire need in this country today for skills in this area. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has a history of about 50 years. But, Chartered Accountants are concerned about financial auditing and accounting. This is a different area. This is management accounting. Management accounting is an area in which skills and expertise are desperately needed in our country today. Yesterday, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti moving an Adjournment Motion referred to some of the very complex problems which have arisen in finance companies and leasing companies in this country. Those are precisely the kinds of problems which can be dealt with effectively only if there is an adequate body of

knowledge and expertise in the field of management accounting. Management accounting is concerned about projecting the future of a company - what are the things that need to be done to ensure the well-being, the management health of a particular entity? Those are the matters which we need to focus on if we are to get to grips with some of the problems that have greatly afflicted finance companies and leasing companies in this country. Venerable Presiding Member, in some countries like Canada, there has been legislation which has the effect of insuring deposits. If I go to a finance company and invest Rupees one million, that deposit is guaranteed because the bank or the finance company that accepts that deposit has to insure that deposit with another state entity. So, there is no risk that is undertaken by the depositor. Many of these problems have arisen because there is no such protection or cover. It is, of course not possible to give insurance cover for all deposits irrespective of their magnitude. If somebody invests Rs. 500 million, it may not be possible to offer that kind of insurance cover. But, the people who are greatly distressed by what has happened in Golden Key Credit Card Company, for example, find it impossible to find the expenses for their basic living. To deal with that kind of situation, the Canadian legislation has stipulated a certain upper limit up to, let us say, Rs. 3 million. With that, these deposits can be guaranteed. So, I think it is useful to reflect on what has happened and try to identify the productive courses of action for the future. I think these are real problems that the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti raised in the Adjournment Debate in this House yesterday. So, if we are to find practical solutions to those problems, the kind of knowledge that is sought to be imparted by the institution that has now been incorporated into law will certainly provide a very useful function. Then it is also necessary Venerable Sir, to reflect on the reasons why this legislation is timely and beneficial at this particular time. Today, we are in a situation where small businesses are arising and doing well in different parts of the country. Entrepreneurship and business are no longer the exclusive preserve of Colombo and the environment. In Kurunegala, in Galle, in Badulla, in Hambantota people are engaging in this kind of activity and doing well. It is, therefore, necessary that those organizations are also reinforced by this kind of expertise. The need for this is not confined to the capital city, it is a need that is felt in all parts of our country. Therefore, this institution will provide the kind of training that is going to enrich and elevate the economic life in all parts of our country, particularly the less developed or the remoter regions of Sri Lanka. I think this is very important. It has to do with social equity. As a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo, I am very pleased about the current system governing the admission of students to our universities. We all know that the raw mark that is scored by candidates at the G.C.E. (A/L) Examination is not the conclusive criteria. We have adopted a system which

2009 18 447 448

gives weightage to the adequacy or the paucity of the secondary school facilities that are available in that part of the country from which the student comes. That is referred to as affirmative action. Let us take two students who score 60 per cent, one student from Royal or St. Thomas and another student from a rural area, where he has not had any advantages. It is very unfair to treat these two students on the same level. It is, therefore, the current policy relating to admission of students to universities that a student who has done well in spite of the fact that he has not had access to proper facilities, will be preferred to a student scoring approximately the same mark but having had all the possible advantages in one of the largest and well-established schools in the Island. In fact, this system was challenged in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in a famous case called "Seneviratne and the University Grants Commission". It was argued that this system was a denial of merit and therefore a violation of the principle of equality that is contained in Article 12 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. But, the Supreme Court said, "No, that should not be the law, because you have to take into account the practicalities of the situation". So, a student from Monaragala who has scored 60 per cent may be preferred to a student from Royal or St. Thomas who has scored 65 per cent. So that is social equity - it has to do with access to opportunity which is one of the essential ingredients of social mobility. Now, that objective is accomplished in a substantial measure by the legislation that is now before the House because this kind of training in Management Accounting for which there is a dire need in Sri Lanka will now be made available not only to privileged sections of the community in Colombo and the suburbs but it will be available without discrimination to students who come from the rural areas of Sri Lanka. In that regard, the cost consideration is very important. Of course, there are other institutions that provide this kind of training, but then the fees are exorbitant. Institutions like the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the Association of Certified and Management Accountants charge fees of the level of approximately Rs. 400,000 a year. Now, the training that is offered by the Institution that is being incorporated today will be at a far lower cost, approximately Rs. 50,000. So it is going to make this kind of training affordable to people. Then, there is also another consideration, which I think is very important. Today, we have to cater for not only full-time students but to students who have the capability to benefit from higher education or from professional education but economic circumstances have compelled them to seek employment. They cannot therefore go to a university and follow a full-time course of study for three or four years. They have to find employment and while they are doing a job, they have to follow a course of academic or professional instruction. This institution will provide opportunities for students of that category. While doing a job, they can follow these

courses; they can equip themselves and they can decide whether they are going to do the theoretical part first and the practical training later. All these flexibilities are available depending on the circumstances of each particular student. I think that is absolutely necessary in the kind of society in which we live. We are no longer in the age of privilege when universities could be content to serve exclusively the needs of students between 18 and 22 years of age following full-time courses of instruction in tertiary education institutions in our country. That is not the kind of society for which we have to cater. So, those are some of the reasons, Venerable Sir, why I think that this legislation is particularly appropriate at this time. Then, I would like also to make a few general comments on some of the other desirable features of this legislation. In particular, Clause 3 (j) of Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka Bill, which refers to the General objects of the Institute states, I quote: to promote, collaborate and assist in the study of Management Accountancy, at Universities and other Higher Educational Institutions; I think, that is a very useful provision that is contained in this Bill. During my time as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo, I tried very hard to involve the business community in the planning of courses of this nature. These are courses with a practical orientation. It is, therefore, not desirable that the planning of these courses should be left entirely in the hands of full-time academics. I, therefore made use of the geographical location of the University of Colombo to make it possible for people in the professions - accountancy and various other professions - to sit on the boards of the University of Colombo which were responsible for drafting the syllabus and the curricular for these particular courses. What is more, some very eminent professionals were persuaded by me to come to the University and to actually lecture at weekends and during the evenings and that kind of input greatly enriched the practical content of these programmes that were being offered. So, I think those are some of the desirable features of this legislation. I would also like to say that situated as we are in this country, we need this kind of expertise even in a broader sense. As the military action draws to a close, the Government is giving deep thought to what needs to be done next. There is no doubt at all that a very ambitious programme of rehabilitation and reconstruction has to be undertaken in those parts of the country that have been affected by the war. The Government is drawing up plans to approach the international community for financial resources to build infrastructure in those parts of the country that have been affected. The response so far has been particularly encouraging. We have been having some informal discussions with representatives of foreign governments and we have told them that there is a dire

[ . . ]

need today to build roads, improve facilities in schools and in hospitals, then, there are irrigation systems, drinking water, malaria eradication, electricity and power generation. These are all very urgent requirements as the military action comes to an end. Now, in order to do this, we need resources. Not only do we need resources but it is necessary to ensure that these resources are properly expended for the purposes for which they are intended. So, we must have a goal, a vision. We must know what our priorities are and what are the objectives that are sought to be accomplished at this time. It has to be done in a professional way. It cannot be done ad hoc. Those are the circumstances in which this kind of training is of particular relevance and benefit in our country today. Once the military action is over, the challenge that confronts the Government is to rebuild these areas. As far as the provision of these facilities, the physical needs of people are concerned, we have every confidence that the international community will respond positively to a request by the Government of Sri Lanka for assistance. So, it is a time for rebuilding. It is a new chapter in the history of our country and if we are to succeed in the daunting tasks which lie ahead, this kind of expertise is absolutely essential. Then, we have to reflect in a cerebral way about the problems that confront us. These are by no means peculiar to Sri Lanka. We are naturally affected by developments which take place in the global economy; the financial meltdown which is effecting economies which are far stronger than our own. Take what is happening in Dubai or in Singapore. Those countries are very seriously affected by the current economic meltdown. I also think that in Sri Lanka, there really is a need to develop a political culture, which enables the major political parties to take a national view of broad issues. Of course, a thrust and parry of party politics is such that some degree of politicization of many matters is inevitable. But, countries with a mature political culture have found it possible to demarcate a certain area of issues in respect of which a different approach is adopted. Take for example, the Kashmir issue in India. The Congress Party and the BJP may disagree on many matters and on public platforms they will attack each other, sometimes ferociously. But, when it comes to a profoundly national issue, such as the Jammu and Kashmir issue, there is real national unity. I think there has to be real national unity with regard to some of the core issues, the absolutely fundamental issues, which we have to deal with in Sri Lanka today. Those issues have to do with reconstruction, and as far as that is concerned, I do not think we should play narrow party politics and there must be a real convergence on the part of all the major political formations in order to find solutions which are beneficial for our country as a whole. Take for example, the issue about the International Monetary Fund. There again, I do not think it is right to play politics with that. Resources are needed not only by

Sri Lanka; they are needed by counties which have been far more affluent than we have been in the past. The International Monetary Fund is today adopting a different approach to these economic issues. It is not a bailout. The practice in the past on the part of the International Monetary Fund has been, if a country has got into difficulties because of its own fault and that country is approaching the International Monetary Fund for support, then the IMF will impose certain contidions. But, today the situation is quite different. The International Monetary Fund recognizes that the whole world is enveloped in an unprecedented crisis. It is, therefore, the function of the International Monetary Fund to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. They do not want that system to collapse. They are therefore duty bound to offer support to countries which have been affected by circumstances beyond their control. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, the main course of our problems has been a fall in demand in the West. We send apparel to foreign countries; we send apparel to the United States and to Western Europe; we send our spices to those countries; we send our ceramic products to those countries. Now those demands are falling. It has nothing to do with Sri Lanka. It is simply that the spending power of people in those countries has been adversely affected by the current economic meltdown. They do not have the incomes they had earlier. Since Bloomberg started collecting figures in 1964, from 1964 up to the present day, the least amount that has been spent on Christmas shopping was in December 2008. So, those are not issues that have anything to do with Sri Lanka. It has to do with incomes in those countries, the performance of the economies of those countries, and Sri Lanka is affected because the demand for our goods is falling, not because of any fault of ours but because of factors connected with the economies of those countries which have been importing our products. In those circumstances, the International Monetary Fund will have to intervene in order to preserve the stability of the international monetary system. It is a very different situation from a country having got into difficulties because of its own fault and then appealing to the IMF for support. I think it is very necessary to recognize that fundamental difference between this situation and the customary situation in which countries turn to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. So I think, Venerable Sir, that those are situations which call for collective action, agreement among all the political parties in order to find solutions that are best for Sri Lanka. I do not wish to speak at far greater length. I think against that background, this is a kind of knowledge and expertise that is badly needed in our country today. There may be some deficiencies in the law; it may be that there are provisions which can be improved. If so, that can be done as we go along. But, that is not a reason for delaying this legislation indefinitely. I think the merits in the legislation far outweigh potential drawbacks. So, my attitude to what has been said by the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti is that while there may be some validity in

2009 18 451 452

some of the criticisms he made, those are not reasons not to bring this legislation before Parliament. The legislation is required. The legislation establishes the basic framework of the institute. It is a good start. We should go ahead with that and if there are problems that arise as we move forward, then we should address those problems to the best of our ability. Thank you very much. [. . 2.05] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Venerable Presiding Member, it is my privilege today to speak on the Bill, together with the amendments to be moved at the Committee Stage, to provide for the establishment of the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka and of a Council of the Institute which shall be responsible for the management of its affairs, an effort pioneered by the founder President of the Society of Certified Management Accountants and a fellow Thomian Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala who has held many positions of responsibility in this country. It is very essential to understand why we need to incorporate the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka by an Act of Parliament, which will give it the necessary government recognition for the Management Accounting profession in Sri Lanka similar to the recognition it has received in other Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are privileged today that the speakers before me, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti and Minister Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris made very valuable contributions towards the necessity for this Bill, the required amendments, and how they perceived this Act should have been brought before Parliament. So, that gives me an opportunity to look at this whole thing from a management point of view. I have been in management for 22 years and the first thing I did before aspiring to sit on a chair, was to have the ability to read a balance sheet. So what I did basically was, while working, I attended weekend classes at the Polytechnic at Wellawatte to a point where I could read a balance sheet because we all know, that if we are to progress in our career, we need to have a sound knowledge of finance. This is probably one principle that every business guru would agree on. Everything we do in business has some effect on the "numbers" - whether they are sales, costs, profits, return on investment, gearing or overall solvency. So if you do not have a basic grasp of the financial implications of your actions, it is very difficult to manage effectively and you are most unlikely to make it to the top. This is applicable to the field of management as well.

There was a time when financial literacy was not quite so essential to manage an organization where the organization was highly functionalized and hierarchical and many successful managers proceeded through their entire career with only a limited knowledge of finance. But today, in the flatter organizations of the modern world where responsibility is typically devolved to business units, managers need a far broader range of expertise and the ability to qualify virtually all their decisions in financial terms. In this environment of business, to be taken seriously, one should be able to talk the language of finance. This is why you need an institute of this nature to be producing more people who can basically talk the language of finance. Sometimes the question arises as to what is it that you need to know. In a company, we talk of three main financial statements. We talk of the profit and loss account, the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. If you do not know the fundamentals of finance it is Greek to you. Most managers are familiar with the first of these and its relatively straightforward formula that profit equals sales minus direct costs and expenses. Fewer people however understand the balance sheet, which indicates the real health of the business, how much it owes and how much it is owed. And, fewer still grasp the vital importance of cash flow, how much money is coming in and out of the business. From these three statements come the key ratios that can be used to manage the business. These include gearing, return on investment and gross and net profit margins. We can go on talking about this and we know that all what we are trying to do with all the different types of institutions that we have in this country and all the different types of courses they offer, is to make sure that we have the skill base to be able to manage the country. Having said this, sometimes you may wonder why with all these professional bodies and all those who gained recognition by way of qualifications, we have so many scandals. We have Chartered Accountants, Management Accountants, we have highly sophisticated accounting and auditing systems and we still have the majority being duped by a few unscrupulous cheats. This is where the crux of the problem is; the ethical values so zealously guarded by our ancestors have evaporated in the modern world. We have all become so materialistic and are finding faster ways of achieving our dreams; by any way you get there - fair or foul. This is where the ethical culture and accountability comes to play. Now, we have instances in this House; we have newspapers flashing reports that the Auditor-Generals Report has been lying in Parliament for so many months unattended. We have watchdog committees being overseen by the subject Ministers. So, all this basically tears apart the basic problem that we have: ethics. How do you inculcate an ethical culture that is so required for the problem that we are in today? We have had scandals all over the world, and if we talk of local Sakvithi

[ . . . ]

scandal, the Golden Key, the Ceylinco Group which everybody thought was The Company" in this country, how did they happen? Is it that they did not have accountants? They had. But, it is the values that the accountants and those above them held which have basically destroyed these institutions. I am reminded of what Felix Adler, Philosopher and the founder of ethical culture said. I quote: If there is a single instinct in me that is stronger than any of the rest, it is the instinctive desire to be truthful with myself and others. I will not be self-deceived. I will look life straight in the eye. I will go on defining ethics. Ethics defines the elements essential to human well-being and proposes principles to be used as guidelines for generating an ethical culture. Ethics also refers to the specific values, standards, rules and agreements that people adopt in leading their lives. Ethics, most broadly, is the study of human behaviour and its consequences in the light of what is ideally possible. Ethics is not merely social conventions, like table manners. Rather, ethics define the social conditions necessary for human beings to thrive. What are the essences of an ethical culture? Human Worth - I am an evolving person cultivating goodness. Every person is a creative source with an inherent capacity for goodness. Responsibility - I am in charge of who I am and what I do. Everyone is accountable for his or her actions. Love - I encourage the beauty, goodness, and creative power in every person. Everyone has the right to be all he or she can be. Freedom - I appreciate and express my uniqueness. Everyone has the right to make his or her own choices. Kindness - I care for the well-being of people. Everyone has the right to safety. Fairness - I act as I wish to be treated. Everyone has the right to an equal opportunity. Trust - I honour my agreements. Everyone is accountable for his or her promises. Truthfulness - I speak without misleading. Everyone can face reality honestly. Forgiveness - I admit my mistakes by expressing sorrow for causing harm, by making amends, and by learning a better way. Everyone can learn by trial and error. Joy - I choose to find within me delight in being alive. Everyone can experience the bliss of being in harmony with his or her ethical yearnings.

Felix Adler also goes on to say, I quote: Ethics is not just publishing a code of ethics. It is a responsibility given to every individual but led by top leadership. An ethical culture is one where actions from the top down are met from the bottom up. If you take accountability, accountability is a concept in ethics with several meanings. How many of us are accountable for what we do? How many of us understand the definition of accountability? Accountability is defined as, A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about As past or future actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct. In leadership roles, accountability is the acknowledgement and assumption of responsibility for actions, products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences. Albert Einstein once said, I quote: The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time after time given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Truth, Goodness, and Beauty..The ordinary objects of human endeavour -- property, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible. Having spoken of all this, we also know that Socrates is on record as saying, I would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and live. Where he meant that our character is in our own hands, though our destiny be not; the conviction that our business is to look to the quality of our life, which we can affect, and leave its quantity or its duration, which we cannot affect, to the inscrutable power that animates the world. When our time for entering the silence comes, when our final day comes, we are to go, as the poet says, not like the quarry slave at night, scourged to his dungeon,. It must be through the consciousness that we have in our infinitesimal degree added to the achievement of the universe. Some touch of lasting good must be there that without us would not have been. When this challenge is met, then comes in every life its special moment. Then is to be said what Dante wrote at the beginning of his story, Incipit Vita Nova : Here begins a new life. For then the man or woman concerned has contributed to the world an element truly new, one that enriches it forever and is carried forward independently of him or her who originated it. Why I say all this and why I emphasize on ethics and accountability is that in todays world, we feel that all what we need to do is to amass wealth and fame. But, what we do not realize is that we do not carry any of these when we go. When we go six feet below the ground all what we leave behind is the name that we have earned; the goodwill that we have earned and very few people seem to understand it. That is why even in a small island nation such as ours, we have these scandals erupting,

2009 18 455 456

where people feel that if they have amassed wealth, they are leaving behind for their children that wealth without realizing that what they are leaving behind for their children is not the wealth but the name that they have earned as a cheat. Gautama Buddha says, Neither fire nor wind, birth nor death can erase our good deeds. So, how many of us aspire to leave our good deeds behind us? All we are running behind is driven by greed. So, unless these institutions and qualifications can inculcate in the human being the value of an ethical culture, we will end up only with people who have a long tale which they will not be able to take to their grave.

( . - ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan - Deputy Minister of Vocational Training) Thank you, Venerable Presiding Member. I am indeed very pleased to participate in this Debate. I must congratulate the Hon. Minister for bringing this piece of legislation, the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka Bill. First of all, I would refer to the speech of my good Friend, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti, who had many doubts about this Bill. Now, the CMA Sri Lanka was established based on the ISA guidelines and the CMA of Canada, the CMA of USA and other management accounting bodies in the region, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Therefore, I feel he should not have any doubts about the quality of education that CMA would provide to the youngsters. By introducing this legislation in Parliament today, we are recognizing CMA which is good for this country. As some of you are aware, CIMA is a very expensive qualification. Only the affluent can afford to do this examination. So the CMA will pave the way for more young Sri Lankans to become accountants. Venerable Sir, around Rs. 800 million is remitted annually by CIMA members to UK. This is a very valuable foreign exchange. Therefore, we need to have better governance in the management and direction of some of these foreign qualifications operating in this country, to ensure that the Sri Lankan interests are safeguarded. We know what is happening with regard to CIMA. There are some problems. I am personally aware that CIMA of UK has intervened in the management of CIMA where the Council stands suspended as of today. Not only that, they have gone to the Supreme Court to solve their problem. They have approached our Ministry to bring in a piece of legislation like what the Minister, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane has done today. I must also appreciate Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala for making all efforts to make this a reality. Today, accounting is not something which is very unfamiliar to this region of the world. Accounting has been a tradition for centuries and centuries. I am personally aware that there is a trading community in Tamil who are called Chettiars. They have a perfect accounting system. They account up to the cent. In the past, they have been managing huge businesses not even with these qualifications, but with accounting knowledge and skills. Therefore, our people are really efficient and can go through these and become very good accountants. Venerable Sir, I am not going to go into the details of this Bill or as to what this Bill contains as members of the Opposition like the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti did.

Some of those things were agreed upon at the Consultative Committee meeting yesterday. I do not know why he had to bring up all these again in this House. I think our Hon. Minister was good enough to agree to most of his suggestions in every respect of the legislation. This is not a personal thing of anybody. It is only for the benefit of this country that this piece of legislation is being introduced in this House today. Therefore, there are no hidden agendas in this. We must understand that. Nobody has a hidden agenda in such a piece of legislation; it is open to everybody. Anybody who has some aspiration could have brought any sort of amendment which we could have agreed upon at the Consultative Committee meeting yesterday itself. Now, let me look at the good side of this Bill. Venerable Sir, today, we from our own Ministry, the Ministry of Vocational and Technical Training, have already set up a university for vocational technology. I think that too came before Parliament and there was opposition. You can go on opposing everything, but you are going to achieve anything ultimately. Therefore, whatever is good for the country, you must all agree and support the cause. According to the statistics available, there are 120,000 students who, after the Advanced Level Examination, are eligible to enter university. But, how many of them could gain entrance into the university if the maximum intake will be 20,000? So, what are we going to do with the balance 100,000 students who want to pursue their higher education? There are so many ways. Our Ministry, the Ministry of Vocational Training, absorbs a portion of them. But, there are a lot of others who want to pursue their studies abroad. Take for instance, the international schools in this country. There was lot of opposition when the international schools came into existence about 25 to 30 years back. But anyway, people overcame that opposition and established international schools. There are more than 10,000 to 15,000 students studying in international schools. Venerable Presiding Member, if those 15,000 students were not accommodated in the international schools, they would want to enter the top schools in this country. By paving the way for these students to enter international schools, we are giving the children of the other poor people, the people who cannot afford to send their children to international schools particularly in Colombo, an opportunity to gain admission to a good school. Therefore, as rightly pointed out by the Hon. Minister of Higher Education, we must open new avenues, expand and bring in more and more new educational systems into the country so that students can study in those places. Now, foreign education has become too expensive. If somebody goes from an international school to study in a foreign country, I think a minimum of Rs. 10 million will be the cost for the whole duration of the course. We will save all these monies in the country if we promote

2009 18 463 464

institutions like CIMA. These institutions have to be regulated to ensure the security of the students who are attending these or studying in these. In this respect, our Ministry, the Ministry of Vocational Training, plays a very vital role registering them and also giving some guidelines. The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka Bill taken up today is a good piece of legislation. I think this will open up avenues for a lot of people and I see that the mediums of instruction are Sinhala, Tamil and English. I think initially it will be in Sinhala and Tamil because they say that the Advanced Level Examination is conducted in Sinhala and Tamil, and finally it will be in English. I would urge the authorities or the governing Council of this Institute to coach them in English too in the latter part of it. Otherwise, it will be difficult for them to switch over from the vernacular language into English. They must give some sort of a training in English also or allow them to continue their education in Tamil as well as in Sinhala up to the final stages. One good aspect I see in this is the fees. I understand it will be about Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 for the entire course of study, whereas CIMA is costing more than Rs. 400,000. I do not know about the Institute of Chartered Accountants, but I believe the fee is very expensive. I represent a community from the plantation sector where the standard of education is a little lower than the national level. We have a lot of problems. Our student population in the universities is very much less than that of other communities. I do not think even 1 per cent of the students of our community is reflected in the university student population. Therefore, we will have to look at providing so many other avenues for those students to pursue their higher studies. Another thing is, it is also due to economic reasons in our sector. You know that the income of the people in the plantation sector is the lowest in the country. The parents of those students cannot afford to give them education. If they cannot gain entrance into university, they will have to go for alternative fields. Our Ministry is training them in so many fields and trades. But, we cannot do that in the field of accounting. So, I would urge the council members and Prof. Lakshman Watawala to consider expanding this institution into other areas so that people can qualify themselves in CMA, which would give them a better living and an opportunity to find better pastures here as well as abroad. According to the figures and statistics given by the previous speaker, this country needs more and more qualified accountants. When education is given at an affordable price, I think we will have more qualified people. Every institution, every business needs good, qualified accountants to manage it. Look at the Golden Key Credit Card Company. What happened to that? There were

qualified people, there were a lot of qualified accountants, but it has crumbled down like a pack of cards and that has created enormous problems in other spheres as well. When just one huge company like the Golden Key Credit Card Company crashes, it affects even the small businessman. Therefore, we must also think of bringing in some other method by which qualified accountants will be called upon to perform their duties perfectly according to the rules and practices laid down rather than follow what the bosses of the companies say, instructing them, do this, do that. If the accountants or the qualified people had run or managed the company perfectly in accordance with the practices, I do not think what had happened to the Golden Key Credit Card Company would have happened. They could have saved it. I commend this piece of legislation that is before the House and I hope everybody will extend their fullest co-operation to pass this Bill. Thank you very much.
