Brief Note for the use of Hon. Prime Minister Confidential HOTEL DEVELOPERS (LANKA) LTD The Hotel Developers (Lanka) Limited is Limited Liability Company established on 11th March 1983 and is the owning Company of the Five star Hotel under the name and style of Hilton Colombo. The Company has two foreign Collaborators namely Mitsui & Company a Company incorporated in Japan and Taisei Corporation Limited also a Company incorporated in Japan. The authorized share capital of the Company is Rupees 600,000,000/= divided in to sixty million shares of Rs. 10/= each. The share capital of the Company is 45,226,141/= ordinary shares issued and fully paid amounting to a share capital of Rs. 452,261,410/=. The share structure is as follows Names of Shareholders No. of shares held % of shares held Government of Sri Lanka 29,388,470 64.98 Mitsui & Company Limited 5,946,100 13.15 Taisei Corporation Limited 5,946,100 13.15 Takashimaya 553,125 1.22 Public 3,392,346 7.50 Total 45,226,141 100.00 The Company in order to carry out the business of hotel has entered into a Management Agreement with Hilton International Co., a Company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware of the United States of America, having its principal office and place of business at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, 301 Park Avenue, New York, N Y 10022, U.S.A. The initial operating Term under the agreement expires on 31st December 2007.

Share Transfer Agreement Cornel & Co. transferred 25,388,463 HDL shares to the Government to secure the Governments guarantees to Mitsui and Taisei, pursuant to the Share Transfer Agreement dated February 24, 1984 between Cornel & Co. and the Government. Government Guarantee The Government executed a letter of guarantee dated January 31, 1984 in favour of Mitsui and a letter of guarantee dated January 31, 1984 in favour of Taisei (collectively, the Government Guarantee), guaranteeing to Mitsui and Taisei the performance by HDL of its obligations under the Loan Agreement. In Sept. 1990, Mr. Nihal Sri Ameresekera, a director of HDL, filed a derivative action in the District Courts alleging that the Hotel has not been constructed according to the original plan and obtained Enjoining Orders preventing the Company from making payments to the Japanese Lenders/Contractors and also from publishing the Accounts. In March 1992, the Supreme Court upheld the Enjoining Order issued by the District Court. In June 1995, Settlement Agreements were signed between Mr. Nihal Sri Ameresekera, Mitsui and Taisei and the Government and the loan was substantially reduced and rescheduled. The implementation of the Settlement Agreements which were entered into on 28th June 1995 have been enjoined in some related Cases filed in the District Court of Colombo and the Commercial High Court. However the Court of appeal on 30th March 1999 varied the enjoying order permitting the payment to be made to Mitsui & Taisei Corporation. The rest of the Settlement Agreements remains enjoined. Settlement Agreement Currently several Cases are pending against the Company pertaining to the Settlement Agreement signed on 28th June 1995 and on the directions of His Lordship the Chief Justice, these were considered for a negotiated settlement by the Hon. Attorney General. However since a settlement could not be reached, it has now been decided to commence the trial with a view to settling the issues before the Court. Attorney Generals Views : In view of the several cases pending in various Courts including the Supreme Court, we have sought the views of the Attorney General and he is of the view that the issues raised in the question are sub-judice and that the Parliament could be informed accordingly. Copy of his letter dated 27th December 2006 which elucidates the above position is attached. 2 GENERAL TREASURY , .. 1559, SA/CH/6/50 DEPARTMENT OF STATE ACCOUNTS My No - 01 , , .. . 1559, . ............. 01.

Hon. Minister, My first Supplementary Question is this. You have tabled a Central Bank Report today. I am asking a question in relevance to the loan that has been taken by the Hilton Hotel because there is a huge outflow of foreign funds from the country. It is also misleading Parliament. Sir, I will from Chapter 1 of the Central Bank report under the title, Economic, Price and Financial System Stability, Outlook and Policies. It states, I quote : Towards the latter part of the year, the second wave of the global financial crisis, which originated from the sub-prime mortgage issue in the United States, turned into an unprecedented global financial turmoil from September 2008 onwards, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Inc., which was a highly reputed major financial institution in the United States. The global financial turmoil triggered a reversal of capital flows from emerging market economies for safety, resulting in an outflow of approximately US dollars 120 billion from the Asian region within a short period toward end 2008. Sri Lanka also had to cope up with its share of sudden withdrawals of foreign capital by supplying almost 60 per cent of its external official reserves, which had been prudently accumulated to the highest ever level of US dollars 3.56 billion by end July 2008. .

Thank you, Madam Chairperson. I thought I will take the time to discuss matters in the financial area even though we are taking up a number of Items dealing with a mixture of activities. I am happy to speak after the Hon. Minister of State Revenue and Finance and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning on certain matters that have come up. But, I think the issue is that they have been speaking on many matters, but not on the main topic - the economic crisis. At this particular moment, I would like to mention first of all, the state of the economy. I think this is aptly reported in "The Sunday Leader" newspaper in its business column. There are 41 companies that have reflected their financial status and out of them, 40 companies have had a downward turn in their profits. So, this basically is a reflection of the economy that is prevalent today. Likewise, look at the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition. The Thriposha programme has been brought to a standstill. , 2009 17 "" " " . These are reflections, Madam Chairperson, of what is going on today. The reason for this is nothing else, but the Government's financial policies. There is no point in scolding the rest of the world when the control of the economy is in the hands of the present Government. Now the Finance Ministry is taking overdrafts liberally from Government banks, the two State banks. I would like to table*, with your permission, Madam Chairperson, a document that shows the overdraft facility given to the Treasury. * . . Placed in the Library.

According to that, the capital component is Rs. 37 billion and the interest component is Rs. 57 billion. This is as at 31st March, 2009. Rupees 94 billion is the amount that has been given only as an overdraft facility by the Bank of Ceylon to the Treasury. So, this is a temporary money-creation activity. Thereafter, they talk of financial discipline and say, The inflation is coming down and the investments are being helped with et cetera. How can it be? Contradictory policies have been spoken of. If money is being sucked in by the State banks and put in for Government expenditure, how on earth could money be there for the private sector? So, this is a clear reflection that it is contrary to what the two previous Government speakers mentioned. One was the Hon. Minister of Trade, Marketing Development, Co-operatives and Consumer Services, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane and the other was a Non-Cabinet Minister, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. They catch hold of 1 per cent of the economy, which was on a good, positive trend and then go on a trip of their own, saying how good things are. I think the most important thing, as reported once again in "The Sunday Leader", is that the banks reject the guarantee letter of the Secretary to the Treasury. This is a true reflection of the economy. Why is this happening? The Government is not trusted any more. Why? This had happened before when Dr. P.B. Jayasundara was there in the year 2000. The Government gave such letters to the two State banks, the Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon, and I can very well remember that one of them was for the CWE. When the Government decided to sell a loaf of bread at Rs. 3.50 and created a huge loss, that loss was borne by none other, but the CWE. The Government gave the promise, but it was carried out by the CWE. Finally, when they had to pay the money and they had cash problems only they sought refuge from the Secretary to the Treasury. At that moment, the Secretary to the Treasury gave a letter saying that that loan would be converted and it would be taken off from their books. But finally, the Treasury relegated that particular promise. As a result, today the guarantee letters of the Secretary to the Treasury are just thrown into the dustbin. It is quite understandable because from an institutional point of view, the banks are saying, We do not get money. We will have to face the problem and if you are able to take us down that road, then you virtually tell us, 'Please do this wrong act and take the brunt of it.' This is what is basically spoken of and when we ask them to give a positive answer to that, they say, . . 14, 1,400 . , 84 . 50 122 14,000 . ? , .

It states: Central Bank says No devaluation No IMF bailout Just like that, in January Mr. Nivard Cabraal said that we do not need IMF assistance. In the same way, the Hon. Minister of Finance who just spoke and left the House said that we have no financial problem, but the world global financial problem is leading us into a crisis. What is he trying to say? Does he think that we are a group of nursery kids who do not understand what he is saying? These are the very reasons that lead us into an economic crisis. Now in this process, the reason why they are going to the IMF is also being distorted. The IMF loan is a bailout to ensure that we get monies to overcome our cashflow problem with regard to the balance of payment. But, there are some Ministers who say that this money will be used to develop the Eastern area, that this money will be used to develop the road network of this country and it will be used to develop the education system of this country. Either the Ministers are ignorant or they are told to lie and they make fools of themselves. The real situation is that there is a huge drop in the four main sources of getting dollars into our country. One of them is our commodities: tea, rubber, coconut and the agricultural sector which includes cinnamon. There is a huge drop in the prices. When my learned Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella was the Minister of Plantation, rubber prices were going up to Rs. 250, Rs. 300 and Rs. 350. Now, it has come down to Rs. 110.

That is a significant drop. Likewise, the tea prices that were hovering in the range of about Rs. 350, Rs. 400 and Rs. 450 are now drowned in the range of Rs. 250 to Rs. 275. So, this has led to a huge reduction in foreign exchange coming into the country.

The second thing is the drop that has taken place in the area of tourism. . . [ ] . , . . 75 80 full . . So that is another reason for the drop in foreign exchange earnings of our country.

The third one is the remittances that are coming in from overseas. People go overseas not for the love of anything but for the simple reason that there are no jobs in this country. So they go overseas and send money to this country. But, now that has reduced almost by about one-third.

The fourth factor is the problem faced by the textile industry. The textile industry is something that leads into all these areas. Whether it is the factory direct or a hotel, it can be an airline, it can be the shipping industry, it can be a small boutique that is outside the area which is helping and providing self-employment; all of them get affected owing to the fact that the textile industry has a huge direct and indirect employment factor. Everyone has a reproduction facility of about four indirect employment opportunities.

So, all these have got caught up for the simple reason the Government decided that the Labour GSP should not be pursued by them. We, in this House, begged for approach and let the Opposition and the Government get together and speak on this. But, they just wrote it off by saying, We do not want your assistance. Today, because of this, the textile industry is facing a big problem. It is moving into India, Bangladesh and to various countries where they feel secure and safe and could get those benefits. Why? The Sri Lankan exchange rate is overvalued. The real effective exchange rate in this country, which is tabulated by the Central Bank itself should be in the range of Rs. 141 - 145. This is not said by us. This is said by the Central Bank Research Section. That should be the actual rate keeping in line with other Asian countries, our competing countries that have effectively devalued owing to the financial turbulence. The reason is that on 26th September, 2008, the Governor of the Central Bank said that we are not caught up in this crisis owing to the strength of "Mahinda Chintana." . . ?

26 . . I will read out the relevant portion. It states, I quote: Towards the latter part of the year, the second wave of the global financial crisis, which originated from the sub-prime mortgage issue in the United States, turned into an unprecedented global financial turmoil from September 2008 onwards, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Inc., which was a highly reputed major financial institution in the United States. The global financial turmoil triggered a reversal of capital flows from emerging market economies for safety, resulting in an outflow of approximately US dollars 120 billion from the Asian region within a short period towards end 2008. Sri Lanka also had to cope up with its share of sudden withdrawals of foreign capital by supplying almost 60 per cent of its external official reserves, which had been prudently accumulated to the highest ever level of US dollars 3.56 billion by end July 2008. Then, Madam Chairperson, if that is the case, you are facing a serious situation whether information has been wrongfully provided to this Parliament. When it was told then that there would be a financial crisis, if we accepted and actioned at that particular moment, we would not be in the predicament that we are in today. Today, we are on bended knees before the IMF for the simple reason that there is nobody else giving us money. You would see that on the 10th of February, 2009, the Central Bank had 48 people going on roadshows worldwide, going from the developing countries like Malaysia, India, Hong Kong, et cetera to the developed countries like the United States of America, Australia and Japan to collect money. Then, it was tagged on that the Central Bank would cash in from the waves of patriotism; to go after patriotism bonds that are being basically looked at in the development of the country. It was targeted to raise US Dollars 600 million and what happened? They toured for 10 days, came back and got only US Dollars one million. That is all. So, US Dollars one million is one six hundredth of what was to be achieved. That is the net result of the financial prudence of our country. What happened thereafter? Just about a week ago, during the New Year holiday, again the Central Bank team went worldwide. I do not know whether they go for holidays, or to collect money or what is the motive behind it. Now, we would like to know how many millions of dollars have been collected. I only hope that they will be able to collect some money at least to pay the hotel bills; the reason being that the external balances are dwindling and the trade balance has reduced; roughly there is a gap of US Dollars 3,000 million. Then, they vehemently denied the liability on the hedging deal. They said that we do not need to pay for this particular transaction. But, finally according to the media yesterday, they were compelled to pay Rs. 92 billion for which the banks have refused to accept liability. So, Rs. 92 billion is virtually almost another US Dollars 1,000 million. Likewise, with the differential that exists with the reduction of commodity prices, with the foreign remittances coming in, you are roughly running into about US Dollars 6, 500 million in the balance of payments. Now with this, you have to have about two

months' reserve in hand which roughly works to about US Dollars 2,200 million. So, if you effectively look at the status at this moment, you would realize that the Government must collect at least US Dollars 7,500 million. If the IMF, which is spoken of at this moment, is giving US Dollars 1,900 million, then from where is the balance going to be made? Is that not one of the conditions that the IMF has put in? They say, If you want money, we will try to assist you. But, please tell us from where you are going to get the balance money. If a part of the money that is required to get the country out of this mess comes from the IMF, then where does the second lot of money which is almost US Dollars 6,000 million come from? That is the sad situation where the answers are not coming forth. On this particular score, I would like to mention about the fundamental functions that the Central Bank is supposed to perform. They are: Public Debt Management, Foreign Exchange Management, Acting as an apex agency for micro finance programmes and development credit schemes of donors and Management and Administration of the Employees Provident Fund. Besides the four functions that are of a critical nature, there are some other core functions to ensure that the Government financial policies are carried out. Three of the four functions which I have spoken of have miserably failed at this particular moment. The fourth one, which is the administration of the Employees Provident Fund, is no better. Inflation in this country on a year-on-year basis has been around 26 per cent and they have been paying the employer - you and me, both - only 11 per cent. In short, we are having a negative return. Is this also not a fundamental flaw on the part of the Central Bank? ; . . . During the last four to five months, the country required US Dollars one billion to defend the Rupee. That is why you had a huge run on the foreign reserves where it has reduced from US Dollars 3.56 billion to almost US Dollars 800 million today. You are accepting that position now but when we said it earlier, you did not accept. How are you going to open LCs tomorrow or the day after? They are going after currency swaps all over. The Malaysian currency swap was taken for three months on a LIBOR plus 3 per cent and it is coming to an end by the first week of May. Are they ready to have US Dollars 200 million as a swap for the loan that was given? Are they going to extend the period again or are they going to the HSBC to get another loan? If the IMF delays to give this loan, who is able to provide the necessary comfort factor to the banks to open LCs? This is the reason why we said, Do not borrow from the HSBC. How can you borrow a loan at 9 per cent interest while having revenue sufficient to pay only at 1 per cent? A cost benefit analysis needs to be done. From the ICICI Bank and the Standard Chartered Bank you

2009 20 1297 1298

took about US Dollars 800 billion and today you are unable to meet the debt amortization cost. That is why you are going before the IMF. So, in this august Assembly, we will ensure that this burden is not passed on to the people. This is why the United National Party has very aptly and correctly said that if the Government is able to borrow from these institutions at a price that they feel is payable, then ensure that the banks get the money from them. We are not going to put the burden on the people with such an extensive interest payable since we know it is not possible to pay back. That is the actual situation. There is no answer to this question. When we say this you will say, You are working against the national interest. We do not care. Our national interest is in the people of this country. If they are unable to pay the money in this instance, then it is nothing but right for us to point out and say that the reason for doing this is nothing else, but a political expedition for their own thrill at the expense of the people. So, on this score I would like to ask, what are the IMF conditions that are being fulfilled at this moment? Are they doing anything? They are the ones who mentioned to us - . . 2009.03.03 . ? 78 63 . . . . . . 19 "" . : " " ? ? 11 18 . ? ? . ? ? . , , , . . IMF . . . , 2009 . ? . ? . . ? . IMF , " . '' . ?

I will heed your advice. Just give me two or three minutes more. On the same score, the private sector is on the brink of an absolute disaster today. You are going to reduce the five and a half day-week of 45 hours to 40 hours. What is the prime reason behind this? There is no production ability in this country. When there are no orders, the companies get underutilized. As a result, they will ensure that less is paid to the employee or the next step is to terminate the service: they are doing both. They are trying to reduce the 45 hours to 40 hours. As a result, the earning capacity of the workers will get reduced. Next, they are giving an opportunity for voluntary retirement. For this they have asked the Commissioner of Labour six months' time during which they can terminate any employee without questions being asked. Now what is happening? Is this not a Government that was trying to protect the rights of the workers? It is the UNP that did this by strengthening, fortifying and improving the economy and ensured self-employment opportunities; the economy was bountiful, investors came into this country. Today, investors are not coming. There is an outflight of investments from this country. That is the real situation. So, as a responsible Opposition, we are always contributing to the well-being of the people. All we want to ask is, what is the macroeconomic policy of this Government? Do they have one? Do they know of one? Today, the way the Ministers in this House spoke on the Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill saying that this money can be brought into the Consolidated Fund and spent on anything, shows their lack of knowledge in carrying out duties entrusted to them. On that score, where else do we have hope in this country? The Committee on Public Enterprises is paralyzed. The Public Accounts Committee is non-functional; it is politicized. The Auditor-General of this country has said that there

are institutions that are corrupt, inept, inefficient, overstaffed and underutilized. Those reports are staring at our faces. We are doing nothing about it. As an accountant, I am sad and shocked that this Parliament is abdicating and relegating its powers. This derelict responsibility needs to be held by somebody. Where is the Minister of Finance? There are 111 Ministers here. But, nobody seems to be able to take this into command and move forward for the development of this country. There, you might as well have 25 effective ministers, like what the United National Party intends having in the very near future. We obviously have to take over an absolute mess that has been created, and there is one thing that has got to be mentioned. The United National Party - ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Member, can you please wind up now? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Madam, give me just one minute. The United National Party is the only party that ensures economic development in this country. In 1948, the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake brought Independence to this country and he governed the country financially well and it was a country emulated by many till 1956. In 1956, the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike took over the country and led it to an economic disaster. In 1960, the late Hon. Dudley Senanayake took over the country, developed it agriculturally and moved it forward till 1970. Then the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirima Bandaranaike - the First Woman Prime Minister - took over the country and led it into queues and economic ruin till 1977. Then the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa, the late Hon. D.B. Wijetunga, your father, Madam Chairperson, and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe developed this country till 1994.

Then, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga took over the country and economically ruined it till we had a negative growth of 1.5 per cent in 2001. In 2001, we took over the country, developed it in 26 months and the development was so rapid that Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the JVPers and the Jathika Hela Urumaya got so worried that a 72-month Government which was to be, was brought to an end in 26 months. That sin is still being paid for. Today, if this economic plight is not corrected, it will lead us to bankruptcy. So, I hope and pray that this would change. This is the time that we should be working together. Of all the 111 Ministers, we can see only two at the back. But, none of them are able to competently handle the financial area. This is the state of play that is going on today. So, we are speaking; they are not listening; people are paying the price and all of this comes into the war euphoric atmosphere.

Let us take matters into our hands. This is our future; this is our country. In developing this country, if we do not show what the deficiencies are, do you think our neighbouring countries will tell us that? No! So, this is the opportunity we have got to protect our economy. Ensure that the consumer is not burdened with any more taxes. That is why we reject the Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill unless and otherwise the money is used for the soldiers. If it is used for them, we have no problem. Their salaries are still what was given long ago. The death payments and other compensation are still what the late Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali obtained for them in 1984. There have been no changes to those. It was Rs. 100,000 then and it is still Rs. 100,000. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up your speech now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Certainly. So, we must ensure that they are respected. But, the most important thing is this. Let us win the economic war first, then we will win all wars. So, Madam, I heed to your advice and thank you for giving me this opportunity. Let us ensure that we walk the talk. There is no point in speaking here if nobody is listening and nobody is actioning. So, let us ensure that the economy is protected and we move from strength to strength. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . , [ ] .
