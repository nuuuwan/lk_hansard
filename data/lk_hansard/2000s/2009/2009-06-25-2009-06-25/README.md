, . . , . . , . . . . . . . , . . . . . . , . Sir, permit me to continue in English. Now, this Bill provides for the appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff to co-ordinate the activities between the armed forces and the Ministry of Defence; for the establishment of the Committee of the Chief of Defence Staff; - .- and provides for the functions of the Chief of Defence Staff. The important thing, Hon. Prime Minister, is that this will give legal status to the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence to execute the powers which are vested with the President as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. That is what exists today. Of course the Committee is there today as well but here, we are legalizing the situation. Now, the most important thing is that the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence becomes virtually the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. We have not seen that earlier even though informally he exercises certain powers. Today we are giving legal status to the Secretary. That is, when the totality of the provisions of the Bill is taken into consideration, he is the authority from whom all actions will flow. According to the Bill, the Chief of Defence Staff will only play the role of a co-ordinator. That is just a decoration, I think. I do not know whether there is provision for somebody who is not necessary to be the head of one of the forces, to be placed in a high position. But, the important thing is, it is the Secretary who will run the show. At a glance it creates the impression that it is a legislation to give more powers to the Chief of Defence Staff. I mean, that is what the Bill states. This Bill is ultimately going to give full powers to the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. At present, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence is only a financial controller. That is the legal side of a secretary, because he is responsible to Parliament with

regard to all monetary matters. But with this Bill, he gets all the powers. At present, he has no powers to order deployment of troops or to open military camps. As referred to earlier, he could cause these actions with the powerful position that he now enjoys. In reality, the powers to do so are vested legally with the commanders of the armed forces. The commanders of the armed forces are the people who decide on the deploying of troops, recruitments and other actions within the three forces. Then, Sir, the Bill - of course, it will become law, there is no problem - makes it virtually impossible for an officer from the Public Service to function as the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. It shuts out the Civil Service. Any person outside the defence circle will have no chance to become the Secretary. It becomes clear when a complete study of the Bill is done, that a person with military experience is required to be the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. This means the post will always be for a retired military officer. In the past, there has been a clamour throughout that civil personnel be appointed as the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. Then Clause 2 (1) of the Chief of Defence Staff Bill states, I quote The President shall appoint from among the persons presently serving as Commander of the Army, the Commander of the Navy or the Commander of the Air Force as the case may be, an officer to be the Chief of Defence Staff. Well, the comment that we have to make on that is, this in effect shuts the door for retired military officers who are deemed fit and proper to be appointed as Chief of Defence Staff. That is just a comment. This is in contrast to the appointment of commanders of the armed forces where the President as the Commander-in-Chief could appoint a person he deems fit and proper. In this instance, only a serving Commander of the Army, Navy or Air Force will become eligible to be appointed as the Chief of Defence Staff. Clause 2 (2) of the Bill states, I quote: The Chief of Defence Staff shall function under the direction, supervision and control of the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister in charge of the subject of Defence......... This provision is both important and significant. For the first time in the post-independent era of Sri Lanka, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence is being placed on top of the commanders of the armed forces and the Chief of Defence Staff. Now, this is the point which I am trying to drive at; that the Defence Secretary becomes all powerful, not the commanders of the three armed forces. This Bill seeks to give sanction, authority to that. On the other hand, this places severe restrictions on the functioning of the Chief of Defence Staff. Although there is a postion of Chief of Defence Staff, it is the Secretary who wields all the powers. The Chief of Defence Staff would only perform under the

1193 1194

[ ]

direction, supervision and control of the Secretary. So, it is merely creating another position in the Defence Ministry. On the other hand, the powers previously exercised by the Chief of Defence Staff and all the commanders of the armed forces particularly with regard to operational aspects, will now be vested in the Secretary to the Ministry of the Defence. The relevant provisions very clearly spells out how the Secretary becomes all powerful. Clause 10(1) of the Bill states, I quote: At the request of the Secretary, an officer or servant of any public corporation may, with consent of such officer or servant and the governing board of such public corporation, be temporarily appointed to the staff of the office of the Chief of Defence Staff for such period as may be determined by the Secretary, on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the governing board of such corporation. That is what Clause 10(1) of the Chief of Defence Staff Bill states. What we have to say about that is, this provision will permit the Secretary to absorb into the office of the Chief of Defence Staff any employer from any State corporation or statutory board. In other words, any Government supporter - now this is what is most important - could become a member of the apex military authority. He could first be recruited by a State corporation or statutory board and later seconded to the staff of Chief of Defence Staff by the Secretary. This will be a mechanism to recruit political cronies including retired officers. This will further politicize the armed forces hitherto we were trying to keep independent. Clause 12(1) of the Bill states, I quote: The Minister may, in consultation with the Secretary, make rules generally for the efficient functioning of the Ministry of the Minister in charge the subject of Defence, and in particular in respect of the following matters:-" Clause 12(1) (a) and (b) deals with the dress code and the conduct and duties and functions of the officers. Here, once again the Secretary will be empowered to exercise an undefined and wider range of powers through this provision. You see the provisions are very carefully drafted and put into this Bill indirectly giving the sole authority to the Secretary. This is on the grounds that they are required - of course there is very good terminology, "for the efficient functioning of the Ministry ...." The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence will have, in other words, very wide powers. These observations are only made to have a deeper study of all the provisions of this Bill. Then Sir, there is another aspect to this. Clause 3(1) states, I quote: The Chief of Defence Staff shall, subject to the pleasure of the President, .... - it is mentioned by the Prime Minister - " ..for a term of two years." - and there is an amendment coming into that.

After that, further appointments to be made on the will and pleasure of the President. Now, the comment that we have to make is the tenure of the Chief of Defence Staff is being restricted to two years - subject to the amendment - with the President having the powers to re-appointment him in a time of public emergency. This clearly shows that the term of the office of the Chief of Defence Staff at the end of two years is subjected to a time of public emergency. This, together with the provision debarring the Chief of Defence Staff holding his substantive appointment, further devalues this office. Those are matters of interpretation. Clause 8(2) states, I quote: The Secretary may also recruit staff if it be so necessary for the office of the Chief of Defence Staff, in accordance with the administrative regulations. Then, Clause 8(3) states, I quote: Where armed forces personnel are deployed for service in the office of the Chief of Defence Staff......." - from the three forces. There, what we have to say is, for the first time the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence is arming himself with powers to select State officers - you are moving away from all rules and norms of Public Service - to be posted to this apex military authority. The office of the Chief of Defence Staff, in addition, is also arming himself to select military officers for secondment to the office of the Chief of Defence Staff. Wide powers with regard to the Committee and the office that is going to function in the Ministry of Defence is centred round the Secretary. This Clause is dangerous because as observers have said, it could be the beginning of a rapid politicization of the armed forces. We are not against the Bill but the fact that there is a gap provided for politicizing the administration and the control of the armed forces. That is the complaint that we would like to make to this House. So, the House must consider this because this is very, very important. Of course, the country has got rid of terrorism and now we are moving towards peace. But, we will never know at what stage that there could be emerging threats that would come on this country, whether it be terrorism or any other form of danger that may emanate. In such situations, I cannot be happy with some of these provisions giving enormous and unlimited powers to the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. , . . , . . . . . .

. . , , , . , ! . . [. . 11.50] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am following, Sir, my good Friend, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa who made a rather fiery speech. But, I shall be quite calm in my presentation. The office of the Chief of Defence Staff is one that exists even today. It is not something new. But, by virtue of this Bill, it is being given a legal status. Clause 5 (a) to (n) specifies and defines the powers of the Chief of Defence Staff. I do not have the time, Sir, to deal with the various powers vested in this office, but when one reads Clause 5 (a) to (n), one can see that the powers are very wide, powers are all-encompassing, dealing with a multitude of aspects and indeed has a very, very wide range of powers. If one looks at Clause 2 (2) of the Bill, Sir, one finds that the Chief of Defence Staff will function under the direction, supervision and control of the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister in charge of the subject of Defence. There is no reference to the Defence Minister in the Bill or in that Clause and the Defence Minister, as we know, at present is the President of the country. The Hon. John Amaratunga dealt with this question at some length and I do not propose to deal with it any longer. When one looks at the rationale behind the Bill, one would see what all this thinking about is and why all this strategy is being formulated. Do you have some external enemy, any neighbouring country, whom you are worried about? I do not think so. I do not think this country has any external enemy. You probably think that you have an internal enemy. You have vanquished your internal enemy. I think everyone in the world today accepts that the LTTE and their military force no longer exists. But then, still you seem to think that you need an internal enemy or will have an internal enemy. Why do you think like that? Why are you being paranoid? When one looks at the rationale behind this Bill, one begins to think that you want to extend the war-psychosis in this country and then in fact you are being paranoid and you want this war-psychosis to continue. We do not want it to continue. The LTTE is over. The LTTE has come to an end. We want that to be a final end. We do not want violence in

[ ]

2009 25 1211 1212

this country any longer; not from the Government, not from the armed forces, not from the LTTE or from anybody else. Sir, when one looks at this whole Bill, one begins to think that there is a desire on the part of the Government to continue with the militarization of this country and that is something we are not happy about. Of course, you have the armed forces in this country today. What percentage of the armed forces represent the minorities in this country? The Tamils, Muslims and Malays are almost 25 per cent of the country. Almost 97 per cent, 98 per cent, 99 per cent of the armed forces personnel belong to the majority community. According to the media, you are going to recruit a further 100,000 to the armed forces. Are you going to recruit 25 per cent Tamil-speaking persons - Tamils, Muslims - or, are you going to create once again entirely a majoritarian armed force? I would very strongly say, Sir, that the LTTE must not be made an excuse or a justification for further militarization of this country and to preserve this concept of militarization, everything is being done with a military dimension. There is a Tamil question in this country. There is no question about it but it must be dealt with politically. The Tamil question cannot be dealt with militarily. There can be no military solution to the Tamil question. The Tamil question must be dealt with politically. It would be a grave mistake for anyone to think that the Tamil question can be vanquished militarily. It certainly cannot be. It will never be vanquished militarily. It must be dealt with politically across the negotiating table and there must be a solution to that question. And, I do not think a Bill of this nature or a law of this nature which seeks to further militarize the entire environment in this country and bring even all political processes under some form of military control, can ever contribute to a solution of the Tamil question. I think that must be very clearly understood. I want to further state, Sir, that the non-emergence of an organization such as the LTTE can be ensured only politically and not militarily. You are trying to militarize the environment; you are thinking that the Tamil population can be subjugated militarily and this must inevitably, at some point of time in the future, lead to a situation where there would be the emergence of yet another military organization. But, if you would deal with that question politically and arrive at a political solution, you will negate the need for a military solution and there can be peace and tranquility in this country. Sir, I want to say that we want demilitarization; we want our people to live in peace, we want our people to move freely and we want to carry on our occupation, farming, fishing, animal husbandry and cottage industries. We do not want the entire area to be militarized. We want our social and cultural activities to take place in an environment of peace and tranquility, not in a military environment and we, therefore, insist upon demilitarization. Militarization was an inevitable result

of the presence of the LTTE, but with the LTTE no longer being there and no longer being a military force, there is no need for further militarization. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Hon. Member, your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Yes, Sir, I am concluding. I was glad to read in today's papers that with regard to the food and medicine sent by the Tamil diaspora, particularly from the UK, the Government has agreed to land these items and distribute them to the IDPs. There are in all 531 pallets containing food and medicine, worth Sterling Pounds 85,515. I have got a copy of the invoice with me. We are thankful to the Government for taking that step. That is a good step. We are thankful to the Government of India for requesting the Sri Lankan Government that that step be taken. We want to thank the diaspora for having sent those items to these unfortunate people. We would also request the Government in furtherance of the good steps you have taken to take steps early to have these items distributed amongst the IDPs in Vanni and elsewhere. Thank you, Sir.
