Can you answer question No. 9 (b) (ii)? If you can tell me the profit of the last three years of the CPC, that would be sufficient. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

In 2005, the profit was Rs. 9,840 million; in 2006, the loss was Rs. 1,602 million and in 2007 the profit was Rs. 3,984 million, up to September. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Right. Can you respond to Question No. 9 ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Borrowings from domestic banks as at 11th December, 2008 was US Dollars 206 million and from the Indian Line of Credit Exim Bank, India as at 30th November, 2008 was US Dollars 77 million. The total, was US Dollars 283 million. The CPC bears the exchange loss. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

The CPC bears the exchange loss. Hon. Minister, I would like to ask the present profit. There is a huge profit being made.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

That was up to last September. Now, we are running at a loss. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Running at a loss ?

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Why? Are you paying the bill for the 110 ministers or what is it ?

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

No, that is because of taxes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Tax is that have been imposed by the Ministry of Finance on CPC ?

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Right. So, prior to the imposition of the tax, you were making a juge profit ?

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Prior to that we had made a profit even without a subsidy. On that basis, we had been losing on several items like kerosene and diesel. We made profit on petrol and on various other items like bitumen and selling of chemicals and all that.

2009 19 531 532

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, You are making unconscionable profits. Today the price of barrel of crude oil is US Dollars 44. That means, you can import a litre of petrol at Rs. 37. So when you sell it at Rs. 122, are you not unconscionably making a profit of 354 per cent ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

I am sorry, I am not making any profit. I told you I am losing. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am sorry. I mean prior to the imposition of taxes. You made that profit. Is that not so ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

You, as the Cabinet Minister, must have the courage to fight in the Cabinet. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Prior to the imposition of taxes, how can I ? If I add the taxes - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Do not answer and lose your job. Give an answer protecting your job. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

If I add the taxes, it is Rs. 83.37 on petrol. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Do not add Minister. You tell the profits before the imposition of taxes. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Before the imposition of taxes, there is no profit. We are making a profit of 90 cents on every litre of petrol that we are selling; from octane 95 we are making a profit of Rs. 3.72; then, from kerosene we are making a profit of 75 cents; from auto diesel we are losing Rs. 2.69; from super diesel we are making a profit of Rs. 8.97; from fuel oil 180 category - we are losing Rs. 8.02 and from fuel oil - 380 category - we are losing Rs. 5.38.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, According to your own conscience, this is an unconscionable price that you are charging. India has now reduced it to almost Rs. 75 or Rs. 80. Why are we doing this and putting an undue burden on the consumer as well as on the small user ?

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

I am losing. I am telling you and you are asking me why I am charging this price. Now, I explained to you how much money I am losing on this.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Your left hand is losing, but your hand is making a profit. I am talking of the Government of Sri Lanka.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

You will have to ask that from the Ministry of Finance.

Hon. Minister, I want to bring to your notice the anomalies in pensions. We are very old people. I am almost your age. I am 70 years now. Tomorrow I am completing ten years as a pensioner. But, I am getting a very meagre pension. All my friends who are of my age are retired Government servants. They are all writing and appealing to me and I am also getting a number of telephone calls regarding their pension. Their demand is to bring their pension on par with the new salary structure which came into effect in 2006. There is a big anomaly. Even last December, we had an Adjournment Motion with regard to this. Along with my JVP Colleagues, I also argued. But, you know, Sir, most of these pensioners are old people like me. They are sick, very feeble and unable to come to Colombo. We cannot even have an Udgoshanaya like the JVP boys.

2009 19 619 620

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

To present that case, our problem is that once a person retires he is given a pension based on the salary at the time of his retirement. Then, subsequently the Public Service Commission introduces salary revisions and so on but a similar revision is not made for the pensioners simply because it is a very large financial commitment. Next time I want to take up the idea given by some of you in the Opposition, to discuss with the trade unions so that if there is any salary increase it will apply to everybody; not only to the public servants, but the public servants and the pensioners will be taken together to see whether we can give a fair share of the salary increase to the pensioners as well. So I am very glad you mentioned it. When I was the Minister of Finance you will remember, I pushed back the year where they could be brought into the higher scale for remuneration. So we will continue to do that and I hope we can solve some of your problems. . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Hon. Minister, there is a precedence. Sir, in an earlier circular this has been granted. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

No, that was done once. But the question is, on principle, whether you could do it everytime there is a salary increase for public servants. You know there is so much of agitation. Can the Treasury afford to take another 600,000? There are 1.2 million Government servants and 600,000 pensioners in this country. Now, almost all the income of this country is being expended on salaries and pensions. So let us try to find the money. If there is growth and we become richer, then of course, we have enough money to pay. . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) I do appreciate that Sir, but try to do whatever possible. I know you have given 43,000 graduate appointments. You did it within a day. So, I am sure you will try to help us. The second thing is, Sir, I went to the Department of Pensions yesterday. Your people are very nice; they are very courteous, very helpful and very cooperative. But you must update and you must fill all the vacancies. Most of these people come all the way from remote areas and spend their time there. The officers are trying their level best. Some of the management assistants and clerks are very efficient. They must be given due promotions. The Management Service must be upgraded like those days.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Now, the Head of the Pensions Department is the Director-General of Pensions. I fully agree with you and I want to take this opportunity to thank my Secretary and the Director-General of Pensions and their staff for all the good work they have done. Although we get praised in this House, it is due to our officials who have done a lot of work and I fully appreciate your comments that we must fill the vacancies. I will do that as early as possible. . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Thank you. [.. 3.08] . ( . ) (The Hon P. Ariyanethran) , , , . 35 - - . . . , 40 . , , , . . 2010 . , , . .
