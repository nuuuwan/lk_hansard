( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. There was a reference made to the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that the information I provided to this House was incorrect. With your permission Sir, Standing Order 85 (iii) is utilized to mention this. Todays "Daily Mirror" newspaper refers to that particular state-ment. The Minister may have not read the newspaper. May I read it, so that he will comprehend what I have been saying?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I know that you can read English. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I hope you understand the English in it. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) My point is whether you can comprehend it properly. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. I hope you too can do the same. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) The issue is, even if you read it over a hundred times, what I said remains as stated in the "Daily Mirror" itself. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What you said is that it was not granted and here it is said that it was refused. That is the difference. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I never said that it was not granted; I said that there was no refusal. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You said that it was not granted.

2009 11 2579 2580

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I never said that. I said that there was no refusal or rejection. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, there is no point in trying to make a debate out of this issue when a clear refusal has been mentioned. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Now, we are arguing about the English language here.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Canada as well has refused to issue visas to 40 po-licemen. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Sir, we are getting on to a debate on English. I main-tain the position that there was no refusal or rejection of visa for the former Foreign Secretary by the British High Commission. The Daily Mirror confirms that position.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, may I read it because either he does not under-stand English or - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Under which provision of the Standing Orders are we talking about this subject now? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , : "Britain insists no political bias in visa process I table* this article which appeared in the "Daily Mir-ror" of 11th September, 2009, for inclusion in Hansard.

: : Newspaper article tabled: Visas Britain insists no political bias in visa process The British High Commission in Colombo, in a statement yesterday said that while it expedited visa applications for senior political and official figures from Sri Lanka and other countries it did it in accordance with British immigration rules and it could not issue free visas for per-sonal visits. The suggestion that there is any political bias in our visa application process is completely unfounded. We never comment on individual visa applications, but many of the details of the various cases reported are incorrect, Acting High Commissioner Mark Gooding said responding to recent news reports of political bias in the handling of visa application. While the statement did not make any direct reference to a particular incident over allegations of political bias, it was issued a day after it was reported that the British High Commission in Colombo had refused to issue a visa to outgoing Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona. In all cases of VIP visits, the High Commission works closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to try to ensure a smooth service, and we look forward to continuing this co-operation, the British High Commis-sion said. Daily Mirror earlier reported that Dr. Kohona had submitted his passport to the British High Commission for a visa to London but to his surprise the passport was returned without any valid reason. The Foreign Ministrys Chief of Protocol, through whom Dr, Ko-honas passport was forwarded to the British High Commission, later sought an explanation for returning the passport but a High Commission official had reportedly told the Foreign Office that the Foreign Secretary should be personally present at the High Commission to obtain the visa. However the Foreign Ministry had insisted that Dr. Kohona had no reason to be personally present at the High Commission to obtain the visa as he was the Foreign Secretary of the Country, government sources had told Daily Mirror online. The Foreign Ministry had later again sought a visa to London for the Foreign Secretary, but the second at-tempt too was rejected with the High Commission saying there was not enough time to process the visa. An angry Foreign Ministry, which insisted that the application was forwarded with 24 hours notice, had made several attempts to contact the British High Commissioner and his deputy to seek their intervention but they could not be contacted over the telephone, the government said. Meanwhile, the main opposition UNP said yesterday that the refusal by the British High Commission in Sri Lanka to issue a visa to the for-mer foreign secretary and current MP had seriously damaged the reputa-tion of the country. Mr. Ravi Karunanayake MP (UNP) told a news conference yester-day that this was not the first time that government officials had been refused visas. He said that the governor of a province had also had a visa application to the UK turned down recently. He said no one would be able to leave the country in the near future if this trend continued, as the Sri Lankan passport would lose its validity. Mr. Karunanayake said that there was no point in blaming anyone for this as it was the government which had created such a situation: The government could blame anyone but it would be pointless, he said. He said the government had turned a deaf ear to the offer made by the UNP to work together to build up the reputation of the country: It is possible to resolve these crises if both the Opposition and the Govern-ment get together, he said. Referring to the state of the economy, the UNP MP said that salaries of both public servants and private sector employees should be in-

2581 2582

creased. He said that private companies were of the opinion that the UNP worked for them but this was not so as the party had to be with the common man. He charged that SriLankan Airlines employees had been asked to work four days without pay as the airline was running at a loss, while Lak Sathosa was also bankrupt, with losses amounting to more than Rs. 60 million. Mr. Karunanayake said some ministers considered these to be minor matters. He said they could not afford to take these things lightly as this issue would have negative effects on the countrys economy. In the first paragraph it is stated that they could not issue free visas for private visits. Therefore they are unable to issue the visa which is mentioned in the second paragraph.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) That is stated in general. There is no reference to this. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This shows that the Hon. Minister has misled Parlia-ment. All I said was that the Foreign Secretary was not issued a visa. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) But, there is no mention of the Foreign Secretarys name. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why not? It is mentioned here. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Where is it? You tell me. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will read it out, otherwise you will not be able to understand this. I quote: The British High Commission in Colombo, in a statement yester-day said that while it expedited visa applications for senior political and official figures from Sri Lanka and other countries it did it in accordance with British immigration rules and it could not issue free visas for personal visits. ' The suggestion that there is any political bias in our visa application process is completely unfounded." It further states, I quote: However the Foreign Ministry had insisted that Dr. Kohona had no reason to be personally present at the High Commission to obtain the visa as he was the Foreign Secretary of the Country, government sources had told Daily Mirror online."

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You go by what the British High Commission has said. You are adding more.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The paragraph continues to state, I quote: The Foreign Ministry had later again sought a visa to London for the Foreign Secretary, but the second attempt too was rejected with the High Commission saying there was not enough time to process the visa I am asking whether there is any interpretation required when it is very clearly stated in the article itself ? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) How can you interpret what is stated in black and white?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Did he go to UK or not? Did he not go to New York via Dubai?- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Sir, this is very important. So, I will make use of the right of reply. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Did he go to UK? He went to New York via Dubai. He called you and you said, Do not tell the newspapers. And, what happened? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) How do you know he telephoned me? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How do I know? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Yes, tell me your source. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are from the United National Party. We are look-ing after the affairs of the Foreign Ministry. This problem

2009 11 2583 2584

has been going on for the last two years. I told you not to recall the Foreign Secretary to Colombo. - [Interruption.] It is the call that you got just before he boarded the plane.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, there is a serious suppression of material by my learned Friend in reading or quoting the very statement that appeared in the "Daily Mirror" of today. My learned Friend omitted a very important word in this statement while quoting in his own way. Now, I will come to what my learned Friend has omitted because he has suppressed material facts from this House and led us to believe that there was a refusal of visa. Now I quote what the Daily Mirror states today. I will start from the beginning of the article because I would like to read what my learned Friend has omitted to read deliberately. I quote: The British High Commission in Colombo, in a statement yes-terday said that while it expedited visa applications for senior politi-cal and official figures from Sri Lanka and other countries it did it in accordance with British immigration rules and it could not issue free visas for personal visits. The suggestion that there is any political bias in our visa application process is completely unfounded. We never comment on individual visa applications, but many of the details of the various cases reported are incorrect,....." Now, this is what the Acting British High Commis-sioner, Mark Gooding said responding to recent news reports of political bias in the handling of visa applica-tions. He has said that allegation is unfounded and you, Hon. Member, deliberately omitted the word, "unfounded". That word is the running and the most op-erative word in the entire press release that appears in todays Daily Mirror. And, Sir, there is no mention of Dr. Palitha Kohonas visa or of any Foreign Secretarys visa being refused by the British High Commission in the statement issued by the Acting High Commissioner, Mark Gooding. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, it is a travesty of justice. What the Hon. Minister mentioned is also untrue. I read a part and tabled the entire newspaper article due to lack of time. But, he took out only one word from the text. All what was stated there was that the Acting High Commissioner of the British High Commission had very clearly mentioned in the recent past that there have been instances of refusal of visas and that comment had been made upon that. It did not refer to Dr. Palitha Kohona. But, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs went further and said that it has been refused but there is no reference to that in what you read. They said that Dr. Palitha Kohonas visa had been refused on two occasions. If you read the article, you will find that. Hon. Speaker, I do not

want to make a big issue on a small matter. But, the impor-tant matter is that the European Embassies and the Canadian Embassy are refusing to issue visas to Government officials.
