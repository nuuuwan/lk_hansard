    "text": "His demise has been a loss to very many other people in this country who had come to know him even beyond his family circle. The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle was in every sense of the word, a colourful personality who contributed much liveliness to the environment in which he was present, whether it was the Parliament, a meeting in the Hon. Speakers Chambers or a meeting in a Committee Room. I must say that persons who were more closely associated with him in the several activities that he was engaged in would have felt the impact of his presence even in a much greater way than those of us who had only a limited contact with him. He was not merely a colourful personality, Sir, he was also a very forceful personality. One could feel that when he made a point, he made it with passion, with conviction and in such a way that he would persuade others to come round to his point of view. There can be no doubt that the fact that he was a very colourful personality and the fact that he was a very forceful personality, had a great impact on the ordinary people in the country who came to know him and who came to associate with him. He was a member of the minority community both ethnically and religiously but he was able to represent a district largely populated by the majority community. He returned to Parliament on more than one occasion quite comfortably scoring his victory without much difficulty and in Parliament, from the position of a Member of Parliament he rose to that of a deputy Minister, a Minister, then a senior Minister and eventually became the Chief Government Whip of the Government. His ascendancy in politics was indeed meteoric and perhaps, given a few many more years in political life, one might have expected that he might have even ascended to greater heights. He was a very affable person; a very amiable person; a very likeable person and a very pleasant personality most willing to be helpful to anyone and everyone. It is a matter of deep regret, Sir, that the life of this very valuable person was snuffed out quite early in his career. I wish to, once again, Sir, associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the other Hon. Members of this House, and once again convey my very deep condolences to Mrs. Fernandopulle and the children, and to the large number of people who loved and respected the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, and request that a copy of the proceedings of today be forwarded to the members of the family. Thank you, Sir.",

Sir, to be frank, I was in Kalutara but I thought it is my duty to come and speak a few words on the late Hon. Fernandopulle because ours was not a normal relationship but something which was spectacular. Sir, I would start by mentioning that I got to know Jeyaraj Fernandopulle in 1994, at a time when the Peoples Alliance was being put to place and they were trying to get the assistance of Mrs. Srimani Athulath Mudali in the formation of a government. Many people have spoken wonderful things about what he has done and what he has said - some truthfully, some hypocritically and some for the sake of saying so - but I thought I must stand up and speak because we were on two different sides and many thought that we were at one another, when it was quite not that sort. I found that he has been a Colleague of ours for 14 years, a friend, a foe at times, but more than that, he was a human being. He sometimes called me and said, Ravi, you are a new advent in politics but you must understand that politics has been engraved in me for 25 or 30 years. So, you have got to realize certain things and there was a certain instilled discipline in him, which I appreciate. Furthermore, I found in him what I found in myself: that he was a person who was loyal to his party. That was the point I think, where both of us clicked. As much as we were engaged in political debates with one another, at the end of the day, he realized that whatever he did was done on behalf of his party which he cherished, nurtured, fostered and he did his very best. Likewise, he found that I was one of the same; the same thing that he did for his party was what I was doing for my party.",

Dissanayake and Mr. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, all of them, called in on Mrs. Srimani Athulath Mudali when I happened to be there. I saw the intelligent and charismatic approach of his in trying to lure Srimani into politics and he succeeded. He felt that what Lalith then did and what he spread at that particular moment was necessary to be included into the heterogeneous alliance that was needed to form a government. So, that was his start. From there onwards, he got elected successfully into Parliament. I got elected",

Almost within a year, the first major problem that the Peoples Alliance Government faced was the electricity crisis. I can remember vividly how all of us, the Hon. Dilan Perera, the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle and the late Hon. Nalanda Ellawala, had to put our best effort together because the backbenchers or as it was then called, the \"Mulberry Group\" had to play a pivotal role at that time. You had Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte who was unable to cope up with the situation that was placed before him and Jeyaraj decided to take the helm on and said, Let us give the leadership and speak to the strikers. There was no electricity in the country for three to four days and we managed to successfully get them on to think from a rational point of view. That is where I saw the real \"politician\" in Jeyaraj. Thereafter, we successfully managed to solve the crisis and then he saw the ability of the backbenchers. We were talking of many things and were trying to put things together. Unfortunately, Chandrika Kumaratunga certainly did not do justice to Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. A talented man was not given his rightful place. I say this not with any malice but with an absolute sense of sincerity. I can remember when there was an opportunity coming in, Jeyaraj walking out of that door said, \"Rightful places are not given to us\". Later, that was communicated by some very senior people - I can point out the Hon. Fowzie because he was also a person trying to bring unity into the party - and within two weeks time, he was made the Deputy Minister of Finance. At last! He was rewarded in a certain way. From there onwards, he knew that it was a team-play that was going on. But then, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga decided to take the DUNF on and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Srimani Athulath Mudali was spotted and she was sacked. That was the time the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, the Hon. Felix Perera and the Hon. Dilan Perera came to me and said, Ravi, we need the DUNF. Srimani has been sacked. Why do you not take the Cabinet portfolio? I appreciated Jeyarajs honesty. He said, We know what you can do. But I said, Look Jeyaraj, if you can do that to my Leader, you can do that to us. So, I am not interested. Why do we not go forward?",

    "text": "led to a situation which was absolutely false. Even though he had to say that with privilege, he decided to go outside and tell the same thing and that was where he erred. Since I had to protect my integrity, I went for a defamatory case. That led to a debate that took place in Swarnawahini and that is where I thank Jeyaraj Fernandopulle for bringing me into active politics. I was only a national list MP, a rather subdued professional who came into politics. At the debate that took place on the privatization of Sri Lankan Airlines which came out from Parliament to the open forum, Jeyaraj said, You are a politician who has come in through the back door. If you want to show your ability, I challenge you, contest the Colombo District and get one more vote than me\". So, being a Young Turk at that time, challenges could not be easily refused. I took the challenge on. He got 122,000 votes and I got 148,000 votes. So my dear Jeyaraj, it is nothing but right for me to thank you for bringing me into active politics and at a time when politicians are looked upon as absolute rogues, hypocrites and timeservers, I thought there is a necessity for me to come and give a different blend to politics and I am sure, next to God, Jeyaraj has played a very significant role in bringing me into active politics. Now, you would see as to why I came all the way from Kalutara to speak of a Friend who left this world untimely for the better and whom we miss dearly. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thought I will go down memory lane because otherwise, you will miss certain things. With the advent of time and having been in court, he realized that he had erred, made a grave mistake in the challenge that he put forth in trying to oppose me. So one day a couple of our friends got together and there he said, Why do we need to take this to court when we can solve it amicably?\" So, he being a political Colleague, we thought we should forget the past and I certainly accepted his spontaneous response and unconditional apology, and from there onwards it was a different approach, a political friendship. This is where I think Chandrika did not stand by him. Information was given, poor Jeyaraj was led in the garden path and when the problem stood tall against him, nobody was there to defend him. We could have made mincemeat of it, but that was not our intention. That is the spirit I think in which a political opponent should be acting. Today, it is the winner who takes it all. People are unable to say something against another; it is not that you get a democratic response but you get lethal death threats. Sometimes death threats go even beyond that. The Hon. Fowzie, an amiable person of generous disposition has been sometimes receiving threatening calls. If he, as a Cabinet Minister gets those calls, imagine what we would get as Opposition Members? This type of political degradation needs to be corrected and I am sure if Jeyaraj was there, he would have been fighting for this injustice. He certainly was a person who took merit into case because he was a person who was able to discharge responsibilities with efficiency. So he thought that merit was the basis in taking a person forward. Then, after seven years in the Opposition we had the opportunity of coming into",

    "text": "Government in 2001. I hope I need not speak about what happened at the time when I was in the Government and he was in the Opposition. He had many friends, and at many times when he needed assistance he used to call me and the job was done. Even if it was regarding schools - I can still remember his son - whether it was St. Thomas' or whatever, we just helped each other. His wife used to call my wife when it comes to tuition. That was the friendship that we maintained. The reason why I am telling you this is because many tried to project that Jeyaraj and Ravi were bitter enemies which was completely false. He had a sense of belongingness to his party, like what I have for my party. But, at the end of the day it was all good fun and good intentions. That should be the spirit in which we should take forward politics in this country. Now, it has just come to an absolutely degraded situation; we have guys who are the scum of the earth represented in this Parliament, who have made some of us shameful to say that we are Members of Parliament in Sri Lanka. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I can still remember when we were in the Government, he called me and gave me very solid advice. He said, Do not trust people. They come for their own personal gains. They will take you on at the first available opportunity. That happened to me during the SriLankan Airlines Debate. I waved aside certain things in front of you and finally when I had to be rescued, nobody came to assist me. So, with that, within 26 months our Governments life ended; we went into the Opposition and he came into the Government. Then he, from being a Minister became the Chief Government Whip. I remember him taking part in the peace process and I think he was one person who had a very clear, imaginative mind to think that this country belongs to the Sinhalese, to the Tamils, to the Muslims, to the Burghers and to the Malays. That fitted exactly in line with the thinking of the United National Party. He said, I may oppose the UNP on many fronts but there is one point, one fundamentally correct point that it is absolutely correct. So, he not only held that view but also professed that during the peace process. While the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva may have held one view, he had the courage of conviction to say, \"No\" and go beyond that and tried to show that this country belongs to all of us and not just to one race. Unfortunately, the discussions did not go in the manner that was expected and finally it ended up in disaster. But, till his death he held that view. He virulently fought in areas where terrorism had to be eradicated like I do, like my party does. But, he also believed that there was a necessity for a political settlement and that was where he realized the strength of the UNP, the sagacity of Ranil Wickremasinghe and the forwardness of our party. Unfortunately, he called a spade a spade and this earned him enemies within his own party. Today, I think there is much more done on the untimely death of Jeyaraj. Many are still puzzled as to how it happened : whether it was a brutal, spineless, barbaric or a terrorist group had done that or whether it was another lot. We need to get to that point. There are many people who",

    "text": "miss him with the only idea that somebody has done it. That is not good for a country that believes in democracy, for a country that has Buddhism as its main religion. So, I think justice needs to be done and I hope that will be done soon. Today, we basically miss his sense of humor, quick-wittedness, and sometimes his sarcasm, especially in the mornings when Oral Questions are asked and Answers provided. I think that was a very interesting time. When I used to ask Questions and the way Jeyaraj responded, I guess, became a treat to the rest of the others thinking whether we were really fighting or whether we were friendlily fighting. So, I thought it is my duty to take you through the 14 years of my knowledge of Jeyaraj. I think he was ably assisted by his beloved wife, Sudharshani. He was passionately fond of his two children, Samurdhi and Bhanuka. I sincerely hope that his good intentions and the good work carried out will be continued and remembered in the future. So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for permitting me to speak a few words and hope the sentiments will be sent to his beloved wife, Sudharshani, his children, Samurdhi and Bhanuka and to the other memebrs of his family. I hope the party treats the family of Fernandopulle in a much more deserving manner than what is shown at this particular moment. Jeyaraj did a lot for his party and I hope that will be appreciated by the party. We, from the Opposition certainly appreciate the manner and courage with which he took forward certain things against someone. That is what we believe in politics. That is the democratic answer. But, eliminating in a non-democratic manner is not something any of us would ever accept or basically believe that it should be an answer against any. So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thank you very much and all we want to do is to convey the sentiments back again to Mrs. Fernandopulle, to Samurdhi and Bhanuka. May Jeyaraj rest in peace! Thank you.

His roaring sound of arguments so brilliantly articulated reverberates yet in our ears.

    "text": "I could recover from the deep shock. I felt that I was robbed of a friend whose friendship I had been enjoying for over three decades since the day of his appointment as the SLFP Organizer of the Katana Electorate. He was basically an ideal Sri Lankan who was a dynamic personality. Although he belonged to the smallest of the ethnic minorities in Sri Lanka, he stood tall enough to cut a place for him among the majority community and he represented the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Muslims alike. He spoke eloquently in all three languages and he saw commonality in all religions and never hesitated to help the followers of all religions. His prime concern was the welfare of the common masses. His demise at the critical hour in the development of Sri Lanka is an irreparable loss to the whole country. A great son of Sri Lanka, he was a shining star in the political arena who bravely stood the test of time. Within a short span of time he rose to be one of the main players in the political chessboard and his continuous effort was to unite the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims as one nation. He was a genius in politics and an advocate of human rights, democratic values and peaceful resolution of conflicts. He was conscious of the fact that he belonged to the minority community but he understood the ground realities of the ongoing ethnic problem and worked hard towards reconciliation and peaceful co-existence with all communities. He proved himself as a leader of great stature and capability during his eminent Parliamentary career as a Member of Parliament, as a Minister and as the Chief Government Whip. He won the admiration of all the communities, the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims and was loved by all. He always stood up for what was right and just and he paid the supreme sacrifice in pursuit of his noble ideals. It is an irreparable loss to the whole country. I join the Members of this House in conveying my deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Dr. (Mrs.) Sudharshani Fernandopulle, to his children and other members of his family. Thank you.
