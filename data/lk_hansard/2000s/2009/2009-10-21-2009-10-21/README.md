( - ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare) Hon. Speaker, I table* the Answer.

* : : Answer tabled: (a) (i) Yes. (ii) Yes. (iii) No. (iv) Yes. (b) (i) No. The decision taken is to pay wages relevant to their period of employment, but not as compensation. Workers have returned to Sri Lanka on their own will and a need for paying compensation does not arise. (ii) On complaints lodged by them, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment summoned the foreign employment agency and got them to agree to give the contracted employment, pay the arrears of wages and for facilities according to the agreement immediately, and the workers were informed of the decision accordingly. But, the workers vehemently refused to work in the Maldives any further. Because of this, action cannot be taken against the employment agency, but the employment agency was ordered to provide air-tickets to bring the workers back and pay the arrears of wages. The employment agency had provided the air tickets and brought the workers back to Sri Lanka. Only four of the workers have consented to accept the arrears of wages and the letters posted to the other two have got returned to the Bureau. (c) Not relevant. : : DOCTORS ENGAGED IN PRIVATE PRACTICE DURING OFFICE HOURS : DISCIPLINARY ACTION 0527/09 9. ( ) ( - - ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake - on behalf of the Hon.

Sir, the UN-HABITAT journal states, I quote: Innovative Approaches for Involuntary Resettlement Lunawa Environmental Improvement & Community Development Project In Sri Lanka today, as in many other developing countries, there is a growing urgency to come up with creative and sustainable solutions to tackle the twin pressures of infrastructure needs and the interests of communities who are affected by such projects, often losing their homes, land and livelihood in the process. Rapid industrialization has catapulted Colombo into an economic hub, however this has also severely damaged the environment where one of the worst victims of industrial wastewater pollution is the Lunawa Lake. The lake straddles two adjoining Municipal Councils: Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia and Moratuwa. Continued discharge of waste water into its waters over the years wreacked havoc, killing most of the fish and the catchment area suffers from frequent flooding, due to an inadequate drainage system. Today, the Lunawa Lake catchment area is the site of an innovative initiative called the Lunawa Environmental Improvement and Community Development Project. The project, getting off the ground in 2001, is the first project that translated Sri Lankas National Involuntary Resettlement Policy into practice. This landmark policy, adopted in 2001, paved the way for the Lunawa model which validates the twin objectives of environmental improvement and community revitalization. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . The strategic partnership of three key institutions - the Government of Sri Lanka, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and UN-HABITAT with the common aim of treating the involuntary resettlement as a development opportunity gave the project a categorical success. UN-HABITAT was the lead adviser on the community development component of the project. The use of an NGO to socially market a package of interventions to communities who were going to be affected in order to break down the distrust they harboured towards Government agencies was too a pioneering initiative by the project. Then, I would like to quote Benthotha Silinona, a mother of five. I lived in an unauthorized structure along the canal. Though I paid municipal taxes, the land was not mine. After settling in Hike Terrace, I have now a piece of paper certifying ownership of the plot on which my new home stands and soon I will have the land deed. I liked my old house. But nothing can beat the pride I feel in living in a legally authorized colony. , . . , .

We continue to engage with the international community on a range of issues of mutual concern relating to the IDPs, resettlement and livelihood projects. Our engagement has included a series of meetings and

interactions both in Sri Lanka and overseas about which I informed the Hon. Members on 8th October, 2009. Due to these interactions, the international community is beginning to show some acknowledgment of the improvements that are taking place in the post-conflict scenario in our country. For instance, the British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, speaking in the House of Commons on 13th October, 2009 acknowledged the improvement of sanitation facilities and cases of malnutrition having markedly decreased in the welfare centres for the internally displaced. However, there were concerns expressed, and notwithstanding that, some countries do continue to express concern on a range of issues relating to the IDP facilities. From my perspective, there is clearly a need for a greater degree of understanding by those countries which do not appreciate wholly the challenges faced by Sri Lanka in the aftermath of over three decades of brutal terrorism. Hence, our engagement has sought to secure a greater appreciation of these challenges and tangible assistance to address the very issues which mutually concern us. The resettlement of persons in their original areas of habitation and the resultant decrease in numbers in the IDPs to less than 250,000 is being appreciated by many quarters. The issuance of IDs to over 160,000 persons and the completion of registration of all IDPs over 12 years have been noted. We are confident that the targets set for clearance of 58,000 for resettlement by end October will be met. Dry rations and an allowance for the reconstruction of shelter for the returnees have been provided. The notable progress made in the health sector with the reduction of the annual mortality rate to less than 4.4 per 1,000 in the welfare centres in Vavuniya, which is compatible with any other part of the country, symbolizes the significant achievement in stabilization of the health facilities for the IDPs. Almost 40,000 children are attending classes in welfare centres. The Government has facilitated 1,187 students to sit for the GCE (Advanced Level) Examination in August this year. This reflects the emphasis the Government places on the long-term welfare of the present IDPs. The fact that 166 of them were LTTE surrendees needs to be appreciated. Our interlocutors have also been informed of the contingency plan and flood preparedness to face the imminent North-East monsoon rains. The construction and improvement of the storm water drainage system in Vavuniya by the RDA and the District Road Development Authority, the Sri Lanka Army with the partnership of international organizations have also to be noted. The fact that drainage facilities in Zones 1 and 2 have been completed is appreciated. Over 50 per cent of the work in the other zones has also been completed, except Zone 7, where work is to begin very soon.

On de-mining which is a prerequisite for resettlement of IDPs, we have articulated Sri Lankas commitment to intensify de-mining. We have made the international community aware that it is the Government of Sri Lanka, through the expertise of the Sri Lanka Army, that has carried out over 70 per cent of de-mining. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , . The fact that the Government has disbursed large amount of funds to secure equipment for a speedier, mechanized de-mining process symbolizes the Governments commitment to de-mining and resettlement. In our interactions, we have emphasized particularly to those who call for a speedy resettlement, the need for tangible assistance in the de-mining process. Some have responded and the responses of others are pending. The certification by the UNHCR that the area is safe is a basic prerequisite before any resettlement can take place in an area. This is a rule strictly followed by the Government for the safety of our people. The sensitivity with which the Government is addressing the needs and difficulties of special categories of IDPs - the elderly, the clergy et cetera - by releasing them is also being appreciated. Up to now, over 10,000 people have been considered under this programme. So has the rehabilitation of former combatants including children. The well thought-out programme for rehabilitation of former combatants implemented at Ambepussa and Poonthottam with the partnership of UN agencies and other donors, we believe, will provide a fine example to be applied even in other post-conflict situations. Now, I will move on to another very important area in terms of the GSP Plus. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , .

With regard to the GSP Plus review process, on Monday, 19th October, 2009, the European Commission handed over to the Government of Sri Lanka its report on Sri Lankas implementation of three of the 27 UN Conventions relevant to its GSP Plus benefits, which were of concern to the European Commission. The Note from the Directorate General for Trade of the European Commission forwarding the European Commissions report to the Mission of Sri Lanka in Brussels stated, The Commission will now decide whether to propose a temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance provided for under Council Regulation (EC) No. 732/2008. The Note goes on to add, If the Government of Sri Lanka wishes to make any representations on this matter or specifically in relation to the Commission report in annex, it is kindly requested to bring these to the Commissions attention no later than 06th November, 2009... It would be recalled that the GSP Plus investigation on Sri Lanka by the European Commission was launched a year ago, at a time when the Government of Sri Lanka was on the verge of ending 30 years of terrorism in Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka did not participate in the process of the GSP Plus investigation and refused a request for experts to visit Sri Lanka as a matter of principle as it was felt inappropriate for Sri Lanka as a sovereign State to participate in such a process and unnecessary, given the numerous ongoing processes both between the Government of Sri Lanka and the UN system as well as between the Government and the European Union. While not co-operating with the process of investigation, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to engage with the European Commission on the issues of mutual interest through existing diplomatic channels, a fact acknowledged in the European Commission report. The Government of Sri Lanka for its part will continue to engage with the European institutions in keeping with the spirit of transparency and mutual respect that is appropriate to the historic and long-standing relationship between Europe and Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka, within the joint Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed by His Excellency the President, will therefore closely study the European Commission report and consider ways and means of addressing the issues in our continuing pursuance of securing the GSP Plus facility. Sir, I table* my Statement and also some portions of the Briefing Note on the outcome of the visit by the Members of the Indian Parliament from the constituencies in the State of Tamil Nadu to be included in Hansard in order to avoid time consumption. Thank you.

The issuance of IDs to over 160,000 persons and the completion of registration of all IDPs over 12 years have been noted. We are confident that the targets set for clearance of 58,000 by end of October for settlement will be met. Dry rations and an allowance for the reconstruction of shelter for the returnees have been provided. The notable progress made in the health sector with the reduction of annual mortality rates to only 4.4 per 1000 in the welfare centres in Vavuniya, which is compatible with any other part of the country, symbolizes the significant achievement in stabilization of the health facilities for the IDPs. Almost 40,000 children are attending classes in welfare centres. The Government has facilitated 1,187 students to sit for the G.C.E. Advanced Level Exam in August this year. This reflects the emphasis the Government places on the long-term welfare of the present IDPs. The fact that 166 of them were LTTE surrendees needs to be appreciated. Our interlocutors have also been informed of the contingency planning and flood preparedness in preparation for the Imminent North-East monsoon rains. Construction and improvement of the storm water drainage system in Vavuniya by the RDA and the District Road Development Authority, the Sri Lanka Army with the partnership of international organizations have also been noted. The fact that drainage facilities in zones 1 and 2 have been completed is being appreciated. Over 50 per cent of the work in the other zones have also been completed, except in zone7, where work is to begin very soon. On Demining, which is a prerequisite for resettlement of IDPs, we have articulated Sri Lankas commitment to intensify demining. We have made the international community aware that it is the Government of Sri Lanka, through the expertise within the Sri Lanka Army, that has carried out over 70 per cent of demining. The fact that the Government has disbursed a large amount of funds to secure equipment for a speedier and mechanized demining process symbolizes the Governments commitment to demining and resettlement. In our interactions, we have emphasized, particularly to those who call for speedy resettlement, the need for tangible assistance in the demining process. Some have responded and others are pending. The certification by the UNHCR that the area is safe is a basic prerequisite before any resettlement can take place in an area. This is a rule strictly followed by the Government for

the safety of our people. The emphasis Sri Lanka has placed on the demining of the Rice Bowl in the Mannar District and the progress made in demining the region by the end of October, in time for the cultivation season, Demonstrated the commitment of the Government, not only to resettle the people in the region, but also to facilitate the return to their traditional livelihoods. The provision of land, plant material, fertilizer subsidies and equipment for the returnees is part of the additional financial commitment of the Government to our people. We have emphasized to our interlocutors that returning the people to demined areas is only one part of the challenge and that, from their end, tangible assistance is needed such as for construction of permanent shelter and developing of livelihood programmes in the area. We will continue to engage our interlocutors on this area of necessary assistance. The sensitivity with which the Government is addressing the needs and difficulties of special categories of IDPs - the elderly, the clergy et al-by releasing them is also being appreciated. Up to now, over 10,000 have been considered under this programme. So too the rehabilitation of former combatants including children. The well thought-out programme for rehabilitation of former combatants implemented at Ambepussa and Poonthottam with the partnership of UN agencies and other donors, we believe, will provide a fine example to be applied even in other post - conflict situations. As the Hon. Members are aware, for the short, medium and long-term development of the areas affected by the conflict, the infrastructure is vital. Our interlocutors have been informed of the progress made in the construction of the Kachcheries, Divisional and Pradeshiya Sabha buildings, schools and health facilities. The establishment of major government institutions including the BOI is being considered. The banking facilities including development banks have been established, which has been noted by the interlocutors. The Hon. Members need to be aware that we have impressed on members of the international community the need to interdict anti-Sri Lanka activity by pro-LTTE groups which are inimical to Sri Lankas national interest. We have impressed on them that just as much as calls are being made by the international community for reconciliation in Sri Lanka, the international community itself must also desist from permitting or turning a blind eye to continuing inimical action by pro-LTTE groups. We have emphasized that such inimical action will make the political processes in Sri Lanka and national reconciliation much more difficult and complex. ( Rajaratnam) A Significant development was seen in the area of the LTTEs financing network. An individual named Raj Rajaratnam has been charged in the US on 16th October relating to insider trading involving hedge funds. This subject is believed to have also provided material support to the terrorist organization - the LTTE. The Hon. Members may be aware that investigations in Sri Lanka on the activities and support of Mr. Rajaratnam to the terrorist organization are continuing, particularly in relation to the funding allegedly provided by him to the LTTE front organization TRO. The FIU of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has stated that any suggestions that such investigations are concluded or that Mr. Rajaratnam has been cleared of possible involvement are incorrect and misleading. (GSP Plus) With regard to the GSP plus review process, the European Commission - EC- on Monday, 19th October, 2009 handed over to the Government of Sri Lanka - GoSL- its report on Sri lankas implementation of three of the 27 UN Conventions relevant to its GSP Plus benefits that were of concern to the European Commission. The Note from the Directorate General for Trade of the European Commission forwarding the EC report to the Mission of Sri Lanka in Brussels stated, The Commission will now decide whether to propose a temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance provided for under

641 642

Council Regulation (EC) No. 732/2008. The Note goes on to add, if the Government of Sri Lanka wishes to make any representations on this matter or specifically in relation to the Commission report in annex, it is kindly requested to bring these to the Commissions attention no later than 06th November, 2009 ........... It would be recalled that the GSP plus investigation on Sri Lanka by the European Commission was launched a year ago, at a time when the Government of Sri Lanka was on the verge of ending 30 years of terrorism in Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka did not participate in the process of the GSP plus investigation and refused a request for experts to visit Sri Lanka as a matter of principle, as it was felt inappropriate for Sri Lanka as a sovereign State to participate in such a process and unnecessary given the numerous ongoing process both between the Government of Sri Lanka and the UN system, as well as between the Government of Sri Lanka and the European Union. While not co-operating with the process of investigation the Government of Sri Lanka continued to engage with the European Commission on the issues of mutual interest through existing diplomatic channels, a fact acknowledged in the European Commission report. The Government of Sri Lanka for its part will continue to engage with the European Institutions in keeping with the spirit of transparency and mutual respect that is appropriate to the historic and long-standing relationship between Europe and Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka, within the joint Cabinet Subcommittee appointed by His Excellency the President, will therefore closely study the European Commission report and consider ways and means of addressing the issues in our continuing pursuance of securing the GSP plus facility.

Briefing Note on the Outcome of the Visit by Members of the Indian Parliament from the Constituencies in the State of Tamil Nadu H.E. President Mahinda Rajapaksa extended an invitation to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Hon. M. Karunanidhi on 11th June 2009 requesting the Chief Minister to consider sending a delegation of your choice. The President added the delegation would be able to ascertain at first-hand for themselves, developments in all parts of our country. Subsequently, the Government of India and the Government of the State of Tamil Nadu arranged in liaison with the Sri Lankan authorities for the visit to take place from 10th -14th October 2009. The composition of the delegation was:

1. Mr. T.R. Baalu, former Indian Minister for Shipping and Transport and DMK Parliamentary Group Leader in the Lok Sabha (Lower House) 2. Mr. A.K.S. Vijayan, DMK MP in the Lok Sabha 3. Mr. T.K.S. Elangovan, DMK Lok Sabha MP 4. Ms. J. Helen Davidson, DMK Lok Sabha MP 5. Ms. Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, DMK Rajya Sabha MP (Upper House) and daughter of Hon. M. Karunanidhi, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu 6. Mr. Thol. Thirumaavalavan, Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchchi (VCK) Lok Sabha MP 7. Mr. N.S.V. Chitthan, Congress Lok Sabha MP

8. Mr. S. Alagiri, Congress Lok Sabha MP 9. Dr. E.M. Sudarsana Nachiappan, Congress Rajya Sabha MP 10. Mr. J.M. Haroon Rashid, Congress Lok Sabha MP On their arrival in Chennai, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Mr. M. Karunanidhi himself went to the airport and received the delegation in a gesture which signified the importance attributed to the visit. Addressing a media briefing the same day, the Chief Minister announced according to the The Hindu edition of 15.10.2009 that following the visit of the delegation, the Government of Sri Lanka had assured that 58,000 internally displaced Sri Lankan Tamils in camps will be sent back to their native places in 15 days, while the remaining Tamils would return gradually. Countering the misinformation that the Government was attempting to change the demography of the northern area by resettling Sinhalese people in those areas, Chief Minister Karunanidhi had stated that President Mahinda Rajapaksa had denied that such a thing would happen. The salient features of the visit by the delegation include:

a. They were able to move freely and interact with the people accommodated at the welfare villages without any restrictions whatsoever. b. They were able to see for themselves the reality of the situation and observe the facilities provided and how the Government machinery is working in the interest of the IDPs. c. The people have, naturally, expressed their desire to return to their areas of residence, which is also the wish of the Government of Sri Lanka. d. The Government of Sri Lanka manifested its commitment to act in a spirit of transparency. The Government moreover in opening the welfare villages for scrutiny, demonstrated that the authorities have nothing to hide or to be ashamed of, since they are acting in good faith. The visit and its outcome may be viewed with dismay and disappointment by pro-LTTE elements across the world, which have been thriving by criticizing the Government of Sri Lanka. The visit has been successful in debunking the criticism against the Government of Sri Lanka. The confirmation that a large number of the IDPs would be resettled in the coming weeks, would also be a blow to the pro-LTTE lobbies.

When I go home via Valaichenai, I see that up to Valaichenai the road has been widened but from Valaichenai to Kalmunai nothing has been done. From Kalmunai to Akkaraipattu, the road has already been completed. I go home in my vehicle. It is very difficult to travel on this road because it is very badly damaged. They have dug small culverts and left all the stones along

2009 21 647 648

the road making it very difficult to travel. Every time after coming back from home, I hand over my vehicle for repairs. I went home and came back yesterday and today I sent my vehicle for repairs. So, the Hon. Minister must take some action in this regard. I understand that this work has to be completed before July. I am glad the Hon. Minister is walking in. Hon. Minister, I am speaking about the highway up to Batticaloa. Up to Valaichenai it has been completed, thank you very much for that. The road from Valaichenai to Kalmunai, which is about 80 kilometers, is in a very bad condition. The road is not even. In trying to do something, here and there they have dug culverts. I understand this work has to be completed before July next year, but I do not think they can do it. At the rate they are doing this work, I think it will take another five years to complete it. Hon. Minister, this is a very good time because we are having dry weather. I saw a lot of people working but the work is going on very slowly. Please look into this. . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. T. B. Ekanayake - Minister of Highways) You mean the Valaichenai Road? . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) From Valaichenai to Kalmunai is about 80 kilometers. You have to expedite the work on that. I heard that you have handed it over to a contractor and when I checked it up from the Road Development Authority they said, Yes, we have handed it over to a contractor. Even though they have handed it over to a contractor, they have to look into this and they must get this work expedited. Otherwise it is very difficult to travel on this road. The second issue, Mr. Deputy Chairman, is regarding the Kallady Bridge. It is on the other side that I stay, in the Southern part. There is another bridge, the Kallaru Bridge, and it has been fully completed. On the side that I stay, there is the Oddamavadi Bridge and it is reaching completion but they have not started any work on Kallady Bridge. They have just put some gravel there. I do not know when they are going to start and finish work on this Kallady Bridge. That is a very important bridge. So when I go home, everyone is asking me, Now what is happening to this bridge? So, I want the Hon Minister to look into this matter too and get this work expedited. I now get on to the projects under the Ministry of Nation Building and Estate Infrastructure Development. Sir, I find that most of the projects such as NECORD, NECCDEP, NEHRP are coming to an end within the next few months. But, this is the time opportune for them to do a good job of work in our areas because now only the people are being resettled there. Therefore, the Government, especially the Ministry of Nation Building

and Estate Infrastructure must take action to extend the time frame of these projects. I understand that the Asian Development Bank which is the funding agency of these projects is prepared to extend their time frame and it is up to the Ministry to do the spade work and get them extended. Once they are extended, I am sure the people will benefit much. The third matter on which I want to speak is about a project where I was employed. Earlier, it was called "NEIAP" and now they call it "Re-awakening Project". As you know this was a very good project. When I was working in this project, a team of officials - experts from the World Bank along with the Residential Representative of the World Bank - used to inspect the worksite every six months and they did monitor the project. If there were any lapses or shortcomings, they took immediate action to rectify it. We, as workers of that project, were on pins those days. But, now the NEIAP is not active as in those days. I read in one of the newspapers, that this project has contributed much towards the development of agriculture in the Eastern region as well as in the Northern region. Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am very much disappointed about the present situation. I am sorry that the Hon. Minister concerned is not here now. When I spoke to him before, he said that he would organize a meeting to review the progress of this "Re-awakening Project", but so far it has not been done. I checked up from the Secretary to the Ministry of Nation Building and Estate Infrastructure Development and he said that he would organize a progress review meeting in Colombo but I suggested that it should be held in Batticaloa because only then we can achieve some good results. Sir, these are the matters I want to bring to your notice. Thank you very much. [. . 1.17] ( )
