That has not been included in your Question. If you send me a new Question I will be able to get that. How can I collect all this information ? There are 17 universities and people pass out in large numbers. Sir, there are 72,000 students already studying in the university sector. They get into different areas of employment, get into different sectors. How can I in my capacity as the Minister in charge of the subject collect all this information ? It took nearly three months to collect this information and in terms of overtime, we have spent Rs. 25,000 to collect the data. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If I may ask the Question in another way. How many new degrees are brought in like insurance, banking, aviation et cetera ? . . ( ( ) . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala) You will have to ask from the relevant organizations, the Ministry of Labour Relations and Manpower or the Ministry of Finance and Planning as to how many graduates are employed.

Happuarachchi, ASP in charge of the Medawachchiya checkpoint on 3rd February 2009 while I was on my way to Mannar to pay a courtesy call on Rt. Rev. Dr. Rayappu Joseph, Bishop of Mannar that I need to get the Ministry of Defence approval even to go to the Government controlled areas of Mannar or Vavuniya. This position was reconfirmed by Mr. Asoka Wijeyatilake, DIG Anuradhapura when I contacted him over the telephone. Anyway, my PSO attached to the MSD had informed the MSD in advance that I was travelling to Mannar via Medawachchiya. When I contacted Mr. Sarath Perera, DIG, MSD over the telephone, he informed me that he has not received any written instructions from the Inspector General of Police or the Ministry of Defence about the necessity of getting Ministry of Defence approval for Parliamentarians to travel to Mannar or Vavuniya via the Medawachchiya checkpoint. I had to stay more than 3 hours at the Medawachchiya checkpoint and return back to Colombo. This was really an embarrassment. Anyway, will you kindly let me know whether you will grant me permission to go to the Bishops House in Mannar, in order to pay a courtesy call on Rt. Rev. Dr. Rayappu Joseph, Bishop of Mannar, again. I will be traveling in my jeep - vehicle number 65-565 along with my MSD security personnel and my security backup vehicle number LF 3990. Anticipating an early reply. Yours sincerely,",

Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am very happy to follow my Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana spoke of the importance of confidence-building measures. That, certainly is one of the priorities of our country today. I think, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that applies as much to the management of the economy as it does to matters of a political nature. I would like to inform this august Assembly of some of the current initiatives being taken by the Government to address the fallout from the global economic crisis and I can say that we are very proud of the measures which have been put in place so far. They will certainly go a long way to enthuse the Sri Lankan economy to provide support and encouragement for industrialists and in particular, exporters in this country. The Government has risen to the challenge, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. We recognize the gravity of the crisis, but we are not overwhelmed or captured by the difficulties. It is our intention to think of practical courses of action to minimize the damage that may be caused. This has been done in a very pragmatic spirit and already the results of that are evident in this way. This country has certainly not suffered anything like the dire consequences which have been felt in economies which are far stronger than our own. Just to give you an idea of the magnitude and the depth of the crisis, let us look at the figures. Up to last week 598,000 persons have lost their employment in the United States of America. More than half a million people have lost their means of livelihood. In the most powerful country in the world and in the most vibrant economy of the world, half a million people have lost their jobs. Only four days ago Nissan, one of the most successful companies in the world, announced that they were retrenching 20,000 people. Sixty seven thousand factories have been closed in China. That is the extent of the crisis which the world is facing today. Our Government, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, has taken stock of this situation and identified the measures that are necessary to deal with the adverse consequences of this situation. In order to do this, His Excellency the President, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, presented to the Cabinet a far-reaching programme of action which looks after every major sector of the economy. An economic stimulus programme has been devised and implemented and the",

    "text": "effect of that stimulus programme is to protect the Sri Lankan economy from this crisis. There are many measures which have been announced by the Government in order to support local industries. One of the most important incentives which the Government has given to exporters is worthy of mention in this House today. We have identified the two national priorities in Sri Lanka in light of this crisis. The first priority is to ensure that there are no job losses in this country. We have to protect means of livelihood. The second cardinal requirement is that we should maintain the same threshold of foreign exchange earnings, which the country needs. One of the basic proposals which we have announced is this, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. If a company, which exports products out of this country, is able to maintain the same threshold of exports as they did in the preceding year, that is 2008, and if it had not resorted to retrenchment of any workers, then that company will be entitled to an incentive payment of 5 per cent of the totality of their export earnings. This will provide a means of strength to companies and industries which are struggling at this time. They have done their part: they have not sent any workers home; they have maintained their levels of production and competitiveness and they have brought into the country the same volume of foreign exchange as they did last year. I think it is only right and proper that the Government should recognize the contribution that is being made to the national economy by companies of that nature and we think that it is an appropriate response for the Government to put at the disposal of companies which have satisfied these criteria substantial pecuniary benefits and one of these benefits is that they would be entitled to 5 per cent of the total sum that they brought in, in foreign exchange. . .

Of course, there may be other companies who for no fault of their own have not been able to comply fully with those stringent criteria. In the case of those companies, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Government will take action to give them 3 per cent of the total foreign exchange which they earn if they have been able to maintain a level of 90 per cent of the foreign exchange that they brought in last year and they have not retrenched workers in this country. So, in a situation where half a million people have lost jobs in the United States, 67,000 factories have closed down in China and 20,000 workers are retrenched by Nissan, which never did that at any time in their history, and when Toyota, a company with which we are all familiar in this country, for the first time in their history have declared a loss, I think due credit has to be given to the Government for coming up with a package of this nature which sympathetically and pragmatically addresses the needs of the Sri Lankan economy at the present time. I would like, if I may, to give some further details with regard to this package. The Cabinet of Ministers has approved an economic stimulus package to reward manufacturers engaged in value-added exports in managing their vulnerabilities and risks associated with the current global economic crisis. This was an initiative of His Excellency the President as the Minister of Finance, supported by my distinguished Colleagues, the two Deputy Finance Ministers. This scheme is administered by a Presidential Special Task Unit on Economic Development under the direction of His Excellency the President with the assistance of the relevant Government institutions and the private sector to facilitate and provide a coordinated support to ensure that exporters sustain their exports and the level of employment in global trade amidst the prevailing crisis. This scheme will assist export industries to secure their existing markets, penetrate new markets, establish and promote backward linkages, diversify and increase value addition, maintain the existing level of employment, compliance with environmental regulations, quality standards and other best practices in exports. Now, Sir, these advantages will be available to all exporting industries. It will not be restricted to apparel, ceramics or gems and jewellery; it is available across the board. This is the criterion.",

    "text": "quarter of 2008. The level of employment should be maintained as declared in EPF and ETF returns for the third quarter of 2008 without discontinuation. Proof from the bank on inward foreign currency remittance of proceeds of exports should be forwarded. This is referred to as the Export Development Reward Scheme. I think this is important because the lifeline of Sri Lankas economy is exports. It was a former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew who said that \"In the competitive world in which we live today a country must either export or perish\". So it is only proper that we place a very strong emphasis on the robust performance of the export economy of Sri Lanka and the Export Development Reward Scheme is one of the instruments that we are using in order to accomplish that objective. The Export Development Reward payment will be made in Sri Lankan Rupees in this way. Sir, there are two categories under this scheme. As far as category A is concerned, Export Development Reward equal to 5 per cent of export proceeds confirmed as received, will be paid to exporters who have received in each quarter of the current year, an equal amount in foreign currency as export proceeds as in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. With regard to category B, Export Development Reward of 3 per cent of the export proceeds confirmed as received will be paid to exporters who have received, in each quarter of the current year, an amount equal to 90 per cent or more but less than 100 per cent in foreign currency as export proceeds, compared to export earnings in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. So, this is one of the most important proposals. It is not by any means the only proposal. It is combined with a whole variety of the other initiatives which will cumulatively strengthen and invigorate Sri Lankas economy at this difficult time. I need to say, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that we will impose a cess to discourage imports into the country in situations where these imports will impact in a harmful way on industries in this country. There are those who uncritically and unreservedly support a laisser-faire market economy policy. I wish to say that there is really no country in the world which has practised such a philosophy. The United States goes very far to protect their wheat farmers and their automobile industry. France has taken drastic measures to protect their film industry. In Japan and in Korea, governments in those countries have gone to very considerable lengths to support and to protect rice production in their countries. We have, therefore, to be practical; we have to strike a balance. We cannot be committed uncritically to a particular ideology. We, therefore, do not believe in opening the floodgates. There are situations in which the local industry has to be appropriately supported.",

    "text": "That is why, Sir, we are imposing a cess on the import of synthetic rubber. This is to protect the production of natural rubber in this country. There are many people, particularly in the districts of Kalutara, Galle, Kegalle and elsewhere who are dependent on the rubber industry for their means of livelihood and we think it appropriate at this time to discourage the import of synthetic rubber into this country by imposing a cess. This cess will be imposed in other areas as well. Ceramics is an area in which Sri Lanka is doing very well. Companies like Noritake, Dankotuwa Porcelain and Royal Fernwood are producing ceramics which are of a sufficiently high quality to be of interest to the most sophisticated markets of the world. They have, however, met the Treasury and my Ministry and made representations to the effect that they need some measure of protection at this time. So, we are contemplating a practical application of the cess mechanism in order to protect local industries in a very hostile global environment. I think the emphasis has to be on the local economy and local production at this time. We cannot forever depend on imports into this country and if we do nothing about the restriction of imports, however much we preach the value of local production, a situation will not be created that is conducive to stimulating local production. We have, therefore, to resort to suitable fiscal measures to engender in this country an environment which will enable local production to increase and to grow. So, that is our approach to the cess and we will be having recourse to that mechanism in a variety of sectors of Sri Lankas economy at this time. I would also like to say that the main reason why Sri Lanka has been spared the most serious consequences, which have manifested themselves in richer and more powerful countries, is this. My distinguished Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, has made reference to this on many occasions both within this House and outside. We have pointed out repeatedly that the robust performance of the agricultural sector has gone a long way towards mitigating the adverse consequences of the global crisis as far as Sri Lanka is concerned. I think everybody will concede without hesitation that it is a considerable achievement to achieve self-sufficiency in rice in the year 2009. That is very much in keeping with the ancient traditions which we are justly proud of in this country. There was a time in our history when Sri Lanka was referred to as \"The Granary of the East\". Our historical records show that there are times in our history when we exported rice to countries including Burma or Myanmar as it is now called. This year, we will not have to spend large amounts of foreign exchange to import rice into this country. Many other subsidiary crops are also doing extremely well. In fact, agriculture has grown by approximately 12.5 per cent. So, that has been a redeeming feature. It has been a safety valve and that is one of the main reasons why Sri Lankas economy is performing well at this time. We expect a growth of about 6.5 per cent this year. When",

    "text": "I was in New Delhi about two weeks ago to attend the Partnership Summit which was jointly organized by the Government of India and the Confederation of Indian Industry many of the Indian Cabinet Ministers who were present on that occasion expressed both surprise and pleasure that Sri Lanka has been able to achieve this level of development notwithstanding adverse circumstances. So, we are putting a very sharp emphasis on the growth of our agriculture, on refining methods of production, for example, in the cinnamon and spices sector. We are putting a lot of effort into modernizing our methods of peeling and production where necessary; we are getting support from foreign institutions such as GTZ in Germany. As far as the gem and jewellery industry is concerned we are helping companies to develop their methods of cutting and polishing gems. There is a company which imports diamonds into Sri Lanka from Antwerp. They do a great deal of value addition which also means employment generation for this country and these are the kinds of industrial enterprises which we are endeavouring to support at this time. Then, we have also entered into a dialogue with the banks. We will ensure that companies which have taken loans in order to expand and to develop their industries will not be put under unreasonable pressure to repay these sums, to redeem these debts at this time. There will be flexibility that will be used with regard to the repayment of these loans in circumstances where it is manifest that the loans have been utilized for beneficial purposes connected with the expansion of key industries. Our export sector is deriving very considerable assistance from the fact that many sectors have been exempted from the 15 per cent electricity surcharge. We know that a great deal of electricity is consumed in certain key sectors such as apparel and ceramics and the fact that companies in those sectors will not be called upon to pay the 15 per cent electricity surcharge will enhance competitiveness and enable them to survive and prosper in an unfriendly global environment. Moreover, there will also be exemptions from the economic service charge for the whole of the year 2009. We have regular meetings of the Exporters Forum. In fact, next week a meeting is scheduled to take place. And, this is a monthly forum in which exporters have the opportunity of drawing the Governments attention to problems that they face in the course of their day-to-day business transactions. We encouraged this dialogue and we have responded positively and meaningfully to the matters which they have brought to our notice. One of these matters has been VAT refunds. The Treasury has now agreed within six months to make all these refunds and very considerable progress has been made even up to now. Then, everything possible has been done to stimulate value addition. Take for example, the tea industry. Now, we have achieved excellence in the global market because",

We concentrate on packetted teas, tea bags and above all, value added teas. So, we are giving encouragement in every possible way for value addition because that is the way that we can protect jobs in this country and that is undoubtedly the need of the hour. I am not saying that Sri Lanka will not be affected to any extent by the global crisis; that would be an unrealistic expectation. A small economy such as ours cannot insulate itself totally from global movements and events. But, certainly speaking in relative terms, our economy has been protected, it has been insulated - not coincidentally, not gratuitously but as a direct result of pragmatic policies which had been constructed and put in place to deal with situations as they arise in the world today.

Sir, in many countries of the world we have seen the collapse of the banking system, the collapse of the banking system results in a considerable erosion of confidence. It is has a domino effect; once it starts there is no stopping it. Now, the Government intervened promptly and effectively when problems arose with regard to one of the major finance companies in this country. When there was every prospect of those problems spilling over into the banking sector, the Government responded immediately to put the management of that particular bank, the Seylan Bank, under the control of the Bank of Ceylon and this was supervised entirely by the Central Bank. Immediately that injected confidence into the system. If that prompt action had not been taken at that time, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the repercussions would have been of a serious nature. We have seen the depth and the magnitude of those repercussions in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom, among other countries. That has not happened in this country. Thanks to the timely action that was taken by His Excellency the President as Finance Minister and by the Government to deal with consequences which would otherwise have manifested themselves. So, what I would like to say in conclusion, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is that a great deal has been done. Government has not been inactive; it has",

    "text": "Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I believe the role of a responsible Opposition is to objectively analyse the acts of the government and offer constructive criticism where appropriate. But, the biggest obstacle to this duty in this country is that when we get about objectively critiquing the acts of this Government, it is instantly, before you can even say Jack Robinson, called an unpatriotic act, a conspiracy - kumanthranaya- to halt the war and topple the government, and to top it all we are also branded as traitors. This is something I just fail to comprehend and it is indeed the sad plight of democracy in this country today where the majority has been herded into subordination and subjugation on the twin slogans of Patriotism against the Tiger terrorists and Supporting the war heroes while the other communities watch in silence of what is to come next. It has become dangerous to be right, when even if you think that the Government is wrong, leave alone being convinced of it. The predicament of the Government of today is that we are at war and we need to keep it going at least till all the elections are through while at the same time doing what is required under this cover to raise the necessary revenue to wage it and also govern the country. I am reminded of what the former President of the United States of America and Nobel Prize winner for Peace, Jimmy Carter once said describing the actions of President Bush, I quote : When your troops go to war, the president changes overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare, health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief. And its just become almost unpatriotic to describe his fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions. I am glad at the comments the Hon. Minister (Prof.) G.L. Peiris made during his speech just before me and I am sure some of these actions will help cushion the inevitable impact of the global recession. But, what is more important today is to look at the situation of this country.

We have sacrificed thousands of lives on both sides, and thousands more maimed for life, spent billions - I believe over Rs. 350 billion between 2007 and 2008 and another Rs. 177 billion budgeted for this year - fighting the war over the last three years and led the country towards a financial abyss. We now have to spend billions more to look after all the internally displaced and towards rebuilding all that we have destroyed forever by bombardments unleashed on the areas formally controlled by the LTTE. Despite all this, we still hold elections to Provincial Councils, which we at one time called white elephants, even before they are due, spending billions more on tamashas, abuse of all government resources and feeding sessions to convince the people that they need to vote for the Government's nominee in order to support the war. I cannot understand this because, you have been constantly saying that the majority in this country is supporting the war. But, I must commend this Government for the total abuse of all State resources including the print and electronic media and the excellent job you have done in carrying the majority with you - even the infamous Joseph Goebbels would have envied this achievement. Now, let us look at what the elections have achieved. His Excellency the President is on record saying that he has unified the country. But, has he? Have the results of this election shown that this country is united? A majority of the majority voting for the Government, and a majority of the minority voting against it, is not unification. Why? We beg the question why? When we have over 12 or 20 representatives of the minority community in this Government who were given a free rein of the upcountry with all the State resources, and all the promises that were made having their own nominees, the question is why did the minorities not support this Government? Why? Is it because they do not need the basic infrastructure facilities that were promised? Is it because they do not need houses? Is it because they do not want all the goodies that were promised? No. They too are human, they are also culpable to be deceived, but what is more important to them is that they need to feel wanted in this country which they call their home. They need to feel secure and they need to have trust in those who govern them. This cannot be achieved by all the majoritarian propaganda that is being dished out. We are not against the war against terrorism. What we are against is what is being dished out which is basically running the minorities into a corner. When they feel alienated, they have no choice but to show their protest. In fact, a young Deputy Minister on the governing side wanted to hold a bet with me and told me, Look!

I am reminded of what Winston Churchill once said: We contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle. Another major issue we have in this country is the representation aspect of taxation. I will quote what Will Rogers has said in this regard: The crime of taxation is not in the taking, but it is in the way it is spent. While we say that we need to impose levies to make ends meet, we do not want to be held accountable for the sins we commit.

I am telling you that the conspirators against this Government are in your ranks. So, put your thinking caps on and start looking inwards before it is too late. I would advise the powers that be tat, maybe they should read what Thomas Jefferson had to say on this aspect of governance on taxation: The same prudence which in private life would forbid our paying our own money for unexplained projects, forbids it in the dispensation of the public monies. Now, we can only avert catastrophe when our leaders listen to our people as carefully as people listen to them. Even good leaders, democratic leaders have to be regarded with mistrust. No leader is infallible. Every leader needs to be reminded at regular intervals. Unquestioning submission corrupts leaders and demeans followers. This is what I would love to tell the empty benches on that side : Every leader needs to be reminded at regular intervals. Unquestioning submission corrupts leaders and demeans followers. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in fact, I happened to be nursing the village called Akurana and why I am saying this in this House is because this is a very serious issue. This is predominantly a Muslim village, a village of businessmen, people who trade, and they live under difficult conditions. Despite all their wealth the terrain is so bad that the Government can allocate provisions of one budget just to clean up that area. But, despite all their needs - they needed roads, they needed water as they did not have drinking water, they needed schools, they needed hospitals - they were willing to defy the Government. That is not because they love the UNP, not because they love the SLMC, that is because they have no trust in the people who are governing this country today. This is the most important element of bringing this country together. If we want to march forward as one Sri Lanka, we have to first unite the communities before we talk of a unitary status. But, how",

    "text": "can there be unity? When? Everyday when you switch on the TV or listen to the radio or read the newspapers, all you hear is of the glory on one side : \"Ah! We have taken over this country. Now this country is one and you shall all obey\". Now, this has to be changed. We cannot reinvent the wheel as I stated in my speech last time. You cannot leave room for youngsters to think of other ways of getting abused. Earlier it was a local problem. The leaders of the LTTE today and those who sit in this House who were one-time leaders of the LTTE are in Sri Lanka. But, now we have a huge minority community of Sri Lankans who are living abroad. You have to think of them. They need to return to this country. They should not conspire against this country in foreign lands. And, how do you achieve that if you are not prepared to carry the minorities with you and instil trust in them? I know that there are very sensible Members who occupy the Front Benches of this Government. It is time that they started to reason and point out that this direction that we are taking, this majoritarian concept that we are pursuing, the bombardment that is taking place in the electronic and print media, will only take us to disaster and not to a united Sri Lanka. I hope and pray that when we have finished all these tamashas and sit down to looking at reality, we will decide that unless we, as people, get together we cannot live peacefully in this country.
