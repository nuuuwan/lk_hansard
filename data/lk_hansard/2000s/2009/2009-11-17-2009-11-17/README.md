: : CONTINENTAL SHELF SUBMISSION : STATEMENT BY HON. MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . . Hon. Speaker, this is further to my initial statement made on 04th November, 2009 on the Question raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Member of Parliament and raised again by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Leader

of the Opposition on 06th November, 2009 seeking a statement from me on our Continental Shelf Submission under the Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982. In this connection, I did undertake to make a formal Statement on 17th November, 2009. Hence, Hon. Speaker, I now make my Statement on the Continental Shelf Submission of Sri Lanka. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - UNCLOS - of 1982 requires States Parties to submit geological and scientific data and other material pertaining to the establishment of the outer limits of the Legal Continental Shelf beyond 200 nautical miles to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf - CLCS. A separate Statement of Understanding - SoU - which is contained in Annex II to the Final Act of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea recognized a special method of delimitation for the States in the Southern part of the Bay of Bengal, taking into account the unique geological and geomorphological features of the seabed in the area. Sri Lanka signed the Convention on the Law of the Sea - LOS Convention - on the 10th of December, 1982, and ratified the same on 19th July, 1994. In terms of paragraph 8 of Article 76 of the Convention and Article 4 of Annex II of the Convention and the technical and scientific guidelines of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, the coastal States are required to submit their scientific and technical data to establish their Legal Continental Shelf to the CLCS by 13th May, 2009. Although the initial time line has been subsequently relaxed indefinitely by the 18th Meeting of the States Parties to the LOS Convention, in June, 2008, the Inter-Ministerial Committee co-chaired by the Secretaries of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources respectively was instructed to take all necessary steps to present a full submission as per the time line previously envisaged, namely, 13th May, 2009, in view of the need to avoid the anticipated surge of submissions. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was conscious of the possible overload of work of the CLCS and made every effort to make a timely submission. Accordingly, the Inter-Ministerial Committee consisting of senior officials of all line Ministries, agencies along with international experts from the UK, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the USA, Norway and the Russian Federation presented a full submission to the CLCS on 08th May, 2009, well in advance of the 13th May, 2009 time line. The work before the Inter-Ministerial Committee was to frame Sri Lankas submission in keeping with the hard-won Statement of Understanding that recognized the need for a special method of delimitation for the States in the Southern Bay of Bengal. May I remind the Hon. Members of the following : (a) Delimitation of the Legal Continental Shelf of the coastal States is done according to Article 76 of the Convention, which contains the general method

1291 1292

[ ]

of delimitation based on what is known as the Irish Formula. This method which is based on the continental shelves off the Atlantic Coast is made applicable to all coastal States across the board. Given the special characteristics of Sri Lankas Legal Continental Shelf in the Bay of Bengal, namely a narrow shelf and a wide rise, Sri Lanka sought an exception from Article 76 and a special method of delimitation. (b) The special method contained in the Statement of Understanding was formulated taking into account the inequity that would result to Sri Lanka in the event of the application of the Irish Formula. More than half of the Bay of Bengal fan would have been excluded by the Irish Formula. -[Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Sir, I wish to quote in this regard the relevant section of Annex II of the Final Act of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea which reads as follows: The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, considering the special characteristics of a States continental margin where; (1) The average distance at which the 200 metre isobaths occurs is not more than 20 nautical miles; (2) The greater proportion of the sedimentary rock of the continental margin lies beneath the rise; and . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I further quote: 'Taking into account the inequity that would result to that State from the application to its Continental Margin of Article 76 of the Convention, in that the mathematical average of the thickness of

sedimentary rock along a line established at a maximum distance permissible in accordance with the provisions of para 4(a)(i) and (ii) of that Article as representing the entire outer edge of the continental margin would not be less than 3.5 km and that more than half of the margin would be excluded thereby.' Recognizes that such State may, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 76, establish the outer edge of its continental margin by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length connecting fixed points, defined by latitude and longitude, at each of which the thickness of sedimentary rock is not less than 1 kilometre. (c ) Thus, in the preparation of submission, the Sri Lankan team had to carefully analyze and process data to ensure the satisfaction of all the criteria in the Statement of Understanding. The Hon. Members will therefore appreciate that every effort has been made by the technical and legal experts to ensure that Sri Lankas submission met all the criteria required to come within the scope of application of the Statement of Understanding. As to our bilateral negotiations with India in this regard, let me add that the two countries have closely collaborated in securing the special method of delimitation for the States in the Southern part of the Bay of Bengal, which is now reflected in the Statement of Understanding. Since the work commenced on Sri Lankas submission, five rounds of consultations have been held with India with a view to coordinate our positions in making our respective submissions to the CLCS. Indias support would be a vital factor in invoking the applicability of the Statement of Understanding when Sri Lankas submission is taken up by the Commission. The available data show an area of overlap that would fall outside the Exclusive Economic Zones of both countries and in the Bay of Bengal sedimentary fan, in a region well to the west of Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. At the last round of consultations held with India in January 2009, the following understandings were reached: (1) To employ the Statement of Understanding in a manner in which both India and Sri Lanka would derive the maximum benefit. (2) To exchange cartographic maps indicating the approximate areas of claim of each party (3) To agree that both sides would file their own respective submissions before the CLCS without prejudice to any future bilateral agreement on the continental margin, which will take into account all relevant issues. Sir, this is a very important area not only for India and Sri Lanka. There is another tip right in the Bay of Bengal where even Myanmar is claiming a portion - an area that we all are seeking collectively. So, these are matters that will be sorted out through a due process and consultations are now taking place.

2009 17 1293 1294

Sir, Sri Lanka and India have a track record of cooperation on this issue from the time of the Law of the Sea Conference. It was as a result of this close cooperation that we were able to secure a special method of delimitation in the Southern part of the Bay of Bengal. We will continue this close bilateral cooperation to address all issues pertaining to the application of the SoU as well, as issues of bilateral boundary delimitation in relation to any areas of overlap stemming from our respective claims for extended Legal Continental Shelves. According to the Report of the Sri Lankan delegation to the 19th Meeting of the States Parties to the Law of the Sea Convention held in New York in June, 2009, Sri Lankas submission is likely to be taken up for consideration by CLCS around 2025. A delay of that magnitude is certain to have a negative impact on the aims and aspirations of all developing countries, which form the majority of those affected. Accordingly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken the initiative together with like-minded States - , ,

- to express serious concern at the prospect of delays of more than a decade before they receive the recommendations of the CLCS, taking into account the major investment of financial and other resources already made by them in the effort to meet the terminal date of 13th May, 2009. Sir, I must explain that there are so many other countries including India which have submitted their applications after this date - 13th May, 2009. Now, we are placed at number 43 and so many other countries are below us. We are fortunate to be accommodated on a first come, first served basis and got our application ahead of 50 other countries that are behind us and several others who will come on a throughout basis. Sir, I must specifically state here that there is no time limit or a time bar in terms of making one's submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continentl Shelf, because no one can limit a sovereign State its rights and pursuits to be a part of the globe and the universe. Therefore, there is no time bar in terms of any submission, but there was a recommended time period in order to facilitate the administrative needs to adjust the requirements under the Law of the Sea Convention. Sir, having said that, I would also like to say that Sri Lanka, together with similarly affected States Parties, has expressed dissatisfaction at the long delay in the scheduling of hearings of the CLCS at the 19th States Parties Meeting. The Sri Lankan delegation at this meeting insisted that such a time scale is not acceptable and that other arrangements should be made to minimize serious implications that would have on the developing countries. If the above problem is to be averted, extra funding must be made available to defray the expenses of the members of the Commission. Accordingly, the President of the 19th States Parties Meeting decided to appoint an open-ended informal Working Group under the

coordination of the Vice President. Sri Lanka is actively participating at the Working Group Meeting, which is currently taking place in the backdrop of the 64th General Assembly Session of the United Nations, with a view to having the proceedings expedited. Sri Lanka is continuing its efforts in order to consult like-minded developing States with a view to finding ways and means to expedite the process. To summarize, let me therefore say the following:

(1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs harnessed all resources, local and foreign, to ensure a timely submission notwithstanding the complex nature of the submission under the Statement of Understanding. All efforts have been taken to assure that the submission is legally and technically sound. The timelines envisaged were duly met and the submission was made on 08th May, 2009, well in advance of the original timeline of 13th May, 2009. (2) The delay in scheduling is entirely due to external factors, in that neither the UNCLOS nor the CLCS anticipated a large number of States to make their submissions at the same time, resulting in a surge of submissions. It must be noted that the scheduling process by the Commission has nothing to do with the merits or the demerits of a submission. (3) This issue is now being addressed by the UN in New York. A strong delegation has been sent out to support the PRUN and the staff of the Sri Lankan Mission in New York to actively canvass like-minded developing States and to reach an understanding on ways and means of expediting this process. Sir, there is one other matter I must raise in fairness to an officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Rohan Perera. He has written to the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the matter that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake raised the other day, stating that Dr. Perera expressed an opinion on certain deficiencies associated with the submission. Dr. Rohan Perera has categorically stated, I quote: I categorically reject the assertion that I have expressed such an opinion to anyone. Sir, I have with me his letter to that effect.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the convoluted answer that has been presented to the House, but I must say one thing. That is, this is basically contradictory to the first

1295 1296

statement you made in Parliament. In the last statement you made in Parliament, you did make a claim on the Andaman Islands; you said that you have made a claim on that. That is what basically caused a rebuttal and the Leader of the Opposition also responded to that. With regard to this situation, you said that the application had been made in time. I did state very clearly at the initial stage that it was made on time, but it was an incomplete application. Sri Lanka had the opportunity to take advantage of this in 2011 but owing to the incompleteness, we have lost that opportunity. Now, you say - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Hon. Speaker, my learned Friend is making a statement. There are two things. The first is, on the 4th of November, in response to an Oral Question that was raised by my learned Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, I never said that we were going to claim Andaman Islands or any of the islands belonging to India. It was categorically stated that our continental shelf lies below those parts, but in the event there are overlapping areas there is a consultation process adhered to, as I have reiterated in my Statement today. I have given a very extensive reply to all these concerns and this Statement is made in response to the request by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition asking for a Statement from me and my Statement speaks for all aspects of Sri Lankas stand on the Continental Shelf Submission. The second is, there was no time bar nor was there an incomplete submission being made to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, the very aspect you mentioned, in defining the outer edge of the continental margin - the thickness of the sedimentary rock should be more than three kilometres, that is where the professionals have guided us. We are not experts on this and they have said that the thickness of the sedimentary rock should be more than three kilometres and that our claim has not been made in accordance with that. So, let us not debate on an area on which you and I may not profess expertise.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Hon. Speaker, now he is going into the sedimentation, that is not less than one kilometre. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is the incomplete application which I have referred to.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Now, are you claiming that it should be three kilometres? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It should be greater that three kilometers. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . . . . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not want to convert this into a Debate, but we will take this up at the next Consultative Committee meeting. Please ensure that the experts are summoned before the Committee, including the people who have been kept out of the particular -

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I fully appreciate if you come for the Consultative Committee meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, when will it be? ( ) The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I will call for it in the first week of December. You did not come for the last Meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I did come. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You did not come.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I was there.

(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) What is that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. R.M. Imam) You know that a fairly large amount of money has been allocated to look after the displaced Muslims who are settled there. But, actually, nothing is taking place. Only in word everything is taking place. With a sense of responsibility, I am telling you, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am glad that you are intervening, but I can tell you, this was given when war was going on - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. R.M. Imam) Hon. Minister, I am sorry for interrupting - ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Please go on. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. R.M. Imam) I just want to say a word. Unfortunately, the Hon. Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, is not here. I am the one and only Muslim Member - I am not talking of caste, creed or religion - who has been appointed by the TNA to look after the interests of the displaced Muslims, because I am a Muslim born and bred in Jaffna. So, on several occasions, I have told the Hon. Minister, With regard to whatever action you are trying to take on behalf of the

displaced Muslims, please consult me. Get my advice also and try to do what you can. But what he does is, just the opposite of what I say. What he has in mind is - Actually, it is nothing to mention. But I am just telling because you started the topic. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no, it is all right. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. R.M. Imam) For the sake of politics he is not doing anything. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The problem is this. I do not know about your home and home matters. But what has happened is, as far as the Government is concerned, we are trying to promote them to go back. There are a lot of international agencies also who are willing to contribute to that. But now what has happened, Hon. Member? I was the Minister in charge of that some years ago, so I can tell you what has happened. There are some refugees in Puttalam who do not want to go back. They have got themselves adjusted there. Some of their children are going to schools in Puttalam. So, it is a complex problem. That is what I am trying to say. I cannot spend my whole time discussing the Puttalam issue. The point is, as far as this Government is concerned, we are trying our utmost, in keeping with the best interests of those IDPs, to see that they are resettled in their village homes. . , landmines - - - [ ] , . , . , . , . . . ? . . . . . . . . . . . . - , , ? . . .
