Hon. Minister, according to your reply, the largest number of houses which are yet to be built is in the Ampara District - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

Four hundred and fifty four houses, which is not the largest. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

As Actually it is a large number. 465 houses are pending, particularly in the Kalmunai area. Though promises had been given that land will be filled and houses built, several NGOs which had promised money had gone back because the Government had failed to give the required land. Now, along with that, a constituent party of the Government has filed action in the Supreme Court against some houses being handed over to Muslims in Norachcholai and Akkaraipattu saying that that belongs to a sacred area. Now, what is the action you are going to take to see that these houses which have been built for the tsunami victims will not be sacrificed on an issue which has no basis whatsoever. Now, on one side there is the issue of 465 houses that have still not been built and on the other unnecessary communal issue has been raised through an action in the Supreme Court denying the rightful owners being given houses in the Ampara District. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

There are 465 houses to be built. What action is the Government taking? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

Now do you accept that the matter is before the Supreme Court? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

No, that is a different matter. Let us forget about that. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

It is you who mentioned that the matter is before the Supreme Court. And, I know that the Supreme Court made an inspection also - (Interruption.) You cannot twist it in that way. Now three Supplementary Questions were asked I replied to them. The Leader of the Muslim Congress asked an additional Supplementary Question to which I replied. The matter is before the Supreme Court as you referred. So let us wait for the Supreme Court decision. , , - [ ] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) 10.05 . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . . ( ) (The Hon.

2009 05 1187 1188

Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Emergency Debate is the occasion on which national security issues are discussed in this House. War on terror has now come to an end and the LTTE is on the verge of collapse, on the verge of total defeat. It has been converted into a paper Tiger, and this has been achieved by the heroic armed forces of this country and they need to be congratulated for their great achievement. People of this country were eagerly waiting for an end to this menace of terrorism. Unfortunately, there was no national consensus on the need to bring an end to the forces of destruction spearheaded by the LTTE in the last 20 years. The assumption of power by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa was a turning point in the history of politics of this country, especially in relation to the need to put the LTTE on the defensive. For the first time in the history of this country, it was under his astute political leadership that the security of the State was given high priority in the national political agenda. It was His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa who gave proper leadership to combat terrorism and he was able to obtain the co-operation of the leadership of the heroic armed forces of this country and the rank and file of the armed forces to fight terrorism. His Excellency the President, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa perceived the whole thing as a massive terrorist threat, and he, unlike his predecessors, saw the need to defeat the LTTE as it would threaten to destroy the very foundation of the Sri Lankan State.

One cannot look at everything from the point of view of the international community. They do not understand all the ramifications of an organization like the LTTE, which, through international propaganda, supported by its Tamil diaspora throughout the world especially in the Western world, created for itself an edifice of a liberation organization. Now, we can see the nature of the liberation struggle of the LTTE to which they provided leadership in the last 20 years; the Tamil people were living in utter misery and poverty and the LTTE leadership was living in luxury. They are a peculiar set of Liberation Tigers who wanted their own people to live under primitive conditions. That is what we have been watching over the Sri Lankan television. The LTTE, if it had succeeded in establishing a mini State in the North and East, they, through this second State, would have destabilized the entire region; primarily, it was a threat to the stability of India. In my view, if a second State was established, it would definitely pose a threat to regional stability and to the stability of India as well. I do not want to go into all the geo-political considerations associated with this matter. India, not now and even in the future, cannot encourage any form of any force to clamour for a second State at her doorstep. India will never tolerate a second State at her doorstep. It is because of this political reality that India wants Sri Lanka to remain a single, unitary State. India wants Sri Lanka to remain a single State, an undivided State. India does not want to bifurcate Sri Lanka into two States and a bifurcation of Sri Lanka into two States is not in her own national interest.

All good neighbourly relations need to be built on national interest. It is in our national interest, the national interest of Sri Lanka to protect the national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We do not want any country, big or small, to interfere with our national sovereignty. We are a sovereign nation; we are a sovereign country. Since 1948, Sri Lanka has been playing a vital role in the international arena, in the Committee of Nations, as a small sovereign State. Therefore, Sri Lanka, at no point of time, since Independence in 1948, wanted to become a vassal State of any country. We are an independent, sovereign State. We need to protect our sovereignty; we need to protect our territorial integrity. But, at the same time, Sir, Sri Lanka prefers to maintain good neighbourly relations with all countries on the basis of the ideology expounded at the Bandung Conference in 1955. Sri Lanka, in formulating her dynamic and realistic foreign policy based on dynamic neutralism, derived inspiration from the Pancha Seela foreign policy principles of Jawaharlal Nehru of India. He was a great statesman whom we admired; all our leaders admired Jawaharlal Nehru as a great leader. The Indian foreign policy is totally and absolutely based on the principles of Pancha Seela. The main components of the principles of Pancha Seela are as follows: one, mutual respect for each others territorial integrity and sovereignty; two, non-aggression; three, non-interference in the internal affairs of another country; four, equality and mutual benefit and five, peaceful co-existence. These are the principles on which the Indian foreign policy has been formulated. We derived inspiration from those formulations as well in the past and we still derive inspiration from them. It is on the basis of such principles that Sri Lanka, since 1956, conducted her own foreign policy. It is on the basis of this policy that we built our excellent bilateral relations with India. The friendship and co-operation with India, Sir, is a major element in our foreign policy, which we would like to continue in the future as well. Our leaders in the past imbibed a great deal from the illustrious leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi of India. We derived inspiration from those great leaders of India and we continue to derive inspiration from the achievements of India. Today, India is a big power. Some people suffer from the Big Brother syndrome. Some people always attach importance to this Big Brother syndrome. I do not do that. I do not want to and it is not the position of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as well. Therefore, our relations with India are vital and fundamental. We need to maintain good neighbourly relations with India. That is one of the major elements of our foreign policy. It is my view that we need to work in close collaboration with India to fight the menace of terrorism because terrorism is international in character. Terrorism is an international phenomenon; it is not a local phenomenon. Speaking on behalf of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, I would like to say that our party is not suffering from an Indian phobia; we are not suffering from an Indian phobia. We, as a friendly nation, would like to

1189 1190

[ . . ]

accommodate Indian concerns on major issues, but we are ready to take all decisions on the basis of our own national interest. A foreign policy has to be formulated on the basis of a countrys national interest. That is why I said, we need to protect our sovereignty; we need to protect our territorial integrity. The major element in our national interest in the given context is to put the LTTE on the defense, to defeat terrorism and it needs to be done in the interest of our own stability as a nation and in the interest of regional stability as well. Stability in the region is also equally important, which is vital for India as well. India is interested in maintaining stability in the region. The recent events show that India still remains one of our closest friends and that friendship is fundamental for us to look at India from the point of view of vital geopolitical considerations. It is purely because of the fact that India is our closest neighbour. India is emerging as an important global partner in the global strategy to combat terrorism. As I said earlier, terrorism in the given context is not a local phenomenon. It is an international phenomenon with very wide international ramifications. India is extending its support to combat terrorism here in Sri Lanka. In 2005, when President Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed power, in the course of his Independence Day address, he gave expression to this point of view. This is what he said, I quote: ...the fundamental platform that I would base my initiative would be an undivided country, a national consensus and an honourable peace. This is what he said and he reiterated the same yesterday in the Independence Day speech. Our heroic forces have created the required environment, Sir, to work out an honourable peace on the basis of the legitimate and genuine aspirations of the Tamil community. We have the resolve to achieve this as President Obama stated at the inauguration on 20th January. Sri Lanka, as the United States, has to inaugurate an era of responsibility. Thank you.

( The Hon. Hasen Ali) Okay. , . . , , , . . [.. 2.08] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Madam Presiding Member, at a time when there is very little interest in this House in debating this Resolution, I am at least consoled that we have a charming lady presiding while we speak. We meet today to debate the Resolution under the Public Security Ordinance extending the state of Emergency for yet another month, ironically a day after we ceremoniously celebrated the 61st Anniversary of our Independence from 500 years of foreign rule. I earnestly hope that this will be the last time we have to go through this exercise which has for decades impeded on the real independence of our people. As someone who has always seen myself as a true Sri Lankan, I always believe that what we celebrate on the 4th of February each year since 1948 is not our independence

1229 1230

[ . . . ]

from foreign rule, which has always been a part of our chequered past, but a transferring of sovereignty to the people of Ceylon, giving us an opportunity to attempt to live together as one nation, sacrificing our historical claims as separate nationalities. I do not want to go back in history and repeat what has been told and retold in many ways to all of us by our political leaders, not with a view to forging forward as a nation, but laying emphasis on their historic claims to nationhood. It is very sad that in our history as a single nation, there have been very few genuine attempts at forging a composite nationhood as Sri Lankans. At every crucial moment in our history, we have come together promising to work for the common good, only for one party to cry foul that they have been deceived once again. We all know that we were a divided nation before the Portuguese set foot on our shores and it is only after the British took over the Kandyan Kingdom that we came to be administered as a single nation, Ceylon, an arrangement which the Tamils and even the Kandyan Sinhalese did not agree with. In fact, it was the Kandyan Sinhalese who first mooted the idea of federal states within Ceylon so that they could administer their own affairs. Such was the division within our people. It is the British who gave credence to a united Ceylon. Saner council prevailed when we put aside our differences to gain independent status. Differences immediately surfaced when we had to decide on a flag to represent the new nation. It would be interesting to note here what the late Honourable D.S. Senanayake, hailed as the Father of the Nation, had to say when he spoke on the Motion tabled in the House of Representatives way back in 1947 by the late Hon. A.L. Sinnelebbe, Member of Parliament for Batticaloa, suggesting that the Lion Flag of the last Kandyan King, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, which was taken to Britain in 1815, be made the National Flag. The Members of Parliament belonging to the All Ceylon Tamil Congress resolutely opposed this Motion. The Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam moved an amendment in Parliament that the Official Flag of Ceylon should be the Lion flag of the Sinhalese, the Nandi - bull - the flag of the Tamils and the Crescent and Star the flag of the Muslims. The late Honourable D.S. Senanayake that day cited history to say that the Tamil kings had ruled the Sinhalese and the Sinhalese kings had ruled the Tamils, but the people had always lived in amity. He highlighted the fact that the last king who used the royal standard was a Tamil. It is a well-known fact that this flag happens to be the flag of the last King of Kandy and we all know that the last King of Kandy was a Tamil. But, still I am proud to proclaim this as the Sinhalese flag, because I embrace the Tamils now as the Sinhalese embraced the Tamils

then. We claim the flag to be a Sinhalese flag although we inherited it from a Tamil king. Those were the words of the Father of the Nation. Having accepted that the last king of the last bastion to fall to the British as being a Tamil from India and having proudly accepted his flag as the flag that marks the end of British rule, how did we get to where we are today, proclaiming to have liberated parts of our country having defeated terrorists and separatist elements? Who are these terrorists and how did they transform themselves to that state? Unless and until we find answers to this question, we will not progress as a nation free of these elements. We can defeat terrorists militarily, but we cannot wipe out the separatist tendency in the same way. It has to be addressed politically. Madam, let me quote what Professor John Kotter said. "Leaders establish the vision for the future and set the strategy for getting there; they cause change. They motivate and inspire others to go in the right direction and they, along with everyone else, sacrifice to get there." Unfortunately, when we should be having a full House listening to what the Members of the minority community have to say with regard to the situation today, we only see depleted benches. I am reminded of what Albert Einstein had to say. He said, I quote: For those who would joyously march in rank and file, they have already earned my contempt, for they were given a large brain by accident when a spinal chord would have sufficed. What the late Honourable D.S. Senanayake stated in his Independence Day speech on 4th February, 1948 is still relevant to present times. He said, All nations should bend their energies towards establishing a peaceful and prosperous world in which every human being can enjoy the fruits of peace. Lanka, with its great traditions of peace and goodwill preached by Lord Buddha, will always advance the cause of Freedom and Peace. What is also relevant is a joint statement issued to the nation on that day by the Maha Nayakes of the Asgiriya and Malwatta Chapters. They said, Let us go forward as one man, firm in the belief that we shall reap the highest benefits that Freedom confers. They called on the people of Ceylon to overcome the inferiority complex that has been engendered by centuries of foreign domination and eschew the vices that they had acquired. However, the harsh truth which stares us in the face today is that the political system which we have engineered to go forward as a nation, in one way or another, has to accommodate the aspirations of the rising generations of all communities who call this land their own. It is worthy at this stage to recall the wise words of James Oppenheim on Freedom. He said, I quote: "They can only set free men, free.And there is no need for that; Free men set themselves free. "

2009 05 1231 1232

Today, if we are not to face a collective debacle, we need to reflect on history and rethink as to how we can forge forward as a nation. We have for many centuries been arguing and fighting for hold over land and disputing each others claims to territory, which we call our homeland or places of historical habitation or traditional homeland et cetera. I would like to quote a chapter - On Time : The Past That Lies Before Us" - from a book that I keep reading over and over again because it teaches me a lot. The title of it is, The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Building Peace by John Paul Lederach. I came across an interesting term used by tribes of the Philippines in this chapter who described the setting called "ancestral domain". It is explained in this way by an indigenous elder. I quote: "Some believe that ancestral domain is essentially a term that refers to land fights, you know, where indigenous people claim historical rights to a piece of land when outside groups want the land, or the minerals, forests or water. I suppose that is true, ........ But for us, ancestral domain is not about the land as if it were a legal question of title. For us, this place is where the ancestors live." Note the words, this place is where the ancestors live. He goes on to say, I quote: "Where they live is where we are people. That is why we say ancestral domain. It is the domain of our ancestors, the place where we as a people go to join them,....... You take away our place, you take away our past. You take our past, and we cease to be. That is what people do not understand." If we do understand this - if we do understand why we are so much attached to this land - would we not be looking at this problem differently? His Excellency the President started his Independence Day speech yesterday saying, I announce with pride that we have raised the National Flag today over a motherland that is being united in keeping with the heartfelt wishes and prayers of our people; my dear people who through sacrifice of life have come forward to defend the freedom of our land; and through their blessings and every thought supported that struggle; and my dear children who have eagerly looked towards the struggle for freedom in our land, Maybe we will defend the events of the recent past as the price we have to pay for freedom or even go to the extent to say that you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs. Decisions made generations ago affect us yet today, and decisions we make today will affect the future generations. Perhaps the greatest mystery of peace is that authenticity of change is located not in what can be quantified and controlled. It is rooted in the courage of people and communities to be and live vulnerably in the face of fear and threat and ultimately to find therein that human security is not tied primarily to the quantity or size of weapons, the height or thickness of the wall that

separates them; not to the power of imposition or control. The mystery of peace is located in the nature and quality of relationships developed with those most feared. Leadership is the capacity to inspire and mobilize masses of people and that is a public transaction with history. When the scope for action is greatest, Henry Kissinger has said, I quote: Knowledge on which to base such action is limited or ambiguous. When knowledge becomes available, the ability to affect events is usually at a minimum. In 1936, no one could know whether Hitler was a misunderstood nationalist or a maniac. By the time certainty was achieved, it had to be paid for with millions of lives..... A democracy can obtain truth only as the result of experience; and many nations perish while they are awaiting the consequences of their errors." Therefore, true independence and freedom can only exist in doing what is right. The task of persuading majorities to accept innovations remain forever formidable. What counts in the end is the subversion of old ideas by the changing environment. It is this that gives you the opportunity to create the taste by which you are being enjoyed. I am addressing this to His Excellency the President; that the task of persuading majorities to accept innovations remain forever formidable; what counts in the end is the subversion of old ideas by the changing environment. It is this that gives you the opportunity to create the taste by which you are to be enjoyed. The use of violence to destroy an old order and install a new one may at times be the last resort for societies entrapped in hopeless logjams as we were with the LTTE. But, save in extremis, violence is not a sensible way to transform society, and the LTTE has learnt it the hard way. The membranes of civilizations are fragile. Ripped asunder, they are difficult to restore. In a rebellion, as in a novel, the most difficult part to invent is the end. And, we say we have come to the end of a war with separatists and with terrorists. Now, how do we write the end to the chapter? Where do we go from here? The consent of the majority is essential if both the fabric of society and the freedom of the individual are to survive. To devise remedies that will both work and elicit consent is the task of democratic leadership. That task requires attention to concrete human needs rather than abstractions of God or history. His Excellency the President also said, We are today a nation that has defeated a powerful enemy that stood before us - an enemy of our own creation. Similarly, we should have the ability to defeat all internal enemies that are found in our midst. I beg the question. Who are these internal enemies? Are they those who oppose the Government? And, how are we going to deal with them? Now, what we have before us and what we have been always talking as a possible solution to this problem, has been the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. I am sure all of us would agree and we

1233 1234

have had it recorded over years in this House that the Thirteenth Amendment was forced upon us; that it is flawed in law; that it cannot work. But, we still keep harping on something that we ourselves keep condemning year after year. But, what was the intention behind the Thirteenth Amendment? It was to devolve power to allow the people to run their own affairs. But, today unfortunately, when we near the end of the war or when we near the ending of the story, we do not talk of a solution. We get back to square one. What we started from the day the Britishers started to rule this country as one, when they started administering this country as one, the divisions that we had among us - the different communities that lived in this country started claiming rights on their own - which we saw paraded yesterday, I was surprised that we have so many different people living in this country which enriches this nation. But, we are still not even close to thinking of a solution. We are again talking of one nation, one people, one identity. But, how do we get there? This has always been the problem that we do not want to end the story. We want to keep repeating this. We want to re-invent the wheel. We want people to have reason to rebel. This has been our history right from the day when the Britishers put all the nationalities together and declared this country as Ceylon and gave it on a platter to us, and said, okay, now rule it. We keep re-inventing the wheel. But, this has to stop and this can only stop if the majority is willing to accept that all those who paraded yesterday are Sri Lankans, all of them have equal rights. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) And, if we do not stop at the parading and get to what we really mean by being a nation, we will not succeed as a nation. Thank you [.. 2.29] ( )
