, 54 . - There is not a single commercial institution in the world, other than professional bodies, like the Medical Council, Engineering et cetera where seven or eight people have been given the right to manage about 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 people. So, we have kept it open. We have not shut that out totally. We have said they may instead of making it compulsory. So, we have taken off the word should and instead we have said may so that liberty, freedom and democracy will exist within the system. Anybody can join any organization. If one feels that any organization does not deliver whatever he or she expects, then he or she will have the right to move on to a different organization. I will go into more details in my reply speech. Then, with the next amendment to Section 60, we expect the agents to advertise all the salary scales and in addition to that, notify any kind of payments that would be made by the agents at the other end. Now, what happens is, I will give you an example. I am just summing up. Maybe later on, I will try to give more details. For instance, agents over there provide the ticket, medical facilities and other benefits for one to migrate for temporary employment. But, here at this end, the agents do collect money for these as well and when they go there they do not get the expected salary. When they say, We have not got the required salary or the agreed salary the agents at that end say, We have provided you with the ticket, the medical facilities and whatever that is necessary. Now, that has to be looked into and dealt with. It is to cover that aspect that we have brought in this amendment. If time permits, we can go into details. Then, the other aspect is with regard to giving more powers, more teeth to the officers of the Investigation Department of the Bureau. Now, we have no right to bring the offenders before any court. What we can do is to only produce them, maybe to the closest police station. Now, my good Friend, the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara has suggested an amendment. I would deal with that at a later stage. Now, I can cite many institutions as of now where they have empowered peace officers. This empowerment is done by the Board of Management, particularly the Bureau, from time to time. They will determine and they will perhaps name the people who will be entitled to this empowerment. For instance, the PHIs are peace officers who could go to any hotel for that matter. If there is uncleanliness, if there are unhygienic issues, they could prosecute the offenders. A similar situation exists in the Department of Forest. I can cite many things. At a later stage I will deal with them. Finally, I would like to say that in the event of any inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts, the Sinhala version of the Bill will prevail. So, those are the

basic things which we should go into more detail, after listening to the contributions from the Opposition. I will deal with them as it comes. Thank you. . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Minister. The next speaker is, the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara. You have 15 minutes.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is very unfortunate that to-day we have come down to slinging mud at each other when we should actually be paying attention to more than a million people who are working in the Middle-East. Today, certain Members spoke about an officer who is not able to defend herself, in the Well of this House. I would challenge them to come out and speak about that particu-lar officer. I can talk about them but I will not talk about them because I am more conscious about the one and a half million poor girls who are working in the Middle-East and I am not here to look after the interests of the foreign employment agencies. I have certain matters to deal with. It is very laudable that the Hon. Minister, even 15 years after the enactment of this Act, has brought in these amendments. But, I would implore him to look into various other aspects of this Act which also have to be looked at. We have to look at the foreign sponsors who are giving enough and more

trouble to these poor girls from the villages who go abroad; the way they torture them, the way they evade paying their salaries. I think there should be a mechanism where we will be able to blacklist those sponsors from getting girls from Sri Lanka to work as housemaids in their houses. There is also the matter of sub agents who are not regulated at all. There should be some methods brought in where there will be pressure on the employment agents who have registered not to employ sub agents who are not responsible to anybody, because when these poor girls go abroad they only know the sub agent who is not liable to any sort of regulation. One other matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Hon. Minister is the medical clinics. We have found that so many girls who are unfit to go and work abroad have been given clean health certificates by these medical clinics. We should bring in some regula-tions to ensure that these medical clinics are brought within the ambit of either the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment or some other organization. With regard to the allegations made by the Members of the Opposition, the Hon. Lalith Dissanayake answered some of them. Let me speak about the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency which is a completely separate body from the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. The Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency (Pvt.) Limited is a company affiliated to the Ministry of Foreign Employ-ment Promotion and Welfare. Now, certain Members talked about Public Administration Circulars, but I think they are not aware that Public Administration Circulars do not apply to the companies set up under the Companies Act and any retired person can be taken into such a company. The Hon. Members who are in the COPE would be aware that that is a matter which we are now looking at very strongly and very soon we will be bring-ing in amendments to the Standing Orders to enable us to look into these matters even at the COPE. But, as the law now stands, Public Administration Circulars do not apply to a private company. Be that as it may, certain allega-tions were made about a letter written by the former Chairman of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency, which was disputed, recommending the purchase of some property at Nawala and that letter has been tabled by the Hon. Lalith Dissanayake. I would request the Members of the Opposition to be more responsible in making allegations. We, both in the Opposition and the Government, have a duty by the people of this country to be more responsible and when we speak in Parliament for the sake of the press or for the sake of the foreign employ-ment agencies, we should reveal the truth, and not half truth. Thank you very much.

Jayewardenepura Municipal Council. Also the Banks, Bazar, Market and public and private institutions are sited within the radious of 0.25km to 01km. 3. The government valuer had valued the property for Rs. 46.5 Mn. Since we could not convince the owner with this price it was decided to revalue the property using the services of approved private valuer. This responsibility was assigned with Mr. P. G. Walpita who is in NSB valuation panel. He has valued the property for Rs. 66,125,000/- A copy of his valuation report is attached. 4. Previously the SLFEA has looked for suitable places to relocate the SLFEA office. However a suitable property encounter with the requirements of the SLFEA could not be identified due to various reasons. Even the owner of the building the SLFEA is currently located has quoted the prices for this building as Rs. 80 Mn, which seems not worth while for this 22 year old compact house with a very limited parking place. Since the lease of this building is due to be completed in year 2009 the SLFEA has to identify a suitable place to relocate the office. 5. Further the SLFEA has no single property on its own. If this has been purchased by SLFEA it is an asset to SLFEA with a very high value addition in future. On the other hand most of the staff members are living with close proximity to this property and it would be an extra convenience to the staff. 6. Most of the Board Members have visited this property and recommended that this place is quite suitable to relocate the SLFEA office. The deeds of the property have been scrutinized by Mr . Gamini Ekanayake and assured the accuracy of the deeds. The land was surveyed to ensure the correct extent. The survey was done by the government approved surveyor (Mr. M. V. T. P. Jayasundara) and confirmed the perches 18.9 us the correct extent and he will give us the plan for our file. 7. According to the valuer the readily buildable commercial sites in this locality transact at rates ranging from Rs. 2.5 Mn to 3.3. Mn per perch and a commercial site further down along Nawala Road has been sold very recently at the rate of transport Rs. 3 Mn per perch. Considering the easy accessibility facilities, commercial locality, and other infrastructure facilities the valuer has adopted Rs. 3 Mn per perch for this land as fair and reasonable. Once the new premises are purchased the monthly rental of Rs. 140,000/- pays for the current office premises is also will be an additional saving to SLFEA. 8. The committee has negotiated with Mr. Premathilake the owner of the property and finally he agreed for a compromisation to bring down the price to Rs. 62 Mn. With this price the value per perch has come down to Rs. 2.7 Mn, which is lower than the valuers estimate of Rs. 3 Mn per perch. 9. In order to secure funds for this transaction the committee proposes to take a loan against the FDs available in NSB. The stamp fees, lawyer fees and the internal partition cost of the building have also to be covered with these loan funds. Ms. K. L. S. Jayawardene, Attorney at law and Notary Public, 10/1, Hena Road, Mr. Lavenia will attest the documents and the lawyer fees agreed upon is 1/2%. 10. Having considered the facts given above the committee recommend to purchase the property identified at No. 12 Narahenpita Road, Nawala. (Sgd.) Mr. Gamini Ekanayaka (Sgd.) Mr. Nimal Siriwardena (Sgd.)

Dear Sir RESOLUTION PASSED AT THE BOARD MEETING OF SRI LANKA FOREIGN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY (PVT) LTD (SLFEA) TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY BEARING NO: 12, NARAHENPITA ROAD, NAWALA I refer to the decision taken by the Board of Directors of SLFEA at the Board Meeting held on 17th December 2008 to purchase the above property for its business operations. As you be may be aware SLFEA was started in 1996 and has steadily progressed during the last twelve years with a sum of Rs. 160 million in Fixed Deposits. SLFEA does not have a property of its own to house its office. SLFEA has been right throughout conducting its business operations in rented premises. In the circumstances, you will appreciate that it has become necessary for SLFEA to purchase an office premises in a good location. SLFEA has been looking for an office premises for the last several months within Narahenpita/Nawala area and looked at several buildings for purchase. A sub committee comprising of Mrs. R. V. Nanayakkara, General Manager/Director and two other Directors M/s Gamini Ekanayaka and Nimal Siriwardena was appointed to study and report to the Board of Directors with regard to the purchase of a property for the business operation of SLFEA. The Committee submitted a report to the Board of Directors recommending the purchase of the above property. The present office premises is available for sale but the price quoted by the owner is highly exorbitant. The owner is demanding Rs. 80 million for this property Finally we came across the above property in the heart of Nawala junction in the commercial area. The details of the said property could be ascertained from the documents attached hereto. The Board of Directors of SLFEA have inspected the premises and they are of opinion that this property is ideally suited and well located for its business purposes. The Board of Directors also observed that the said property is within the reach of people who come in search of foreign employment and also has ample transport facilities due to its central location. After taking the above into consideration the Board of Directors of SLFEA has decided to purchase the said property for a sum of Rs. 62 million. The decision was taken unanimously by the Board of Directors of SLFEA. I am forwarding herewith the relevant documents and draft Board Resolution for your approval to proceed with the purchase of the said property. Thanking you. N. M. Shaheid B. A.

(Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill which was presented just now proposes to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act, No.1 of 1981. Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the said Act, which deal with the recognition of political parties, are to be amended in order to democratize the structure of political parties in this country. In other words, the basis of recognition of political parties is to be expanded, and the criteria adopted for the purpose of recognition is also to be expanded. The conditions incorporated in the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981 are not sufficient as the existing law does not specify the relevant requirements that a political party is expected to fulfill for the purpose of recognition. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " () " . , . . Question put, and agreed to.

, () . , , (.) . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (VEN.) UDAWATTE NANDA THERO took the Chair. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Venerable Presiding Member, there is yet another defect in the existing piece of legislation; the Commissioner of Elections who was expected to take the decision on the question of recognition was not provided with a set of clear guidelines for the purpose of recognition. Such shortcomings need to be eliminated in the interest of a healthy party competition in our country, primarily for the purpose of improving our political system. Therefore, the Bill, which is before this House, lays down the criteria for recognition of political parties. It was in April, 2006 that a Select Committee was appointed to study and report on the revision of the present electoral system which, in my view, is the root cause of Parliamentary instability in this country. All Parliamentary institutions have deteriorated primarily due to the nature of the electoral system which came into existence in 1978. It was this Select Committee, headed by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, which examined all aspects of the system of Proportional Representation, recommended a series of changes; one such recommendation dealt with the recognition of political parties. I do not wish to go into the other recommendations. There was an in-depth discussion of these matters and the Select Committee which consisted of 32 Members of Parliament recommended changes in the existing formula regarding the recognition of political parties According to the changes proposed in this amendment Bill, a political party which seeks recognition for the purpose of elections is expected to apply to the Commissioner of Elections before the 31st of January. According to this Bill, a political party, which proposes to obtain recognition is expected to provide the Commissioner of Elections with the following : (1) a copy of the Constitution of the party; (2) a list of its office bearers; (3) an audited statement of accounts; and (4) a policy statement of the party. These changes, in my view, Venerable Presiding Member, will have a major impact on the internal administration of the political parties in this country. It will have an effect on the functioning of political parties as vital instruments in a democracy. Political parties are indispensable for the functioning of a healthy democracy. That has been our experience as well. In democratic societies, it is through the political parties and the electoral system that governmental power is exercised. In Sri Lanka, since 1947, there was vigorous and effective

3211 3212

competition among the political parties, which initially was a kind of two coalitions of parties. We did not have a bi-party system. It was a system based on two coalitions of parties. Power alternated between the two major political parties. The smaller political parties on the basis of their ideology and on the basis of their political agenda entered into coalitions with the two major parties. That has been the political experience of this country as far as the party system is concerned. There are small political parties which function as pressure groups. They are political parties cum pressure groups. They are mini political parties which need to be described as pressure groups. The nature of the system of political parties which provided some kind of stability to the Parliamentary System of Government since 1947 underwent a fundamental change with the introduction of the System of Proportional Representation, which as you know multiplies political parties. It is under the Proportional Representation System that political parties multiply. In this period - I am referring to the period 1947 to 1970 - there were six political parties which contested elections. In the period 1947 to 1970, there were six established political parties which contested elections and they were major political parties which contested all Parliamentary Elections. It was during this period that political power alternated between the two major parties or two coalitions of parties associated with the two major political parties. Venerable Persiding Member, it demonstrated the unique turnover pattern. I am using the word turnover - the unique turnover pattern of political party competition. In other words, there was no one party dominance as in India. The Indian system for years was dominated by the Congress Party of India which came to be described as a one-party dominant political system. It happened when the Indian Congress dominated the Indian political system as the single dominant political party for more than half a century. In our system, the party competition was greater. It was much more competitive because we had a multi-party type of competition in our political system. Therefore, it injected a new kind of political dynamism into our political system, the unique feature of which was the vibrant political party competition. All characteristics of the Proportional System of Representation leads to the proliferation or multiplication of political parties or the proliferation of a multitude of small splinter political parties. There are a number of examples, but I do not want to go into those examples. I do not wish to give those examples because I am sure most of the Hon. Members of Parliament are aware of the nature of the system which consists of smaller splinter parties. I do not want to give examples as they are numerous in our own system. In our system, both communal and ideological cleavages have contributed to the multiplicity of political parties. In other words, most of the smaller political parties are either based on ideology or based on parochial, regional agendas or they could be described as communal parties. In this country, Venerable Presiding Member, there are

regional parties with regional agendas; absolutely regional and parochial in orientation. Various communal issues and parochial matters influenced the formation of smaller political parties with not much popular support; they did not command much popular support. The present electoral system encouraged such mini-parties which are highly opportunistic in their approach to politics. This kind of multiplication of political parties in the end gave birth to a system consisting of 60 political parties. In the present system, there are 60 political parties and half of them are mere name boards associated with a couple of individuals. They are mere name boards. It was this kind of development which compelled the Select Committee to formulate a scheme for the de-recognition of political parties. Already, there are 60 such political parties in the country. Most of them are inactive. Only 10 or 15 are active in the system. The Commissioner of Elections faced a series of administrative problems due to the large number of political parties, especially in relation to the conduct of elections and it became very difficult for the Commissioner of Elections to conduct elections due to the existence of a large number of political parties; some of them are very active, some of them are totally and absolutely inactive. Most of the parties were non-functioning parties, and they, though remain inactive, make use of the system to obtain certain political concessions. I do not want to describe them. I am sure my good Friend, the Hon. Vijitha Herath, knows all these things because they also represent a major political party.

Today, as I said, there are 60 political parties, a majority of them have not contested any election. . This increase in the number of political parties does not contribute to a healthy democratic society as they introduce an element of instability into the system. The proliferation of political parties or the multiplication of political parties introduce an element of instability into the political system. Some political parties are active. Most of the mushroomed political parties, the parties associated with individuals, are inactive. I mean, a couple of individuals get together and form a political party which has no popular base at all and this is, Venerable Presiding Member, not in the interests of a healthy party competition in a democratic political system. Therefore, this piece of legislation which is before this House proposes to introduce provisions for the de-recognition of political parties. If a party is to be recognized, it is the duty of the particular party to remain active in the political life of the country. If a party wants to achieve some political, let us say, victories at an election or something of that sort, it needs to remain active. It needs to be active. For instance, a political party which seeks recognition should have been engaged in political activities for at least four years prior to the date on which it makes the application for recognition. Therefore, in

[ . . ]

2009 24 3213 3214

other words, a party needs to be active for a period of four years before it applies for recognition. In the same way, if a political party fails to comply - ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) , . . , . In the same way, if a political party fails to comply with those provisions in Section 8, the Commissioner of Elections can de-recognize the political party. Section 9 in this amending Bill refers to the conditions under which a political party is to be de-recognized, not recognized and they are as follows: 1. A party is expected to nominate at least one candidate for two consecutive Parliamentary general elections; 2. A party is expected to conform to the requirements incorporated in Section 8. I do not want to repeat that. Therefore, these amendments, in my view, lay the foundation for a good democratic government in this country. Thank you, Venerable Presiding Member. . .

[. . 2.02] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you Venerable Presiding Member. I believe this Bill is not being presented to the House today in its original form. There are some amendments circulated and we have seen them. But, very unfortunately, neither of the spokespersons on behalf of the Government, the Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala and the Hon. (Mrs.) Sumedha G. Jayasena, referred to those amendments that are to be brought before the Bill is passed. In fact, I might mention that when this Bill was tabled in the House, several of the minority parties in this country or the parties representing the numerically minority peoples - the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchchi, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress - petitioned the Supreme Court in regard to a particular provision in the Bill contained in Clause 2 (6) which refers to the disqualification of a political party which in its nomenclature signified any religion or

community. These parties representing the minority peoples in this country who petitioned the Supreme Court raised serious objection in regard to this particular provision and the Supreme Court ruled - I have got the Ruling with me, I do not want to quote the Ruling because I have no time - that those words were unacceptable, were objectionable and would even tantamount to an interference with the franchise of the people; and franchise being one of the elements of sovereignty of the people, those provisions could not remain and that they must be struck off. The Senior State Counsel who appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General at that point of time gave an undertaking to the Court, that reference to any name that signifies any religion or community would in fact be struck off from that proposed amendment. In fact, the amendment that has been circulated by the Government today very clearly and specifically states that those words will be removed. Lines 18 and 19 are to be removed thereby ensuring that the words signifying any religion or community in regard to the name of a political party, are removed. I would like to have an assurance from the Hon. Minister of Urban Development, who is here, who is also the Chairman of the Select Committee on Electoral Reforms whether that will be done at the Committee Stage. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, that will be done. I give that assurance. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you very much. I am grateful for that amendment. I want to refer to the importance of community and religion in a historical-political context because that, in my view, is a matter of some significance. I refer to Section 29 (2) of the Soulbury Constitution. I quote: No such law shall - (a) prohibit or restrict the free exercise of any religion; or (b) make persons of any community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of other communities or religions are not made liable; or (c) confer on persons of any community or religion any privilege or advantage which is not conferred on persons of other communities or religions; or." Section 29 (3) states, I quote: Any law made in contravention of subsection (2) of this Section shall, to the extent of such contravention, be void. This was the compact, on the basis of which this country achieved Independence. But, this compact has been abrogated by both the 1972 Constitution and the

3219 3220

[ . ] 1978 Constitution; both of which in my submission were instrumental in character and not framed on the basis of consensus. They were framed by political parties to achieve their political objectives and their political goals and they were not consensual in the sense that they did not have the consensus of all the peoples who inhabited this country, particularly the Tamil people who did not partake in the making of the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions. You not merely violated and abrogated the compact, the Soulbury Constitution, the provisions which I have read in terms of which this country attained Independence, you went much further and of the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions which you framed without the consensus of the Tamil people in this country, you defined the character of the Constitution as unitary; you made Sinhalese the only official language; you gave Buddhism the foremost place in this country, thereby conferring on persons of one community or religion privileges and advantages which others do not have and depriving people of other communities, subjecting them rather to certain restrictions which were not imposed on all the people in this country, and you thereby violated not merely the Soulbury Constitution and the compact under which this country achieved Independence, you went further and you wanted to ensure the promotion of majoritarian ethnic and religious interests in this country and the institutionalization of majoritarian hegemony. That is what you have achieved. This is unacceptable. This is a complete violation of the compact, on the basis of which this country achieved Independence. I want to go further and say that before you think in terms of Parliamentary Electoral Reforms, you must have in this country a Constitution based upon a consensus which defines a structure of Government, which gives all the peoples who inhabit this country a meaningful share in the powers of governance to be in a position to foster and promote their own economic, social, cultural and political interests. The other thing is, such a Constitution framed on the basis of consensus which defines a structure of government insofar as the different peoples who inhabit this country, you cannot frame, in my submission, a meaningful, purposeful elections law for this Parliament or for any other institution. Therefore, I submit that while we are happy with these amendments which have been brought about with those objectionable words removed, the fact that those words were included in the original Bill is clearly indicative of a thinking on the part of the Government to further institutionalize the majoritarion hegemony that the Government wants to prevail in this country. I thank you, Venerable Presiding Member. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .

[. . 2.10] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana - Minister of Science and Technology) . . First let me say, I am happy that the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill which was initially presented has been duly amended according to the discussions that took place at the Select Committee. I went through this Bill very carefully and I am happy to say that the amendments that were moved at the last Select Committee meeting have been incorporated. I would first like to draw your attention to the positive features in this Bill. Basically, we would like to have recognition of the political parties done on a systematic, rational criteria. I am glad that this Bill, with the amendments, will achieve this objective. The fact that we are having a multiplicity of political parties, a few large ones and several smaller ones, is today a reality in the political scene in this country and considering the fact that there are different interest groups within our society, I think this is a healthy development. We must respect the rights of all groups whatever the basis of the getting together of those groups. It may be on the basis of community alignments or any other alignments where a particular group feels that there is a need to appear together on the political arena to further and safeguard the interests of that community. I think that right should be respected and allowed for. So, it is in this context that these amendments are welcome. Also, the other reality we have to recognize is that alliances are formed as a result. I am glad that these amendments will enable political parties to form alliances, maybe stable alliances which will continue for a period of time or maybe short-term alliances. The amendments proposed make provisions for either eventuality. Therefore, I think that again is a healthy development. On the question of community and minority rights, I would like to acknowledge the points made by my good Friend, the Hon. Sampanthan because when bringing about unity in our country, we have to think not only in geographical terms and have one united country but also we have to build one united Sri Lankan nation. To build that Sri Lankan nation, we have to respect the diversity that we have in our society and allow that diversity to exist, not to wipe it out; it has to be there. The identities of those diverse communities should be respected and they should be allowed to express themselves even in the political arena. So, any attempt to take away that right should be resisted. We have to ensure that those rights are respected and the fact that there will be alliances developing which will enable even small groups to share

2009 24 3221 3222

in power is also, I think, a healthy development so that in the process of governance different points of view, different interests can get representation. So, I think this amended legislation may improve the situation where political activity in our country is concerned. I would say that we have to be sensitive to the points that the Hon. Sampanthan raised and it is for this very reason that the All Party Representative Committee has been meeting. There has been a considerable representation of different communities in the discussions that have taken place, different political opinions and it is through that mix that we can get the type of agreement, the consensus that we need to achieve the stability in our society. It is my intention, that at some stage in the process to invite the Tamil National Alliance and it is also my fervent hope that at that time, Hon. Sampanthan, you will respond positively and participate in that process of Constitution-forming, which I think is vital to build a united Sri Lankan nation. So, I accept the comments that you have made with due respect and let us, through this, build the type of unity that will ensure a stable Government in our country where there is no need for any divisive forces to raise separatist issues but where we can live together in one country as one Sri Lankan people. I hope that this amended legislation will pave the way for such a future.

, . , , , , . The Chairman of the Select Committee would agree that all Members of the Select Committee have taken painstaking effort to introduce reforms to our electoral laws which we have attempted, as far as practicable, to bring through consensus. Unfortunately, there have been certain areas where we could not agree but within the confines of Parliamentary tradition, we have seen to it that our voice of dissent was expressed through the available processes. Also, unfortunately, my party has had to seek the intervention of court in order to contest two Bills that came out of the efforts of the Select Committee. Whatever it may be, we went to court and challenged the amendments to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. The Supreme Court held that certain provisions of that Bill were in contravention of certain provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and referred it to all the Provincial Councils.

3227 3228

[ ]

For the Bill to be ultimately taken up in Parliament, every Provincial Council will have to give their assent upon that Bill. Then, subsequently this Bill came up and there again we found certain offending provisions, which went to the very root of existence of some of us as political parties, became an issue. There again we had to go to the Supreme Court where we were joined by some of our Colleagues on the Government side who belonged to the Leftist tradition like the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and even I am sure the Communist Party, though they did not come officially to court, they were in agreement with the contention upon which we went before the Supreme Court. So, what I say here is that it was very unfortunate that some of these provisions which very clearly violate provisions of the Constitution have crept into the Bill and it had been totally overlooked by the Chief Legal Officer of the State, the Attorney-General, who had apparently given a certificate to say that the entire Bill is in total conformity with the Constitution. We are thankful to the Supreme Court that we were able to intervene and vindicate our rights, that too within that limited period of seven days. But, this is not always possible in such a very short period and sometimes the way in which these provisions have been worded, specially this particular offending Clause where it sought to deny recognition of parties based on religion or community appears to have been very surreptitiously included and on a very cursory reading sometimes you tend to miss these things. This is what had happened in the Select Committee. When we questioned, we were told that way back in February or March the Bill was presented to the Select Committee. I would like to even ask the Chairman to prevent such occurrences happening in the future. It would be better for us to go through Clause by Clause of the Bill that has been prepared and take a decision in the Select Committee rather than just approve the Bill. We felt that the plea of the Commissioner of Elections, where he had faced a lot of difficulties, was very justifiable. Originally, there was a separate Bill prepared, which dealt with recognition and de-recognition of political parties and we found that it contained certain practical difficulties and finally we suggested that the Commissioner amends the Parliamentary Elections Act, No.1 of 1981. That is how the genesis of this Bill came into being. But, however, now quite strangely enough, both at the Select Committee level and at the Cabinet level, they have all been misled into approving a Bill which contained provisions clearly in violation of the Constitution, which gave pride of place to issues regarding fundamental rights, freedom and even issues of sovereignty. Therefore - I am not pointing a finger at the Attorney-General - how are we to take the Attorney-Generals certificate as carte blanche and then agree on these Bills? So, as an officer assisting the Select Committee and the Cabinet, the Attorney-General will have to be a little more cautious in going into these matters because precious time has been lost. Some of us had virtually been on pins about the entire future of politics in this country. Ultimately you have to look at the way in which the politics of this country has been shaped since

Independence. I know that a previous speaker even went to the extent of saying - because that appears to be the ideology of this Government - that there are certain minor parties which are very opportunistic in their politics. But opportunism, Venerable Presiding Member, is not a monopoly of the minor parties and the minority parties. We have seen in history that opportunism in politics is a common trait that runs across all parties in this country. Therefore, it is very unfortunate that we come to such conclusions and take certain parochial and short-sighted decisions to finally complicate the democratic space that is available to espouse the diversity that is there in this country. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I do not want to go further; I will conclude with this. But, let me also say that we must be cautious in the future because this morning there was an issue concerning the legality of a Bill that was being debated. So, this has become a perennial problem. Therefore, it would be better for the Chief Legal Officer of the Government, the Attorney-General, to be a little more cautious in his approach. Despite the fact that the Select Committee had agreed to delete these provisions, no such assertion was made before the Supreme Court. Only when the Supreme Court wanted them to reconsider it that they, as if it was very generously conceded by the Attorney-General to delete it, considered it. But previously, the Minutes were very specific that those offending portions should be removed. Therefore, I am making this as a complaint so that no such things happen in the future. I am glad that we have been able to at least bring in certain laudable features into the Parliamentary Elections Act so that the Commissioner of Elections will have the possibility of regulating it. There again, I must insist that this issue of regulation must not go to the extent of an unnecessary interventionist approach. I am sure the Commissioner of Elections, who is a gentleman who has held his office with a very even-handed, balanced approach, will be quite pleased today and we are also very happy that we were able to assist him. But, in the meantime I must also say I am sad and quite hurt because the way in which some of these things have been handled in the past has affected the credibility and the trust we have had in the Select Committee process. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . 08 .

! . , . . . Sir, I want to say a few words in English also. I am very sorry to say this, Hon. Minister. You are a very fair Minister. Whenever we asked for something, you have been very generous. You gave appointments to 43,000 people. But, in this case, I know we will have a negative reply. What are we to do? We have to just listen to you and you are also helpless. It is on our part to agitate. So, I must go and tell my people, "I spoke about it in Parlia-ment; I told the Minister; I have done my part and we will wait and see". I will say, I myself will organize an udgoshanaya or some procession and we will see. There is little time, four months more for Parliament to be dissolved. I hope that one day I would lead the proces-sion and try to do something. I do not know what will happen. The second matter is about disabled children who are entitled for their parents' pension. I know there are a large number of applications. They are trying to scrutinize the applications. But, there are a few genuine cases; one or two. The officers are very careful because people give false information, false documents and try to deceive the Government. In that situation, we also have a very diffi-cult time. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I do not know how to convince the officers of the Department of Persons, but I myself know that there are genuine cases. I can only do one thing I can swear that the particular child of that fam-ily is disabled, not married, sick, he has got a medical certificate and try to help that child. Otherwise, I do not know how this problem could be solved. Hon. Minister, you must find a solution to this. We do not know how to prove the truth when there are so many false things going on in this country.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I just want to say one thing. If there are cases like that, please bring them to my notice. I will personally intervene and try to help you. Not only you, but any Member of Parliament has the right to address the Minister and seek a remedy.

. ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Thank you. Sir, I worked for 42 years in the Govern-ment Service and three years in an NGO. Then, I retired and came to politics. So far, I have tried my level best to be honest. I do not want to deceive anybody and so far I have not done so, up to now. So, I will not mislead; I will not give false information. The second matter is, it is not only in the Department of Pensions but even in other departments, the person concerned should get a letter granting permission to go on

pension. That letter is required by the Department of Pen-sions. To get that letter, they have to run after the heads of departments for four to seven months, especially, I would say, in the Department of Education. They say, You are an officer of the Principals' Service. Your files are at the head office. They go to the provincial councils but they are also helpless. Then, they come back to the Department of Education again. This takes a lot of time. That time factor must be reduced. They go on pension. You issue the letter stating that you allow him to go on pension. You have a hold, you know that you are going to pay them the pension. Then do not pay their pension if it is a false case or something like that; but give them that letter. Without the letter, the Department of Pensions cannot process the pension papers. I will not prolong my speech anymore. Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giv-ing me time to say a few words. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . 5 .
