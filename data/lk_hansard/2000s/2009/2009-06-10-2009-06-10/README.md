Speaker, for giving me an opportunity to speak at a time when the Government is imposing taxes on specific commodities and other revenue-gaining measures. When there is a cost reduction and an increase in revenue, the question that many people ask is whether it is desirable to put the burden on the people. Come what may, firstly, I think it is desirable to ensure that we look at a national economy. We have been talking from the day we received Independence, of economic revolutions, but it has only led to peoples revolutions. We, at this particular moment, have a responsibility to ensure that we develop an economy that is able to withstand the pressures, the vicissitudes that take place in the international arena. So, I think it is time now, instead of colourizing the economy, to think of a national economy and work together. We have been telling this from day dot. Unfortunately, the acrimonious political environment that is prevalent ensures that anything that comes from the Opposition is treated as disdain and in a very vitriolic sense, but anything that comes from the Government is treated as nothing but the truth and that needs to be pursued. So, I think it is incumbent on us to pursue that goal at a time when our heroic forces have made a historic victory. We congratulate them; we thank them. But, the Government

* . . Placed in the Library.

must ensure that there are many other activities that they have got to be continued. As a Government, you have got to ensure that you give leadership to all ends. There is no subsection that you can take over and ensure that only that area is pursued by neglecting the rest. That is why I think there is no better time than this particular moment - sometimes there are wrong steps taken at the wrong time - to take the right steps. It may be one step in the right direction and I think that is what is required. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . , [ ] .

If the Minister of Finance says that there is no Letter of Intent that has been proceeded with or sent to the IMF, on what basis do they give money? Do they suddenly get up and say Here we will give you some money. So if the Letter of Intent is not given, then why has that application not been made? Labour GSP, we offered; let us work together and protect it. There are two months more. I hope it is going in the correct direction because we got it; you and I, all assisted to get that. So, let us protect it in the same way. It is the same with regard to IMF. Let us ensure that we get the money from the IMF. Where on earth do you have an Opposition coming forward in this manner? When we come forward to assist you, you say, It is too little too late. We have been right along saying, let us work towards a national economy whether it is the labour GSP Plus or the IMF loan. The intentions are pure. But, ensure that we comply with what is expected. A Letter of Intent is like a loan application. Without doing that, you do not expect the IMF to come and say, Here is money for the country. We together can ensure that that is obtained. If the Government does not have such intentions you tell us, so that we will stay aside. We see how a difficult matter becomes much more difficult. But, then we say, Let us work together; develop the national economy without putting any further burden on the people. These are the areas that we have got to look at. On one side, the Central Bank says, We do not want the IMF loan. On the other, you say, IMF loan is paramount. The people in the banking sector know how important the IMF loan is. The General Manager and CEO, Seylan Bank, Ajitha Pasqual, has said in "The Sunday Leader", IMF loan is needed to kick-start the economy. To our knowledge our US Dollar reserves are

417 418

roughly in the range of 600 to 800 million - we do not know; we are not kept informed. So, assuming that it is 600 to 800 million, with the hedging loans that need to be paid, with the Iran loans that need to be paid, with the trade balance and the deficit that comes in and with the amortization that needs to take place, we need a revenue reserve of about US Dollars 6,500 million. As it is, you need US Dollars 5,000 million more. So, even if we work together assuming that the Government says Yes, we want your help" and we come forward to get it, there is still going to be a gap. How is that gap going to be bridged? These are the things that need to be discussed. This is a national economy. This is not a budget of a particular party. That is why we have got to ensure that we work with a nationalistic approach. Senator Feinstein and Senator Bond - I am sure the Hon. G.L. Peiris will know - have come forward selecting certain least developing countries exporting garments to the US on a duty-free basis. They have named 14 countries, 12 of them are recipients. Two of them are subject to receive, if certain obligations are complied with. I am sure this is not being looked at from a rejected point of view because the textile industry is in serious turmoil. So, the only way possible is to ensure cost reduction in the country, if not revenue increase, or the benefits that come in between. If the cost cannot be reduced and the income cannot be generated, then what are the fringe benefits that come in, in order to ensure that we get to that point? So, on that score, the benefits of duty-free access to European Union is a must and that is why we said, Let us work on the Labour GSP together. We talk of the American economy and we say once again that this is an area where collectively we can achieve much more than leaving it to the Government or the Opposition. Here are Senators coming forward and saying, Option is there. I quote Section 4 (c) of Mrs. Feinstein's document - A bill to extend certain trade preferences to certain least-developed countries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. Sri Lanka Economic Emergency Support.-- For purposes of this Act, the President may also designate Sri Lanka as beneficiary TRADE Act of 2009 country eligible for benefits described in section 5. Section 5 gives certain reasons and compliance factors that need to be done. Why do we not ensure that, because 60 per cent of our textiles goes into US? We should be working together to ensure duty-free access. I hope you are working on it. If not, it is time to work to ensure that we have a national economy at heart. So, Hon. Minister, I am only labouring the point because at the end of the day we must ensure that we have an export-led growth factor. We find that there is a Western bashing system taking place. Let us change this approach. You can catch more bees with honey than with vinegar. That should be the approach. There is no point in saying, let us bash the West and export to the West.

This is the problem, Hon. Minister. I guess you have the knowledge, the wherewithal and the sagacity to go forward. But, that may not be prevalent in the Government. It is time that that seeps in. We often see, on one side you have the heterogeneous alliance members who say, We do not want the West; we do not want their conditions; give if we want. We are not the only girl on the beach. When it comes to export, we are not the only country in the world to receive aid; we are not the only country confronted with problems. Problems are there in all countries. We must snatch the opportunities that are there. So, just do not bash the UNP and think that that is going to help the problem. , , . . . . , , . . , . . , . , 2004 752 . ? 202 . ? ? ? ? , . . . . . , , . 61 . . . . . , travel advisories . ? ; , . . . . . 222 . .

. , , , . 2 . 18, 26. ? . . Hon. Minister, these are the matters that need to be taken up. You, as a former Minister of Finance, as an export development manager and as Minister of Export Development and International Trade, must ensure that the issues of the small and medium enterprises sector, which is the backbone of our economy and 65 per cent of which revolves round the economy, are redressed. If the inflation is coming down, correspondently there should be a reduction in the interest levels. The lack of that shows that there is something hidden. That is the issue. At the end of the day, it is a Government-Opposition bashing that takes place. This type of political culture needs to be changed. This is the problem. I think this new step, even though it is far late, is opportune. A right step can be taken at any right moment and there is no better time than this. But, ensure that it has sincerity; it has purpose; it is visionary and it is not just for the sake of saying so. So, see that the service sector, tourism and the small and medium enterprises sector are developed. There must be absolute, resolute action taken against corruption. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

So, Hon. Minister, whether it is regarding the IMF, the Labour GSP or duty-free access to America, ensure that we work together on these areas. You would see that the Opposition has been very responsible even though the Government makes it their hobby to character-assassinate the UNP. No, that has not been the case with us.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Member, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will heed your advice. If there is an overstepping of time, you can reduce it from the time allotted to the Hon. Kabir Hashim because he is not speaking. So, Sir, I take the liberty of taking one or two minutes more. I do not want to labour the same point once again. Today, there are certain problems in the Port. The competitiveness is not there anymore. Singapore is giving competition on one side; Port Klang is there on the other side; Port Fujairah is on the left-hand side. The shipping industry is basically in a major crisis. Why? Because cost inputs have taken place in the Port of Colombo. The competitiveness of the Port of Colombo is eroded and as a result, shipping lines are looking at the most efficient ports. So, when they choose international routes, they put down Sri Lanka as a less competitive port and at many times, they ensure that they do not come to the Port of Colombo because it is not competitive enough for them to come in. Now, with the new computerization process that has been adopted, there are many problems. The efficiency of handling 25 to 30 containers an hour has reduced to 10 to 12 containers, I am informed. This needs to be corrected. There is no point in saying, Okay, there is a problem, forget it and we are happy with the performance. It is the national economy that you are playing with. So, Hon. Minister, that is why we are saying that that needs to be corrected immediately, because that is one of the most important sectors in this country. In the service sector, the shipping industry plays a pivotal role.

There is the Sethusamudram Project through which the Indians are trying to take the advantage away from Sri Lanka. India will do what is good for them. We do not expect India to do what is good for us. But, it is incumbent upon us to do what is good for us. At this moment, we are only playing into the hands of the shipping industry of India. So, before the Sethusamudram Canal comes in, ensure that Sri Lanka has its shipping

industry developed in such a manner that competition from India would be impossible. If India sets out with a number of ports around its coast, Sri Lanka would be subjugated because 80 per cent of our transshipments come in as Indias exports. So, this is what we need to rectify, where the threats should be eradicated and ensure that we seize the opportunity available. Ensure that the Indian shipping industry does not overtake us. If they develop and we sleep on it, let us not blame India.

So, that is why Sri Lanka needs to have a national economy and that national economy should not be colourized; that non-colourization needs to have tough decisions taken on a coherent, consistent basis. That is how we can resurrect little Sri Lanka. Ensure that we are made to shine on the world map rather than letting the light to fade away. Let us not have the "lighthouse" theory adopted. The light that flashes out there searches things afar, but what is beneath it is not being looked at. That is where we need to correct ourselves. So, let us rectify, correct, work together and ensure that we bring about a national economy.

So, Hon. Minister, all I could basically say is, as I mentioned before, the Government in the course of obtaining the deficit between the revenue and the cost that is galloping, has three options: either you print money, borrow or you tax. Now, we have come to the saturation point with all three options. So, rectification needs to be done. If we are to increase the revenue, I think we have done it and finished off. If we are to borrow, I do not think there is anymore that you can borrow. If you are to print money, you will only end up with inflation rising. So, we have got to revolutionize our thinking; we have got to ensure that we think from a different point of view. I guess the time has come for us to work together and let us seize that opportunity.

The Budget was presented six months ago. The Central Bank in its bulletins has stated that the revenues have dropped, the costs have increased and deficiencies are coming up. Who is going to ensure that those are corrected? As I mentioned before the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena came in, from 1948 to 2005, our total borrowings in public debt had been Rs. 1,783 billion. From 2005 to today, within five years or four and a half years, we have gone up to Rs. 4,500 billion. That is an increase of almost Rs. 2,800 billion. That has put us into a debt trap. Now, we must ensure that that is looked at. We cannot just say that that is a debt trap and finish off. That is why we told them, Do not go after HSBC loans. Go after IMF and World Bank loans, which are conditional, but good. Now, you are reverting to that step. So, ensure that those things are looked at, that we work together and let us not put the burden on the people.

Thank you.

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. LALITH DISSANAYAKE took the Chair.

[. . 11.29] . . ( ) ( . . - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Mr. Presiding Member, I greatly appreciate the attitude that was reflected in the speech made just now by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, who extended the co-operation of the Opposition in dealing with the countrys economy. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said that we have arrived at a critical juncture in the history of our country and that all of us together, collectively have to deal with matters pertaining to the health and the well-being of Sri Lankas economy. I think that is very much the right spirit and we appreciate that. I think what the Hon. Member was explicitly acknowledging was the fact that the one impediment which prevented the realization of the country's fullest economic potential for the last 20 years has now been removed. But, there is another challenge which is equally formidable and that is the challenge of dealing with the economy. So, that is what the Government is addressing in earnest and the co-operation of all sections of the public for the achievement of success is a national need at this time. I would like the Hon. Member to appreciate in a spirit of objectivity, which certainly was characteristic of his speech, the facts of the current situation. Today, there is a certain myth that is being propagated that the international community, whatever that means, is hostile to Sri Lanka.

I assert, Sir, that that is not the case. I would like to inform the House of some of the developments which took place during the last week when I visited Japan and China to discuss the very matters which the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake referred to. In both countries, when I spoke to the political leadership as well as the leaders of industry and commerce, what I realized very clearly was the enormous fund of goodwill that exists in those countries for Sri Lanka. They all realize that Little Sri Lanka has achieved something that was thought to be well-nigh; almost impossible. We have defeated terrorism; we have put the country on the path of development, and the leaders of those countries said very clearly - for example, the Chinese Minister of Trade and Commerce, the Hon. Chen Deming, said, We admire what you have done. It could not have been easy. But, you have accomplished that. We did not think that that would really be feasible. Now, we think that our duty is to come in vigorously to make the fullest use of the vistas of opportunities that are now opening up to encourage our private sector to do the same". This was specifically mentioned in Japan. Japans Deputy Minister of Commerce, the Hon. Nikai as well as the Foreign Minister, Nakasone told me in Japan that the road is now clear. Earlier there were projects which were evaluated; they were going ahead with those projects but they were put on hold because of terrorism in the country. Now that there is no violence; the problem of terrorism has come to an end. Their view articulated with great emphasis was that there is no longer any hindrance, so we can go ahead, we can come into Sri Lanka and we can now rapidly do the things that we were hesitating to do in recent years because of the problem of terrorism. These are not mere words, Sir, there are very substantial things that Tokyo and Beijing are doing for us. For example, the Government of China is committed to three major projects, one of which is the development of the Port of Hambantota. The second is the thermal power project in Puttalam and the third is the development of a centre for the performing arts. Now, Chinas Minister for Commerce told me at that meeting which we had in Beijing, in the presence of Sri Lankas Ambassador to China, His Excellency Karunatillake Amunugama, that China will be taking action to accelerate the implementation of the Port of Hambantota project. Japan is equally involved in several projects which are critical to our economy. They are upgrading the facilities of the hospital in Anuradhapura. Japan has already given this country the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital. They are responsible for the establishment of an institute for the training of nurses. In the same spirit, they are now upgrading the facilities in the hospital at Anuradhapura. They are also involved in the construction of major bridges in Batticaloa and Mannar. So, these countries are coming in, in a big way. The Foreign Minister, Nakasone of Japan told me that he was sending the Special Envoy of Japan, Yasushi Akashi, who is familiar with conditions in

6 PL 004071 (2009/06)

425 426

Sri Lanka to make an on-the-spot assessment as a basis for proceeding very rapidly with major projects which the Japanese have in mind. Yasushi Akashi is at present in Colombo. I will be meeting him at 2 oclock in the afternoon in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We will be talking to him with the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama and several other Ministers to tell him about Sri Lankas priorities at the present time. What is equally encouraging is the vigorous involvement of the private sector. In Japan, the leading companies of Japan that are active in Sri Lanka had substantive discussions with me and the Japanese companies were led by Mitsui who constructed this Parliament building. Mitsui is well-known in Japan. They are respected as a leader of industry. Mitsui wants to undertake more and more work in Sri Lanka taking full advantage of the opportunities that are now available with the final and irrevocable defeat of terrorism. Now, when a large company like Mitsui comes in at this time, that is considered a flagship investment and that will encourage other smaller companies to come into the country. So, companies like Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Noritake, all met me in Tokyo and indicated their firm resolve to participate vigorously in the economic development of Sri Lanka. It is also worthy of mention that the apex Chambers of Commerce and Industry representing 27 countries of the Asia Pacific region met in Yokohama, Japan and they made a decision to hold their next meeting in Sri Lanka. That is an overwhelming vote of confidence in the stability of this country and the potential that is now available for rapid economic progress and social advancement. The private sector of Sri Lanka is working closely with us to make this development a reality. In Yokohama, I was joined by Mr. Jayampathy Bandaranayake, the Head of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Kosala Wickremanayake, the Chairman of the Federation of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka. So, from 27 countries the leading chambers of business unanimously decided that the best venue for their next meeting will be Sri Lanka. So, this grouping involved companies in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Korea and the Philippines. They all agreed that the atmosphere that prevails in Sri Lanka today is conducive to vigorous participation on the part of the private sector. It is also necessary, Sir, to explode some of the myths that are being spread by interested parties in order to do harm to Sri Lanka. There has been a great deal of discussion about displaced persons. Of course, we must understand the magnitude of the task; how difficult it is to cater for the needs of 270,000 people who have been displaced. One must understand the multi-faceted nature of the task and give credit where credit is due. Sri Lanka has done an exceedingly good job in providing, for example, health facilities for this large number of persons.

It is certainly not true that the Government was interested only in securing a victory. We have put in place ambitious plans to cater for the humanitarian needs of these people and to address in earnest the economic development of those parts of the country and indeed the whole island, in order to make possible the restoration of livelihoods of people who have suffered pain and anguish in consequence of the situation that existed for the last 20 years. I also stressed in a speech that I made to the National Press Club in Tokyo where journalists from the West were present in large numbers, that the Government of Sri Lanka will be reviving the democratic process by holding local government elections in the Northern Province within the next few months. The attitude which I encountered in both capitals, in Tokyo and in Beijing, can be summarized in this way. The leaders of those countries said, What should be the attitude of the international community under these circumstances? We must appreciate Sri Lankas achievement and we must now join hands with Sri Lanka in dealing with the very difficult problems pertaining to economic development that lie ahead. It is not for us to force, to put in the way of the Sri Lankan Government obstacles and impediments, to make things as difficult as possible, to make unfounded charges. On the contrary what we should do is to find out what the genuine needs of the country are and to do whatever we can to assist in a spirit of understanding, goodwill and empathy. That was very much the attitude that was encountered in these capitals and we are very grateful for that.

I think the Government of Sri Lanka has achieved a major triumph not only in the military action but also internationally. The voting that took place recently in Geneva gave the Government of Sri Lanka an overwhelming majority. We secured 29 votes. Only 12 votes were cast against us and there were six abstentions. So, this means that the overwhelming majority of countries that participated were convinced of the justice of Sri Lankas cause and they supported us unreservedly. This was a combination of various groups of countries. The African countries, the Asian countries, the Muslim countries - they all came together to support Sri Lanka. So this idea that the international community is hostile, that they look down on us, that they disapprove of what we are doing is fictitious. That is not the case at all.

Today, in the media there is a reference to a very important statement made by Mr. Shiv Shankar Menon, the Foreign Secretary of India, who says that this is a problem of Sri Lanka and basically India will not think it necessary or suitable to tell Sri Lanka what to do. I think that should be the enlightened attitude of foreign countries. They cannot make decisions for us. They can certainly assist us. We do not propose to work in isolation in an interdependent world. That is not a realistic policy. But, decisions relating to the future of

[ . . ]

2009 10 427 428

our country must be made by a government that has a mandate from the people of this country. Donor nations cannot be in the driving seat, although they can certainly play a supportive role. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake referred to several matters including the IMF loan. Now, here again, there is nothing wrong in applying for a loan. IMF loans have been obtained by Sri Lanka on many occasions in the past. However, we have emphasized that there is no question of Sri Lanka accepting conditions which are harmful to the public welfare. That is a matter of sovereignty. It is only the Government of the country that can decide what is best for its people. So we are involved in a process of negotiation with the International Monetary Fund. It is our position that IMF loans are always given on technical criteria. Political circumstances cannot be taken into consideration. So we have applied for a loan. We consider ourselves to be entitled to the loan because we satisfy the criteria. But, under no circumstances will we agree to conditions which are harmful to this country. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have only two more minutes. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

I will conclude rapidly, Sir. Then, the other point that was made by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake related to GSP Plus facility which we enjoy from the European Union. Now, of course the GSP Plus facility is very useful to Sri Lanka. It gives access for 7,100 items into the markets of 27 European countries. But, that does not mean that we are prepared to barter the sovereignty of this country for this benefit. We have made it very clear that we are prepared to engage in a discussion with the European Commission through normal diplomatic channels, to deal with all matters that arise from Sri Lankas application for the extension of GSP Plus for another two years. We are certainly prepared to do that. In fact, consultations are taking place all the time. I, myself have been to Brussels. The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama went there. Dr. Palitha Kohona is constantly talking to his counterparts in Brussels. So, through normal diplomatic conduits, those discussions are taking place. However, we have made it very clear that we will not accept an investigation into Sri Lanka; an inquisition is not acceptable. This is a sovereign country and we cannot put ourselves to the humiliation of an investigation of this country by a foreign country or a group of foreign countries. That is clearly unacceptable. So, that is the position with regard to GSP Plus. That benefit is at the moment available. Orders are still coming in for spring and for summer. There has been no change with regard to that and we have every confidence that we

satisfy the criteria stipulated in the conventions that govern the issue and we have no reason to believe that action will be taken by the European Commission to deny the country the benefit of a concession which has been granted to us on proper and objective criteria. So, these are the matters which I wanted to place at the disposal of the House, Sir. I conclude on this note. The international community understands the situation in this country. Certainly, that was the case with Japan and China. They are extending to us the hand of friendship to work with us as we confront the challenges of economic development, having overcome the one problem which impeded the economic and social development of this country for as long a period as two decades. Thank you very much, Sir. [. . 11.47] . . ( . . ) (The Hon. R. M. Gamini Rathnayake) , . , 90 . 10 . . . . . . 80 . . 2006 10 . 1,000. . GST . . , , , , , , , , . 2006 1,000 . . . . 1,000 . . . 10
