: : Determination of the Supreme Court: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA SC. (SD) No. 02/2009 DEFAULT TAXES (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) BILL PRESENT : J.A.N. de Silva, Judge of the Supreme Court D.J. de S. Balapatabendi, Judge of the Supreme Court P.A. Ratnayake, Judge of the Supreme Court COUNSEL : A.P. Niles with Champaka Ladduwahetty instructed by Chithrananda Gemunu Liyanage for Petitioner. Nihal Sri Amarasekera - Intervenient - Petitioner Present in Person. Indika Demuni de Silva, DSG. With Nerin Pulle, SSC. for A.G. Court assembled for hearing on 29th April 2009. at 10.00 a.m. A Bill titled Default Taxes (Special Provisions) Bill has been presented to Parliament and was placed on the Order Paper of Parliament on 7th April 2009. The Petitioner has challenged its constitutionality by the papers presented to this Court and has thereby invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution. Hon. Attorney General was given due notice of the Petition and Mrs. Indika Demuni De Silva, Deputy Solicitor General assisted Court in considering the constitutionality of the Bill and its Provision. The Bill seeks to give effect to a 2008 Budget Proposal which is to provide for a stream lined and speedier process for the recovery of taxes in default. It also provides for the writing off of taxes in default in certain circumstances. The Petitioner and the Intervenient Petitioner objected to Clause 6 of the Bill on the basis that the write off of default taxes in respect of the institutions enumerated therein is discriminatory vis--vis other defaulters such as private entities and therefore it violates Article 12(1) of the Constitution. It was submitted on behalf of the Attorney General that the classification is based on intelligible criteria and that it bears a reasonable and a rational relation to the object and effects sought to be achieved. In this regard it was further submitted that the write off of Taxes in Default is confined to those institutions enumerated under Clause 6 of the Bill and which are dependent on Government funding to meet their tax liabilities. In SC. Special Determination 28/2004 the Court states as follows :- However, it is to be borne in mind that in terms of Article 15(7) of the Constitution, the exercise and operation of all the fundamental rights declared and recognized by Articles 12, 13(1), 13(2) and 14 shall be subject to certain restrictions prescribed by law. These restrictions according to Article 15(7), ..subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed by law in the interests of national security, public order and the protection of public health or morality, or for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others, or of meeting the just requirements of the general welfare of a democratic society (emphasis added). The main purpose of the Bill, as pointed out earlier is to implement the Budget proposals of 2004, and it is undoubtedly for the purpose of general welfare of a democratic society. To the extent the Clause would come within the exception granted in terms of Article 15 (7) of the Constitution.

1757 1758

In our opinion, the same could be said in respect of the Provisions of this Bill. In SC. SD. 03/80 Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill where exemptions of Income Tax were given only in respect of undertakings which has a capital of over Rs. 500 million this Court has held as follows:- It may be considered that the exemption from income tax of profits and income of undertakings which has a capital of over Rs. 500 million when undertakings with more modest capital are liable to pay income tax on their profits and income is discriminatory and offends against the provisions relating to equality in the Constitution. This is, however, fiscal legislation and it is a matter for the Legislature to decide what considerations relating to the amelioration of hardship or to the interests of the economic progress of the people should be given effect to. Presumably, this provision is sought to be enacted on the basis of economic consideration in respect of which the decision must largely be left to the Legislature in view of the inherent complexity of fiscal adjustment of diverse elements that requires to be made. Based on the above reasoning, we are of the view that as submitted on behalf of the Attorney General that the classification made in Clause 6 is based on intelligible criteria and that it bears a reasonable and a rational relation to the object and effects sought to be achieved. It was further submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that the Provisions of the Bill effects Parliamentary control over Public Finance. Reference was drawn to Article 148 of the Constitution. Article 148 states as follows:- Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law. It was contended that discretion was vested with the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue without proper guidelines under the Provisions contained in Clause 7 of the Bill. The Deputy Solicitor General took up the position that the said Provision in Clause 7 do not provide any discretion to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. In any event, attention of Court was drawn to Sections 145, 165 (13) and 175 (3) (c) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and also to Section 113 of the Financial Regulations where discretion has been given to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in dealing with public revenue. However, the Court observed that the application of Clause 7 (1) (b) in its present form would give a discretion to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue to obtain the certification from the Secretary to the Treasury only in circumstances where he deems it necessary. Such a wide discretion vested on the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue would be arbitrary. Accordingly this Provision would be violative of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. However, The said inconsistency would cease if the words where necessary is deleted. In this context, the Learned DSG. agreed to suggest an amendment to delete the said words at the Committee Stage of the Parliament. In the absence of such an amendment the Bill would require a special majority as laid down by Article 84 (2) of the Constitution. Clause 2 of the Bill deals with the application of the Provisions of the Act and applies to the recovery, discharge or write off of taxes, charged and levied on or before 31.12.2007 under any of the laws specified in the schedule to the Bill and which are in default for a period of over two or more years. This Clause provides a definition for Tax in Default. In this context, Court is of the view that the term Tax in Default may be appropriately amended in order to ensure that the Statutory Appellate Procedures where applicable should be exhausted prior to a person being deemed defaulter for the purposes of Clause 2 of the Bill.

For the reasoning stated above, we make a determination, in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution that Clause 7 (1) (b) of the Bill in its present form is inconsistent with Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and therefore this Bill may only be passed by the special majority as provided for in Article 84 (2) of the Constitution. We make a further determination in terms of Article 23 of the Constitution that the inconsistency stated above would cease if Clause 7 (1) (b) is replaced by a Provision on the following lines. having obtained the confirmation of the Secretary to the Treasury, that such categories of institutions are dependent on Government funding to meet their tax liabilities. Apart from Clause 7 (1) (b) none of the other Provision of the Bill are inconsistent with the Provisions of the Constitution. We wish to place on record our appreciation of the assistance rendered to Court by the Deputy Solicitor General, the Counsel for the Petitioner and Mr. Nihal Sri Amarasekera who appeared in person.

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . . . . . , . Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa has raised a matter of national importance and given the significance of the subject matter, I wish to respond to his statement as follows. Firstly, I will deal with the attack carried out by operatives of the LTTEs international terror network on our Embassy in Oslo on Sunday, 12th April, 2009. As the Hon. Members would be aware, the Government of Sri Lanka immediately condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms and on the very next day itself, summoned the Royal Norwegian Ambassador in Colombo to the Foreign Ministry and lodged a strong protest at the failure of the Norwegian authorities to take adequate security measures to prevent this premeditated and cowardly assault on our Embassy in Oslo. As stated in my formal communication to the Norwegian Government, this attack was a clear breach of Norways internationally-binding legal obligations to afford protection to diplomatic premises on its territory in terms of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18th April, 1961. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the Foreign Ministry also issued a statement denouncing the attack. I wish to table* this media release, which is self-explanatory, to be included in Hansard.

It was in the spirit of statesmanship and humanitarian goodwill that President Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a directive to the armed forces on 12th April, 2009 to restrict their operations to those of a defensive nature in order to give the civilian population held hostage in the No-fire Zone by the LTTE the opportunity to celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil New Year in a suitable atmosphere. However, this festive goodwill gesture of the President was marred by the premeditated attack on our Mission in Norway. As this House is aware, in the recent past there have been a number of demonstrations organized by the LTTEs international network across the globe. Hon. Members, this attack displays the contempt with which the LTTE has continued to treat the repeated concessions made by the Sri Lankan Government. In these circumstances, the Norwegian Government was informed that the Government of Sri Lanka perceived that it was no longer feasible for Norway to act as a facilitator in its engagements with Sri Lanka in the current context. We strongly urged the Norwegian Government to apprehend the perpetrators of the attack and bring them to justice. My Norwegian counterpart, Jonas Gahre Store, immediately condemned the attack on our Mission. In a Statement issued by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry on the day of the incident itself, on 12th April, he stated, I deeply deplore the fact that unauthorized persons unlawfully forced their way into the Sri Lankan Embassy in Oslo and caused extensive damage. This is a violation of Norwegian law and an action that is totally unacceptable. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition Progress Party, Per Sandberg, also denounced the attack. In a statement he said, When one attacks and vandalizes an Embassy, one is not only in violation of Norwegian law, but one is almost making a declaration of war. I take it for granted that this would be investigated thoroughly and that the people responsible for the destruction are immediately sent out of the country and back to Sri Lanka, no matter what conditions they may face there. Within two hours of the incident, Mr. Jon Hanssen Bauer, the Norwegian Special Envoy to Sri Lanka, visited the Embassy and expressed his deepest sympathy to our Ambassador on behalf of the Norwegian Government. The Chief of Protocol of their Foreign Ministry also visited the Embassy to convey the Norwegian Governments condemnation of the incident. The Minister of International Development, Erik Solheim, who was on vacation at that time, contacted our Ambassador and condemned the attack on our Mission in the strongest possible terms, terming the attack as an outrage which was totally unacceptable. Immediately after the attack on the Embassy, the Norwegian Police issued a public apology for failing in their duty to prevent the attack. The Chief Police

1881 1882

2009 06

Inspector, Johan Fredriksen stated, This is something we are sincerely apologetic about. We are humble and very apologetic for what has happened, and it is without a doubt, the Polices responsibility to maintain security at foreign missions in Oslo. I wish to inform the Hon. Members that the Norwegian Police had taken in 12 persons. . in connection with the terror attack on our Embassy. Further investigations are continuing at two levels, one by the Oslo Police and the other by the Police Security Service - PST - at a higher level. The Head of the Counter Terrorism Department of the Police Security Service, who is closely monitoring the investigations, is in constant touch with our Embassy officials and we expect the Norwegian authorities to prosecute all those involved and mete out stern punishment to the convicted offenders. I have noted a statement released by the Norwegian Government that the Sri Lankan Government would be compensated for the material damage caused to the Mission premises. I thank the Norwegian Government for this gesture, but I wish to state that the Government of Sri Lanka would be undertaking the repairs to the damaged premises at its own cost. We will not seek any compensation or expect repairs to be made by the Norwegian Government. We will be doing our repairs at our own cost accordingly. In response to the terror attack on our Mission in Oslo, the Norwegian authorities have strengthened security measures for both the Embassy and the staff. Round the clock security has now been provided for the Mission premises too - police officers and police vehicles have been deployed in the vicinity of the Embassy. A security cover has also been provided for the Mission staff. I wish to emphasize that the traditional warm and friendly relations that Sri Lanka enjoys with Norway have not been in any manner undermined on account of this unfortunate incident. There was much loose talk of our downgrading diplomatic relations with Norway. That is far from it. Our relationship with Norway is one of endurance and goodwill. Following the return of our previous Ambassador in Oslo, Mr. Rodney Perera, a senior officer of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service has already taken up his post as Ambassador Designate and will be shortly presenting his credentials to the Norwegian monarch. On the positive side, the average Norwegian citizens perspective of Sri Lanka, heavily influenced by the pro-LTTE propaganda, has also undergone a dramatic change following the attack on our Embassy, the footage of which was shown on television. I believe we can now look forward to a better understanding and appreciation of the real situation in our country by the Norwegian Government and the people.

Sir, I made a formal statement in terms of how we have reacted to the attack on our Mission in Oslo. Now, there is a bigger picture that we have to deal with. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . " " "" . . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I think it will be better answered by the Hon. Prime Minister if you raise that when he is here in the House. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) " " "" . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , . . . - I think for the first time we are countering terrorism in its full measure and in a comprehensive manner that today we are encountering the world at large, the international community with an equal commitment and wider engagement. That is the most salient feature of President Mahinda Rajapaksas foreign relations. How we administer this Governments foreign relations lies in the test of it, how we deal with each situation. Nowhere in the history of Sri Lanka have we ever taken on the LTTE in the manner in which we have taken it on today. In order to do that, we had the total support and commitment of the entire international community, which I am proud to state here as the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka. After the visit of the Right Honourable David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, what did he have to say about the LTTE? I will now quote from his statement in the House of Commons immediately after returning from his visit to Sri Lanka. Now, Sir, may I quote the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, the Right Honourable David Miliband. We emphasized that if the LTTE had any heart at all, it would let the civilians leave the conflict zone. It is the LTTE that is preventing people from leaving the conflict zone. I also had the benefit of meeting with the United Kingdoms Parliamentary Delegation that visited us yesterday and in that, there were five Members who visited the camps in Vavuniya. They include, Desmond Henry Browne, Malcolm Gray Bruce, Edward McGrady, Mohammad Sarwar and also John Simon Bercow. These Members met me that evening.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , ? ? ? . . . . . , , . That is the way forward. No one has said there is no political solution that lies ahead of us. We are committed towards a political solution. Let me explain in this House the issue that is before us today. To the question whether international pressure is mounting and whether we are going to subscribe to the international pressure, the answer is "no". We have a local agenda that we are pursuing right across the globe and the world community is being educated well enough to understand the gravity of the situation in Sri Lanka and to be supportive of the Governments agenda currently being pursued. . , I have to respond to this matter. Yes, our President went to the United Kingdom. At that time, what were we looking at? We were even going to Geneva; we were even talking at that time to the LTTE to come to a negotiated settlement. That is what our President expected by going to the United Kingdom, meeting with Tony Blair, who was the Prime Minister at that time, discussing their own experiences in the North Ireland issue and experimenting how best we could address these matters outside a military engagement. But, all those things did not succeed and that is why we were compelled, with the development in Mavil Aru when they closed the Mavil Aru anicut that was supplying water to the Eastern Province, to engage militarily and succeed in clearing the entire Eastern Province. Now, we want to replicate our success in the Northern Province with the humanitarian mission we have undertaken today in freeing the people from the clutches of the LTTE. That is our mission. That mission is being witnessed by the international community and we welcome their presence, their assistance and understanding as to how we are attending to this difficult task. That is the issue before us. I would like as much as my Colleague - the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa called upon the Opposition to join hands in addressing this issue - for us to say in one voice to the outside world that the issue lies here. Let us join hands and explain to the world at large how the Government is looking at this matter. What was the reaction coming from my learned Friend from the United National Party? My good Friend straight off started saying that the issue is on the domestic agenda, the issue

is in the domestic polity. That is what we must avoid when we address the fundamental, core issues that are affecting a nation. We would like a wider understanding to prevail when we get our message across to the international community. Having said that, today I am happy that we could look at the challenges before us. What are the challenges that are before us? The first is, how to get the balance civilians who are entrapped by the LTTE and kept as hostages in the No-fire Zone, which is now restricted to about four and a half square kilometres, out. The second issue is the welfare of the civilians, numbering 120,000, who have fled the No-fire Zone within a period of less than 72 hours, escaping the hold of the LTTE, facing the threats coming from the LTTE and resisting the bullets fired or directed at them. They were waiting to be freed by the Government and they came over to the cleared areas embracing the military as the protectors of the civilian population who were entrapped by the LTTE. They preferred the military over the LTTE. They preferred not only the Government, but also the military apparatus of the Government as protectors of the Tamil civilians who were entrapped by the LTTE. The next challenge that lies ahead of us is, how we are going to treat the IDPs. - [Interruption.] Yes, my Friend? - [Interruption.] No, no. I have all the time for my Friend. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Our grievance is this. The Government cannot gain the remaining territory without causing deaths to thousands of civilians who are trapped there. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) My Friend, you and I have always shared this issue. You never expected 120,000 civilians to flee within 48 hours. Was it your own conviction that it would have been possible at that time? Your answer would have been "no" if we had raised this issue, may be a month ago. - [Interruption.] But today, with regard to the balance, the remaining civilians, success has been shown in our engagement. We will succeed. We will succeed with greater responsibility. We will not have any collateral damage coming on to the civilians and we will engage ourselves in the most careful, the most responsible and the most accountable manner when dealing with the balance civilians who are trapped by the LTTE. No longer can we also tolerate the entrapment of civilians by the LTTE terrorist organization. [Interruption.] I could not finish -

1887 1888

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Our accusation is this. You are crushing the Tamil civilians. Why do you say that you are trying to free them from the clutches of the LTTE? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Yes, we are doing that. - [Interruption.] We are not killing the Tamil civilians. You must go to the camps there. Now, listen to this. If you came and discussed with the President yesterday, in response to his invitation that was extended to the TNA to come over, sit and discuss with him the matter that affects your people, our people - the people of Sri Lanka - we could address these matters in a better way and in a more pragmatic and a practical way. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) If the military operations could be halted, we are ready to meet the President now.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Do not throw a lifeline to the LTTE. - [Interruption.] Let the LTTE die. Let the civilians live. Let the LTTE die. Let the civilians live. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) My good Friend, Mr. Anandasangaree, who is also your good friend, has stated that there are more than one lakh of civilians - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Fair enough. Let there be even more. But, we are responsible for each one of them. Statistics will not count. What matters is every single life. That is what matters to the Government of Sri Lanka. You all are going by numbers. What are the numbers with regard to the LTTE, if this is a case of numbers? The LTTE, as a terrorist organization, has to be dealt with the manner in which they deserve to be dealt with. Civilians have to be protected and that is our responsibility as the Government of Sri Lanka. That is why we are getting more and more engaged. What did the civilians have to say to the British Members of Parliament whose names I just quoted, the five of them? The list is here. They said that the LTTE was preventing them from coming and were shooting at them when they attempted to come and that is the

behaviour of the LTTE - shooting their own people; our people; the Sri Lankans - the Tamil community. This is the treatment that the LTTE was giving them. Now, the international community has come here to witness this. That is why I am happy that my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella asked whether we are ready to deal with the international community. The answer is, Yes. We are dealing with them in an integrated manner, in a wider manner, in a more penetrating manner and that is why you will see more visitors coming at my invitation to Sri Lanka, such as ministers of foreign affairs, with whom we could engage in discussions and who in turn will go back and speak in their countries to the Tamil diaspora and to the Sri Lankan community and thereby will educate the people on what is right, what is wrong and what is happening in Sri Lanka. In fact, having visited the IDP camps in Vavuniya, one of the members said that he should be at the Trafalgar Square. Why should he be at the Trafalgar Square? That is to tell back to the LTTE demonstrators that this is the true situation in Sri Lanka. I must compliment the Hon. Member who stated that to me yesterday and I am sure that he will demonstrate his commitment by us. When the Minister of International Cooperation, Mrs. B. J. Oda came from Canada at my invitation, what did she find? She found a very extensive arrangement being made to take care of the IDPs in Sri Lanka. Where else have you seen this type of a sudden IDP development taking place being addressed by any authority or any government? Nowhere in the world! These visitors who come to Sri Lanka have seen other locations in the world. That is why I am quite happy and confident that we will address this issue well. As much as my learned Friend, the Hon. N. Sri Kantha has said, let us engage in a dialogue to see where the political process would take us in the future. Let us get the LTTE out of our way. Let it have its death as a terrorist organization. Let the people live in Sri Lanka as a country where all of us can be part of it and I must compliment the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa for giving me the opportunity to bring this up.

* : : Media release tabled.:

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS , 1, . . My No. Your No. Date MEDIA RELEASE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS TERROR ATTACK ON SRI LANKA MISSION IN OSLO The Government of Sri Lanka vehemently condemns the violent attack by operatives belonging to the international terror network of the LTTE on the Sri Lanka Embassy in Oslo on Sunday, 12 April 2009. On the advice of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Rohitha Bogollagama, the Royal Norwegian Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Tore Hattrem was summoned to the Foreign Ministry today (13th April 2009), and an official protest lodged. The following matters were brought to the attention of the Ambassador in connection with the attack on the Sri Lankan mission in the Norwegian capital yesterday. * The Sri Lanka Government strongly condemns the premeditated attack on the Sri Lanka Embassy in Oslo on Sunday, 12th April 2009 by operatives of the international terror network of the LTTE. * In the recent past, there have been a number of demonstrations organized by the LTTEs international network across the globe. On this particular day (12th April) too, a demonstration was held with the permission of the Norwegian Government. The said attack was subsequent to this demonstration. * The Norwegian Government, being fully cognizant of the modus operandi of the LTTE and in constant contact with its international network as well as its leadership in the North of Sri Lanka, ought to have ensured the provision of adequate security to the diplomatic premises and agents of the Sri Lanka Government as obligated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18th April 1961. Article 22(2) of the Convention casts a special duty on the receiving State to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity. * Furthermore, requests for adequate security for the Mission had been made repeatedly by the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Norway, who had been informed by the authorities that since the Norwegian Security Service was maintaining a constant surveillance of the Mission, they did not perceive the necessary to place a static guard to provide security cover. * In this context, the Government of Sri Lanka deplores the failure of the Norwegian Government in fulfilling its obligations under international law, consequent to its sheer neglect in the provision of adequate security to the Sri Lanka Mission in Oslo. * Quite in contrast, the Government of Sri Lanka has been continuously providing security to Norways diplomatic representation in Sri Lanka at all times, notwithstanding the constraints of manpower and other resources on the Police and security agencies.

* It was fortunate that none of the staff of the Sri Lanka Embassy came to harm due to their absence from the diplomatic premises, when this vicious and violent attack on the Mission took place. * It is deplorable that this act of terror took place within hours of the presidential directive to the armed forces to restrict their operations to those of a defensive nature, in order to give the civilian population entrapped as hostages by the LTTE, the opportunity to celebrate the Sinhala & Tamil New Year in a suitable atmosphere and have uninhibited freedom of movement from the No Fire Zone to the cleared areas. * This outrageous act of terror committed by the LTTE in Oslo, the capital of Norway which they feel is a location due the moral backing available locally, should demonstrate to the Norwegian Government, the true character of the LTTE. * Further, is displays that repeated concessions made by the Sri Lanka Government have been treated only with contempt by the LTTE. * In these circumstances, the Government of Sri Lanka perceives that it is no longer feasible for Norway to act as facilitator in its engagement with Sri Lanka in the current context. * The Government of Sri Lanka strongly urges the Norwegian Government to apprehend the perpetrators of the attack on its Embassy in Oslo and bring them to justice immediately. In addition, the Government of Sri Lanka also expects the Norwegian authorities to act swiftly to provide adequate security for the Sri Lanka Mission, as well as all for the staff of the Mission, in keeping with Norways international obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and also ensure that there is no recurrence of such incidents in the future. The violent conduct of LTTE elements conducting various demonstrations elsewhere abroad, amounting to glorification of terrorism, should at least now convince the international community of the absolute intransigence of the LTTE and its callous disregard for international law and civilized norms of behavior. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Colombo. 13th April ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . , . . Question put, and agreed to.
