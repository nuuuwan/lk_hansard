SPEAKER'S CERTIFICATE ( ) (Mr. Speaker) 79 2009 17 . ( ) REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES . . . ( )

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne - Minister of Power and Energy) Hon. Speaker, as the Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises, I am pleased to present the First Report of the Committee on Public Enterprises for the Fourth Session of the Sixth Parliament. The Report is based on the findings of 20 examinations conducted during the six month period from July to December 2008. The list of enterprises and the relevant dates of examinations are given at the beginning of the Report. The Report gives emphasis on several serious problems and weaknesses found in many of the public

enterprises. With regard to such anomalies, recommendations have been made here. There are 10 such major weaknesses observed during the six-month period about which ten specific recommendations are listed in the main section of the Report. The section based on the proceedings at COPE in relation to specific public enterprises are given as Schedule I under the titles Major Issues and Problems Discussed and Comments by the COPE and Decisions. In addition, the minutes of each COPE Meeting are also given in detail at the end to the Report, as Annex I. While specific public enterprises are made to rectify their weaknesses, it is essential that all public enterprises are instructed to follow a set of general guidelines which will result in benefits to the entire public sector. It may be mentioned here that some of the principles behind the recommendations are not entirely new to the public sector. But, it has to be emphasized that due to lack of discipline and weaknesses in managements, major problems had arisen in the public enterprises. By implementing a set of recommendations in the form of guidelines, it is expected that major improvements in the administration and effective management of the entire public sector can be achieved in addition to the contributions to the economy as a whole. At the meeting held on the Development Lotteries Board, is was decided that the Hon. Speaker should be informed of the need to convey to the Bribery Commission, the allegations on the payment of an advance of Rs. 24 million for the purchase of motor vehicles. As regards the Sri Lanka Press Council, the Committee decided that the Hon. Speaker should be informed of the decision to reactivate the Council by conveying the decision to His Excellency the President and also to the Hon. Minister of Mass Media and Information. In conclusion, I would like to place on record my gratitude to all Members of the Committee whose excellent cooperation and participation helped in finalizing the tasks before the Committee. In addition, I also wish to thank the Auditor-General and his staff, the Treasury representatives and the staff of the COPE secretariat. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) With reference to the Report on the Committee on Public Enterprises that has just been presented, I would like to state that I appreciate the actions that have been taken. But, there are certain matters which are of a more pertinent nature that have not been referred to in this Report. As a matter of fact, even when we ensure that these matters are taken up, I am sorry to state that the level of the Committee on Public Enterprises has degraded to such

1253 1254

a political level that it has basically made the very entity that has got to look into this, a mere joke. One specific institution is the Sri Lanka Press Council. This was something which was there when the matter was taken up. But, Hon. Minister, as the Chairman, you had stated at the Committee on Public Enterprises that this was a decision of the Government. That was what was communicated to the Committee. But, the statement that was made in this House by a non-Cabinet Minister was as if there was a genuine decision taken by the Committee on Public Enterprises. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) The matter of reactivating the Press Council was taken up after a prolonged discussion at the Committee. In fact, when the matter was taken up, Members of both sides - that is, the Government and the Opposition - were present and ultimately there was a unanimous decision taken to request that the Press Council be reactivated. I do not know whether the Hon. Member himself was present. But, this was a decision that was taken after a long descussion. Nobody can go behind it. It may be that you were not present but I cannot help it because this was a decision taken by the whole Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Being present or not is a different matter. But, the verbatim reports basically state what goes on. I, as a Member of the Committee on Public Enterprises for the last 14 years, do know what goes on in that Committee. But, the reference made by you was that this was a Government decision. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

No. no.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

That is what is stated in the verbatim reports. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

It is not the Government. The Government has nothing do with this decision. I emphasize that that is not a Government decision. It was a decision taken by the COPE and when the matter was discussed. Members of both sides were present. In fact, they had the opportunity to express their views. Ultimately, a decision was taken to request the Hon. Speaker to inform His Excellency the President to reactivate the Press Council.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you know that this is only a Committee of Parliament. So, if any action needs to be taken, it has to come back to Parliament. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

Yes, that is right. Now, this is coming to Parliament by way of a report. In this report we have incorporated that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On page two of the verbatim report, it is very celar that this is a decision of the Government. If that is the case, it does not matter. It can be communicated. But, do not say it was a decision of the Committee on public Enterprises. There was only one Opposition Member out of five. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

I do not agree with you. Hon. Member, now this report does not constitute of the proposals made by the Government. These are not Government proposals. These are proposals made by the COPE, which consists of Members from all parties in Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No, it is not the case. We totally object. There were only five Members and this was not an issue that was to be discussed that day. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

This is not a Government Committee. This is a Committee which consist of all the political parties in Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Do not made these entities a laughing stock. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

You can go through the minutes and find out as to who and who were present on the date of this meeting and who participated in the discussion. All that can be found out by going through the minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, I am stating this on facts. There were five Members. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

There is no point in arguing about this. These were incorporated. And, this is a matter that was discussed in the Committee. As I said earlier, you can refer to the minutes. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) The Attorney-Generals opinion is that there are certain institutions which cannot be summoned.

1257 1258

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . Those opinions are not related. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) They cannot be summoned because they do not come directly under the Government. In fact, I myself wanted to summon them. Then, they came out with the opinion of the Attorney - General that had been given in writing. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, but that has no relevance. This is Parliament. They do not need to tell the supreme body what we have got to do. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) There is no problem about it. You and I both want to have them summoned. So, let us look into the possibility of summoning them. If there are any obstacles. Let us remove them. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, with all due respect to you as the Chairman upholding the sanctity of the Committee on Public Enterprises, would appreciate that there is no Standing Order that precludes you from doing anything that is not against the Standing Orders. So, there is no need for an opinion from the Attorny - General. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) That is your view. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, that is the view of Parliament. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) When the Attorney-General expresses an opinion, the tradition is to respect that opinion and if we are not prepared to accept that opinion, let us sit together and take a decision. That is a different matter. But, anyhow, the only way of overcoming this is to get the Hon. Speaker to look into this and see that these Standing Orders are amended in order to facilitate this. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why do you need to dilute the Members of Parliament-

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) Why are you contesting that ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am not contesting. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) I think it does not take long. Let that Hon. Speaker decide on it. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I do not want to ask you to transfer subjects to the Attorney-General. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

Let the Hon. Speaker decide on it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Speaker, I leave it to you. We, as the Members of the House, have not brought any preclusion or trying to bring any entity into the Committee on Public Enterprises. So, why do we get the Attorney-General to give us any opinion?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . , . . . . . . ( )

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala - Minister of Higher Education)

Mr. Speaker, if you would allow me to intervene, it is true, as the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake says, that Parliament is supreme. But, the fact remains that the activities of both, the Committee on Public Accounts and the Committee on Public enterprises, are governed by the Standing Orders, which have been approved by Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . ? . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (An hon. Member) . . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. Standing Order No. 126(4) states. I quote : The Committee may when it considers necessary appoint sub-committees of its own members to examine and report to the Committee on all accounts, the budgets and annual estimates, the finances and management of such public corporations or of any business or other undertaking vested under any written law in the Government as the Committee may direct. So, it is very clear. We do not need the Attorney-General to tell us what we should do. Under the Constitution, Parliament is supreme as public finance is controlled through Parliament. From that, the Standing Orders derive powers so that every institution or any institution can be brought before the Committee. When it comes to the supreme body, we do not need anybody from outside to direct these things. So, Hon. Minister, as the Chairman of the COPE, immediately call for a meeting. We must have a meeting with the Attorney-General and the secretary-General and then we can focus on something constructive. Yesterday, we mentioned about Mihin Air in Parliament. For the year 2006 . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) It would take us a longer time because there is a precedent. In fact, I am guided by that precedent. During the time of the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, when he was the Chairman of the Cope, this matter came up. When he summoned Air Lanka, it came with the opinion of the Attorney-General. In fact, they came and participated and thereafter, the COPE decided that it has no right to question them or to investigate them. That is the precedent we have and I am bound by that. ( ) (The Hon.

() ? () , ? : () ? () , , ? () ?

(c) Will he state the measures adopted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to build better diplomatic relations with the Netherlands again? (d) If not, why? ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Hon. Minister of foreign Affairs, I would like to answer Question No. 6. (a) Yes, Sut, in May 2005 phasing out of the Bilateral Development Cooperation Assistance for Sri Lanka had been approved by the Dutch Government, with Sri Lanka having reached the Low Middle Income Country status. That is, LMIC. Phasing out of the ongoing projects which was envisaged to end in 2010 will now be completed in 2009 it has been brought forward because the projects are being completed.

The Dutch Government has now decided on a new decentralized policy for the year 2009 for disbursement of funds for international cultural programmes which will be at the discretion of the Dutch ambassador in Colombo and other agencies in Netherlands, in decide on future projects.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Is the answer to Question No. 6 (a), Yes

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila) Yes, but with these qualifications.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . -

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila) No. That is Question No. 6 (b). Do not mix it up. Hon Member. Let me come to Question No. 6 (b). ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I am Sorry. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . , . , . ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila) The answer to Question No. 6 (b) is an emphatic, No. (c) We have strong diplomatic relations with the Netherlands and the question of building better relations, does not arise. However, Sri Lanka is continuing to engage the political leadership of the Netherlands to sensitize them to the ground realities in Sri Lanka, in the context of reconstruction, resettlement, rehabilitation and reconciliation in the post-conflict areas. We have also maintained a continuous dialogue with the Dutch Embassy in Colombo. Sri Lankas foreign policy is conducted in compliance with the national interest of Sri Lanka. It has been impressed upon all our interlocutors that the national priorities of Sri Lanka would be addressed according to a homegrown agenda as determined by the Government and the people of Sri Lanka. Close political interaction has been maintained with Dutch officials, Members of Parliament, representations of the academia and civil society. Sri Lanka, while promoting political relations with the Government of the Netherlands is also engaged in enhancing economic and cultural ties between the two countries. (d) Does not arise.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, Hon. Minister. I agree. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) So, according to those procedures only, these licences have been issued. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, that is related to government - owned broadcasing stations. When it comes to broadcasing stations owned by those outside the Government, then it has to be done on a tender basis. That is why I am asking by my Question whether in doing so, the Acts of 1982 and 1966 have been complied with in full. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, no. What you have asked is, . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) And about the procedures adopted.

No. If you flagrantly violates something only - ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, there is no absolute licence given. That is my understanding. Once you issue a licence, it is for a

1289 1290

particular period of time. Thereafter, that licence has to be renewed. There is also a licence fee. Suppose they fail to pay the licence fee, then the licence ceases to exist. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That means, they have to be at the beck and call of the Government. After investing if the Government says, We are sorry. We are not going to give it. ( ) (The Hon.

[. . 11.22] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Nahmaduhu wa nusalli ala Rasoolihil Kareem

Hon. Speaker, it is an honour to place on record the services of the late Hon. M.L.M. Aboosally, a gentleman politician who served his constituency and his country without any bias for a period spanning over 50 years.

The Hon. Aboosally was born in Nawalapitiya in his mothers home and was brought up in Balangoda, the home of his father, where he served his entire life. He was an example politician who served with honour and honesty. The Hon. Aboosally was educated at Zahira College, Colombo, where he played rugby and was a keen student. He entered the University of Ceylon to study medicine and also represented the University in rugby. But, he later withdrew, due to his fathers illness, in order to take over the management of his fathers estates and other land holdings in Balangoda. The Hon. Aboosallys family lived in Balangoda from the time the area was settled by the Kandyan chieftains and his family was the descendents of the famous Muslim physicians of the Kandyan Kingdom of the Hatara Korale. The Hon. Aboosallys grandfather, Sinna Lebbe Cassim Lebbe, was a famous physician, who was also known as Kottasa Mahatmaya. His father was C.L.M. Marikar Hajiyar J.P., a land owner and his uncle was C.L.M. Jamaldeen who became the town headman of Balangoda under Barnes Ratwatte Dissawa.

Throughout his long career, his reputation was unblemished. He was known to be an honest, honourable and a peace-loving man. In addition to his long life of public service, he was an ardent supporter of sports - playing cricket and rugby from his school days - and he also managed football teams from Sri Lanka to Indonesia at that time. Known throughout his life as a social worker and a politician, the Hon. Aboosally began his career in public life through the co-operative movement serving as the President of the Balangoda Co-operative Union and the Co-operative Bank of Ratnapura as well as serving as the Vice-President of the Co-operative Federation of Ceylon.

Some of the Members of the Government Benches spoke very highly of the Hon. M.L.M. Aboosally, a person who served irrespective of caste, creed and religion. The Hon. Aboosally being a Muslim Member of Parliament from Balangoda from 1977 to 1994, who represented a 96 per cent Sinhala electorate on behalf of the United National Party, was one of the longest serving Members of the UNP from the Balangoda seat of the Ratnapura District.

He began his career in politics when he was elected as the Chairman of Balangoda Urban Council and was an independent candidate. He was a member of the United National Party for over 50 years. Subsequently, he served as the District Minister for Ratnapura from 1977 to 1982; Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development from 1982 to 1988; State Minister of Plantation Services from 1990 to 1993 and the Cabinet Minister of Labour and Vocational Training from 1993 to 1994.

1361 1362

The Hon. Aboosally oversaw the heritage properties of the Jailani Mosque situated in the Balangoda District with an ancient Islamic shrine where the pioneer Muslims in Sri Lanka from all walks of life flock together for an annual feast. He served not only the Muslims but also the Buddhists, the Christians and the Tamils in equality. He was a person with great eminence who served the community in the area with grace. Hon. Speaker, I would like to place on record that the Hon. Aboosally was a skilful orator who graced this august Assembly and was a star among the Muslim community in Sri Lanka at that time. I had very close associations with the Hon. Aboosally and his family. As a young politician, I found him very rich in advice and we exchanged views and ideas at his home. He, being a pioneer trustee of the Jailani Mosque, we discussed many matters connected with the Islamic sector. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is very appreciative of his ideas. Though he was a very loyal member of the UNP, he continued to support the ideals of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. My great Leader, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, was one of the ardent admirers of the Hon. Aboosally and I would like to pay tribute to this great person who has taught us so much. We still think of him today and would do so in the years to come. May the Almighty Allah grant the Hon. Aboosally Jennathul Firdouse. He provided his loyal services to every human being in the district of Ratnapura and to all Muslims. He was a humanist, a social worker and a great father to his children. I know his daughters look up to their father as a role model. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress would like to convey the condolences to his bereaved family and to everyone connected with the Hon. Aboosally. Thank you very much.

[. . 11.30] ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak a few words about the late Hon. M.L.M. Aboosally, who I believe, was the first Muslim Member of Parliament representing the Sabaragamuwa Province. He, though being a Muslim Member, broke across ethnic barriers to represent all communities in the Ratnapura District where there was a very small population of Muslims. But, he was elected to Parliament time and again because he won the confidence of the general public as a person who could serve his province and his district.

In fact, he was one of the fine leaders of the 1977 period under His Excellency, the late President J.R. Jayewardene. I think the Hon. Speaker also was a Member of Parliament at that time. Under that leadership, he was able to serve the nation and his area in a way that cannot be surpassed easily in the future.

Speaking about the Hon. Aboosally, I considered him as a mentor. When I entered active politics in 1994, he was one of the people who encouraged me and helped me to contest under the United National Party. In fact, he was a strong member of the All Ceylon Muslim League where I cut my teeth as a young person in getting involved in politics. He was a close associate of my father and I remember the late night debates and discussions he used to have with my father regarding the UNP and about the country in the early days. I think that by my close association with him, he was one of the people who inspired me in my political life. I remember him as a person who was honest, who was friendly, who was loyal to the party, who was hardworking and who was committed for his people . In fact, his demise has been a great loss for the Muslim community, for the Ratnapura District, for the Sabaragamuwa province and for the nation as a whole.

I take this opportunity to condole with his family, with his loving wife and his children and his extended family and to say that the Hon. Aboosally will be remembered not only in this House, but in the country as a person who inspired other people in politics. Thank you, Sir.

I am very happy to speak on this important Supplementary Estimate today. First, I want to congratulate the Hon. Minister for the excellent work that is being done by his Ministry in providing electricity to the poor villagers in our country. We are well aware of the difficult task that you are entrusted with. You have been very successful in encountering the various hurdles and protests, especially the udgoshana and all that, where our good Friends were giving a lot of trouble. Your ability to tackle all those problems and achieve your target, especially the Kotmale and the Norachcholai Projects shows that you are a strong Minister. I want to make special mention about the Bill that you were able to pass in Parliament recently. I know that efforts were made earlier to get that Bill passed but finally you were very successful. Finally, I want to express my appreciation for providing electricity to the farming community in my electorate. Hon. Minister I have to recall an incident at the Parliamentary Advisory Committee last year. When the financial year was almost coming to an end, I made a plea and you were very kind enough to provide sufficient funds and I was able to provide electricity to a number of farmers. They are poor farmers living in sandy areas in Batticaloa. You are not a stranger to my area. You have

1409 1410

a lot of friends in my constituency and we expect much from you. We are extremely thankful to you. Now the cost for pumping water has gone down very much. Farmers are quite happy. Earlier they were spending about Rs. 2,000 or Rs. 3,000 to purchase kerosene oil. Now, the cost for pumping has come down to about Rs. 500 or Rs. 600. They are making a good profit. They are producing vegetables, fruits and everything. They are quite happy. We have a lot of poor farmers in our area and I hope you will try to help us. I do not want to take much of your time. Once again I take this opportunity to wish you all success in your new endeavours. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, you have 10 minutes. [. . 2.28] ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . SITUATION IN IDP CAMPS IN VAVUNIYA . . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah)

, with a heavy heart I move the Adjournment Motion on the situation of IDP camps in Vavuniya. I move, The conditions in the IDP camps in Vavuniya where the Tamil civilian population who got displaced due to the war and are now being forcibly detained have been steadily deteriorating. With the advent of the current rains, the conditions in the camps have reached unbearable limits. Extensive flooding, grossly unhygienic conditions, spread of diseases in addition to the total lack of basic living conditions, tells of the pathetic situation faced by the 300,000 inmates of these camps. With the advent of the monsoons next month, the situation will get much worse. If the Tamil IDPs are continued to be further detained in these camps, large numbers are likely to die due to the spread of epidemics et cetera. Under these circumstances, this House moves this Motion to resolve that the 300,000 Tamil IDPs be immediately permitted to leave these camps and resettle in their own homes where they have lived for generations and centuries. , . ; . ! . , 70,000 . . . . , 16-18 , 3,15,000 . ;

. . . . . , . ? ; .. . - - . . . .. . . , The Joint Statement by the UN Secretary-General and the Government of Sri Lanka dated 26th May, 2009 states, I quote : President Rajapaksa and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon discussed a series of areas in which the United Nations will assist the ongoing efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka in addressing the future challenges and opportunities. The next para, it states, I quote : With regard to IDPs, the United Nations will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the IDPs now in Vavuniya and Jaffna. The Government will continue to provide access to humanitarian agencies. The Government will expedite the necessary basic and civil infrastructure as well as means of livelihood necessary for the IDPs to resume their normal lives at the earliest. The Secretary-General welcomed the announcement by the Government expressing its intention to dismantle the welfare villages at the earliest, as outlined in the Plan to resettle the bulk of IDPs and call for its early implementation".

. There is a commitment on the part of the Government and the President to resettle the people at the earliest possible. , ?

Hon. Minister, we are told that people there are dying - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You wait and listen to me. According to the sphere guidelines for proving IDP care for South-East Asia, it should be 0.25 per 10,000 population per day. The red tape is 0.5 per 10,000 per day. There are international norms. The monitoring of the deaths and the cause of deaths were done by the Ministry of Health and Nutrition over the last few weeks and it shows a clear decline in the number of deaths that occur per day. There is a graph on the Daily Crude Mortality Rate per day, from June to August. It shows a very clear decline according to this graph. It was about six per day. Now, it has reduced to less than two per day.

2009 19 1439 1440

So, this is compatible with international standards. Therefore, compared to international standards, our IDP camps are being managed well. So, you cannot sling mud by giving false figures and tell the international community, Come and make things difficult for the Government, because these things are not being monitored only by my Ministry. The UNICEF, UNFPA and all the international organizations including WHO are monitoring each and every death that occurs in the IDP camps. Therefore, you cannot mislead them. So, I must be very firm on that. That is entirely wrong. Do not paint a wrong picture. . ( . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah)

Hon. Minister - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You can reply; wait. With regard to the healthcare provided to the IDPs, currently there are around 70 to 80 doctors working in the IDP welfare villages. When they were under the clutches of the LTTE, there were only 20 doctors to serve all these 300,000 population. Now, there are more than 80 doctors. There are around five to six consultants practising in IDP welfare villages. There are also around 30 nurses and 48 PHMs working. In addition to those, 8 MLTs and 9 dispensers are also working. The doctor-population ratio is 1 : 3,500 which is a very fair ratio. The semi permanent hospitals : there are six referral centres - zonal hospitals - in six zones and 18 primary healthcare centres in all six major zones. Hence, there are 24 healthcare facility centres in all zones. The healthcare centre-population ratio is 1 : 9,231. The vaccination coverage : you are expecting the children to die. We will not allow that. A recently conducted vaccination programme under the supervision of the WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA was able to cover nearly 100 per cent routine vaccination coverage. Therefore, do not think the children will die and you will have a reason to go to India or to any other country and say, The children are dying. We have taken all the precautions so that the children will not die, because the vaccination coverage is more than what is being done in the South. Antenatal care : all pregnant mothers are attending antenatal clinics. All mothers are subject to ultrasound scans. Under Prabhakaran, did you have ultrasound scan facilities given to these mothers? No. This programme is conducted by the Maternity Task Force - joint programme with Family Health Bureau and College of Obstetrics. The College of Obstetrics is sending a four-member registrar team including Dr. Kanishka Karunaratne who

did the first caesarean operation in the Cheddikulam Hospital when I was there. So, we have provided quality healthcare to the IDPs. Do not forget that. Development of Cheddikulam Hospital : the bed capacity of the Hospital has increased to 200. A new theatre is ready for operations. Two VPs, two paediatricians, one surgeon, one VOG have been appointed and they are working there. What else do you want? Donor contribution : Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have intervened with the donor agencies. I made a special appeal to the WHO. Up to now, the WHO has given me Rs. 250 million and we have spent Rs. 205 million by now. The UNICEF has spent Rs. 140 million. Mercy Malaysia has spent Rs. 40 million. We were not just sleeping. In order to give quality healthcare to the people in the IDP camps, we have mobilized the foreign assistance. The German Red Cross has sent Rs. 50 million out of which we have another Rs. 40 million to be spent. The UNFPA has already spent Rs. 50 million. The International Organization for Migration has already sent Rs. 92 million. So, they are not just giving money and looking the other side. They monitor every step: how we are spending the money; whether the benefit is being reaped by the IDP people who are there. The Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies has sent Rs. 82 million. Medical Teams International has sent Rs. 12 million. AmeriCares has sent Rs. 4 million. An Italian NGO has sent Rs. 20 million. Sarvodaya has sent Rs. 40 million. The Italian Government gave a handsome contribution of Rs. 100 million. Thanks to my Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe. There has been a total of Rs. 880 million commitment and there is a sum of Rs. 404 million to be spent. In the meantime, the Government of Sri Lanka has spent more than Rs. 3 billion in order to provide healthcare to these people. Health Co-ordination Centres have been established in Menik Farm under a Director. A Cabinet Paper has been produced to take over the Cheddikulam Hospital and bring under the Health Co-ordination Centre which comes under my Ministry. There are around 11 ambulances, four mobile laboratories, two mobile dental clinics and there is one mobile clinic functioning in the Zone. So, those are work which have been done by my Ministry in order to give quality healthcare to the IDP people. So do not try to mislead the national and international arena. Then, with regard to issues in providing healthcare services, we are getting ready for the rainy season. We will ensure that the health of the people living in these IDP camps would be looked after by my Ministry and I must say that nurses are working under very difficult circumstances. I have provided them with quarters. I must thank the nurses. They are working there. The doctors are also working. I have put up quarters in the Cheddikulam Hospital itself and they are

8 PL 004337 (2009/08)

1441 1442

now permanently there. I have provided some quarters near the Menik Farm; the doctors refused to go there, but the nurses went there. What is good for nurses, the doctors think is not good for them. That is the problem with our doctors in Sri Lanka. So, what am I doing now? Now, most of the doctors are staying at Cey Bank Hotel in Anuradhapura. This can accommodate 44 doctors. There are around 44 doctors at present. The Ministry has already paid Rs. 2 million so far. The doctors are being stationed at the Cey Bank Hotel in Anuradhapura. I am paying a bill of Rs. 2 million. The Ministry is giving them accommodation, giving them free food, free transport and paying their salaries also. So, this is how our doctors are working. We must tell that also. But, of course the nurses are at the quarters near the Menik Farm. Therefore, we are doing our best. Then, with regard to communicable diseases: chicken pox, all types of diarrhoea, typhoid and hepatitis are declining rapidly. There had not been a single case of typhoid upto yesterday. This is a great achievement. So, I must say, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Government of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has done his best to look after the internally displaced people and it is our wish and we are trying hard to resettle them very soon. Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) [Interruption.] - fairly by the Opposition. What did your Leader do? He went around the world and vilified the Government by giving all wrong information. So if you behave well, probably we will allow. ( ) (The Hon.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Presiding Member, I, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, would also like to express a few sentiments on this issue of Internally Displaced People who are undergoing some difficulty in the background of the onset of the monsoon. It is understood that the

Government has pledged that these people would be resettled within a period of 180 days, which in my opinion, appears to be a very ambitious deadline. Going by the various statements made by important people in the Government, it appears to be a very flexible approach even to extend it beyond 180 days. Yesterday, I was at a lecture delivered by the Presidential Secretary, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, at the Colombo Club where he said that the resettlement process is inhibited by the difficulty posed in demining the areas of the Northern Province. He also mentioned that almost every inch of land had been mined and therefore meticulous care had to be taken before ascertaining the areas as being demined since the safety of the civilians is of paramount concern to the Government. It appears that the very statement of the Presidential Secretary that the Northern Province had been mined every inch by inch is, for all purpose, a very exaggerated statement. We understand that there are many areas which have already been demined. The Hon. Minister a while ago said that in the Musali area which had been liberated almost two years ago, the demining activity has almost come to an end. So, a large number of displaced people who had been forcibly displaced by the LTTE 20 years ago could be easily resettled. In fact, Tamil Members of Parliament too agree that there must be a simultaneous process of resettlement of Muslims who had been forcibly displaced years ago by the LTTE and those who have been displaced a few months ago due to the recent battle. Therefore, I do not see why the process of resettlement of the Musali Muslims has been inordinately delayed though the Hon. Minister mentioned that a few families have been resettled in the Musali area. Large numbers of people are willing to go back. They want permission to go and inspect the areas so that they can start the process of resettlement. But, for some strange reason their resettlement is being delayed inordinately. I understand the Hon. Minister had called the Musali Muslims and had a lengthy discussion about their resettlement. But, for reasons unknown to these people, still their resettlement process is being inordinately,- [ Interruption.]

! Therefore this is a matter that has to be very clearly clarified and seen as to why this impediment has come about in the resettlement of those people in an area which had been liberated almost two years ago and where the demining process is almost at an end. In fact, in Silavathurai, the main town in the Musali area, the Police Station, the DS office, all the civil administrative offices are already functioning but yet the poor fishermen and farmers are not allowed to go there and engage in seasonal fishing activity or farming activity. This, in my opinion, is a travesty of justice and has to be remedied as quickly as possible. I must also state that in the Menik Farm refugee camp, the onset of the monsoon has created untold difficulties and misery for those who are living there. In that regard, some speedy action has to be taken. When you take the period of tsunami and even the previous

2009 19 1451 1452

incidents where people were displaced internally due to war efforts, there was an immense outpouro of international assistance. The Hon. Minister will agree that comparatively there is not enough assistance forthcoming since the conditionalities as far as the resettlement process is concerned have now increased and it appears that there is some distrust as far as certain members of international community are concerned when they come to commit funds for the transit camps in which these refugees are now suffering. Therefore, these matters have to be clarified. I think on the diplomatic front too, there have been certain issues which have perhaps contributed to this unfortunate situation where the poor refugees have become pawns in the hands of various forces which has ultimately resulted in them being deprived of adequate funding for their sustenance. Now, within the limited time available, I must also mention that the resettlement of Muslim refugees must take place in a parallel manner and as every Hon. Member of Parliament in this House perhaps will agree, in order to instil a sense of coexistence, it is always good for all communities to be resettled together and of course, when it comes to the issue of demining, if there are certain time frames that have to be adjusted, that could be discussed with the Opposition. But, unfortunately this Government appears to be having serious mistrust as far as the Opposition Members are concerned. In fact, we have had to go to courts finally. On the next 24th, we are going before the Supreme Court in order to get permission for the Opposition Members to visit the IDP camps in the Vavuniya area. So, this could be easily settled by the President inviting the Opposition Members and then discussing the matter very openly and allowing them to go and inspect these camps. Sir, there are many other issues of corruption which I do not want to bring up here, but on another occasion with relevant facts regarding the whole issue of IDP camp in Menik Farm and as to how other interlopers and intermediaries have crept in, would be raised. The cost of goods inside the camps is thrice the cost of goods available in the Vavuniya town. This is because there has been a lot of bribery in order to get a few henchmen of the Minister and others engaged in trade activities. So, this is a matter - ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen) Hon. Member - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Then, I must refer to certain hardware stores. I do not know as to who owns Anver Hardware in Puttalam, Anver Hardware in Medawachchiya and Mega Hardware in Vavuniya. These are the hardware stores which supply items for constructing camps and they are owned by brothers and fathers-in-law of the Minister. This is a fact.

Then, there is an NGO. We say that the NGOs engaged in the demining activity are not speedily doing their job whereas the army is doing it. Fair enough! Then, there is an NGO called the OHRD. The Chairman of that is one Mr. Riyaj, the brother of the Minister, who is doing all the construction work inside the Menik Farm refugee camp. For the tents, they have charged Rs. 450,000 but it does not even cost Rs. 150,000 to build those flimsy tents. So, this is the reason why the flooding has finally resulted in total misery. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Therefore, Sir, the issue of corruption will have to be dealt with. His Excellency the President has pledged that the issue of corruption will be dealt with directly and there is a presidential investigation unit which has been set up to go into the issues of corruption. This is a matter which we will take up with facts to show that the Minister, his brother, his family and his henchmen are involved in extreme corruption inside the refugee camps. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. . . [] ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Give me one minute.

( - , ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights)

Hon. Presiding Member, today the 19th of August, 2009, marks the commemoration of the first-ever World Humanitarian Day. Last December, the United Nations General Assembly decided to commemorate this day to coincide with the death, six years ago, of the then Special Representative of the UN Secretary General to Iraq and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello. He, along with 21 of his colleagues, tragically lost their lives in the massive Canal Hotel bomb explosion in Baghdad, Iraq. Unfortunately, before that incident and since then, there have been several incidents in other parts of the world where humanitarian workers have been harmed or killed. Today, we recall their service with gratitude and collectively, as a global community, pay tribute to them. Sir, Sri Lanka has emerged into the light after more than 25 years of battling terrorism - one of the worst kinds. The decisive victory gained on the battlefield has thrown up new challenges. Chief amongst these is the provision of humanitarian supplies and services to the IDPs who were rescued from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the humanitarian operations which concluded in May, 2009. Our eventual goal is their resettlement in the areas where they originally resided. This process requires ensuring that the areas of return must be safe, free of mines and other unexploded ordnance which could cause immeasurable harm, if not cleared. These are challenges, Sir, that the Government of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken on and we are determined to overcome them. This process of resettlement, reconstruction, development and national reconciliation, should result in a society and a nation in which everyone is able to enjoy the full gamut of rights that are enshrined in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights in the Constitution. Everyone should feel equal to one another and the postulates of equality in the Constitutional document should not be confined to mere words on paper but must be made a practical reality. In ensuring this equality of status, treatment and opportunity, we must nurture and celebrate the wonderfully rich diversity that characterizes Sri Lankan society. Our countrys multicultural, multilingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious makeup must be maintained in order that everyone can play an active and productive part in the process of national reconciliation initiated by His Excellency the President. It is when this new Sri Lanka is created that we can genuinely claim that we have overcome the many challenges we are faced with. Sir, nearly a month ago on the 22nd of July, I had occasion to address this House on a similar theme during

an Adjournment Debate dealing with the situation of IDPs. On that day, I detailed the various measures that the Government was taking in cooperation with its national and international partners to care for the people in welfare centres and relief villages. I noted then that the situation was not ideal but pointed out that there had been a gradual improvement in conditions since the month of May. Todays Debate, Sir, is more focused as the Motion moved by our honourable Colleague, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, concentrates on the situation caused by the recent rains and the fears of flooding and attendant health risks. We anticipated that the impending rains could cause conditions in the camps to deteriorate and I directed the Disaster Management Centre, which comes under the purview of my Ministry, to evolve a strategy together with other operational agencies working in the Cheddikulam area to deal with the threat of inundation. To facilitate this, we used the mechanism of the National Disaster Management Coordination Committee which is the coordination structure for all government, non-government and private organizations working on disaster management related areas. The NDMCC has developed collaborative programmes between member organizations in order to harness the synergies of different organizations to manage disasters effectively and efficiently. The NDMCC is operational since November 2007 and has a membership of over 70 government, non-government and private organizations. The wealth of experience and resources available in the members of NDMCC are being used strategically, Sir, to find sustainable solutions for the humanitarian and development issues faced by the IDPs. Sir, I can report that we have made substantial progress in preventing and/or mitigating the risk of flooding in the camps in the Menik Farm area. In accordance with the decisions taken to date, the Disaster Management Centres Disaster Risk Management Programme assisted by the United Nations Development Programme will bear the costs of developing contour maps for all IDP zones while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will support initiatives related to drainage system development. The project will be implemented in two stages to minimize the delays that could occur between the planning and implementation periods. Under the first phase, the drainage systems of Zones 01, 03 and 04 will be developed. The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation has undertaken the construction of drains in Zones 01 and 03. The local Road Development Division (RDD) is working in Zone 04. Rainwater disposal system is scheduled to be completed by the 15th of September, Sir. The DMC has undertaken to develop the drainage system in Zone 02, in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) based on the contour maps developed by the Survey Department. At present this initiative is ongoing to construct the system in Zone 02. I have received reports to the effect that over 50 per cent of the work has been completed.

2009 19 1463 1464

Under the second phase of the project, the drainage systems of Zones 05, 06A, 06B, Dharmapuram, Veerapuram and Sunethipuram will be developed. The different phases of the projects were designed considering the potential severity of the drainage issue and the size of the population living in the respective zones. The zones with large populations and potentially severe drainage issues were included in the first phase of the project. Based on the reports I have received, we have every confidence that a much improved rainwater disposal system will be available by the 15th of September. As of last evening, I have received reports from the DMC to the effect that there is no stagnation of rainwater inside the camps. In fact, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa who had toured these areas in the morning with the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, confirmed that this is the case. I repeat that there is no large-scale flooding and as I have said earlier; construction work is ongoing to improve the conditions - [Interruption.] If you do not mind, we will talk later. I have only limited time. Anticipating problems connected with sewerage disposal which could be encountered during the rainy season, we have taken steps to address this issue as well. We took measures to prevent the risk of collapsing walls of septic tanks due to horizontal forces after heavy rain. This could result in adverse environmental impacts. The DMC coordinated the visit of consultants to these sites and several remedial actions were made. The DMC also coordinated with the Central Environmental Authority to introduce a suitable waste management plan that can be executed during the forthcoming rainy season. A team of CEA officials were accompanied by officers from the DMC and the UNDP and visited IDP settlements in Vavuniya from the 12th to the 14th of August, 2009. Steps have also been taken to initiate a hospital waste disposal system for the Menik Farm area and we expect that a project proposal will be submitted by CEA in the near future. Moving on to the health issues, Sir, I am informed by the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition that the moderate rain that occurred last week has not resulted in any major health or health related issues. The Hon. Minister confirmed this today. None of the health centres were affected and all centres are functioning at normal capacity. Health personnel are supplied with adequate protective clothing and are actively working. The communicable disease situation is monitored closely and so far, there is no reported increase of any communicable disease. Sir, the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition took proactive steps to establish a specialized unit to monitor and coordinate health supplies and service delivery sometime ago. They report that measures are underway to strengthen the roofing of the existing health facilities and ensure provision of appropriate and adequate drug-

storing facilities. With regard to disease control, the existing communicable disease surveillance system is geared to monitor the communicable disease situation closely in order to prevent epidemics. Vector surveillance activities will be commenced immediately by entomological teams and there will be a further strengthening of the fly control measures and develop a mechanism to improve supervision of garbage disposal and removal. The Ministry has also made recommendations in respect of preparation for the anticipated rains which include identification of alternative accommodation for people in flood-prone areas, especially for the elderly and disabled, to keep a stock of extra tents ready and the need for cementing the floors of the existing shelters. In order to maintain quality standards in water and sanitation, it is necessary to strengthen the existing system which supervise water and sanitation with the support of the Public Health Inspectors, increase the number of permanent and temporary latrines - [Interruption.] I do not have time. I am sorry. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Ratnayake) , - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) . ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Ratnayake) , 180 . , , drainage system 15 . ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) , .

Sir, in order to maintain quality standards in water and sanitation, it is necessary to strengthen the existing system which supervises water and sanitation with the support of the PHIs, increase the number of permanent and temporary latrines in every zone, to augment the water purification system by distributing chlorine tablets to households and to water storage facilities, to strengthen laboratory facilities at Vavuniya for testing of water quality and to carry out super chlorination during floods. Sir, I am going into this in much detail to demonstrate very clearly to the Hon. Members that the Government is taking its responsibility to care for these displaced Sri Lankans very seriously. We are looking into every small issue and are taking measures in advance to address problems before they can arise.

Sir, other activities to assist and support the IDPs are proceeding at a rapid pace. We have completed registration of 144,000 persons. Sir, 100,000 identity cards have been issued to the Police for distribution and 75,000 cards have reached the intended recipients. I am also happy to inform this House that we have managed to ensure the construction of 112 child-friendly spaces in the camps. These are specially necessary to enable children to have some space to relax and interact. We have also taken steps to create service protection centres on the basis of one for every 5,000 IDPs to enable them to access the range of services that are made available by the Government. We have taken steps to release approximately 9,000 persons including the elderly, pregnant women and lactating mothers and children. We have also been able to resettle 4,500 persons from camps in Vavuniya, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Kantale and Batticaloa. Sir, these processes are ongoing. Sir, we are not only looking at the short-term provision of care and assistance, but in support of the Wadakkin Wasantham initiative of His Excellency the President, my Ministry has, after wide consultation, just completed a national framework proposal on the reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life. This proposal takes a holistic view of reintegration which includes not only disarmament and demobilization followed by rehabilitation but also transitional justice, reinsertion and socio-economic integration. This process will enable those who took part in the conflict to rebuild their lives and become productive members of society. We are in the process of formulating an action plan in keeping with the national framework in close consultation and coordination with the various Government focal points. Sir, we stand ready to assist the various Government agencies with mobilization of donor funding to assist in implementation if such a requirement arises. We have also put in place a strategy of confidence-building and stabilization measures which will sustain and help the resettlement process now being carried out under the aegis of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Chairman of the Presidential Task Force for Resettlement, Development and Security in the Northern Province, with the support of my Colleague, the Hon. Minister Risad Badhiutheen. Sir, in the medium term, my Ministry is drafting a National Action Plan for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights that will also include a thematic component on IDPs rights among other critically important areas. As I said earlier, all our efforts must fit in under the larger umbrella of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksas inclusive national reconciliation process which involves all political parties. Our efforts must all buttress and contribute to that overall national exercise which is of critical importance to the future of our Sri Lankan nation. In conclusion, Sir, I must reassure you, and through you the Hon. Members of this House the people of this country that with regard to the IDPs in Vavuniya and
