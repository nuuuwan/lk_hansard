[. . 11.19] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) How much time do I have? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have 17 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

I thought it was much more. . . . Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I may refer back to something not quite relevant to this Debate, in 1949 an English Novelist by the name of George Orwell wrote or published "Nineteen Eighty-Four" what was destined to become one of the most celebrated dystopian novels of the 20th Century. This story, Mr. Deputy Speaker, was set in future England and the author himself stated, "It was intended as a show-up of the perversions which have already been partly realized in communism and fascism. And, of course he took the experiences of Nazis of Germany and Stalinists in Russia into consideration and he also described his novel as a warning to the British

2691 2692

[ ]

public that totalitarianism if not fought against could triumph anywhere. Actually, had George Orwell been alive today he would have been extremely pleased, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that most of the world has moved away from the fascist communist forms of Government to firmly entrenched forms of democratic governance. However, I am sure he would have been shocked to see that the little Island Paradise called Ceylon which was how it was known then, which gained Independence from the British Empire one year before George Orwell published his novel in 1948, has now become the setting of a true to life Orwellian nightmare. In fact, in the novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four" the dictator was called the "Big Brother and in that novel, pictures and cutouts of the "Big Brother" were everywhere and now today in Sri Lanka, in real life we have our own indigenous version of the "Big Brother" in our . As the "London Guardian" of 14th September, states, Colombo streets are littered with so many pictures of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brothers that the incipient personality cult would shame a Chinese communist. Actually the giant cutouts displayed in every nook and corner of this country, I am sure, would have even ashamed Hitler and Stalin and to be fair on the modern Chinese leaders, they have moved away from this kind of cheap display of their hubris. However, I am now coming to the subject which is distinctly Orwellian; what is happening in Sri Lanka today is the concept of newspeak which George Orwell introduced in his novel. The newspeak of the Rajapaksa regime - newspeak, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is a way, a manner in which for propaganda purposes you twist language to mean or to say the opposite of what it really means. For example, in the novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four", the Ministry of Peace actually deals with war. And, in that novel the Ministry of Love actually deals with torturing people. Likewise, we saw the same thing happening recently when the peace secretariat of Sri Lanka in the last few years suddenly became actually the war secretariat of Sri Lanka because that became the main institution apologizing for all the atrocities which happened in this country in the name of defeating terrorism. Now, I would like move on to the Hon. Ministers subject. Today, we are talking about welfare camps. That is a totally Orwellian, sinister and cynical way of naming these camps, which are actually prisons for nearly 300,000 people. As you know, that is why the international community is calling these welfare camps, internment camps. In actual fact, they are open prisons with barbed wire. You are calling these people IDPs, Internally Displaced Persons, but I suggest that they ought to be called FDDPs. In actual fact, they are "Forcibly Displaced and Detained Persons". Nearly 300,000 people were uprooted and displaced from the conflict zone. Four

months after the Government officially announced the defeat of the LTTE in May, over 280,000 people, we believe, are still held in closed camps in one of the most serious human rights crises in the 21st Century Asia. The only crime, Hon. Minister, these unfortunate people have committed is to have been born in an area which was under LTTE control for nearly two decades. Previously, these very same people suffered untold hardships and humiliations under the brutal and tyrannical rule of the LTTE. Their children were abducted; they were subject to all forms of decrees by the fascistic LTTE. Now, the LTTE has been defeated, - well done! - but unfortunately, the very Government which promised them liberation is actually putting them into even more tyrannical forms of hardships and humiliations. In fact, they are facing the proverbial situation of falling from the frying pan into the fire and these people have been denied their most basic of human rights: the freedom of movement, the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly, the freedom of livelihood and the freedom to get their grievances redressed. According to certain reports that we have, 30 to 40 persons are abducted or disappear on a daily basis. Like in the conflict which preceded this crisis, the war without witnesses, the local and international organizations, the local and international media and other NGOs are not allowed into these areas, into these camps. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Member, are you generalizing the figures? ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

No, I am not generalizing the figures. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I only refer to the figures you mentioned, that 30 to 40 are abducted daily. We would like to challenge it because I do not think it is - ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Okay. In that case, Hon. Minister, by all means prove that it is not so by opening these camps to the world. Let us go there. To begin with, even the Hon. Members of Parliament are being barred from going into these camps. If you have nothing to hide - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) They are two different matters. I do not want to disturb you. But -

2009 22 2693 2694

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) You are most welcome because I know you. You are sincere. But, I have here with me various articles which claim - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Articles can be written. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) There are all sorts of claims and counter-claims, but that is the very reason why you must be more transparent and you must open these camps for public inspection. You must have an all party Parliamentary Select Committee which is allowed to go there and look into the veracity of what is going on. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That is a proposal you are putting forward. - [Interruption.] But, these IDPs cannot be taken to the villages until we de-mine those places. You accept that de-mining is a priority. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) These are all very sad excuses. I will come to that, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Otherwise, how can you take them to their places?

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am coming to that. I was about to say that even we, as Members of Parliament, are not allowed. Because of the limited time, I am not going to talk about the conditions within the camps. But, I am going to deal with the issue which was raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. Now the Government likes to give various excuses like a mantram for not allowing these people the freedom of movement. But, first of all, I must tell the country and the world that the people who are being held in these camps are not refugees, economic or otherwise. The majority of the detainees who are there have their own homes to go back to or kith and kin in different parts of the country, who are willing to put them

up. As we know, there are teachers, government servants, farmers, landowners, people who had been doing respectable jobs in those areas and they are not without money. Actually, they do not need this supplementary benefit of yours if they are allowed to go home. I am quoting from a news report in your own "daily noise", the Daily News of 15th August, 2009, which reported the Deputy General Manager, Bank of Ceylon, Mr. I.D. Weerawansa, I do not know whether he is a relative of the other Weerawansa, as saying that Rs. 500 million had been deposited by the IDPs over the last four to five months and ATM facilities had been provided in the camps with 21,000 new account holders. So, this clearly shows that they are not economic refugees, they are not beggars, they are not people without any place to go to and they are not even like the tsunami victims of 2004 in our areas and in the East because, as you know, their livelihood, their homes and their means of existence were all washed away then. That is what I am saying and - [Interruption.] No, no, but they can. Of course, you can. What I am asking is, why can you not send them? Because most of them are saying, if they cannot go to Mullaitivu or Kilinochchi, they can go to their relatives and friends. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) It has already been published in the newspapers that if there are close relatives, they can take them in. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

According to all international conventions, they must be allowed to choose where they want to go. All of them have relatives and friends. What they are saying is, Let us go home. That is their only single request. They are not asking for money from the Ministry. - [Interruption.] You have been saying so for the last four months. Your President promises it every time there is international pressure, but, unfortunately nothing like that ever happens.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Within 180 days - ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) You said that to the Indian Foreign Secretary; you said that to the Indian Defence Adviser about five months ago; that you would do it in six months and then again last week, you were telling Mr. Pascoe that you would do it before January. So, we are waiting to see what you all are-

2695 2696

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) The 180 days will complete on 31st January, 2010. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Now, are you committing yourself that after January 31st, 2010 there will be no more camps in Sri Lanka? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) More people will be resettled. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No. We want you to ensure that there will not be any more camps where these people would be forcibly held. Are you committing yourself to it? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Thank you. But, on the other hand, what I am saying is, you do not have to even wait till January. There are a lot of those who have relatives, those who have friends, kith and kin, kinsfolk. Allow them to go. That is their only request. Hon. Minister, even though you may want to send them, the President himself must recognize the right of the people to return and the people must be allowed to go to their original place or the place of their choice. I am saying that resettlement must start immediately and it must be done under the supervision of an all party Parliamentary Select Committee. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) That is a good proposal. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Yes. That is specially important in the face of the allegations that the Government is merely relocating peoples from these camps in similar camps elsewhere to stave off mounting local and international pressure. In fact, I saw that the Hon. Mavai Senathirajah had made an allegation saying that the people who have been allowed to go from these camps have been again resettled in another camp. I also saw an article in The Sunday

Times on Sunday about a report by the UNOCHA saying that over 2,000 people released from these camps have been again incarcerated elsewhere. - [Interruption.] Afterwards please, Hon. Minister, because I have very little time. Of course, as the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena would have been advised to say - I am just coming on to the subject of mines - the standard excuse is, "We cannot allow you to do so until the de-mining is complete". Of course, I know because I have been told - I have never been there. Many of them respond by saying that they have been living with landmines for the last 10 or 15 years under the tyranny of the LTTE and they can easily live again with them until those are removed. But, on the other hand, I think it is a very good thing that you are doing about de-mining the area. So if the de-mining is now taking place and if it is an obstacle to continue the de-mining process with the presence of civilians, why do you not ask them to go and live with relatives or friends elsewhere? They have relatives in Colombo, they have relatives in Kandy -[Interruption.] , . ? [ ] ? [ ] ? [ ] . . . , . . , . landmines . Landmines . Landmines clear . . , " landmines . , " . , , , - the freedom of choice- . They must have the choice. They have relatives everywhere in this country. I am sure there are friends and well-wishers who would like to keep them. Let them do so. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , . [ ] . Then the next excuse is - [ ] . [ ] . [ ] . . . . . The next excuse is that there are 20,000 suspected LTTE cadres within the camps, so until those people are identified, they cannot allow the others go. This also raises two very interesting questions: one is the credibility and veracity of the figures released by the Ministry of Defence. For example, on 10th February, 2008 - I have the articles - the Army Commander said that the LTTE

2009 22 2697 2698

has around 5,000 fighters remaining. 5,000 2008 . 2008 Commander , 11,000 4,000 . Having decimated the LTTE in May this year, what is very curious is how did this figure suddenly rise up to 20,000 when the Government itself said that the LTTE is so much in their own news items and websites? It is obvious that the numbers of the LTTE seems to be fluctuating according to the whims and fancies of the Defence Minister. Secondly, it raises the question of legality of incarcerating 280,000 people because of the inability of the authorities to identify 20,000 people - even if it is true. This form of collective punishment for the misdeeds of a few is illegal and totally unacceptable in a democracy. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon.
