Venerable Sir, the Hon. Minister of Tourism wanted peacein the way that peace should prevail in this country. So ifthere is peace, tourism will flourish. I have some experiencein this field as I was the Tourism Minister of theCentralProvincial Council. We have a variety of tourists com-ing in. We have eco-tourists who come to see the historicaland archaeological sites and tourists who come for cultural

tourism. They love the beach, the sunshine and the sand.Also, there are tourists who come for sexual pleasure, andtourists who come for tracking and hiking. What do we havein our country? Our tour operators usually have a programmeof work. They take the tourists to Dambulla, show them theruins there, then they take them to Polonnaruwa, show themthe ruins there, then they take them to Anuradhapura andshow them the ruins there. The tourists have better ruins tosee in many other countries. They can go to Greece, India orItaly. They need not come here to see that kind of thing. Thenwhat else do they see ? They see the Kandyan dance in Co-lombo. They see the same thing in Dambulla, in Anuradhapuraand in Polonnaruwa. Once again, if you go to the low coun-try, starting from Mt. Lavina up to Matara, they see the low-country dance. his is what the tourists repeatedly see.

The other matter is, they do not have a programme. I comefrom Nuwara Eliya and our Hon. Minister also has come intoParliament from the Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya seat. These tour-ists come to Nuwara Eliya by 6 oclock in the evening. Theyhave a drink, they sleep at the Grand Hotel or in some otherhotel there and the following morning they leave. This typeof tourism does not do any good to the people of that place.They do not go around and see the small town, the NuwaraEliya town. They do not even go to the Golf Club and seewhether they can play golf or have some pleasure. NuwaraEliya is such a beautiful place where you get waterfalls, the single Tree and the Lovers Leap, where they can do lotof tracking and hiking. They do not have a programme ofwork to do these things. When I was the Tourism Minister inthe Central Provincial Council, I prepared a programme ofwork with the then Minister of Tourism, the late Hon.Dharmasiri Senanayake. we planned how to attract the tour-ists there_ not only foreign tourists but even the local tour-ists. In places like Nuwara Eliya we get more local touristscoming in. What do they do there? They come in a Hiacevan, buy a few bottles of liquor, go to the lake side, drink,dance and go away. This is the type of local tourism that wehave. It has not developed. Hon. Minister, you know betterthat in other countries they encourage local tourists.

It is not only in Sri Lanka that we have tourism. For abeacgh and better sushine, most of the tourists go to Maldives.We have seen many times, Venerabel Sir, that when an aricraftcomes through Maldives, at least 90 per cent of the touristsget off there and the aircraft comes empty to Sri Lanka. TheSri Lankan Airlines takes all of them to Maldives. This is thekind of tourism that they have developed. In the other coun-tries, even in Europe, if you go to any hotel the first thingthat you would see is the places of interest that could bevisited. What do we have? A tourist may come and ask,What do you have in your town? What do we have? Maybe a faw hotels and here and there a casino or something likethat.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)You are there.

2006 2818391840

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)Yes. I am there.

(+ )(The Presiding Member) , .

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)Okay, We have to develop some plan. Tour operators shouldsee how tourism is prospering in other countries and think ofsome mechanism to develop the industry here.

I can speak a lot but because of want of time -

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)Hon. Member, we have got a special developmentprogramme for NuwaraEliya, I will discuss with all the MPsof the NuwaraEliya District and the Central Province and wewill get it into operation by next year.

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)I have presonally spoken to you on this subject on manyoccasions.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) Nuwara Eliya, is a very neglected town. I have been anMP for Nuwara Eliya for 11 years. I know what you aresaying is correct. It is a thoroughly neglected, dirty town.You have to clean it up and make it as attractive as possibleand I hope you will give us your fullest co-operation. Thankyou.

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)Thank you, Venerable Sir.

( )( - )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike - Minister of Tourism)

Hon. Chairman, I would like to thank all the Members ofthe Opposition, particularly the Hon. Gamini Lokuge whowas the Minister of Tourism before me, the Ven. AthuraliyeRathana Thero, the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka, theHon.Ranjith Madduma Bandara, the Hon. ChandrasenaWijesinghe, and all the other Members of Parliament whospoke on the Ministry of Tourism. I appreciate their criticismand I welcome it. As a parliamentarian of 30 yearsexperience, I know that the Committee Stage of the Debateis more important than the Budget Debate itself. This iswhere you have the opportunity of pointing out andcriticizing which is your just right, any ministry of yourchoice and bringing out to the public any wrong doing.So, as a democrat and as a parliamentarian I welcomewhether right or wrong all the suggestions that have beenmade by the Members who have spoken this morning.

I would like to begin by thanking my former DeputyMinister, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga. He resigned his posttwo months ago and I am the only Minister in the Cabinet,Hon. Lokuge, who does not have a deputy minister. Thereare 40 odd ministers. Some have three or four deputy

ministers. Anura Bandaranaike has not got a single deputyminister. So, I thank the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga for sittingby my side and assisting me during this Debate because ofhis affection for tourism, his affection for cricket and hispersonal affection for me.

Mr. Chairman, let me begin by, before I answer the variousquestions that have been raised by the Hon. Members, avery brief summation of the tourist industry. I am givenhalf an hour. I will take 20 minutes to read this and if Icannot finish it in half an hour I will table it and get on tothe questions raised by the Hon. Members.

Sir, you know that tourism is the fourth largest foreignexchange earner to the countrys economy which contributesmore than 3 per cent of the countrys GDP with over Rs.36,377 million. Approximately 200,000 individuals andtheir families depend on tourism related jobs and economicactivities. Its potential for future growth is enormous andhas no boundaries. Tourism was impacted heavily by themost horrendous tsunami disaster which occurred on the26th of December 2004. The tourism sector languished andfell behind other countries in the region such as Mauritius,Maldives, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Theincreasingly disturbing security situation on the other handhas had a debilitating effect on the performance of thetourism sector during the past couple of decades. You willagree that tourism is one of the foremost industriessensitive to volatile situations like what we are experiencingtoday. Whenever there is an act of terrorism in any part ofthe country, my ministry is the worst affected. As the Hon.Gamini Lokuge pointed out, the incident at Habarana washighlighted in the Western media as an event that tookplace in the hub of the Cultural Triangle. It was not anattack on tourists. It was an attack on the navy personnel.The attack on the Galle Naval Harbour was not an attackon tourists but it was an attack on the naval harbour. But,the BBC went on repeating ad nauseam that it was an attackon the tourist hub of Sri Lanka, which is Galle. Now, theaverage viewer who watches BBC - in their millions - willget the impression that they are targeting tourists. TheHon. Lokuge knows that there have been horrendous actsof terrorism in the Geeza in Egypt, in Sharm el-Sheikhand in Bali in Indonesia where hundreds of tourists havebeen targeted by terrorists. But, in this country whateverharm the terrorists have done they have not targeted a singletourist. This is the only plus point which we have got andthis is the point that I have been driving home during myvisits to the United Kingdom, to France, and when I metthe Ambassadors of Germany, the Netherlands, Italy andall the European countries that have put out traveladvisories on us.

The travel advisories became a lingering problemimmediately after every single incident which occurred inColombo.

2006 2818671868

The industry and the Sri Lanka Tourist Board have gottogether to formulate a tactical plan to be effective fromthe 1st of January 2007. This plan will be focused onincreasing arrivals in the winter period from selectedcountries and improving the image of the country. The Hon.Members who spoke today, the Hon. Ranjith MaddumaBandara - I will come to his speech later and the Hon.Gamini Lokuge talked about the Cess Fund. All the moniesthey mentioned were correct. But do you know what hashappened to the Cess Fund which was begun under the UNPregime, which was nurtured under President ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga? The entire Cess Fund goesstraight to the Treasury. Not a cent of the money that youmentioned Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Hon. GaminiLokuge, comes to the Tourism Ministry at all. It goesstraight into the Treasury. - [Interruption]. Yes, yes. Thatis correct. You started it. The former President continued itbut in the year 2006 it was changed. I have no objectionto the Treasury policy that there should be a committeemonitoring the expenditure. I have no quarrel with that.Rather than giving the decision to one person, it is theSecretary of the Treasury, Secretary to my Ministry and theChairman of the Tourist Board, the three members of thisCommittee who will monitor the funds that go every monthto the various tourism projects. This was formulated, Ibelieve in January 2006. That was stipulated by anotherfactor, that this Committee should meet every month toassess the quantum of money that is going to be given tous. For the last 11 months this Committee consisting ofthe Secretary to the Treasury, the Secretary to my Ministryand the Chairman of the Tourist Board has not beensummoned for a single meeting. Whenever we want moneywe have to go with a begging bowl. For the money thathas to come to our Ministry, we have to go with a beggingbowl to Dr. P.B. Jayasundera. That is the plight of theTourism Ministry, Hon. Lokuge. - [Interruption.] Well, Iam responsible. I am a member of the Cabinet. I have infact mentioned this to the President and I hope he will makechanges in this arrangement because this arrangement istotally unsatisfactory because every time I need moneywhether to the WTM or the ITB or for any promotionaldrive, we have to go to the Treasury. . .

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) . [ ] .

Since March, 2006, the Treasury has collected a sum -Hon. Lokuge, you must listen to this - of Rs. 461 million upto September, 2006 and it is estimated that it will exceed Rs.560 million by the end of December, 2006. The Sri LankaTourist Board has not received a single cent out of this TourismCess Fund for any tourist promotional work. This speechwas drafted by myself and the officials of my Ministry.Therefore, I urge the Treasury to release these fundsimmediately enabling us to engage in the much neededtourism development and promotional activity.

I utilized every single opportunity made available to meat the international fora I attended, to speak on traveladvisories to lessen their impact on our tourism product .

I personally led a delegation to lobby for an immediatechange in the travel advisory given by France. Three weeksago I met the Minister of Tourism in Paris, the Hon. LeonBertrand and other high-ranking Government officials inParis. The French Travel Agents Association, the TourOperators Association were invited for one-to-one dialoguewith me. As a result we were able to lobby for some changesin the travel advisory in the immediate future enablingFrench Tour Operators to sell Sri Lanka as usual. TheFrench Tourism Minister told me clearly that they willreview the situation in the light of our presentation. Theywill do so within the next few weeks. Similar exercises areplanned for other countries as well like Germany, Italy andthe Netherlands.

Now these travel advisories as you know, Hon. Members,have gone to an extent where they have drawn the map ofSri Lanka in two colours. The North and East includingAnuradhapura where there has been no terrorist attack atall in recent times has been painted red which is completelya no go at all. The rest of Sri Lanka from Anuradhapura toGalle, to Colombo, to Kandy, to the entirety of Sri Lankahas been painted in dark orange which means also do notgo. I do not know how they chose these colours. Darkred; dark orange which means do not go. So, I appealedto the Tourism Minister of France - the tourists have notbeen targeted, that they are perfectly safe; no tourists havebeen killed in the Habarana attack, no tourists have beenkilled in the Galle attack - therefore to please lift this travel

18691870

[ ]band in the rest of the country except the North and East.So now in view of our appeal, they are going to changetheir travel advisories and I am glad that Australia whichwas the first country to be in the travel advisory against ushas now withdrawn it.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to also mention that for thefirst time in the history of tourism we were able to conducta Strategic Marketing Planning Workshop in Bentota lastmonth to which my good Friend, the Hon. GayanthaKarunatileka very graciously came. Over 100 membersrepresenting public and private sectors brainstormed for fourdays to formulate an effective and efficient strategy for thenext three years. The entirety of the private sector wasthere. This plan will be called Sri Lanka Tourisms StrategicMarketing Plan and will be ready in a few weeks time.The proposed plan will give required marketing directionfor Sri Lanka tourism from the year 2007.

A few perverted journalists attacked the cost of theworkshop. But, every penny was worth it as the benefitswere beyond our own expectations.

Sir, I do not know. There seems to be a lot of publicityon my Ministry. I do not know how many Ministers arethere. There are some 40 odd Ministers. Nobody talks aword about their Ministries. The one Ministry they alwaystalk about is the Ministry of Tourism. Is it because of AnuraBandaranaike or is it because it was Hon. Arjuna Ranatungasformer Ministry or the Hon. Gamini Lokuges former Ministryor is it because tourism was started by Mr. J.R. Jayewardeneand my mother? What is the reason? The Ministry ofTourism is everyday in the papers, everyday in the papers!Other Ministers get away scot-free.

( )(The Hon. Gamini Lokuge)

That is a promotion.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)Promotion. Uncalled promotion.

In accordance with the thinking of His ExcellencyPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Sri Lanka Tourist Boardis paving the way to enter new markets such as China,Russia, Eastern European countries and the Middle East.You know that the Middle Eastern market is a small market.But they are high spenders. I think, the Hon. RanjithMadduma Bandara mentioned that and you also mentionedthat. It is not the Heads that matter. It is the amount ofmoney that we collect. That is right. That is absolutelyright. I agree with you entirely.

We have had so far, no major promotional drive in theMiddle East. I am hoping to begin at the end of January amajor thrust into the United Arab Emirates - Abu Dhabi,Dubai, Sharjah, Oman and Qatar. I will go and work outwith them, with their Ministers of Tourism and the tourismsectors a massive road show for Sri Lanka in the UnitedArab Emirates by the middle of next year.

The Chinese market is doing well. We have three flightsa week to China. If we can break into the Chinese market,our tourism is made. The Chinese are all Buddhists. Beinga communist state, they have never practised Buddhism.Having opened their system, all the Buddhist Chinese arebeginning to discover that there is a world beyond China,there is a world beyond the Great Wall of China. Todaytheir interest in Buddhism is growing bright day by day, asthe Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero mentioned; not only inChina but also in South Korea and Japan. They are allBuddhist countries. Therefore, I have worked out a conceptcalled The Buddhas Route or the Buddhas Trail. Likethe Silk Route which had been traversed by the travellersover the centuries, The Buddhist Trail will begin fromLumbini, in Nepal where the Lord Buddha was born. Thento northern India, Sarnath, Sanchi, Varanasi, Buddhagayaand then to Sri Lanka where the Lord Buddha visited thrice,Kelaniya, Mahiyanganaya, Nagadeepa including theTemple of the Tooth, Sri Pada and so on. I have spoken tothe Minister of Tourism and Culture in India, MadamAmbika Soni, an old friend of mine and also the Ministerof Tourism of Nepal who is a very good friend. They allagreed that they are fully committed to this and we willget this off the ground by the year 2007 which will be amajor attraction for the Chinese market because the Chineseare not looking for beaches and the sun like the Europeans.They want to see culture, they want to see heritage and theywant to see things that they have never seen before. Alsothe Chinese are high spenders. Middle-class in China hasgrown so much in the last 15 years, Mr. Chairman. It isunbelievable. But once you shed your communist garb,what development you can do! Therefore, Sir, that is oneof the markets that we are going to work on very much inthe near future.

We are also planning to launch an aggressive destinationmarketing campaign during the year 2007 when ourPresident visits China to celebrate the 50th anniversary ofChina-Lanka Diplomatic Relations which was begun by myfather, the late Prime Minister, Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaikein 1957 when he was the Prime Minister and ForeignMinister of Sri Lanka. Now, Sir, we are also planning toopen offices in Tokyo, Beijing and Delhi next year whichare three of our major markets because India, as you know,has the largest tourist arrivals today. As the Hon. GaminiLokuge said, with so many open-sky policies, so manyairlines are coming into Colombo. Airlines like Sahara,Jetwing, Kingfisher, all these airlines are flying to Colombonow. There are 100 flights between India and Sri Lankaevery week; hundred flights a week! So, we are workingon the Indian market very hard.

2006 2818711872

Sir, I would also like to mention that what is fundamentallyimportant is to make our product perfect and without peaceand without civil war - without civil war there is no peace.I will come to that at the end of my speech. We need goodroads and good infrastructure. Waste-free and cleanenvironment, touts and trouble free mobility and reasonableproduct pricing will be the topmost tourist pulling factors.Many of our overseas partners have repeatedly complainedabout the harassment to tourists in key resort areas. Toaddress this issue we have set up a special Tourist PoliceUnit at the Sri Lanka Tourist Board and we will beexpanding to other key resorts such as Bentota andNegombo.

During the year 2005, several internationally reputedbrand products took off the ground in Sri Lankan soil.Amman Resorts ventured into Amman Galle and AmmanWella in Tangalle. The Hyatt Hotel, one of the largest hotelchains in the world, has commenced construction in theheart of Colombo, thanks to the far-seeing policies of Dr.Lalith Kotelawala, a man whom I hold in great respect, andwill be completed in the next two years. There are now15,000 star-class hotel rooms in operation with another 5,000ordinary rooms in the informal sector engaged in activetourism business.

Sir, I would skip some pages of my prepared speech becauseof the time limitation. At the beginning of the year 2007,we will embark on two mega tourism projects, namelyKalpitiya and Dedduwa. Such mega projects have neverbeen undertaken before. Initially, there will be 4,000 acresvested in the Sri Lanka Tourist Board for accommodationand recreational facility development in the proposedKalpitiya Tourist Resort, which is the biggest ever in thehistory of Sri Lanka. I have sought Cabinet approval forthe Tourist Board to embark on the basic infrastructuredevelopment in Dutch Bay Island at a cost of Rs. 350million. The first stage of this will commence in January,2007.

Dedduwa, referred to by my good Friend, the Hon.Gayantha Karunatileka, was begun during the time of theHon. Ranil Wickremasinghes Premiership, under the UNP.We will not drop it; we will develop it. Already onDedduwa, the land has been virtually acquired. The landacquisition is over and we are in the stage of consideringcompensation for the lands that have been taken over. Therewere some problems with some of the land owners for sometime. They were going to court and doing various things.So, we have to settle the compensation. However, Dedduwawill begin on target and do not worry, whatever good thingsyou had started, we will carry on. When we are not thereand you come back here, if you come back here, pleasecarry on the good work that we have started.

Sir, for the first time in the history of tourism, my Ministryhas secured a grant of Rs.3 billion under the JBIC Yen LoanPackage from Japan to develop tourism resources in

Negombo, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Sigiriya, improvingthe the Hamilton Canal in Negombo and the Gregorys Lakein Nuwara Eliya - listen, Mr. Puththirasigamoney, one ofthe major targets I have got is Nuwara Eliya - to constructthe new Hotel School in Kandy and the Ring Road networkin Sigiriya and Anuradhapura, which are in the CulturalTriangle. We launched the new project in Negombo onthe 25th of November, last Saturday, with a massive awarenesscreation campaign involving the Negombo MunicipalCouncil, the Hon. Member of Parliament for Negombo,hoteliers and other stakeholder agencies and the community,which was a great success.

The Ceylon Hotels Corporation underwent a suddentransformation as a result of the Galle Face Hotels CompanyLimited buying over Rs. 653 million worth of shares fromthe Bank of Ceylon, emerging to be its major shareholder.This was at the behest of the then Finance Minister, theHon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama and the Secretary to theTreasury, Dr. P. B. Jayasundera. I had nothing to do withit. The shares were all owned by the Bank of Ceylon. Theemployees of both the Ceylon Hotels Corporation and theKandy Hotels Company Limited will be given 10 per centof the value of shares disposed by the Bank of Ceylon.I recall the Hon. Gamini Lokuges comments in this regardduring the last years Budget Debate. We have fulfilled thisobligation now. Once the Ceylon Hotels CorporationRepeal Act is passed by Parliament, which will happen verysoon early next year, 1.5 million preference shares held bythe Treasury will also be converted to ordinary shares tobe sold in the share market. Cabinet approval has alreadybeen obtained to vest in the EPF and the ETF the CeylonHotels Corporation Employees 10 per cent of the value ofshares to be disposed of. On account of the shares held bythe staff, they will be offered a place in the directorate ofthe company on the insistence of the President, HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.

We have given equally high priority for development offacilities in domestic tourism. We are in the process ofrefurbishing the Tourist Board resorts in Kataragama,Anuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya, Bentota and Bandarawela.Thirty seven rest houses are being upgraded for domestictourists, out of which 18 have already been completed andso on and so forth.

Now, Sir, we have also built comfort centres in NamalUyana and Bibile - my good Friend, the Hon. RanjithMadduma Bandara will know that - for the benefit of thedomestic travellers.

Now , Sir, I am skipping some more pages of my speech.Sir, I would like to just say that we are working within theMahinda Chintana policy of President MahindaRajapaksa, aiming at a target of 1.5 million arrivals by theyear 2010. This is going to be subject to a major problem.We can target for a million arrivals or 1.5 million arrivalsdepending on the ground situation as far as the war isconcerned.

18731874

[ ]Yesterday, we all heard the speech made by Mr. VelupillaiPrabhakaran on Maveerar Day where he declared virtualwar on the State of Sri Lanka. What this will mean at theend of it, I do not know. What he means by it, I do notknow. But, all I can say is that we are going to be in for avery very hard time. I will come to that later. So, all thesefigures depend entirely on the situation vis--vis the civilwar with the LTTE. Now, Sir, I would like to table the restof my prepared speech because I want to reply to the Hon.Members who have raised various questions on the Ministryof Tourism. Therefore, Sir, I table* from page 16 to 19 ofmy speech to be included in Hansard.

I have now excellent working relationships with the privatesector. I met them several times and assured them many timesthat their role, which is fundamental, will be protected andenhanced by the new Tourism Law. I expect theirparticipation as equal partners in developing Sri Lankantourism together with my Ministry. I shall utilize their talentsand their experience fully in our future strategies, of thatthere shall be no doubt at all. The only slight delay in thiswas that some of the Clauses in the new Tourism Law were inconflict with the Mahinda Chintana. Therefore,I appointed a three-member committee consisting of a retiredSupreme Court Judge and a respected ex-Chairman of theTourist Board, Mr. Samaranayake. They have given a reporton some of the Clauses in the new Tourism Law, which mightbe in conflict with the Mahinda Chintana. So, I shall discussit with President Rajapaksa, get those things corrected andI will bring it before Parliament at the latest, by the end ofFebruary next year.

Now let me deal with the matters raised by my goodFriend, the Hon. Gamini Lokuge. He mentioned about theCess Fund, which I have dealt with, and the WTM. As faras the WTM in London is concerned - I have been theMinister of Tourism for two and a half years - I have onlybeen to one WTM in London and that was the one thatwas held last month. I think you had been there, Hon.Lokuge, when you were the Minister of Tourism yourself.I would like to tell the Hon. Lokuge that in the year 2004,the Tourist Board spent Rs. 42 million for the Sri Lankanstall at the WTM. In 2005, we had spent Rs. 42 million.This year, we spent only Rs. 34 million. That is Rs. 8 millionless than 2004 and 2005. Those are the final expenditurefigures.

Sir, in fact, I was not happy about going to the WTM.I decided not to go, but the private sector and my Ministryprevailed upon me to go there. I met the British touradvisers because Britain is the only market that is availableto us in Europe today, whose travel advisory has been themost lenient and the most encouraging. So, the Britishmarket is the only hope we have got in the whole of Europe

* . Produced at end of speech.

because by the time the French, the Germans, the Dutchand the Italians get their act together, the season would havebeen over. So, therefore, the British market we are targetingin a very big way and I am going to allocate a large amountof funds to promote Sri Lanka in Britain along with Britishtour operators to get as maximum tourists from Britain aspossible in the next three months.

I know, as the Hon. Lokuge mentioned, that there willbe a lot of retrenchment that will come up with the lesserarrivals from Europe and the rest of the world. As you know,after the tsunami the Government of Sri Lanka extendedSusahana, which was a bank facility, to all the possiblesectors. We gave duty-free importation facilities to all theaffected hotels. We will take appropriate action to dealwith the hoteliers who will be the worst affected by the non-arrival of tourists in the coming season. As to what formand shape it will take, will depend entirely on the financialsituation that we are in. We are aware of the tremendousproblems that are going to be caused by retrenchment; theunemployment and the heartaches that will be caused bythis. So, to prevent that, we will take every single measurethat is within our purview.

As far as the Hotel School is concerned, we areconducting all four certificate level courses. The minimumqualification in the English language is an Ordinary pass,not a Credit pass. For Hotel School, Colombo, a C passis required and for satellite schools only an S pass isnecessary in English. Those were the two major points thathave been raised by the Hon. Gamini Lokuge.

The Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero mentioned someimportant points, which I would like to deal with thoughhe is not here. The Venerable Thero talked about sextourism. The Government does not encourage sex tourismnor can we discourage it. Some very high people are foundinside cars - - or caught in the act of sex. So,how can I stop those things, Hon. Members? As long asthe two parties are willing, what can I do? So, as far as weare concerned, we are not promoting it. Where child sex isconcerned, we are working with the UNICEF very closelyand taking very stern action to deal with paedophiles andchild sex tourism in Sri Lanka. It is something which nogovernment can ever endorse or encourage in any way.

The other question the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Theromentioned was, the arrival of prostitutes. How on earth arewe supposed to know whether a person is a prostitute ornot, Mr. Chairman? If you can help me, I will be very glad.We had been in the same school together. Your father andmy father served in the same Cabinet. So, if you can helpme to identify a woman of ill-fame, please go ahead anddo so. I will stop her from coming. My former DeputyMinister can help me or the Hon. Deputy Minister of Power,who is a master on the subject, can help me.

With the Hon. Ravi Karunanayke.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)Along with the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. So, these arethings, Sir, that no Minister of Tourism can stop. Butcertainly, we will not encourage it.

( )(The Chairman)

You can check the profession under the declaration inthe visa form.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)

Yes. If they are honest, they will declare their realprofession. But nobody does that, Mr. Chairman, exceptyou and I and a few others.Sir, the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero mentioned aboutPresident George Bush losing California because of theenvironmental issue. I would like to correct the VenerableMonk that President George W. Bush lost not onlyCalifornia, but the entirety of the United States. He lostthe House of Parliament and the Senate not because of theenvironmental issue, but because he went and invaded asovereign State called Iraq. America is stuck head to footin the mud of Iraq which was certainly caused by thecomplete disastrous management of foreign policy by Mr.George W. Bush and his accomplice Tony Blair. I have saidthis so many times on the Floor of this House. I am goingto America in two weeks time. I hope they would not stopme at the customs. But, I will say it again and again thatfor the misery the Iraqi people are suffering, the first suspectis not Saddam Hussein, but George W. Bush. Therefore, Iwould like to remind the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Therothat Bush did not lose because of the environmental issue;he did not lose because of corruption, but because of hisinvolvement in Iraq. The American people have given aclear verdict.

Sir, we have encouraged the private sector to promoteeco-tourism. The Ven. Rathana Thero also talked about eco-tourism. We are having eco-tourist villages, traditional classpottery ware, rattan ware and we will be encouraging thisall over the country. The Venerable Thero also mentioned

about the ayurvedic systems. I think many hotels today,five-stars to three-stars, two-stars to one-stars, have gotayurvedic treatment. Siddhalepa is doing a magnificent jobat Wadduwa in their ayurvedic hospital. We areencouraging the ayurvedic traditional form of treatment allover the country. We hope the private sector will take thecue and open up more and more ayurvedic centres for ourforeign tourists.

Sir, the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero mentioned abouta person called Goenkaji. I have never heard of a Goenkaji.So, I asked my officials. They have also not heard of aGoenkaji. Somebody called Goenkaji had arrived at theBMICH and was blaming the Ministry of Tourism for notencouraging him. I have never heard of the man in mywhole life, Sir. Have you heard of him? I think theSecretary-General of Parliament knows about him. I thinkwe will pass it on to her. I and my Ministry will certainlyencourage the Secretary-General of Parliament to bring moreand more Goenkajis to Sri Lanka.

Now, Sir, the Hon. Chandrasena Wijesinghe of the JVPraised some very important questions and also the Hon.Gayantha Karunatileka about Dedduwa. We are carryingon with Dedduwa. There is no question of a pull back. Weare now settling the land issues, we are paying thecompensation and Dedduwa will get off on target.

Then, Sir, he talked about the Hikkaduwa bypass. Weare now going to do the Hikkaduwa bypass and we arelooking for foreign funding for it. I am speaking very fastbecause I am running short of time. He also mentioned avery good point, how Thailand and Malaysia are spendingso much of money on their advertising. Hon. Member, theproblem we have got is, we do not have that kind ofresource. We do not have that kind of money to spend ontourism. Malaysia and Thailand have spent enormousamounts of money on international television advertising,on newspaper advertising, on country to country advertisingand that is why they have got so many, an abundance oftourists in their countries. Our finances are limited and myfinances are frozen. So, in that situation I do not think wecan compare ourselves to Thailand or to Malaysia in anyway as far as the monies are concerned.

The Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the Hon.Gayantha Karunatileka are two of my old friends. We wereon the same side for many years. I have the greatest regardfor them as two up-and-coming young leaders of the UNP.I thank them for the warm compliments they have placedand praised me and I am indeed grateful to them for theirfulsome praise, which I will always remember.

Sir, the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara mentioned aboutcertain acts of omission in the Tourist Board. If you cangive me all the documents, I will go into it fully. At thenext Consultative Committee - I am not asking him to waitfor one year more - in January or February, kindly give it

18771878

[ ]to me. Before that I will make a full investigation and giveyou the full report because I know you are genuinelyconcerned. You know that I am not involved in any acts ofcorruption which I have never been in my whole life. Ifthere is anybody in my Ministry starting from my Secretarydownwards who is involved in any act of corruption,anybody, that person will be dealt with according to thelaw. I will not encourage it nor will I sponsor it nor willI seeing it, turn a blind eye to it. So, please give me all thedocuments you have and I will personally investigate intothese matters that you have raised. Thank you very muchHon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara.

I would like to finally say Sir, in conclusion-

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

He can take ten minutes from the time of my Ministry.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)

No, Sir, I only need five minutes.

( )(The Chairman)

All right.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)

I thank the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle for giving me fiveminutes. Now, Sir, I wish to make one appeal to this House.The development of tourism, the development of investmentor the development of highways, of every single sector inthe Government depends on peace. That is the crucial keyto this. If there is no peace, there is no tourism. If there isno peace, there will be no investments. If there is no peacethere will be no development. We are standing still, thegold is going by. The Maldives has bypassed us; tiny littleMaldives, because there is stability in that country.We cannot compare ourselves with India, Thailand, Malaysiaor with any of the bigger countries. But this country needspeace desperately. We have reached the point of no return.I said this in my Budget Debate speech and I say it againnow in the light of the speech made by Mr. Prabhakaranyesterday.

Sir, for the first time the SLFP and the UNP in 55 years ofbattling each other have joined together after signing anMoU for two years. What is the fundamental issue of theMoU? It is the settlement of the ethnic issue. If we canreach a consensus as fast as possible and persuade the LTTEthrough India, through the European Union or throughanybody - it does not matter who - to come back to the

talks, let us go before them, talk with them and finally seewhether we can find a solution to their problem. Maximumdevolution - you can call it whatever name you want to -appears to me to be the only solution that is available. Thatmay be the only solution the Tamils will accept. Butwhether the LTTE will accept it, after yesterdays speech,I do not know because Prabhakaran yesterday declaredvirtual war on us.

Now, Sir, I am sorry that the newspapers of this country,not only the State media, even The Island newspaperexcept the Daily Mirror newspaper, gave it so littlepublicity. Such a major speech which affects the life ofevery single Sri Lankan was blacked out in the newspapers.What are we trying to do?

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)It was a worldwide speech.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)It was a worldwide speech. It was on CNN, it was on BBC,it was on Indian television, it was on Hong Kong television,on Singapore television. In Sri Lanka television not a wordabout it. Fortunately, Sirasa gave his speech yesterday.I was watching him. He spoke with absolute confidence.I saw, Sir, and the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake must have alsoseen this in one of the Sunday newspapers, I think one ofthe privately owned newspapers, they had drawn a sketchof Prabhakaran and listed all the ailments he has got. Theysaid, he has heart problems, hypertension, pressure goingup, diabetes, liver problems, kidney problems and they havealso said, Sir, that his genitals are enlarged. Now, no SriLankan leader has ever met Prabhkaran; fromJ.R. Jayewardene to Ranasinghe Premadasa to ChandrikaKumaratunga, to Mahinda Rajapaksa, nobody has metPrabhakaran or seen him. I do not think any one of ushas met him. [Interruption.] Do not involve that poor manin this. Now, how do we know that his genitals have gotenlarged? Our newspapers are asking us to believe thatPrabhakaran is having all these ailments. The man lookedthe picture of health on television. Whom are you tryingto bluff? For Gods sake stop this bluff. If the man hasgot hypertension, let him look after that. If he has gotenlarged private parts let him get it operated. Why are weworried about that? We are satisfying ourselves thinkingthat Prabhakaran got swept by the tsunami, he is dead, hehas got an enlarged heart, enlarged private parts, what thehell do we care about that? He can look after his ownhealth. He has looked after it for so long. He has killedso many of our leaders, so many of the Indian Leaders, sweptthe UNP leaders from the political picture, he nearlybombed my sister to death, killed C.V. Gooneratne, killedLakshman Kadirgamar, killed so many innocent people;Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, Mr. Amirthalingam, Mr. Yogeswaran;

2006 2818791880

4 PL 001689 (2006/12)

the whole of the Tamil diaspora was killed by them in theSri Lankan politics and the man is the picture of perfecthealth, and we are telling ourselves, My God, Prabhakaranis going to die now. Stop this rot. Whether the man isalive or dead, the LTTE is alive and we have to deal withthe problem of terrorism. So let us together - I appeal tothis House once again and perhaps for the final time becauseI am not going to speak on this subject again - drop allour inhibitions and forget the past. The UNP and the SLFPhave worked out an MoU together. We have got 85 percent of the country behind us. Now for Gods sake, moveahead and settle this problem once and for all. Then,tourism will prosper, investment will prosper, everything elsewill be on the move and Sri Lanka will once again beginto move as a nation and we will all feel proud to be SriLankans.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

( )(The Chairman)

Thank you, Hon. Minister.

* : Rest of the speech tabled:

We are working within the Mahinda Chinthana policy frameworkaiming at a target of 1.5 million arrivals by year 2010. While doing sowe are mindful of the bottom line, which is sustainable tourismdevelopment with due regard to the preservation of our precious culturalheritage and the unique natural environment. Tourism is anextraordinary industry which cannot operate in isolation. Tourismdepends on better airport services provided by the Ministry of Portsand Aviation, good roads constructed by the Ministry of Highways,health services provided by the Health Ministry and enjoy facilitiessprovided by the Wild Life Department and the Ministry of Zoological& Botnical Gardens as much as a tourist interacts with every humanaspect from entry point to the exit. Tourissm requires genuine stakeholdersupport of course including the entire community.

We have initiated several projects to ensure benefits of tourism to therural community who are the custodians of our culture and the gifts ofnature. Most of the tourists today want to enjoy their travel withresponsibility. They are keen that the local community benefits fromtheir travel. For the tourists to interact with the community and to enjoytheir lifestyle, we have initiated several village tourism projects wherewe develop facilities for tourists to visit traditional craftss, pottery.Rattan wear producing villages. We have 1000s of such villages whichcan promote as key tourist attractions specially adjacent to tourist resortsand located along tourist routes. Media has been reporting that I havereceived instructions from Hiss Excellency the President to replace thecurrent Chairman of SLTB.

I wish to inform the Hon. Members that I have not received any suchinstructions from His Excellency the President. Furthermore, when thecurrent Chairman intimated to His Excellency the President of his wishto step down, he was requested to continue.

My Ministry works closely with the Provincial Councils and with theRural Industries and self employment, Samurdhi and Poverty Alleviation,Plantation Industry, Culture and National Heritage and Rural LivelihoodDevelopment Ministries for this purpose by which we can eventually

ensure substantial benefits from tourism to rural community. I sincerelysolicit the support of all agencies purpose while thanking for theenormous support given to my Ministry, Tourist Board and theConvention Bureau in the past.

I have appointed a three-member committee to look in to the newTourism Law. The Committee, which consist of a retired SupremeCourt judge and a senior ex-chairman of the Tourist Board pointed outthat they noticed a few inconsistencies with the constitution and theyare not in line with Mahinda Chinthana which received the peoplesmandate. Therefore some amendements may be required beforeimplementation and the power of the Minister will not be diminished.I am hoping to bring required changes to the new Tourism Law earlynext year in consultation with His Excellency the President.

I thank you very much for giving me this opportunityto speak on a very, very important Ministry headed by acompetent Minister. But I do not know whether he ismaking use of his competency. He is an able person, anaffable person and also able to get things done. Now, Hon.Minister, I had the privilege of holding this Ministry from5th December, 2001 to 2nd April, 2004. So as a result Ispeak passionately on this Ministry, and I speak with a senseof feeling rather than with acrimony. My genuine approachis to ensure that this Ministry is made into a better Ministry,able to contribute towards the well-being of the country.That is my only intention. Going on further, I would liketo take on from where the Minister, the Hon. AnuraBandaranaike, a very senior person stopped. He said withall dignity in this House that the countrys problem liessomewhere else but whether proper attention has been paidto that is the most important aspect. Going on from theMinistry of Tourism to the Ministry of Trade, I think it isnothing but right to continue from where the Hon. AnuraBandaranaike stopped by saying that peace is the mostimportant ingredient if we are to put Sri Lanka back on themap. When we took over the country to govern under theable leadership of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, one ofthe priorities was to ensure that we bring peace to thiscountry. When we took over, the growth rate which was anegative 1.8 per cent was converted to a positive growth.We were able to put Sri Lanka back on the map for thesimple reason that we had perdurable peace in this countryand that was not an easy task. It was something which wasbasically being looked at by Sri Lankans, by theinternational community and more or less being ridiculedby some of the chauvinistic parties that seem to besupporting the heterogeneous alliance today. But as hementioned, the United National Party being a responsibleOpposition today has come forward in the time of need toassist the President in his call to bring peace and goodgovernance in this country. But whether it is being used isthe question. Signing agreements does not mean everything.As of today, the President has signed agreements witheverybody except the LTTE. So I am saying that it has gotto be looked at from a positive sense. Look at the olivebranch or the assistance that has been given by the UnitedNational Party. It will make governance more acceptableand also make the international community and the investorslook at Sri Lanka and ensure that there would be a tourismand investment boom. It will also ensure that brain drain

is stopped from our country. So, on that basis if we do notpursue too much, our Namo Namo Matha will be no more,no more Sri Lanka. So ensure that we go on the properbasis and take on the peace process in its proper sense.

The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle when I asked a questiontwo weeks ago did accept the fact that the CeasefireAgreement is accepted by the Government. He stated thatthis is something carried on from the previous Government.So he feels that there is a necessity to go forward with that.If that is the intention of a very senior Minister and that iswhat is shared, when you go for the Geneva talks, pleaseensure that you look at it from a proper perspective insteadof listening to some lunatics who are there trying to givesupport or a chauvinistic party that is bloodthirsty who thinkthat that is the only solution. My belief is that we do notneed to negotiate through fear nor do we have fear tonegotiate. That is the standing point. There may bedeficiencies in the Ceasefire Agreement. But certainly thatis a very vital ingredient in order to take the countryforward. I am sure, Hon. Minister, in your onerous task asthe Minister of Trade, Commerce, Consumer Affairs andMarketing Development and as the Minister of Highways,you must be lampooned with all the investors coming andasking, When are you going to bring peace to thiscountry? I guess that is the most important selling pointwhen you meet an investor. That is the reason why I thoughtI will take on from where the Hon. Anura Bandaranaikestopped and it is not too far away from his own words thatthis country will be a failed State. I guess in practicalterms it is. It is only to be named so if we go on in thissame asinine manner. This is all I would like to mention atthe start.

Hon. Minister, I know you have a very difficult task.It is not a pleasant task and I know that every single personwould love to ridicule you. We, from the UNP do not getany extra pleasure in saying that you all have failedmiserably in doing so. But perennially this has been thecase. But macroeconomic policies have been eliminatedin your good governance approach which has made yourlife in the Ministry much more difficult. And this, I amsaying not with relish but for the simple reason thatmacroeconomic policies are of absolute essentiality if youhave got to bring down the cost of living. There are threecomponents that basically make up the cost of living.It may be an import inflation which is owing to factorsbeyond our control. Then, there are controllable factorswithin the country, such as certain pressures that are comingin from union activitieset cetera. The third area is lack ofproper policies and implementation of them. These threefactors play a pivotal role in deciding the cost of livingand as regards all three factors, the Government has failedmiserably.

If you look at the maintenance of the exchange rates,today the country is paying a price for living beyond ourmeans. Look at the exchange rates. It is a reflection of your

18851886

[ ]assessability not being in line with internal consumption.And doing too little too late does not help you in any wayto solve that problem. As you know, when we handed over,the Dollar was Rs. 93. When we took over it was Rs. 99and just six months ago it was Rs. 102 and it is almostRs. 109 - Rs. 110 today. That does not mean that this issomething which cannot be controlled. The Central Bankstepped in too late and they did too little to ensure thatthis is properly corrected. Why I am talking about exchangerates in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes ofthe Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Consumer Affairs andMarketing Development is for the simple reason that weare an import-based economy and on that basis our exportsare bent on the imports that come in. Our consumption isalmost 40 per cent to 50 per cent of import-basedproducts. So exchange rates play a pivotal role. Withoutyour knowing it, without your conscionable knowledge,this country has paid 20 per cent more for goods from theday you took over to-date for no crime you committed.This is what all the Trade Ministers have to go through.This is what all the Ministers of Consumer Affairs haveto go through. But you should have the right to say inthe Cabinet, I am sorry, we are going in the wrong way.

Likewise the interest rates; the interest rate is alsoimportant for the Trade Ministry because you are competingin a global world and when you compete in a global world,in your cost inputs the interest rate is the most importantaspect. Banks are not benefactors. They are basically takingmonies from the depositors, adding profit and then sellingit to the lender. So on that basis, interest rates which wentup from 7 per cent to almost 17 per cent,18 per cent, 19per cent and treasury bill rate from 6.75 per cent, whenwe handed over, to almost 12 1/2 per cent today meansthat there is a hundred per cent increase in your cost ofcapital. Cost of capital is what a lender would borrow fromthe banks, add value to its services and then ensure it issold out. So there again, your cost has gone up 100 percent on the input basis. The third aspect is poormanagement. Good governance is non-existent. TheSeventeenth Amendment is practised in the breach. Thereis no recourse where you could go to courts. The investorsor the aggrieved parties do not get quick resolution whenit comes to legal matters and that has a very bindingimpact for getting investments into this country. I am sure,going through the annals of what we have done when wewere in the Ministry, you will find that one of the biggestproblems was to ensure confidence build-up in theinvestors who come.

So Hon. Minister, my starting point is that you must getyour macroeconomic policies into place, otherwise youwill be living permanently with some outsiders sins at yourdoorstep. Why am I saying this? I could easily be blastingyou by saying, What have you done from the day I leftor since you have taken over? I guess that type of politicsneed to be changed. I am not saying this just because we

signed the Agreement on the 23rd of October, 2006. ButI guess that at a time of crisis there is no point getting anundue thrill by just trying to score brownie points by saying,this is the problem. But I hope these are being listened to,and acted upon. Just because we from the Opposition saysomething it does not mean that we are saying somethingwrong. We are also Sri Lankans. We also like to take overthe economy that you will be handing over in the nextcouple of months - may be owing to the fact that you areunable to govern. But, you have got to continue. We havegot to take over. If you lose the economic war we havelost all wars. Hon. Minister, why I put you in the pictureis, because these were the biggest drawbacks that I had inrunning that Ministry and I am sure you have the sameheadache.

But going on further, if I may get into the real area, I dealt withthe cost of living because that is the most relevant question and thepeople today are absolutely burnt with that. . . , , , . , . . , , . . ? , , . , , . , . , , . . . . . . . . . . COPE . . . . . , .

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . External Trade .

The Free Trade Agreements are something which is veryimportant. I would like to mention that there was a veryintellectual discourse that took place about ten, twelve daysago, where most of the professors and the people who havebusiness acumen came forward and gave their ideas and said- Sir, I am quoting from the Daily Mirror of 25thNovember, 2006. Lanka fast losing ground on hub statusfor trade.

. , . . I like to mention the areas of trade balance betweenIndia and Sri Lanka. We have to be thankful to the late Hon.President, Premadasa for starting the Indo-Lanka Free TradeAgreement. But, thereafter, it was the Hon. (Mrs.) ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga who signed the Indo-Lanka FreeTrade Agreement and put in place. But then it was theUnited National Party, I am sure, you would agree, who reallyforced to draw the situation. Then from Sri Lanka to Indiathe import was about 12 and is now brought to 1 is to 3simply because we generated enthusiasm, we pushed theexporters from here to ensure that we open the Indianeconomy, so that they accept the exports coming from SriLanka without any problem. But still there is a lot of non-trade barriers -.

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

We must ensure that these are taken away. I know inyour last discussion you were able to ensure that there willbe more port entries, more items opened up but that wasnot the belief as to how the Free Trade Agreement was goingforward. There should be CEPA, the ComprehensiveEconomic Partnership Agreement,. that should have beentaken over in 2005, But that is still being dilly dallied byI do not know who the person concerned is. You have gota good Commerce Department.. Ensure that we maximizetheir capacity. There we see Mrs. Manel de Silva with alot of ability. Ensure that you have the team to drive itthrough and ensure that we keep the momentum, the gustoor the pressure that was there during our term. Now if wefail on that, we will lose the external factor that is there,the local trade that is absolutely essential. Today, the localmarkets are dwindling. So in order to ensure themanufacturers are able to have the critical mass that is there,they have to export. , . , .

So, I am happy to mention the import and export figuresof the past few years. In 1999 there were US Dollars 512million worth of imports from India and US Dollars 49 millionworth of exports from Sri Lanka. In 2000 it was US Dollars600 million as against US Dollars 58 million. In 2001 itwas US Dollars 602 million as against US Dollars 72 million.In 2002 it was US Dollars 835 million as against US Dollars

171 million and in 2003 it increased to US Dollars 1093million worth of imports to US Dollars 245 million worth ofexports. In the year 2004 Sri Lankas imports were worth USDollars 1350 million while Sri Lankas exports were worthUS Dollars 382 million. You can see a rapid growth there.Then in 2005 there were imports worth of US Dollars 1437million and exports were worth US Dollars 588 million andin the year 2006 it is US Dollars 924 million as against USDollars 299 million. So, there is a tremendous growth. Butthis is with lack of zeal and enthusiasm. I know that there aremany areas that your Ministry has got to look into. But youhave to ensure that some attention is given from your valuabletime to this area because it has to be driven from top to bottom.Otherwise it will never function.

Going further on this subject, I would like to say thatthe FTA or the Free Trade Agreement with the USA is a deadduck today. I know that you are having a State guestcoming from America tomorrow and you have kindly invitedus too. But I guess that is not sufficient because today thereis a Congress that is democratically elected. That is whywe said on the 10th of February in 2004-

( + )(The Presiding Member) , . .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

When we mentioned that with the Free Trade Agreementin hand, they made a mockery out of that. But today withhindsight they say, Yes. We lost that golden opportunity.Therefore, ensure that we fight back from TIFA to Free TradeAgreement. Otherwise we are going to have a verydangerous trend because America is discussing to have FreeTrade Agreements with other countries. They want toconclude them. So, we will get caught up in a trap andwe will not be able to have the status that the others arehaving. European Labour GSP is something in jeopardytoday. We have a Consul-General there from the CommerceDepartment. Please ensure that we push it and get the labourGSP protected because today the exporters are able to sendgoods duty free into Europe. If we lose that - I am signalingthat it is going to happen in March, 2007 - we are going toface a grave problem of exporting on a cost competitivebasis to the European Union.

, Peace is absolutely essential. Ensure thatpeace brings in stability, stability brings in growth, growthbrings in investment, and investment brings in jobopportunities. Job opportunities ensure that we have higherincomes. Higher income ensures reduction of cost of living.Reduction of cost of living indicates that you have contentedcitizens in this country. So, all what we could basically say isthat we can fight from morning to night, but at the end of theday we have got to ensure that Mother Lanka wins. Todaywe have come to a point where Sri Lanka is faced with whatPrabhakaran said yesterday. It puts us on a gloomy picture.But we have to ensure that life goes on. We have got toensure that we bring peace, stability, and the investors intothis country and put Sri Lanka on the world map. I am sureyou will take it in the proper perspective. Take it on.We have extended our support to His Excellency thePresident, Mahinda Rajapaksa. So, together we will ensurethat we bring in a better Sri Lanka. Extremists and chauvinistsforces can be set aside to bring back Sri Lanka onto the map.

I think you very much and would like you to, before toolong - if you are unable to do so - hand this country over tous. We will be able to take it forward for a better Sri Lanka.

( )(The Hon. Neomal Perera)I am happy to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion onthe Votes of the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, ConsumerAffairs and Marketing Development and also the Ministry ofCo-operatives and Co-operative Development.

Especially with regard to co-operatives, there is nothingto talk about. In the Puttlam District all the co-operatives arerunning at a loss, Hon. Miniter. So there is no point talkingabout it. There is no help or relief to the consumers who aresupposed to benefit from co-operatives.

Going by the functions gazetted under the Hon. JeyarajFernandopulles Ministry, there are many functions comingcoming under him. The most important is trade. In trade,even India our closest neighbour from whom we mainlybeneffit say that we have not taken adequkeate advantagefrom the trade agreements.

If you compare the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and today, as oftoday we have lost many markets and they have gained a lotof advantages from the trade agreements that we have signed.

If I am to especially mention about Vanaspathi oil, it hasbeen presently agreed to export 250 metric tonnes to India.But 90 per cent of the owners of Vanaspathi Plants in SriLanka are Indians. [Interruption.] Yes, Manjula is there. Heis a Sri Lankan but 100 per cent is Indian. If it is 100 per cent [Interruption.] So this is the plight of the Sri Lankan tradeand I hope that these trade agreement benefits are given tothe country. I mean, the total benefits should come to SriLanka and the Sri Lankans when there are free tradeagreements. Also, the Trade Agreement which we signed in2001 in the sense you signed, we negotiated was in

Thailand. Sri Lanka exported 8000 metric tonnes ofdesiccated coconut to India under that same Agreement whichwas signed in Thailand. Eight thousand metric tonnes wasexported in 2004. Thereafter with the change, and the FinanceMinister of India coming from South India, there was a lot oflobbying because coconuts are grown here and the factoriesare in South India. Hence, right now the amount exported hascome down to 500 metric tonnes and with a lot of red tape itis practically not possible to export even that 500 metrictonnes.

The coconut industry is an industry that belongs to the SriLankan people from which most of the people in Wayambaand the Coconut Triangle benefit and are dependent on it.Right now, the 50 per cent surcharge or the amount of moneythat had to be deposited for importing any item has beenapplied to coconut oil as well as palm oil. Palm oil is asubstitute for coconut oil and therefore it is an essential item.In day-to-day life everybody consumes coconut oil or palmoil or a mixture of both. By making it a non-essential itemyou are increasing the sale price in this country. Hon. Minister,such levies or taxes may be introduced by different Ministriesbut if there is no co-ordination among the Ministries, priceswill never come down in this country. The cost of living willnever come down!

If for instance you take poultry; in the Gampaha District,in the Puttalam District or in Wayamba and in the country asa whole we have about one million people depending onpoultry. Right now, there is no VAT rebate on poultry. Therehas been an introduction of VAT on poultry feed as well as onthe sale of eggs and sale of meat. Therefore the prices havegone up by about Rs. 32 as at today. So this is the plight ofthe Sri Lankan poultry farmer.

If you take anything else for that matter, everything hasgone up in price due to the mismanagement or non co-ordination of Ministries. Therefore the Dollar reserves in theCentral Bank has come down to as low as one month or maybe even less than that. Due to that the Dollar price isfluctuating. It is true enough that the exporter benefits butthe majority are consumers. How can the consumers benefit?Therefore I ask you to co-ordinate with the other ministries.Whether it be the coconut industry, fisheries or animalhusbandry, please co-ordinate with the other ministries andcome to a compromise so that the consumer is looked afterfirst before anything else and the manufacturer is also lookedafter subsequently.

Last month, on the 29th of October, VAT had gone up on1385 items including essential items which we consume day-to-day. But, subsequently in the Budget you reduced VAT oncertain items. We appreciate the reduction of VAT from theelectricity bills of manufacturers; things like that weappreciate. But, we want this to materialize so that everybodywill benefit from your management of the country; not onlya few people, not haphazardly or not by a request of oneperson or for one industry.

Then, also Transparency International has said that themost corrupt country in South-East Asia is Sri Lanka and it iscoming up in stages. That also is reported in the newspaperswhich is very bad. We ven the Indian Ministry of Trade, theysay in the of 1st October that Sri Lanka is nottaking the benefit of the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreementand is missing all opportunities.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) ?

( )(The Hon. Neomal Perera)Ministry of Trade, India. .[ ] They say that we are not taking advantage ofthe situation. It is true.

Also, Hon. Minister, the Financial Times of the DailyMirror newspaper of 25th November, says, I quote :

Lanka fast losing ground on hub status for trade.

So, that is a severe disadvantage and it is said by a group ofeconomists and experts in trade negotiations. Professor UpaliWickremesinghe, is one person who highlights that Sri Lankais losing the hub status of Asia for trade.

As far as the Central Bank is concerned, there are seriousallegations made on the Central Bank and it is said that theCentral Bank of Sri Lanka is currently surrounded withcontroversy over a scandal that has erupted over the suddenclosure of an investigation unit which was probing theactivities of GoldQuest. That is the position of the CentralBank and its Governor. The Governor is not handling thesituation at all and the GoldQuest purchases, John KeellsHoldings and the market picks up.

So, where is the transparency? There is no transparency intrade or in purchases of shares in the share market. So, this isthe present situation because there is too much of politicalinterference.

I also want to state that today the Puttalam District CricketAssociation is being nominated at Wennappuwa. There wasa high-handed act of one of the Deputy Ministers who broughtin the SSP Chilaw, Mr. Roshan Fernando his NationalIdentity card number is stated as 610700799X and hissignature is also here and taken the nomination paperswithout proper approval. he has got the Secretary of St.Xaviers Cricket Club, Nattandiya to take the applicationforms from the post office and gone and filled his name andthe names of two other persons and become one of the votersof the twenty persons who can vote to elect the PuttalamDistict Cricket Association. So, this is political interference

backed by politicians to bring a high-ranking police officer,the SSP of the Chilaw division, to vote. And, he had broughtthe OICs of seven police stations, vehicles and special squadsto prevent peoploe from coming and voting. I had to intervenein this matter and tell this to the Minister of PlantationIndustries, the Hon. Milroy Fernando. He had to spoken tothe SSP and told him not to interfere in the sports activities ofthe district as well as in the country. [Interruption.] Today,at 10.00 oclock at Hotel Madurabavana in Wennappuwa. Iwould like to table* this document sighed by the Hony.Secretary of the Puttalam District Cricket Association to beincluded in Hansard because this contains the signature ofthe SSP which he had illegally taken from the Secretary andgone in as a voter. He had sat next to the Hon. D. M.Dassanayake, Deputy Minister of Nation Building andDevelopment who must also be wanting to do a good job.But, this is how he uses the police officers to handle suchissues and sports activities in the District.

( )(The Chairman)Thank you, Hon. Member. Please, bring your speech to aconclusion.

( )(The Hon. Neomal Perera)Hon, Minister, I hope the next time you negotiate you willpay more attention to the Coconut Triangle which is in yourDistrict and which is important to the people who voted foryou. Please negotiate so that we will at least get back whateverSri Lanka had in 2004. Do not leave out the coconut industry.Do not take in Vanaspathi palm oil, because Vanaspathi is a100 per cent imported palm oil and is not manufactured inSri Lanka. I hope you will negotiate on this so that the industryas well as the consumer will benefit.

Thank you very much.
