HUMANITARIAN CRISIS TRIGGERED BY THEONGOING HOSTILITES

[. . 9.49]

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahamanir Raheem

Mr. Speaker, I move, That the humanitarian crisis triggered byhostilities in the Mutur, Serunuwara, Toppur areas of the TrincomaleeDistrict must be discussed by this House in order to facilitate the speedyresettlement of the civilians displaced.

Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, this entire issue of whoproposes the Motion today and the contents of which Motionis to be debated was taken up this mornig at the Party Leaders

Meeting you had summoned. I would like to read the originalMotion I submitted to you on Tuesday. That Motion readslike this : Callous disregard for human security by both theGovernment and the LTTE resulted in the ethnic cleansingof Muslims from Mutur.

Mr. Speaker, you will realize that there is a vast differencebetween these two Motions - the original Motion I submittedand the subsequent Motion which I amended in order toaccommodate the concerns expressed by all sides. Of course,the JVP was insisting on bringing up their Motion thismorning which was to praise the security forces. Here again,I must tell theHouse very clearly that the tone and tenor ofmy original Motion would be achoing in my speech thismorning though the caption of it is different as a request wasmade by all sides. If I am to explain it in Sinhala

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) , . [ ] . , . _ Humanitarian crisistriggered by hostilities must be discussed by this House inorder to facilitate the speedy resettlement of civiliansdisplaced. We are going to discuss that.

( )(Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero) .

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Everybody has to accept that. But then the JVP wanted todiscuss their Motion which, of course, was to praise thesecurity forces. I mean those of us who want to praise thesecurity forces, definitely must praise them. We can praisethem even when we discuss this Motion. We have to give allthe encouragement perhaps to the security forces for all whatthey have done. Loot at todays Daily Mirror newspaper.All news papers are talking about the Mavil-Aru sluice gatesbeing opened. , ; , . . . [ ]. . . , open .

At the same time lock at the ceasefire. Both parties aresaying. We are abiding by the ceasefire, observing theceasefire. This has become a joke and peoples security hasbeen compromised. None of us wanted this war. Those partiesand people have been inducding the Government to go intoa wasteful war. If we consider the money you have spent onall the bombs that have been sprayed all over TrincomaleeDistrict, and the artillery and mortar, I think, you can feed thefarmers who lost their crops as a result of this Mavil-AruAnicut being closed. Today our problem is how to get thedisplaced back to their hormes. Such large amount of moenyhave been wasted in killing poor civilians. Of course, theLTTE, scores of them too would have been killed. The LTTE

will not admit how many were killed. The Government willnot admit how many were killed. I am not here to say anythingto demoralize the armed forces. Of course, the armed forceshad to engage the LTTE is a difficult situation but then theevents leading up to this crisis must be looked atdispassionately. We are being emotional and sentimental. Itoo become emotional and sentimental. We are all humansbut today what have you achieved. Even I told HisExcellecny the President when we met him the day beforeyesterday that we are not at cross purpose with the Sri LankaFreedom Party or its position but the Sri Lanka FreedomParty and its leadership is being driven to take hasty andirrational decisions at a time when the whole country is facinga serious crisis. So, what we feel is that ultimately it is thepoor civilians of the Trincomalee District t hat suffer. I amnot talking only about the Muslims. Of course, thepreponderant majority are Muslims. Poor Sinhalese farmers,too have had enough of this war. I do not think any of themwant this war to continue I visited some of them in Kantale. Iwent to the Temple and saw them and learnt their sentimentstoo. Of course, they want the security forces to gain somevictory but at the sametime they want this entire thing tostop immediately. I was just listening to what was happeningin Israel yesterday. Up to now, none is Israel wanted theoffensive to stop but yesterday the Mayor of Haifa one of theNorthern towns in Israel, was desperately calling for the warto stop because Hezbollah attacks had come into Haifa andseveral had been killed. So, now he is asking for the war tobe stopped. Now, it is the same situation here. Does Israelthink that just because they had been pounding SouthernLebanon that Hezbollah can be totally eradicated? I thinkthere will be more and more people joining Hezbollahbecause of what they are doing. This is what is going tohappen here too. This is what we are warning but look atthe humanitarian crisis. Look at the chaos you havecreated and how you have finally compromised thesecurity of the civilian population. Everybody is sufferingnot only the Muslims and the Sinhalese. I am alsoconcerned about the Tamil civilians in TrincomaleeDistrict where scores of them are getting displaced. I amsure LTTE cannot cope with this humanitarian crisis. Butthe Government has a responsibility to feed everyone.Now, here we cannot look at whether it is Muslim,Sinhalese or Tamil but the Government as a responsiblegovernment has to behave responsibly. I am sureeverything is being done to alleviate the sufferings of allthe displaced but unfortunately, the Government doeshave to take some responisibility for what has happened,particularly, regarding the artillery and mortar attacks. Iam not prepared to change my position. I pleaded on thesecond morning when the LTTE went into Mutur. TheLTTE held Mutur only for 48 hours. On the 4th, they gotout of Mutur, but within that 48 hours our only plea to theGovernment, and all the Muslim political leaders, was tostop the artillery and mortar attacks on Mutur which wascreating fear, panic and desperation among the innocentcivilian population. Please stop this artillery and mortarattacks and resort to any other means of military offensive.

2006 10189190

Of course, they may have had difficulties because theywere in denial for 48 hours. This is a fact. They were sayingthat Mutur is not taken over by the LTTE and they were incontrol of all the important military installations.Kattaparichchan camp surely must have been still in thehands of the Government, but it was under siege. Nosoldiers were seen anywhere there. The police stationsapparently were deserted. Everybody knows that. EveryGovernment installation was in the hands of the LTTE.The LTTE perhaps started flying some of their flags evenin the Telecom Tower. This created a fear psychosis. TheLTTE cadres who were inside there, everybody says, weresmall in number. Their intention was perhaps not to stayfor too long. But they stayed there sufficiently enough tosee that the Muslims run away from Mutur. This is wherewe hold the LTTE responsible. Elilan, the Trincomaleepolitical leader of a LTTE, after they withdrew from Muturto the pre CFA positions, made a grand eloquent statement.What did they say? They said We launched a limitedoffensive to destroy Sri Lankan security forces camps andhaving achieved that objective our valiant forces havereturned to the pre February 22nd Ceasefire Agreementpositions, taking into consideration........ They added,.......... taking into consideration the serious humanitariancrisis that has been triggered in the whole of Trincomalee.A very grand eloquent statement, Mr. Speaker. But if wereally take that part of the statement, ........ taking intoconsideration the serious humanitarian crisis.......... Iwould say that they should have withdrawn from Mutur24 hours earlier before the civilians started fleeing Theywaited until the entire civilian population went out andthen they withdrew. If they had taken into considerationthe grave humanitarian crisis that had been triggered bythis offensive they should have withdrawn 24 hours earlier.Now they can never claim credit for having wihtdrawnbecause they had consideration for the serioushumanitarian crisis. They triggered this and made theGovernment to walk into a trap. This is what I have to sayas far as the Mavilar Are anicut affair is concerned. Theradical forces which pushed the Government into thathasty and irrational decision must take responsibility asmuch as the LTTE for the eviction of the poor civiliansfrom the entire Trincomalee District. I am talking aboutthe Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims. In this issuewe are all united today to somehow see that the innocentMutur population gets back to their original areas. Thereare very brave people still there. Then there are women,children and the elderly undergoing very severe hardshipsand serious psychological trauma. There are almost 6000people, together with the able-bodied men, still wantingto stay on because they want to give courage to theirbrothers and sisters who had run away because they hadno other way to save their lives because their politicalleaders could not help them.

There was an All Party Muslim Political Leadershipthat went to the Presidential Secretariat. We were assuredby the Joint Chief of Staff, the former Air Force

Commander, Donald Perera and Mr. Basil Rajapaksa thePresidential Advisor. They of course were in denial. Theysaid No. the shell and artillery attacks never originatedfrom the Naval Head Quarters area in Trincomalee, neverwas it from Plantain Point and never was it from MonkeyBridge. This was their position. But we maintained andwe still maintain that position because people keepsaying. it.

Even the day - before yesterday the President took greatpains to explain to us that it was not the work of theGovernment but the LTTE. But then as we say, Truth isthe first casualty in a war. Those who suffered theconsequences of it know what happened. They arespeaking out loudly and today, for them to get back, theywant this assurance, Never again will you resort toartillery and shell attacks.

Of course, the LTTE too may be responsible for a certainportion of the attacks into mutur, because they were keento capture the jetty. Mutur jetty is a strategic military point,which they wanted to take under their control. But in thiswhole episode, all sides have to take equal responsibility. Allsides are equally guilty for what happened to the civilianpopulation.

It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure thatmaximum security is now provided for them to get back.They are placing all types of conditions. I am not here to talkabout those conditions. But then, those conditions, naturally,will come from a population which has become desperateand destitute in a situation like that. How long can we live inKantalai? See the overcrowded camps. See what is happeningin Kantalai. Hearts of those who go there, start bleeding. Weare trying to do the maximum we could. But, nobody wantsthis war to continue in this fashion. It has to come to an end.

Then, in bringing it to an end, every party has to co-operate.I know the Government is in a very difficult situation. Thekind of leverage that some of the parties that have come on tothe Opposition are enjoying as far as the Government isconcerned when it comes to maintaining its majority in thisHouse makes the Government helpless, perhaps. But then,there are moderate forces all round. They have to take theiradvice too; they have to have the confidence of theinternational community. Today, I know, the mood is to totallyignore what everybody else says. We have an objective, letus achiever it, like how the LTTE said. Now this Mavil-Aruanicut has become a bone of contention for everyone. Theywant to claim that they are the people who went and openedit. That is why I said I also want to claim. Everybody mightthink, why should that I opened it. I not have some share? Iwould say, I went on a mission, a very risky mission, and didthis myself. Mr. Hansen Bauer also will say it tomorrowbecause he also went and negotiated. But then, some do notwant the Norweigians to negotiate; some do not want theICRC to be involved; some do not want anyone to comebetween before they achieve their objectives. What is going

191192

[ ]to be the objective? Once you have made Mutur a ghosttown, it is pointless for us whether you achieve the objectiveor not. Today, there are hundreds of villages. In the BatticoloaDistrict alone we have more than 30 villages from whereMuslims have been permanently displaced, from mid eightiesup to now.

( )(Mr. Speaker) . .

, [ . ] . , , ( ) Whereuon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair and MR. DEPUTYCHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. M.SATCHITHANANDAN] took the Chair.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) , + + + [ + +

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is important forus to also look at the other serious violation the LTTE hascommitted. The LTTE today, in my opinion, has to answerthe Muslims about what happened in Kiranthimunai, whathappened at the 64th Milepost, why they subjected theinnocent Muslim civilian population that was fleeing Muturwith their assurance that nothing would happen to them todeath. They forcibly diverted them at the 64th Mileposttowards Pallikudiyiruppu, into the LTTE held area. This,innocent population, thousands of them, was detained underthe scorching sun. Pregnant mothers, the elderly, the feeble,children, everybody was made to suffer. The able-bodiedmen were separated from women and children. They tiedsome of these peoples hands with the ropes they hadbrought. They had said that they wanted to question allthese people. The way in which the LTTE had behaved theregave a very clear indication to all those who were gatheredthat these people were going to be summarily executed, itis said by eyewitnesses. Most of these things, some mayclaim, are unconfirmed reports, but there are thousands and

thousands who have come to Kantalai and everyone isnarrating the same story. There has to be credibility to whatthey are saying. Up to now, thousands and thousand areclaiming that there are more than 60 bodies lying theKiranthimunai area.

We have asked the ICRC to look into this. The ICRC,for a variety of reasons, has politely declined to go in there.Government security forces have attempted to go to the areaand they have been prevented by LTTE fire from reachingthat point. So, those bodies have to be buried. That is theleast amount of dignity we can show to a human soul. Eventhat, the LTTE is not willing to do. They are trying to scorebrownie points here. They want to hand over with all thepomp, gallantry and pageantry 40 bodies of the soldiers,they say. The Government is denying that there were suchcasualties or such soldiers who have perished in this battle.Both sides are trying to score brownie points here. But, wecivilians, are demanding from both sides to immediatelybring a halt to this war, this senseless war. This benefits noone and this will only exacerbate things. The internationalcommunity is fast losing confidence in all sides. We hadhad some advantage with the European Unions ban on theLTTE. But then that advantage is fast disappearing becauseof our own actions. The Government needs to act with moreresolve, with more commitment. Well, just lipservice tothe Ceasefire Agreement would not do. Today we demandthat the Ceasefire Agreement needs to be amended in orderto include our grievances and human security issues. As aparty the SLMC has been demanding this for a very longtime. These things have happened during the UNP regime.More than a 100,000 people had been driven away by theLTTE in 1990. In October this year they will be celebratingthe 16th year of completion of having been ethnicallycleansed from the North. The LTTE has its hands soiled. Ithas to answer. Now, again in Mutur, I do not think the LTTEcan escape blame.

Today, The Island newspaper states of course, let mebring it up as a matter of Privilege tomorrow morningabout the way in which certain news papers try to aim atme when I speak the truth. Well, I cannot be expected towhitewash everything that everybody does. I had to speakup and when it is distasteful to the security forces top brassor to those forces which are pushing them into thisunfortunate war, I cannot help it. But let me say that I holdthe Government responsible for the safe return of Muslimsto Mutur. They have to do it as quickly as possible.

The LTTE cannot simply talk about having achievedtheir limited objectives and returning to their pre-CFApositions. They are responsible for what happened inMutur. We are also equally concerned about our innocentSinhalese and Tamil brethren in the Trincomalee District.I have to explain what happened and what the Sinhalesevillagers are talking about. There are a variety of accusationsthey bring about. They are neglected. Some of them aresaying that even the security forces have not had their

basic essentials supplied to them. It is not just the civilians,even the security forces are suffering. I am sure the LTTEcadres too are suffering. But to achieve what ? Theobjective has to be to somehow promote coexistence. Butcoexistence is going to be a distant dream if you are goingto go in this fashion.

We need to put our heads together. We have to sit downand talk. Negotion is the only way to solve this Problem.The sooner we return to the Negotiating table, the soonerthe people will feel and have confidence to return. If thiswar continues, I do not think you can instil that confidencein the people to return to the affected areas.

Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chairman ofCommittees.

[ . . . ], + +, - + , + , + ; + ,{ + + , , { + + + + + + , + , 45 { { , ,, + ! + { , + + , + + ; + Multi-barrel artillery attacks and shellbombing have really panicked the people in Mutur. there aremosques which have been destroyed; there are schools whichhave been destroyed; there are houses which have been de-stroyed and number of people have lost their lives. But, wedo not say that the LTTE is innocent. The LTTE wanted thisand it was well planned. The plan was to cleanse the Muslimsof that area. We were informed of this well ahead, about twomonths back. We never wanted to believe that. But, of course, after this attack, after this incident we have to believe that.

We interviewed the people in Mutur personally. We spentwhole of yesterday with the people of Mutur who aresuffering, who are suffering without basic facilities. I have totell you the fact that there were 19 meetings with the Hon.Ministers of this Government. But, nothing had been doneso far. It is the philanthropists, it is the NGOs that are helpingthem now. We also said, We do not want food. We do notwant the basic facilities from the Government. Please, providesecurity for these people. There are 3000- 4000 people stillliving in Mutur. the people want to go back to their places.

That is what they need. But, they are in panic. They want togo back to their places. Please, provide security. Forget aboutyour meetings. Every day, every Minister is having manymeetings, with those affected people. People have lost faithin them. They are getting enough food now. But, they aresuffering. They live in camps and have no basic facilities. So,the Government has to take serious action to providenecessary security for the people in Mutur. I feel sorry for theTamil people as well. The innocent Muslims and Tamils,both communities who have been living in peace and harmonyare being divided again. The Muslims have come to one sideof that area. I hear that Mutur has been separated as a result ofbridges and other roadways being cut off because of artilleryattacks. They are suffering. They are being trapped there. Wealso met the Sinhalese people yesterday in the temples. Theirsituation is also very pathetic. Therefore, the war has taken adifferent turn there are problems within communities andthere are problems among communities. Both sides want toachieve their objectives and goals and the innocent peopleare suffering as a result of that. The Muslim people in Mutur,when you listen to them, they have been pleading with theLTTE, We have not taken a drop of water. Please, let us gowith our husbands. Please, let us go with our brothers. Therehave been artillery attacks and they also say that it is notonly the Government side but they also suspect the LTTE.May be they have been inducing. Why should have theycome inside a Muslim village? You have the problem at Mavil-Aru. Why did they intrude into Muslim villages? You fightthe Army. That is a different thing. But, it was a plan to comeinside a Muslim village and also it is said that there wereanonymous calls given to the forces saying that the LTTEwas in this area. So, the artilleries were being directed towardsthose villages, they say.

This is the situation there. Political parities and Ministersgo there, have a meeting and give statements to newspaperssaying that within 10 day people will be resettled. How canyou resettle these people of the Ampara District, when thepeople who were displaced by the tsunami are still suffering?you go to Trincomalee and have a meeting and make astatement saying, We will resettle the 50,000 people inMutur within 10 days You say it like a champion. This is afunny statement. Can you resettle these people? They are intrauma and very disturbed. They are confused and they donot know what to do. You say that they will be resettledwithin 10 days! Take constructive action. I am pleading withthe Government and I and pleading with the Ministersresponsible. You should understand the ground realities there.Why did all these calamities take place? Why have thesehuman beings got killed unnecessarily? You should thingabout this. Please se that it does not take place in futureplease provide security. That is all we seek form you. We donot want food. We are not a community who beg and eat. Wedo not have a history of that nature. We do not want yourfood. We do not want your basic facilities. Let us go back toour places. As Sri Lankan citizens we are not demanding aseparate State. We are not asking anything from you. If youallow us to live where we are. we will be thankful to you. Butdo not use us-

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, your time is up.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)I have fifteen minutes, Sir.

This was should be stopped. Everybodys prayer is that.We must achieve permanent peace. But are we going in thatdirection in terms of this fifty-nine year old ethnic problem?This seemed to be going iowards a conclusion when theGovernment of the Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe signed theCFA on the 22nd of February, 2002. The same CFA is stillvalid. Now you find fault with this CFA. You promised thepeople saying you will tear it off. So many things would bechanged. You will send back the Norweygian facilitiors. Butnothing has taken place. People have been cheated. Peoplehave been betrayed. The innocent people are the ones whohave been suffering right throughout. Therefore, I would liketo humbly request the politicians, do not achieve yourpersonal objectives, through this.

These are human beings. See what is happening inLebanon. The UN has just been observing. No action hasbeen taken for the last one month. This is the fate of thehuman beings today. Likewise in Mutur innocent people,both Muslims and Tamils are suffering. I should make aspecial reference to this. I met some of those Tamils. They arealso suffering. So I would like to tell both the Governmentand the LTTE that war is not going to bring us any result. Wehave suffered enough. We have learnt enough lessons. Weknow that. When this Government was formed and when thePresident was elected we knew that this type of a situationwas going to arise.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, your time is up.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Therefore, we all must think about the future. You cannotwin a war. Nobody can win a war. It is only through a peacefulnegotiation that we can achieve something. But withextremist forces, can we do that? This is the question.

Thank you very much.

Report, Professional Military Education Assessment, Sri Lanka, 1 4September 2002

Executive Summary and Background.

As a result of meetings between President Bush and Prime MinisterWickremesinghe during July 2002, President Bush offered US assis-tance to Sri Lanka to assess various elements of its national security andeconomic establishments. The Department of Defense was tasked toassist the Sri Lankan military to assess a broad range of issues, includ-ing operations, doctrine, procurement and training and ProfessionalMilitary Education. The first DoD team conducted an assesstment ofthe Sri Lankan Professional Military Education system in early Sep-tember 2002.

The five person PME assessment team was led by Ambassador RobinRapheb. Senior Vice President of the National Defense University. Theteam visited all Sri Lankan PME institutions and held discussions withsenior military and civilian leadership.

The longer term issue for Sri Lankan PME is changing the systemfrom a parochial, service - centric one into a joint, interagency systemthat will foster cooperation and increase interplay among the wieldersof various elements of national power. Of prime importance to thislong term goal is engaging the civilian leadership in providing nationaldirection, strategy and objectives. In addition, the officer corps needsto accept the value of education as a supporting element of profession-alism and advancement potential. Various stages of PME need to be-come requirements for promotion. This will help to depoliticize theofficer corps.

Issue: Tricomallee Harbour Defenses

Discussion: The most important base for the SLN is without questionTrincomallee Harbour. Currently, the LTTE control the southern por-tion of the Harbour, From this area, the LTTE have effectively moni-tored all ship movement in and out of the Harbor, launch suicide andartillery attacks against the Naval Base and could potentially destroyany vessel coming in and out of the harbour. The SL Army is respon-sible for this area but they have been unable to completely secure it.

Recommendations:

a. The SL Defense force must secure this land area. The vulnerableposition that currently exists could essential level the majority of theSLN fleet. The result would be that the only re-supply capability for theJaffna Peninsula would have to come from Colombo, more than 4times the distance to Jaffna.

b. Currently there are designated areas for the LTTE and areas for theSL Defense forces. If the southrn tip of Trincomallee Harbour has notbe designated for the LTTE, it more than likely isnt then the SLgovernment should be massing police and military personnel in thisarea encase the hostilities resume.

c. Without control of this area the defense of Trincomallee Harbourwill always be a losing battle. Without Trincomallee Harbour the abilityto prosecute the war would be detrimentally affected.

Mawilaru crisisSLMM blamesGovernment* Heavy shelling continues till late night

The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission is holding the government totallyresponsible for the breakdown in the much needed negotiatedsettlement to the Mawilaru water crisis after the security forcesallegedly launched a fresh shell attack on rebel cadres near the anicutlast afternoon just before the LTTE was to open the water gates.

. .

The attack forced the LTTE to reconsider a decision to open theanicut taken earlier in the day following talks between LTTE politicalhead S.P. Thamilselvan and the visiting Norwegian special peace envoyJon Hanssen Bauer.

It was however interesting to note that Minister Rambukwella andthe government said last week it would cease the ongoing offensive inMawilaru if the LTTE agreed to re-open the anicut unconditionally, theSLMM spokesman said

Sir Lanka needs more foreign monitors-Rights group

More internation at monitors are needed in Sri Lanka, a U.S. rightsgroup said on Friday, after Denmark, Finland and Sweden withdrewfrom a truce observation mission, as the island nation slides back towardscivil war.

More than 800 people have been killed so far this year.

The fighting is the most intense and prolonged since a 2002 truceand diplomats and some military personnel say the civil war that begainin 1983 appears to have resumed in all but name.

With the dramatic increase in violence in Sri Lanka, moreinternational monitors are needed, not fewer, said Brad Adams, AsiaDirector at Human Rights Watch. The lives of countless civilians are atrisk at this critical time.

By withdrawing their monitors, Denmark, Finland and Sweden willdeal a devastating blow to the protection of civilians in Sri Lanka. saidAdams, Concerned governments must take urgent steps to get moreinternational monitors on the ground.

Thousands of civilians on Friday fled Sri Lankas eastern battle zoneby tractor and on foot, as shells fell during an artilery battle between theTigers and the Army, survivors said.

Human Rights Watch called for the creation of a strong and widelydeployed international human rights monitoring presence, withobservers based in Sri Lanks north and east, Colombo and other areasof heightened political violence.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am happy to follow the Hon. RisadBadhiutheen, Member of Parliament from the Vanni and aMinister in the present Government. I appreciate the tenor ofhis speech. I do very sincerely appreciate the feelings of myMuslim Colleagues in this House on behalf of the Muslimpeople. It is not a matter which can be neglected ; it is not amatter which can be overlooked. It is a matter about whichall of us have to very seriously think and make some veryclear decisions.

I will speak about this, Sir, as I go along, but at thecommencement of my speech, I will first deal with thequestion of the Mavil-Aru anicut which, I believe, was closedaround the 20th of July and the channel from this area feeds afair extent of paddy land cultivated by all communities : bythe Muslim, the Sinhala and the Tamil people.

2006 10225226

The Hon. K. Thurairetnasingam, Member of Parliamentfrom the Trincomalee District, who comes from the Muturarea and who knows that area very well, mentioned in theHouse when he spoke, Sir, two days ago that 65 per cent ofthe paddy land is cultivated by the Tamil-speaking peopleand 35 per cent by the Sinhala-speaking people. Therefore,Sir, It cannot be said that the closure of this anicut was intendedto punish any one community.

This irrigation system has existed for several decades. Nosuch thing happened in the past. Even at times when therewas a war situation in the country, such a thing did nottake place. Why now ? The talk of ethnic cleansing of theSinhala people from this area, in my view, is nothing butunwanted, unnecessary crap. This is the talk, Sir, of self-appointed saviours attempting to promote themselvespolitically.

Sir, insofar as land and water are concerned, the Tamil-speaking people in the Eastboth the Tamil people and theMuslim peopleand even the Tamilspeaking people in theNorth have very many complaints to make. My Muslim friendsof the Ampara District will acknowledge, Likewise myMuslim friends of the Batticaloa and the Trincomalee Districtswill acknowledge that insofar as land and water are concerned,they have several problems under the Gal-oya Scheme, theKantalai Scheme, the Allai Scheme and under the PadaviyaScheme where the majority community, by virtue of theirbeing the ruling classthose who wield power and have powerin their hands are subjecting the Tamilspeaking people,both the Tamils and the Muslims, to much deprivation anddenial.

Speaking about this matter, Sir, to drive home this point,may I refer to a statement made by Mr. Dudley Senanayake,former Minister of Agriculture and Prime Minister of thiscountry, a much respected political leader, in regard to theKantalai Tank. The statement made by Mr. DudleySenanayake was published in the Sunday Sun newspaperof 8th June, 1969. He referred to the Kantalai Tank in thecourse of his statement. This is what he said, I quote:

When the augmentation of the Kantalai tank was taken up in early50s an undertaking was given to the Purana field owners who were theonly land owners enjoying the limited irrigation facilities of theereservoir at that time, that the first 55,000 acre feet of water would bereserved for the Purana field owners for their Yala cultivation.

When the colonists were selected they were told quite clearly thatwhile they could have a full Maha, the Yala cultivation would dependupon the availability of water in the tank.

The Purana paddy field owners under the Kantalai Tankwere the Tamils and the Muslims; the Muslims fromMullipothanai and Kantalai and the Tamils primarily fromThampalagamam and also Mullipothanai. What is theposition now? During the kodai cultivation, that is the Yalacultivation, this agreement is not implemented. This

agreement is totally ignored and with the assistance ofGovernment agencies, water is primarily taken by thecolonists. I am mentioning this, Sir, because I want everyoneto realize that land and water has been a problem insofar asthe Tamil-speaking people, both the Tamils and the Muslims,in the North and the East.

What was the LTTEs position in regard to the anicut? I amnot trying for a moment, Sir, to justify the LTTEs position,but the LTTEs position needs to be understood, in mysubmission, in the proper perspective. After the aanicut wasclosed, the LTTE itself has been involved in various steps toopen the anicut which in my view is an implicit admission ofthe fact that the closure of the anicut was not justifiable. Ifthat be so, why did the LTTE do it? There was an urgent needfor water in their own area. The people were undergoingimmense difficulty as a result of a lack of water in their ownarea, in the LTTE-controlled area, which is beyond theGovernment - controlled territory. Under an ADB scheme,that territory was also to benefit under the new water supplyscheme. That decision had been taken but unfortunately whenthe water schemes were to be implemented and were taken upfor implementation recently, that particular scheme meantfor the uncleared territory had been taken away, taken out ofthe implementation programme. This, according to the LTTEwas the work of the new Governor for the North-East and thenew Government Agent for Trincomalee, both of whom areretired military officials. I have nothing personal against thesegentlemen, Sir, and I do not want to be seen as some one whois all the time finding fault with them. I have got along wellwith several former governors and several former governmentagents. We had Mr. Tyronne Fernando as the last Governor.We had Major-General Asoka Jayawardena as Governor beforethat. Then we had Mr. Leelananda as the last GovernmentAgent and Mr. Rodrigo as the Government Agent before that,and if anyone was to talk to them, they would say that Mr.Sampanthan is a very easy person to get on with. Butunfortunately, Sir, the manner of the posting and the time ofthe positing of these two persons to the position of governorand government agent has been a matter of grave concern tothe Tamil-speaking people in the North-East and in theTrincomalee District in particular and the LTTE was naturallyunhappy that a programme that had been agreed upon andwhich was a dire need in their areas had been removed fromthe items of work that were going to be implemented. Afterall, Sir, injustice cannot be repeated ad infinitum. It muststop at some point of time. You cannot expect the LTTE toreact in the same way the Tamil moderates will react. I thinkone should have realized that by now. The LTTE certainlywould not react in the way that I would react. A message hadto be conveyed to all concerned that the denial of the waterscheme to the LTTE controlled area where tens of thousandsof people live is unacceptable and the way of conveying thatmessage was to close the sluice gates. But the LTTE havingclosed the gates shortly thereafter was willing to open thegates. In fact, they did their best to open the gates. Butunfortunately things went awry. I would now like to refer to

[ . ]how things went awry, Sir. I refer to a news report that appearedin the Daily Mirror of Friday, 28th July, 2006. This is whatthe news report states, I quote:

Ven. Neelapola There who was among the protestors charged that theLTTE leadership was ready to open the anicut but had changed its mindon the insistence of Mr. Elian.

Then using his own words, Sir, the newspaper goes on tostate, I quote:

Elilan had decided not to open the anicut after the Air Force bombedsome of the areas on Wednesday night.

Quite apparently, Sir, as a result of the intervention of localleaders and after discussion amongst the local population,there had been an agreement on the part of the LTTE that thesluice gates will be opened but unfortunately there was thisbombing on Wednesday night which resulted in that planbecoming non-implementable. The Hon. Rajitha Senaratne,Sir, in the course of his speech referred to that. He referred tosome people who went marching. He referred to how Major-General Nanda Mallawaarachchi had to go and interveneand how an assurance was given that the gates will some howbe opened to pacify the marchers. I think, Sir, if they hadbeen allowed to go, after a short distance they would havecome back or if they had gone through the full distance theLTTE may have taken them to their own areas and shownthem the difficulties that the people there were undergoing.Sir, that was the first way in which the possibility of thesesluice gates being opened was thwarted by unnecessaryintervention. This was a local, social and developmental issue.It was the advent of forces who wanted to politicize the issuefor their political gain that resulted in that initial move beingthwarted. Sir, one must understand that it is the abuse of themilitary prowess of the Sri Lankan State, that has been thecause of the Tamil - speaking people, both Tamils andMuslims, being denied their legitimate rights. Sir, in thisinstance, this initial act of aerial bombing was the culprit andthe cause of the anicut not being opened as early as probablythe 27th of July.

Then we move on, Sir, to the next stage when the LTTEwas still prepared to negotiate and settle this matter. Mr.Thorfinnur Omarsson the spokesman of the SLMM hasmade a statement which was published in the Daily Mirrornewspaper of Tuesday, 1st, August, 2006. This is what itstates, I quote :

The air force bombed rebel positions in Trincomalee on Fridayat the same time the SLMM head Ulf Henrikson was at a meetingwith the LTTE and villagers of the area to resolve the conflict.

The monitors hit out at the air force for the bombing saying itwas a foolish move as the security of the SLMM head and hisdelegation present at the meeting with the LTTE was thrown intojeopardy.

Sir, here is the SLMM sitting and talking to the LTTEand to the local villagers to resolve this problem and thenthe air force goes and bombs them, drops bombs in close

proximity to the venue of the meeting. Consequently themeeting had to be abandoned and the possibility of theanicut being opened was thereby lost or thwarted.

This position that I just referred to, Sir, has been furthercorroborated by a news item appearing in The SundayLeader newspaper of 6th August, 2006 where they havereproduced a part of an interview given by the Head of theSLMM to Reuters and I quote that particular part of theinterview:

We sat for talking and got clearance from the government andtried to convince the LTTE to have confidence in the government.They bomb in the vicinity. Thats not the right signal.

Sir, the SLMM Head goes there meets the LTTE and isengaged in a meeting to have some faith in the Governmentand that things will be done, and a bomb is dropped andthe meeting is thwarted.

Attempts to resolve this conflict, Sir, continuednevertheless, and shortly thereafter Mr. Jon Hanssen Bauer,the special envoy of the Norwegians arrived in Sri Lankaand he went to Kilinochchi. There was an agreement arrivedat in Kilinochchi which was that the water was to be releasedimmediately and for whatever else that had to be fulfilled,there was a duration of three or four weeks that had beenagreed upon. But the main issue was the question of thewater and there was an agreement that the water can bereleased immediately. The SLMM Chief the Political Headof the LTTE and some people from that area, consequentto this decision, went to release the water. What happenedto them when they went there. Sir, on Sunday, the 6th ofAugust to release the water as per the agreement arrived atin Kilinochchi between the Norways special envoy and theLTTEs Political Head? It is reported, Sir in the DailyMirror newspaper of 7th August, 2006 on the front pageand it states, I quote:

The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission is holding the governmenttotally responsible for the breakdown in the much needed negotiatedsettlement to the Mawilaru water crisis sfter the security forces allegedlylaunched a fresh shall attack on rebel cadres near the anicut lastafternoon just before the LTTE was to open the water gates. Theattack forced the LTTE to reconsider decision to open the anicuttaken earlier in the day following talks between LTTE political headS.P. Thamilselven and the visiting Norwegian special peace envoyJon Hanssen Bauer.

SLMM spokesman Thorfinnur Omarsson charged it was clear thegovernment had other agendas in mind but stressed that it was notthe end of the road as negotiations for a settlement were stillcontinuing.

It goes on to state, Sir, and I quote:

Following the LTTE agreement to open the anicut gates onhumanitarian grounds the SLMM head Ulf Henrikson decided tomonitor it by personally travelling to the site and escaped the militaryshelling by a whisker.

You will see, Sir, that even that agreement arrived at inKilinochchi could not be implemented though the SLMMHead went there with the LTTE Political Head and other

2006 10229230

persons from the area with the objective of opening thegates and letting the water on the 6th of August. But thatcould not be done because there was shelling and bombingand the SLMM Head managed to escape as the report says,by a whisker. Sir, this is what is said by independentpersons. That is what is said by Venerable Neelapola Thero.This is what is said by the SLMM. This is not what is beingsaid by me. This is not what is being said by the LTTE.What is the inference that one can draw from this situation,from the independent testimony forthcoming from avenerable monk, a Buddhist monk living in that area, nota monk who went from Colombo to Trincomalee, but a monkliving in that area and the SLMM spokesman monitoringthe situation in the North-Eastern part of this country?

Who prevented the sluice gates being opened on severaloccasions when an attempt was made to do so? Is it not clear,Sir, that it was this unwarranted aerial bombardment, a deci-sion which had been thrust upon the Government by somepersons trying to show their muscle in that area? They werenot persons from that area, but persons who went to that areafrom outside trying to show their muscle in that area whichcompelled the Government to resort to aerial bombardment.

I am told that even today as we are debating this issue inParliament, areas in the Trincomalee and Batticaloa Districts,and the North of the Batticaloa District abutting theTrincomaleee District are being bombed and shelled evenright now. According to the reports that we have, about 45civilians have been killed in Vakarai. Is it not abundantlyclear, Sir, that there is an agenda for these military attacks;the aerial bombardment and the heavy artillery shelling thatwent beyond the supplying of water to the farmers?

The gates have now been opened and. I am told that wateris flowing in abundance. But, Sir, the point to remember isthat what could have happened twelve days ago as per thetestimony of Venerable Neelapola Thero or ten days ago asper the statement of the SLMM spokesman, has been delayedand only now the water is flowing. Sir you do not open asluice gate by bombing from the air or by firing artilleryshells. I am told that there are claims and counter claimsbeing made as to who opened the anicut gates. GeneralWeerawansa in the morning said that - [Interruption] - healso claim that they opened the gate. Hon. GeneralWeerawansa says so. But I do not think so Sir I think, thosegates must have been opened with someones hands; not bybombs or by artillery shelling and if that is the position Sir -[Interruption] I think, some young LTTE cadre on theinstructions of his superiors must have quietly gone thereand opened that gate. That is something Sir, which shouldhave happened really 10 days ago without all this bombing.Now we cannot stop at, Sir, merely saying that the water isflowing and that everything is hunky-dory, and thateverything is all right. When the bombing and the shelling iscontinuing what is the agenda, what is the overall objectiveof this agenda? Is it the scrapping of the Cease-fire Agreement,the dispensation of the Norwegian facilitation and the

commencement of a total war? Is that the objective of thisagenda? While paying lip service to peace, is a differentagenda not being relentlessly pursued? That is the questionI want to ask. Not by an open declaration right now, somewhatcovertly now, on the pretext of opening the sluice gate, if thebombing and the shelling is even continuing after the waterhas started flowing, then I do not think the Government canconceal things very much longer. It is quite clear that theGovernment had an agenda which goes completely beyondthe mere opening of the sluice gate. Sir, however the gate wasopened, even if one was to think that the Government openedit, which I do not believe, I can only say, Sir, this is what wewould normally call, a pyrrhic victory. The word pyrrhic isderived from the name Pyrrhus. There was an Emperor calledPyrrhus who fought a war expending a lot of his resources.He won the war. When the war was over he said to himself,One more war like this and I am finished. I want to ask theGovernment, you govern a poor country and that there are anumber of people who are experiencing numerous difficulties.Today there are tens of thousands of people in the MuturDivisional Secretaies Division, in the EchchilampattaiDivision, in Vakarai and in the Kathiraveli Division who arestarving. Can all this money that is being spent on arms,armaments and ammunition not be used for providing reliefto those people and providing those people with some of theessential needs in regard to their requirements? No, theGovernment is not concerned about those objectives. TheGovernment is concerned about establishing its militarysupremacy. Sir, that is becoming increasingly clear by thehour.

Sir, now the Government has a very interesting phraseolgyfor these military activities. They say that they are carryingon limited military operations at identified military targets.That is correct, Sir, that they had some identified militarytargets. The target could have been Mavil-Aru assuming thatthey could open the gate by bombing and shelling. But theaerial bombing and the artillery shelling of the armed forceshas happened in various places. It happened in Karadiyanaruin the Batticaloa District. A number of persons were killedthere. It happened in Vakarai and Kathiraveli in Batticaloa. Ithappened all over Echchilampattai and Sampur and it evenhappened in Mullaitivu. If you are bombing Mullaitivu youmight say you have got a reason to bomb Mullaitivu. Youmight say, We are bombing Mullaitivu for a particularreason. So, far Sir, indiscriminate shelling in Mutur East andEchchilampattai divisions have earlier resulted in 16 personsbeing killed. In Uppural, Nallur and Cheenaveli a few daysago, on the 7th of August 15 persons were killed and over 20persons injured were taken to the Batticaloa Hospital.Yesterday five persons have been killed at Werugal as a resultof bombing and shelling. These areas have been flattenedand people are living under trees. The houses have beendestroyed. All buildings have been destroyed. Infrastructurehas been destroyed. No relief is being sent to these areas.

I have been in touch with the ICRC Head in Colomboon a daily basis over the past several days. They have gotthings ready both at the Trincomalee end and at the

231232

Batticaloa end. They are prepared to take the things. Butthey say, We cannot move due to artillery shelling andbombing. Until both sides agree to stop this, we cannot takethe food. We cannot take the relief material. A large numberof persons are leaving the Trincomalee District and movinginto Batticaloa. According to the information I got thismorning, tens of thousands of Tamils from the North ofTrincomalee have moved into Batticaloa.

Sir, we would like the diplomatic community and themedia, both domestic and international, to be taken to theseareas and for them to see for themselves what has happenedto the people and to these areas. They can see the immensedevastation and destruction that have been caused to allinfrastructure in these areas. We would like the diplomaticcommunity to go and see it and the media to see it.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Order, please! Your time is over. You have got 40 minutes.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

No, Sir, I will take the balance time also.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)You started at 12.33.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Sir, we have got the half an hour lunch time also and it isbeing divided amongst some of us. Fifteen minutes for usand fifteen minutes for SLMC. Whatever the time is, I willgo on, Sir. At what time did I start, Sir?

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)At 12.33 p.m.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I will carry on, Sir, and I will finish my speech. I wastalking about these military operations that are going onin these areas. This is why, Sir it would appear the LTTEdecided that if the Government can carry out limitedmilitary operations on identified military targets, they wouldalso move into Government controlled territories. That wasthe reason why they came in. The LTTE in fast informedthe heads of the mosques well in advance of their moving

[ . ]in. They informed Muslim persons living close to Armycamps that they were going to move in in a short while.They gave adequate notice to the religious heads of theMuslim people and to people living close to camps. Thatis how they moved in.

I must state this point, Sir, that when the LTTE movedinto Mutur, there were no casualties. The LTTE ensured thatas a result of their movement into Mutur and the way theymoved into Mutur, there were no casualties to the Muslimpeople. They moved in such a way that they attacked thecamps, they attacked the police stations, but, they did notattack the civilian population. Then, Sir, later on theGovernment retaliated. The Government fired into the MuturTown were the LTTE was present all over. Ten persons werekilled in the Arabic College at Mutur and 12 persons werekilled in the Al-Nooriya Maha Vidyalayam. In all 79 personswere injured. Sixty-nine injured persons were broutht toTrincomalee. I sent my people to meet those injured personsand ask them how they got injured. The answer was thatthere was shelling from Government controlled areas intoMutur. Because the LTTE was in Mutur. It was thisindiscriminate shelling by the Government forces fromGoverment controlled areas that resulted in our being killedand our being injured. That was the answer of the people.The Government acted in callous disregard for the safetyof the civilians. This is what they normally do in regard toTamil Civilians. But in this instance, it so happened thatthe civilians were Muslims.

I will read, Sir, the interview given by the SLMC Leader,the Hon. Rauff Hakeem to the media, a short paragraph inTamil.

{ 27 , {

The English translation is, Sir, that our people wereinjured. The Mutur Muslim people have very clearly toldus that it was shells that were aimed from Governmentcontrolled territory that caused these deaths and theseinjuries. So, that is the position. This is our ownindependent information, Sir, in regard to what happened.-[Interruption.]

[Interruption.] Sir, there was a statement made by someMuslim Members in the course of the debate in Parliamentabout a particular incident that happened in an area calledKiranthimunai. We do not have, Sir, any definite informationin regard to what happened in Kiranthimunai. We will waitfor the confirmed reports. But, if what the Hon. MuslimMember mentioned in Parliament is correct, I want to saythat that is clearly unacceptable. I want to make it very clear.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Sampanthan, your time is up.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I am winding up Sir. I want to very clearly say, Sir, that itwhat was mentioned by the Hon. Members aboutKirantimunai is correct, if there are confirmed reports inregard to that matter, I want to state that it is thoroughlyunacceptable. Sir, over 40,000 Muslims have been displacedfrom Mutur. Likewise, an equal number of persons havebeen displaced from LTTE controlled territory in the

Trincomalee District and those people are moving intovarious areas. They have lost their houses. I think thosepeople need to be looked after. Relief needs to beimmediately sent. 17 young Tamils working with an NGO,Action contre la faim have been massacred and killed inMutur after the armed forces went into Mutur once again.That is a matter that I will refer to in the course of theEmergency Debate tomorrow.

Likewise, Sir, there is much suffering among the peopleliving in those areas, both the Muslims and the Tamils, theMuslims in particular. We want the Muslims to be lookedafter. We also want the Tamil people to be looked after. Inboth the Government controlled areas and in the LTTEcontrolled areas there are citizens, there are our people. Weneed to look after them and we want to request theGovernment, urge the Government to take all steps to ensurethat humanitarian agencies like the ICRC and other nongovernment organizations can go into those areas andprovide the people with necessary relief.

I thank you, Sir.
