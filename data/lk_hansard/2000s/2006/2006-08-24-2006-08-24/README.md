( )(The Deputy Speaker) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me thisopportunity to speak, not only as a Member of Parliament,but also as a Chartered Accountant.

I though it is my bounden duty, first of all, to pay a glowingtribute to the outgoing Auditor-General, Mr. Mayadunne, aperson who is unshakable ; a person who takes matters intohis heart and a person who lives on his own means, as a resultof which no political pressure could have been brought onhim. I pay a glowing tribute to him once again for being achartered accountant, for being a public servant, who hasdone a tremendous job under most trying conditions andcoming out with a report we have never seen in this augustAssembly. I stand here not just to talk of the audit report thathas been submitted, but also to talk of the prevailing situationand the economic trials that we are facing today.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, as you know, the Report of theAudiltor-General on Special Project Audit on theManagement of Government Tax Revenue in terms of Article154(6) of the Constitution of the Democratic SocialistRepublic of Sri Lanka is the matter that is undr consideration.The reason why this has basically been taken up in Parliamenttoday is that the Auditor-Generals terms of office has ended; he retired a couple of days ago. He and his predecessorshave been continuously pointing out the deficiencies thatare there in the system. I must say that this type of report inany other Parliament, even in a banana republic, would havehad the attention of all the Cabinet Ministers and them sittingand listening to what is going on. Unfortunately today we

889890

[ ]only see the amiable Hon. Dew Gunasekara, who is listeninghere as a solitary member in that almost defunct Cabinet.These are matters of a serious nature. Any other Oppositionwould have called for a Motion of No-Confidence not onlyon the Government, but also on the officials who have broughtthe Government into disrepute.

Sir, this does not stop only at the Auditor-GeneralsDepartment. Today, there is a crying need for independencein the areas of the Attorney-Generals Department, the SupremeCourt and the Judiciary and the Constitutional Council.Today, we are talking of a country that does not have aConstitutional Council in place. Then, we talk ofindependence and democracy in this country, Sir.

If you look at the annals of history of the Auditor - GeneralsDepartment, you would see that it has always been a charteredaccountant who has been heading it. It has to be headed by achartered accountant, just as you cannot put a doctor in aplace where an engineer is required or a nurse in a placewhere a fashion designer is required or an accountant in arole that he is not used to. But, this is specifically anaccounting role and that is why this esteemed, prestigiousposition has always been held by a chartered accountant ofrepute. Before Mr. Mayadunne, it was Mr. S.M. Sabry whoheld this position. Mr. Sabry did his best. Prior to Mr. Sabry,Mr. W.G. Epa was the Auditor General. Prior to Mr. Epa, it wasMr. G.M. Wijesuriya who held this position. Then prior tohim, Mr. D.N. Sentinayake was the Auditor - General. Prior tohim, there was Mr. B.L.W. Fernando. Mr. D.S. de Silva precededhim and Mr. L.A. Weerasinghe was the first Auditor - Generaland also the first President of the Institute of CharteredAccountants of Sri Lanka.

Today, there is somewhat an attempt to appoint somebodywho is not in the profession to perform this very valuableduty. Sir, if you take the court, it is understandable andcustomary for a lawyer to represent clients and the interestsof the State. So, when you take an accounting firm, it isthe same. If you take a company, financial area invariablyis given to an accountant. So, Sir, what is the necessitytoday - there is politicization taking place - to appoint aperson who is not an accountant or to bring in a politicalappointee into the Auditor - Generals Department?According to the Report that has been submitted - I, verymeticulously, went through it - this did not stem, I mustsay, from the goings - on of one or two years or oneGovernment, but over a passage of time. So, the only thingwe can do, if we are unable to find a substitute, which I donot think so, is to recall Mr. Mayadunne back again untilsuch time that we can find a competent and honourablegentleman.

Going in further, look at the areas that are mentioned inthe Report of the Auditor General on Special Project Auditon the Management of Government Tax Revenue.

Sir, as I mentioned before, in countries like New Zealandit is enshrined in their Constitution that financial disciplineis the hallmark of their move forward, their thrust forward

or their development as of today. It was just 30 days agothat a Cabinet Minister of theirs was reprimanded formaking a statement that came out of a Cabinet meeting,and as a result the citizens in New Zealand were able totake undue advantage through insider dealing and theCabinet Minister was forced to resign. It was just a statementwhich was attributed to insider dealing.

Sir, here in this country you have today many other thingsthat are going on in a reckless manner. Sometimes accidentlyand sometimes calculated statements are made. Likewise,actions of certain officials are as bad as casting certainremarks.

Going on that basis, today we have to look at this Auditor- Generals Report keeping in mind that this is the maininstitution that is supposed to look at the collection ofrevenue in this country.

Sir, look at the Government revenue. Almost 91 per centof it for this year was anticipated through the taxationprocess. In the past, almost 88 per cent was budgetedthrough the taxation process. But have we achieved it, isthe question.

Mr. Mayadunne and his efficient team amidst manyproblems have been working and been able to collateinformation and prepare this report. Today, the revenue thatcomes in, whether it is from the Ceylon Electricity Board,the Railway Authority or the Ports Authority - I think, itwas nicely and aptly remarked by the then Finance Minister,Dr. Sarath Amunugama as the biggest monsters who aregobbling the economy of this country - have got to belooked at in a completely different way. The Members ofthis august Assembly who have been co - opted into theCOPE, in the last couple of days have been most strenuouslyscrutinizing the working of the institutions coming underits purview. The Ceylon Electricity Board has beensummoned again before the COPE today. But, prior findingshave shown that the financial stability of this institution isin grave jeopardy. This is once again because of the mafiathat is there in the system that does not sometimes allowthe politicians to do their work. It is a general myth in theworld that politicians are the cause of ruination of thiscountry. They think and they also paint the picture in sucha way to show that the politicians are the robbers, the roguesof this country. It is just a handful, a percentage of officialswho ruin the very existence of a nation. There are peoplewho can stand the strain of this. I am a victim of certainanarchic political parties who criticize people who work. . On the samebasis they tried to make allegations against the running ofthe CWE and today the muck has fallen into the PA andthem. They are coming to us and apologizing. They are evenwithdrawing statements that they uttered in carelessness andwithout knowing the true facts. Today what has happenedto the CWE? Dr. Sarath Amunugama paid a glowing tributeto the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe

2006 24891892

5 PL 001453 (2006/09)

and I, for having the courage of conviction to go ahead andstop the erosion of revenue that was in the CWE. Today, ithas proven right. They are saying today that a difficult jobfor the Government has been reduced owing to the correctmanagement decisions that we took then. But the politicalprice we had to pay temporarily is not something that iseasy to bear. We were able to do so because we had cleanhands.

Sir, now coming back to this Audit Report, it very clearlystates that the inefficiency, the cohlluiveness and thepremeditated actions of certain officials are ruining the entirepublic service. This is what one public servant is saying inhis Final Report. Sir, this is a Report consisting of 200 pages.I think it is my bounden duty to give some information oncertain points therein, to the best of my ability, so that thisAugust Assembly may be able to take corrective and remedialsteps to ensure that this type of heinous crime is nevercommitted again in the future. So we have got to worktogether. This is not an institution that basically says, this isthe problem of X, Y or Z. We all, together have got to set asidepolitical differences because if we lose the economic war, wehave lost all wars. This Government is pursuing an ambitiousprogramme of trying to solve certain dexterous problems inthe way they deem fit. They take one step forward and getpushed three steps backwards putting this country intodanger. But, we as a responsible Opposition have beengoverning this country for a long time knowing the gravesituation that is there. We hold the Government responsiblefor every action that they take. But we are silent on themilitary action that is taking place at this particular moment.Why we say so is that we do not want to place the lives ofthose valiant soldiers and the policemen who are safeguardingthe sovereignty, the unitary character of this country injeopardy. But this Government that has decided to take thecountry to war must be held responsible for every singleaction and be accountable for, in the not too distant future. Itis the maniac political parties such as the JVP and the JathikaHela Urumaya that is taking this country into an unknowndestination on a voyage of discovery and I hope that pursuitis correct because otherwise this country would be dead andgone. I pray and hope that this country sees reality andeverything works out well so that we can live as proud SriLankans. But, Sir, while these wars are going on, we mustensure that every single student is protected in this country,every single school is protected in this country and thereligious institutions the temples, the churches, the kovils,the mosques - are protected in the process. There is mayhemthese days and for that we hold the Government responsible.

Sir, coming back to this Audit Report, we have theobservations made on the entire Executive Summary that isgiven here. Sir, I will start with page number one of the Reportof the Auditor General on Special Project Audit on theManagement of Government Tax Revenue which I wouldread out.

It states, I quote :

According to test checks carried out during the course of audit itwas observed that the annual loss of the Government Tax Revenue isextraordinarily large. According to audit test checks the computablevalue of the loss of Government Tax Revenue and the failure to collectin accordance with the legal provisions during the last few yearsamounts to about Rs. 389 billion....

Sir, Rs. 389 billion is almost 88 per cent of the revenue ofthe Budget of the year 2006.

...While the amount that cannot be computed is extremely large.

So, what is basically mentioned in this Report is what iscomputed, what they physically have been able to do. Imaginethe amount that has not been computed. If Rs. 389 billion iswhat is basically computed. I dread to think what has notbeen computed and which is a contingent liability, Sir.

It further states, I quote:

The audit coverage is very much limited due to limitations of timeand resources and as such the possibility of the prevalence of largescale irregularities and weaknesses in the wider areas which were notcovered in audit cannot be ruled out.

Sir, he is qualifying it for the simple reason that he knowsthat he cannot do it basically with a budget that has beengiven to the Auditor-Generals Department with a capitalexpenditure of Rs. 320 million. He has been called upon tolook at the entire countrys revenue, whether it is in properorder, to give a statement whether to the best of his knowledgethe accounts present a true and fair picture. That is what hehas been called upon to do.

On that particular basis, I am saying this, Sir, in this augustAssembly which is absolutely empty today. I wonder as towhy we are wasting our time in trying to speak to an emptyHouse. But at least Hansard will carry that there were Membersof the United Natioanl Party who spoke at a time when crimes,grave crimes are being committed in this country, to aGovernment that is inept, unable to expalin as to what isgoing on or able to bring in any remedial action. Whetherthey do it or not is their responsibility.

Sir, going on further this particular amount of Rs. 389 billionis what he states. Normally, people of this country elect theGvoernment. The Government is held responsible throughthe Cabinet and the Cabinet ensures that their directives arecarried out by the chief accounting officers in the Government.According to the number of Cabinet Ministers, the ministriesare allocated and each of those secretaries to the ministriesare held respobsible to the chief of them who is the Secretary,Ministery of Finance. Now, this is a direct report given to theSecretary of the Ministry of Finance.

, ., Where upon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair and THEHON. MANO WIJEYERATNE took the Chair.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you, Sir. When you sit in that Chair, you remind meof your legendary father and the service that he rendered tothis Parliament. I am sure with that compliment that I paidyou, at least I will be given another ten or fifteen minutesmore to speak at this very important moment.-[Interruption.]Yes, Sir.

I am basically saying at this particular moment that thiscountry is faced with a militaristic or war situation. As I saidbefore, if we lose the economic war, we have lost all wars andthis will affect not only the PA, not only the chaotic JVP orthe Jathinka Hela Urumaya but all of us. Therefore, at leastthe right-thinking people must be able to give a right answer.And that, Hon. Dew Gunasekera, you should becommunicating to your Colleagues who are absent today. Itis a crying shame that they are not here to listen to and debateon what is going on. If you feel that this Report for which theAuditor Generals Department has put in a lot of labour is notworthy of consideration, you are only paying absolutedisrespect to the will and the wants of the people. As I saidbefore, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance is basicallythe chief financial officer to all other secretaries. Today, thisReport that is addressed to him needs certain clarifications,needs certain accountability and needs certain future actions.

If we allow this to just go by, people of this country willhave their own laws put in place like in the judicial system.Today the underworld lords, the mafias or the godfathers are

a law unto themselves. You basically have certain areas thatare totally outisde the control of the wirt of the Government.So, do not let us lose control over the revenue of this countryalso.

Sir, I will take certain points from the Executive Sumarryof the Report of the Auditor-General on Special Project Auditon the Management of Government Tax Revenue.

In page three it states, I quote :

Even though the Tax Revenue represents about 90 per cent of theoverall Government Revenue, a sound and efficient managment hadnot been maintained for the management of the Tax Revenue.

This is a serious statement. They are saying that this countryhas not had a proper revenue collection process. There is noproper system put in place. Today, bluechip companies oreven a company that is selling beetle leaves has basicaccounting responsibilities and certain formats to be followed.There are ISO standards that tare being adhered to bycompanies. In certain countries ISO standards are a must. Butif this country does not even have the management of taxrevenue properly maintained, what future have we got, Sir?

The Executive Summary of the Report further states,I quote:

Even though the contribution of the Value Added Tax representedabout 42 per cent of the Government Tax Revenue, its management isreplete with serious dificiencies.

That means, out of the entire 90 per cent of the Governmentrevenue, which comes in from taxes, almost 42 per cent comesin from Value Added Taxes. Prior to the Value Added Tax, wehad BTT and GST and it goes on and on. This is the first timethat you have an input - output tax. These were theprofessionals and these were the people who wanted this tobe brought in for the simple reason that they thought thatthis system is more desirable, more affordable and morerevenue oriented to the country. We all agreed so.

Out of the 230 nations in this world, we have at least about50 per cent relying on indirect taxation. The GST or theValue Added Tax service is what is prevalent. So, Sir, if this iswhat is going on in this country, why are we wasting ourmoney in paying the Government ? If it is going to the handsof some unscrupulous people, then, what is the remedialaction that has got to be taken ?

It was not too long ago that the Chandrika BandaranaikeKumaratunga administration tried to victimize the UnitedNational Party people, including myself. Owing to the graceof the God above and owing to certain actions that werebasically taken, today we are free, because we knew thatthere was nothing going on. But what has been done to thepeople who were actually doing this ? There was a lot ofnoise about this VAT scam. Why has it gone under the carpettoday ? Is it just because the names of two, three Ministers ofthe Peoples Alliance Government have got highighted ?

2006 24895896

It is just because one JVP MP - I do not want to name him- hasgot highlighted for taking telephones ? These things havebeen suppressed. Is this the necessity at this particular moment? We have got to ensure that we bring these out. We have gotto bring them to light.

Sir, going on further, the Report states, I quote :

The co-ordination of the flow of informaton and confirmationswhich should be in operation among the major Government institutionsdealing in matters relating to the Tax Revenue had been at an extremelyweak level.

The inter-division co-ordination within the Government institutionsresponsible for the management of the Tax Revenue had also not beenmaintained adequately.

The institutions dealing with the Tax Revenue had not maintained anadequate tax management co-ordination with their supervisoryinstitutions that is, the General Treasury and the Ministry of Finance.

Sir, at every stage in this 200-page Report, the Ministry ofFinance comes in at absolutely important levels.

You cannot expect the President of this country to knowwhat is going on. That is not his job. That is not expectedfrom him. People elect a person not only for his credentialsbut as a political figure. As a result you have the system thatcarries it through and that is where the administrative structurecomes in. This is a serious indictment on the administrativestructure. If the so called accounting officer - not in theMinistry, but in overall ministries - who is the FinanceSecretary, is being questioned, I do not know with whatauthority he is able to function now ? There is a battle goingon between the Secretary and the then auditorgeneral, butthat is to no avail. When this type of information is broughtto light, there is the necessity to look at it afresh. For almosttwelve years it has been under the dictatorship of one or twomafia boses in the Ministry of Finance. There are a lot ofprofessionals in that place. Their voices have been stifled.Their initiatives have been crippled for the simple reasonthat one or two people who think they know everything havebeen ruining this economy.

Today public debt stands almost at Rs. 2,450 billion. Outof that 65 to 68 percent is foreign debt. With the Rupeecrashing day in and day out, we are leading into a furtherdeath trap. If this is the way the countrys revenue is beinglooked at, is being collected and is being accounted for, thenSir, I think we are in serious difficulty.

The Leader of the House is here. I am happy at least he hascome in. I hope he has been listening to what we were saying.He is a responsible senior Minister aspiring to reach evengreater heights, looking at major changes that could takeplace and the smile on his face may be that he is moving fromhis seat to the next seat unseating another person. Butremember, before you get into that seat, solve the problems inyour present seat. Look at this. This is a serious indictmenton your Government, Sir. As I said this is totally devoid of

politics. You and I together must ensure that these recketeersdo not use the names of politicians. You, I, or anybody whoworks, gets tagged corrupt people. Some are corrupt ofcourse. We show no mercy on them. But innocent people likeus have to go through this type of accusations because ofthese racketeers who are in the system.

The Auditor-General and his team have said that the checksand balances have been flagrantly violated. They havementioned certain politicians and I will mention them bytheir ministry. They say that if we do not put this in order, thiscountry will have no future. Owing to lack of time, I will readout certain extracts from the Executive Summary of theAuditor-Generals Report. It states at page 3, I quote ;

Even though the sphere of tax forms the major source of revenuewhich forms the basis of the budget proposals of the Government, amethodology for estimating the Tax Revenue at an adquately reliablelevel is not being used.

The reliability of statistics published as the Government Tax Revenueand Exports are uncertain to a considerable extent.

I hope the same situation is not prevalent in the CentralBank. They say that there is a growth rate of 8.1 percent. TheLeader of the House, the Hon. Dew Gunasekera and the DeputyChairman of Committees are present here. Do we feel a 8.1percent growth rate in this country? ? . . A growthrate of 8.1 percent has not permeated down to the people. Ifthis is the type of problem the Auditor-General is referring to,I hope the Central Bank Report is not a massage to the egosone or two persons. Please ensure that this is corrected. Today,the country is being looked at as a failed state. There aremulitilateral agencies lending money to this country and ifthey find out that there is a careful manipulating process,even the Hon. (Dr.) Mervin Silva will not be able to salvagethe economic crisis. His simle and his amiability keeps atleast certain ministries running. When he comes down theaisle, we wonder whether he is going to occupy the seat nextto the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva.-[Interruption.]

Sir, this type of thing is no laughing matter. We have got toensure, and it is bestowed on us as reponsible citizens toachieve the expectations of the people of this country. Lookat the reliability of the statistics published. If they are notcorrect, multilateral agencies will stop lending to this country.God forbid!

I further quote:

The risk of uncertainty over the future economic plans exists due tothe inability to utilize accurate data as a basis for planning.

Questionble responses made instead of taking the immediate stepsnecessary to be taken even after serious lapses are brought to the noticeof the institutions concerned by audit, pose problems.

The JBIC and the ADB have stopped lending money to theCEB because of the non-implementation of certain reformsthat were expected in the CEB. The non-implementation of

897898

[ ]those reforms has led to the acts of the JBIC and the ADB.They have said, We are sorry, we cannot give money to thisinstitution that seems to have a bottomless pit. That is theactual situation of the CEB. When this type of reports go in,it only makes a bad case worse for this Government which istottering today. Her Excellency Chandrika KumaratungasGovernment lived by the day and this Government is livingby the hour. Even Members of political parties in theGovernment, which is heterogeneous, is fighting and puttingthe very existence of this Government in jeopardy.

Sir, the Auditor-Generals report also stresses the importanceof tax revenue. I quote:

The Tax Revenue represented about 84 per cent of the overallGovernment Revenue during the years 2002 and 2003 while it hadbeen estimated at about 90 per cent in respect of the years 2004 and2005.

But are we able to ask with authority whether this is thecase?

Sir, page 10 of the Report gives, Arrears of Revenue.Now remember Sir, under the year 2003 and the year 2004,they are taking two areas and showing that in the year 2004there has been Rs. 95 billion outstanding as arrears and in theyear 2003 there has been Rs. 67.2 billion outstanding; adifference of Rs. 27 billion. This is as per the anticipated orexpected return in the budget. So they are comparing thiswith the budget and saying that these revenues have notcome in. So on that particular basis there are certain revenuesthat even as at 15th May 2006 has not gone in to those years.They are reporting on year 2003 and year 2004 and we arenow in year 2006, today being August 23rd. So the revenuethat should have gone into year 2003 and 2004 have notgone in. So I do not understand as to how this country canafford to go on.

The Hon. Leader of the House, your budget for this year asI said is almost Rs. 524 billion. The Rs. 389 billion that thiswonderful team with their ability and their limited resourceshas been able to find is almost 85 per cent of your budget.You can have another budget if you collect this money. Whereare those maniacs of this House, the Janatha VimukthiPeramuna who said that during the United National Partyregime that there was a tax amnesty to the tune of Rs. 222billion?

? , . [ ] ,. . . . . Rs. 222 billion ? . ? , , .

That is there in this report. As at 15th May, 2006 if therevenue that should have gone into year 2003 and 2004have not gone in where on earth are we heading? Please

ensure that this report is tabled at the next Cabinet Meetingand is discussed for a day or two or a week until you are ableto take remedial steps. There is no point in trying to politicizeissues if you cannot find an answer. We will call upon thepeople of this country not to pay taxes if it is not going to theGovernment but to a bunch of roues who were then robbingbanks and now going to army camps and giving inflammatorystatements.

Getting back to the Auditor-Generals Report, I am adkingyou what is being done with this? On this particular area,arrears of Value Added Tax increase over a particular periodis almost 623 per cent, Sir. You are basically coming on tothe areas of what is going on. I most respectfully request,Sir, please ensure in this august Assembly that we have morecredibility in this country. People look at politicians asrogues. We must ensure that this is changed. I callupon themedia to please ensure that they name the rider and not thehorse. They must ensure as to who the guys who are ridingon these horses that are leading the country astray. Since1994, owing to a hijacking of this political agenda bycertain extremist forces, today the main two parties are beingisolated. They are being hijacked. They are beingundermined by certain pepole who are sucking the goodblodd of this country. So on that particular basis, the Auditor-Generals Report basically shows exactly what we aresaying.

2006 24899900

In page 13 of the Report of the Auditor-General on SpecialProject Audit on the Management of Government TaxRevenue, under Arrears of Value Added Tax, they areshowing that in the year 2003, the VAT collected isRs. 97,753.8 million. In the year 2004, the VAT collectedas of end of the year is Rs. 117,030.9 million. As at 31stDecember 2005, it has gone up to 141,877.9 million. Butit shows that in the process, arrears of Value Added Tax asat 31st March, 2006 had increased by a further sum ofRs. 17.9 million totalling to Rs. 288.9 billion, Sir.

So haw on earth can we afford to go forward? The primaryreason for the increase in arrears of taxes had been due tothe large scale fraudulent VAT refunds made by theDepartment of Inland Revenue without proper investigationand negligence and the failure to recover such refunds. Sir,do you think you can get a VAT refund with politiciansinterfering? It is in the hands of the public officials, publicservants. Do not taint the 99 per cent of people who areworking very tirelessly in very trying circumstances. It isone per cent of those people who are ruining the entirepublic service and that one per cent are the ones who areruining the political image of this country. That is why Iam so passionately stating today that we need to rectifythis. We need to take remedial action, Sir.

Look at the Rs. 220 billion tax amnesty they were talkingof. Where is this? This is shown in this particular Reportunder Reliability of Data. They say that in the manipulatingprocess, the files are kept open. Officers have gone andcollected revenues and they temporarily close the files andput it as outstanding when effectively the monies of theGovernment have gone into individual pockets. This is why,Sir, there was so much of resistance to changes in this system.As you know in any place when there are changes, there isresistance and if it changes for the collective good, nobodyshould stop that. Knowing this particular thing, having hadexperience, we tried to bring in our professional knowledgethrough professional institutions. But there were placardcarrying people tried to stop that. They tried to make thePorts Authority almost inactive, they made the CustomsDepartment inactive and they made the banks inactive whenwe tried to stop these types of robberies. This is a heinouscrime. Hon. Ministers, we are speaking most passionately -not for the simple reason of a green telling a blue - forget thecolour, if we want to have rapid development. we need revenueand we need resources. The resources come not from you orme, it comes from the people, and these people are basicallyliving in most inhuman conditions sometimes sometimes.Look at the North - East. Look at the Tamil and Muslimbrethren who are suffering owing to the war. Look at theother people who are outside those areas, whether they beSinhala, Tamil, Muslim or Burgher, all of them suffercollectively today owing to certain wrong decisions that arebeing made. These decisions were made owing to calculatedor premeditated actions by certain public servants and that iswhat gets highlighted through this Audit Report, Sir. I go onto page 26 which basically shows the discrepancies between

the data of the Performance Report of the Department of InlandRevenue and the data of the Department of Fiscal Policy. TheDepartment of Fiscal Policy takes decisions on behalf of thecountry whether it is on inflation or whether it is on exchangepolicies. Those are the matters that keep the economy turningand churning and if they are unable to have correctinformation at their fingertips how on earth can you expectthe Cabinet to make decisions?

Hon. Minister, you are in the Cabinet now. We were in theCabinet then. May be before too long we will be comingback to the Cabinet. On that basis we have to still go on withour system where we have to get information from oursubordinates, our juniors and our public servants whobasically give us information. But if they give information,as per page 26 of the Auditor Generals Report which wecannot rely on anymore, will we be making the correctdecisions? Is that the reason why when you impose certainincreases in one area that it has a ramification on some othersector which is totally unknown? Page 26 of the Report states,I quote:

A reconciliation carried out in respect of years 2003 and 2004revealed discrepancies totalling Rs. 50.8 million in respect of the year2003 and discrepancies totalling Rs. 3,445.6 million in respect of theyear 2004.

So that is how it basically goes on.

Sir, the name of Kuthubdeen comes up very, very often inthis particular area. I just happened to be browsing throughthe newspapers. On the 14th of June 2006 The Islandnewspaper carried an article under the heading Rs. 3.57billion VAT Scam - Im not involved, says HamzaKuthubdeen. He also says that if ever he has got to giveinformation, that he will reveal who the Cabinet Ministers ofthis Government who have put them into trouble. I am notquoting anybody, I am only quoting, Hamza Kuthubdeen.He has further said to the papers about the Dry Port and whatthe Minister told them to do and how to do and how to pay. Isthis the reason why the VAT Scam is being pushed under thecarpet? He has been saying that he gave telephones to certainMembers of Parliament. This type of Cardboardwansas arethe ones who are ruining the economy.

He is says this in the open. Why is it not being looked at?If Rs. 25,000 is taken by an innocent clerk he is remandedwithout bail. When Rs. 3.57 billion is outstanding over theVAT scam why is this Government silent? That is whyAmerasinghe who is a Member of the Janatha VimukthiPeramuna, basically said what was going on after he resigned.I have a lot of respect for him, I am happy that at least he hasgone to His Excellency the President, the Hon. MahindaRajapaksa and is supporting him in trying to correct theunions in this country. At least he has taken the right decisionin going from a wrong party to a right party. But what he saysis something we must take note of. We must all get togetherand look at what is going on. You must as a Cabinet ensure6 PL 001453 (2006/09)

[ ]that action is taken on every single matter that is spelt out init. I am taking this report as the truth and nothing but thetruth because I rely on the professionals who produced it.But if by chance there is a wrong assumption that is therethen you have got to take action against the people whohave put that in. But this has been vetted through by a teamof professionals. I know the former Auditr-General is not aperson who puts pen to paper irresponsibly. So, Sir, all thatwe can basically say is please ensure that the countrysrevenue is properly managed.

Sir, in page 28, ther is the Detailed Audit Observationsrevealed through Audit Test Checks I will not read all theitems under that. I will *table this entire Report and requestthat whatever pages I have specifically mentioned, not to bekept in the Library, but to be included in HANSARD. I see mygood Friend, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle coming intothe Chamber. He is a person who works and because of thathe gets hammered. At least the three of them should take upthis Audit Report that has been submitted to Parliament todayat the next Cabinet Meeting. So as I said for the sake ofsaving time, Sir, whatever I have quoted from page 28 to 30,should be included in HANSARD**. I hope that is okaybecause I do not want to waste valuable time of this augustAssembly.

Sir, further it is in this same way that revenues are beingroded and it is in the same way that reckless statements arebeing made by political parties. I mentioned as to what theJVP said. I will now mention what the Jathika Hela Urumayais saying. Sir, an article under the heading, JHU calls forabrogation of agreement. appeared in The Sunday LeaderNewspaper of the 22nd of July, 2006. It refers to a NorwegianCompany, NOPEC obtaining exclusive rights to gatherseismic data. The reason why I am saying this is to point outthe ulterior motive in that statement. There was an agreemententered into with a company called TGS - NOPEC for the oilsurveys to be done in this country. It was mentioned that theagreement was signed on the 13th of February, 2002. But,frankly Sir, this particular agreement was signed on the 21stof May 2001 by the then Minister of Power and Energy, theHon. Anuruddha Ratwatte, the then President and the thenSecretary. But it tried to make out that this was done ninedays before the Ceasefire Agreement was signed. So thesetype of heinous crimes have to be stopped. The Hon. Membersof this august Assembly must not misguided. Certain reportsstated as if this transaction had taken place during the tenureof the United National Party.

(+ )(The Presiding Member) , There areno eternal friends and eternal enemies in politics .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)My dear Sir, always he was a good Friend. Unfortunately,one particular day he miscalculated and misjudged ourhonesty and he realized it before too long. It was he who hadto correct it. We never had a difference. [Interruption]. Thatwas the difference. Because he was misguided by some peoplewho put him into difficulty. That was the only problem.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)That is what he was trying to say.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)That is right, Sir. That is also not in the Auditor-GeneralsReport. But I am saying that it is for the collective good ofthe future. You have got to ensure [Interruption]. There is amaniac who has come from Gampaha to create problems forthe Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandoupulle. He is a person who shouldbe catching fish rather than coming and talking here. Healways creates him problems. What I am saying is that youhave got to have professionals, people who can work, in thisHouse. That is what the Auditor-General also says. There aresquare pegs in round holes.

Going on further the Auditor-General says, I quote page45:

4.5 Test Checks on the Value Added Tax (VAT) Fraud Committedby the Overstatement of Export Income by 275 million - Rs. 104.8Million.

905906

[ ]Going on this particular basis, Sir, I come to page 62. Item4:8 of page 62 states that there was a test check on the refundof the Value Added Tax. It is a test check, Sir. He mentions itvery cautiously that owing to lack of resources, owing tolack of staff, they were able to trace only Rs. 3.6 billion. ThisRs. 3.6 billion traced, is on 235 claques that were paid out. Iam asking on this particular basis, where in this investigation?Why is it stopped? Why can it not be carried forward? Why isKuthubdeen saying something? Just because you havepolitical influence it does not help you to cover up certainthings. You politically victimize all the Opposition Memberssaying they are the regues when the rogues are in theGovernment. So you must bring them out, Sir. And we areasking this Cardboard Waansa why are they not shouting? ? . . .

, . Going further on this audit report,Sir, what is the remedial action that has been taken fromthe day this was reported? The Auditor - General says thathe had reported this VAT scam in june in the year 2004.From June, 2004 to April or May, 2005, why was it nothighlighted? That is something which you as a Cabinet haveto question. Is that the reason why the Members like theDeputy Minister Arjuna Ranatunga resigned? Because heknew that the situation is rotten there. There has to be adisplay of professionalism. Is it not being displayed. Whereprofessionals need to be put in, they are not being put in.That is what the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga has been saying.Cricket should be in the hands of the cricketers. Can therebe a more correct statement? Likewise the post of the Auditor- General, should it not be among the auditors or theaccountants? I stand here as the only accountant in thisHouse. Not for the sake of the -

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

Do you say that the administration of cricket should behanded over to Thilanga Sumathipala?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

To Arjuna Ranatunga - [Interruption]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

I am asking you, should the administration of cricket behanded over to Thilanga Sumathipala?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

If you say. I said Arjuna Ranatunga is a cricketer -(Interruption). Is he a cricketer? I say a cricketer shouldhandle cricket affairs - (Interruption). Ah. That is the reason- (Interruption). I am the one who said Arjuna Ranatunga -(Interruption)

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)I though you are supporting Thilanga Sumathipala.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, do not try to drive a wedges between us.If the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga can get the strength of alland do it, well and good. Mr. Thilanga Sumathipala hasthe wheal and deal for cricket. I am sure the Hon. ArjunaRanatunga, if appointed, will do well. But you have got toput the right person in the right place. Mr. ThilangaSumathipala has enough skills. I am sure, the Hon. ArjunaRanatunga accepts that. They were good friends before. Weall were friends before. But what I am saying is, you havegot to put the right person in the right place. Make use ofthe enthusiasm and zeal of Mr. Thilanga Sumathipa anddevelop cricket. That is the difference. You put us intorequired places, then we will do it. (interruption)

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

He can go for betting.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

He might be able to make betting another revenue sourcefor the dwindling economy of this Government. Yourrevenues are dwindling. Owing to that correct position, youmight be able to collect revenue. Do not laugh. They arebasically in their chosen field and they are also bringingrevenue to this country. Do not just discount them on thatparticular basis. Do you not associate them? Do you nottake their revenue? Do not laugh at them?

I am saying, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga has the ability.He brought fame to this country. He may be my politicalopponent. But that is a different matter. He has the ability.Put the people into correct places. You put the right personin the right place and you will see how it works. That isthe difference Hon. Minister. I hope, that goes into thosethick skulls and you will be able to say that this is the waythat Governments must be run.

You look at the Auditor Generals Report, Sir. I am referringto page 156 in this 200 page Report. It basically says -

2006 24907908

(+ )(The Presiding Member)

You got five minutes more.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am referring to pages from 156 to 191. There, it saysthat the Government revenue in certain institutions havebeen eroded owing to certain political interference. But thatis not the case. It is also the responsibility of the officialswho are handling that. There is no point in blaming theMinisters and say that is the reason. He may be part of theproblem. But ensure that we basically get the correct one.The officials are basically putting the Minister into troubleand say, All the politicians are rogues. That is the biggestproblem. That is the thing that I always try to highlightbecause I have been a victim. Thank God and the people.Today the media is giving the right picture and is able tocorrect the wrong pictures that have been given by certainpolitical anarchic parties. Their only method is characterassassination. All these Ministers basically get hammeredby the media for the simple reason that they are working?Guys who do not work are not here. They are not able tolisten to what is being told. Guys who do not work are nothere. They are not able to listen to what is being told.

Sir, you look at page 191, Summary of Audit Findings.This is something very very important. I will only read thefirst little and leave it you to decide that this be includedin HANSARD, not to be placed in the Library. It is a wasteof time. People read HANSARDs and they do not come tothe Library to see what is going on.

The audit test checks of the Department of Inland Revenue, SriLanka Customs, Department of Motor Traffic and the Department ofImports and Exports Control carried out in addition to the audit relatingto VAT carried out in relation to the Department of Inland Revenuerevealed a large number of serious deficiencies and shortcomingsconnected with the overall Management of the Government Revenue.The structural weaknesses of the institutions, neglect of duty by thehigher management, weaknesses relating to the internal controls,weaknesses prevailing in the systems and controls as well as theconceptual problems relating to the State Audit are brought to lightthrough this report.

That is why they are highlighting things.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)

Whatever you want to table in the House to go into Hansard,if you are taking full responsibility for that, you couldtable it.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you very much, Sir, I take the full responsibility forthe simple reaosn that I am not quoting from anything else,but from the Auditor Genrals Report/ I am tabling* pagesfrom 191 to 193 in the House today if it has not been donebefore.

I want to refer to a very particular area of the Report. Iquote :

The collection of Revenue or other Government dues for whichAccounting Officers are responsible is closely watched and examinedby the Ministry.

The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, in furnishing furtherexplanations, has stated that he believes the determination of Rs. 389billion as a loss to Government revenue is erroneous and would createa wrong opinion on the Tax Administration, about those institutionsand the overall State Tax Management.

Sir, that is a clear case of acceptance of defeat and astatement from defeat. All that has got to be done is, if it ismentioned there, ensure that they check and come back andsay, this is wrong for this reason rather than cast aspersions.The Report that is trying to correct this is being whacked. AsI said, name the rider, not the horse. That is the problem.Today they are trying to kill innocent people who are tryingto bring the truth to the public domain. We are able to get thisinformation because there are a lot of assistance that havegone into this. So on that particular basis, with no malice oranything like that, all what we have got to ask is, what hasthe Secretary to the Ministry of Finance been doing? Wehave been asking this question day in and day out. Yesterday,our Deputy Leader, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya mentioned inthis august Assembly that monies are being borrowed todayat LIBOR plus 1.34 per cent. Then, capital is being borrowedfrom other multilateral and lending institutions at almostfive or six per cent. How on earth can this country afford itSir? Development work has to go on. Money is required.Owing to that fact you borrow. When you can borrow at oneper cent or one and a half per cent you borrow at six per cent.Who is responsible for this? We are telling this Governmentto pelase open their eyes before this country goes into adeathtrap.

In the Consultative Committee on Finance we have beenrepeatedly mentioning this. The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane,the Hon. Kabir Hashim, our leader the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and I, have beenwarning the Government. Do not lead us into a deathtrap. Donot take us into an era where we cannot afford to pay ourloans back. Sir, today the situation is such that this countrythrough debt service payments has to pay Rs. 300 billion asinterest payment. When both are put together it is, Rs. 454billion. How on earth can you afford to pay this? HonMinister, these are not figures that are coming from the skies.There are payments that have to be made before the end ofthis year.

[ ]Are you going to increase the price of petrol again? TheHon. Fowzie says that he is going to increase it by Rs. 7.00The COPE probed into the working of the PetroleumCorporation and a serious corrouption was highlighted. Thereare five or six mafias that are running that scene. I am tabling*a COPE document titled Ceylon Petroleum CorporationThrift Society Ltd. (CPCTS). Rs. 562 million has beentransferred to this account without any Board approval. Juston one persons decision, Rs. 562 million has been transferredto that account. That Rs. 562 has to be paid by the consumers.You and I not only pay Rs. 35 a litre as taxes but we pay forthis type of- inefficiency and corruption just to support 2,447workers who are there in the institution Is this what is expected? I table this for the sake of public probity. In the same wayhow can you afford to pay Rs. 45 billion as capitalamortization and interest payments ?

No, today look at the countrys situation ? Our chiefnegotiator who is basically negotiating from all ends onwards, is basically unable to bring in any peacewith the LTTE owing to problems created by his own partypeople who are supporting the Janatha Vimukthi Peramunaand the Hela Urumaya. Today the country is at war. Whoshould be held responsible ? 2005 17 , . , . 64 , , . , ? . Now, look Sir, there is aGazette notification dated 25th July 2006.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Hon. Member, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Give me just another ten more minutes, Sir. There is Gazettenotification Number 1455/15 to take over the Baur Building.Baur Building which is a monumental structure is to be takenover by the Government owing to security reasons and so on.These are matters that we cannot debate because security ofnot only His Excellency the President but also of any personis absolutely essential. But have we got to pay Rs. 4 billionto take this over. These are State funds, I table* this documentfor purposes of clarity.

Sir, the next matter is innocent people of Colombo andKotte are being given some forms titled ResidentsInformation documents supposed to be form the police asking

* . Produced at end of speech.

the people to fill in and hand over those documents back tothe police. I table* this document just for purposes of clarity,Sir. In page four of this Residents Information documentthey are asking for information such as ethnicity, religion,and so on. What relationship has this document got to thepresent war ? The war is going on there. If it is being won andevery LTTEer is being killed, then is it the ghosts of theLTTE who are figting against the Government forces today. Imake no further statement except only to say, the Governmentis held responsible for the situation that is prevailing. Everyinnocent student must be protected. As I said earlier, templesand schools must be protected. Do not say at every moment abomb explodes that it is due to the United National Partyspeace process. 2005 17 , . . . . . , . , ? , . . . . , ? , ? Central Bank . - - , ? ? , , , . .

Today the chief financial officer, who is in charge of thefinances of all the Ministries, should be held fullyresponsible. I guess the Cabinet has to ask him to takeresponsibility. You appointed the former Chairman of PERC.The then Minister of Finance and Planning, the Hon. (Dr.)Sarath Amunugama, and the then President, Mrs. ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga, appointed Mr. Nihal SriAmeresekere as the Chairman of PERC. That formerChairman is saying that, during his tenure of office, theresponse he got from the Ministry of Finance and Plannningwas atrocious. It only corroborates the evidence that hasbeen given by the Auditor-General and Mr. Ameresekere callsupon the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planningto resign. I table*, in order to save time, the letter dated24th August 2006, which has been copied to my leader, theHon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, as the Leader of theOpposition. I table this letter to be included in Hansard. hesums up the entire matter in this letter and calls upon theSecretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning to resign.

* .{ Placed in the Library .

He only says that during his tenure of office the support hegot from the Mumstry of Finance and Planning was nopbetter only confirms what is in the audit report. I also tabledthat, Sir.

Look at the Prima Company. The revenue that wascoming in was stopped. who was the Secretary to theMinistry then? look at Telecom, Lanka Indian Oil Companyand LMS. LMS is another scandal where eight acres of landhas been transfered to a company without consideration.Does the Cabinet know about this? LMS was privatized andsold to John Keels Company in the year 2003 and on the5th of February 2005, eight acres in the Port was transferredto the same company without consideration. This wassomithing which we, in the COPE, found out. Today weare shocked as to what is going on. The same thing happenedwith regard to the land in Battaramulla. When wementioned it, they thought we were trying to createproblems. Today only, they know the actual situation. Wementioned about the cars; nobody took notice then. Wementioned about Telecom, which was undersold; wementioned about the rackets going on in the Port and asked,What is going on in this country?

Yesterday, the Secretary to the Ministry of Pertoleum andPetroleum Resources Development appeared before theCOPE and said that his work cannot go on because SEMA isinterfering directly through the Ministry and the Chairmanof the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said, Yes, I am sayinghere that SEMA gives one instruction and PERC gives anotherinstruction. I am saying with responsibility that the Secretarysaid it with utter disgust and he wanted the COPE to give hima direction as to how he could take that institution forward.Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Ministers, please look into that.

You have the All Party Conference and talk rubbish. Youwant our support and you are talking with maniacs who donot want peace in this country. They want to see it in pieces., . . . 1971 , 1988-89 . . , , . . , . . . , . , . . .

All I could basically say, Sir, is that this particular auditreport is most timely. This countrys economy is in dire straits.We are going from peace to pieces. The very few investors wehave in this country are moving out. You and I, Sir, are fondof our country. I know that the Hon. Prime Minister, theHon.Ministers, the Hon. Leader of the House, the Hon. DewGunasekara and all of us, the Hon. Members of the UnitedNational Party, have one common interest: that is, the SriLankans.

Before we are too late and cry for Sri Lanka, all we have todo is to work together; think together; act together; kick outthe maniacs who are there and get the focal element - thepeace process - into the correct path. I do not say that everyaspect of the peace process is perfect. If we can basicallyeradicate terrorism by war, well and good, do it. But, what hasbeen done? Over 25 years, all parties have been doing thesame thing and it has been a miserable failure. On thatparticular basis, the only thing you have to do is to thinkstrategically and move forward.

In order to do anything, first you have got to have money.Here is the Report of the Auditor-General, which states thatwe do not have money. We had money, but it has gong to thewrong people. So, you have to correct it. Find the culprits,but do not let those Government servants put the blame onthe politicians. Today, Sir, you and I, all of us, sometime feelshy to be politicians, because people look at us with a squinteye and think, All of them have ill-gotten gains. Only a fewof them know that we waste our money to be in this publicservice owing to the fact that we cherish dong it. We feel thatwe can do a better job, if we are given the opportunity. .

I want to ask why the Hon. Minister of Tourism, the Hon.Anura Bandaranaike, sent this letter? Is he seeing what theHon. Arjuna Ranatunga saw? Is he saying that this country isgoing in the wrong way? I table* the Hon. AnuraBandaranaikes letter-this has no relevance to the matter beingdebated, but it has relevance to the connotations that arethere and the ramifications that could follow if the wrongsteps are taken - sent to the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena withregard to the present political situation.

All we basically say is, ensure that peace is brought to thiscountry. The Government is held responsible for theprotection of every single student, temples, schools and thepeople, whether they are in Colombo, in Jaffna, in the East orthe West. All have got to be protected by this Government.

[ ]I conclude my speech on this Report of the Auditor-Generalby saying, please ensure that you appoint a charteredaccountant, who will be able to bring prestige to thisinstitution, as the next Auditor-General. If you cannot, pleaserecall the former Auditor-General, say, until such time youfind a suitable person, and ensure that he does the work.

As the final conclusion, the Report of the Auditor-Generalstates in page 200, I quote :

The entire expenditure of Rs. 320 million comprising recurrent andcapital expenditure incurred on the Auditor Generals Department forthe year 2005 as compared with the computable losses and non-colectionof taxes amounting to Rs. 389 billion....

Sir, Rs. 320 million was what was incured on the Auditor-Generals Department, but this amounts to Rs. 389 billion!

....... excluding the amount that could not be accurately computed,indicating 1,193 times that amount shows that the immediate attentionof the Legislature and the Executive should be paid to the rectificationof the existing deficiencies.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Please, wind up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Sir, there is also one other thing which we brought up inthe COPE. That is, the monetary policies, the regulations andthe statutes followed in this country today have been draftedas for back as 1945, 1956 and 1971. Sir, we are in the year2006. We are working towards paperless offices. We have tohave sophistication, we need computerization, we have tocome out of the box and think. . , boards . , strike . , I congratulate the former Auditor-General forthis Report and request the Cabinet of this country to ensurethat it goes through this.

5.Summary of Audit Findings

The audit test checks of the Department of Inland Revenue. SriLanka Customs, Department of Motor Traffic and the Departmentof Imports and Exports Control carried out in addition to theaudit relating to VAT carried out in relation to the Departmentof Inland Revenue revealed a large number of serious deficienciesand shortcomings connected with the overall management ofthe Government Revenue. The Structural weaknesses of theinstitutions, neglect of duty by the higher management,weaknesses relating to the internal controls, weaknessesprevailing in the systems and controls as well as the conceptualproblems relating to the State Audit are brough to light throughthis report.

5.1 Weaknesses of the Higher Management

In pursuance of provisions in Article 52(2) of the Constitutionof the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka the overallresponsibility in this area is devolved on the Secretary to theMinistry of Finance.

The constitutional provision that The Secretary to the Ministryshall, subject to the direction and control by his Minister. exercisesupervision over the departments of Government or otherinstitutions in the charge of his Minister Surpasses all otherprovisions.7 PL 001453 (2006/09)

917918

A part from that, a huge responsibility and a duty are devolvedon him in terms of Financial Regulations as the Secretary to therelevent Ministry who is the Chief Accounting Officer and asthe Secretary to the Treasury whose foremost responsibility isthe maintenance of the financial control and administration ofthe Government.

A summary of the responsibilities of the Secrerary to the Treasuryin terms of Finance Regulations is given below.

*Financial Regulation 124(1) provides that the Minister ofFinance is charged with the raising of Revenue and thecollection of other Government monies as well as with thegeneral oversight of all the financial operations of Government.He (or the Treasury on his behalf) therefore lays down thebroad framework within which departmental financialtransactions of all kinds may be undertaken.

*Control and supervision of the Treasury is given in FinancialRegulation 126(1). Accordingly the chief function of theTreasury is to maintain control and supervison over theGovernment finance. It is therefore. the duty of the Treasuryto set up a system of financial administration satisfactory inall respects specially with regard to accounting security andresponsibility.

*According to Financial Regulation 126(2), the responsibilityof the Treasury under 126(1) above is not curtailed by theStatutory assignment of any financial function.

Therefore, the responsibility of the Treasury for theoverall management of the public finance including themanagement of Tax Revenue is a responsibility whichcannot be evaded. According to Financial Regulaion 127which shows the general responsibilities of chiefAccounting Officers, A Chief Accounting officer isresponsible to the Minister of Finance for the adequacy ofthe financial administration of all the departments withinthe Ministry.

In accordance with this Financial Regulation, the Secratary tothe Ministry of Finance, as the Chief Accounting Officer, isresponsible to ensure that -

*Each Accounting Officer under his supervision has plannedthe financial work with propriety and has evolved a systemwhich provides adequate control over expenditure and thecollection of revenue.

*The expenditure of the institutions under his control is closelyexamined in the Ministry from the point of view of economyand efficiency.

*All case of doubt or difficulty are referred to him so that hemay bring his own administrative experience and judgementto bear on them.

*The important variations between the estimates and the actualsof the institutions under his supervision are critically examinedby him personally, and

*The collection of Revenue or other Government dues for whichAccounting Officers are responsible is closely watched andexamined by the Ministry.

The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, in furnishing furtherexplanations, has stated that he belivers the determination ofRs. 389 billion as a loss to Government revenue is erroneousand would create a wrong opinion on the Tax Administration,about those institutions and the overall State Tax Management.

When the explanations received in connection with eachindividual observation referred to in paragraph 4 are takeninto consideration the simple situation that clearly emerges isthe weakness of the State Tax Revenue Management.

Head the higher management acted with understanding andadequate professional competence, specially with regard tothe estimation, collection and refund of Tax Revenue and thedetermination of the quantum of tax. the possibility of the lossfrom taxes remaining without being collected in accordancewith regulations, of such an erroneous amount of revenue couldhave been minimised.

5.2 Structural Weaknesses in the Organisational StructureAudit test checks carried out in relation to the Department ofInland Revenue, Department of Customs, the Department ofMotor Traffic and the Department of Import and Export Controlrevealed that the accountability of the Government institutionsengaged in the collection of revenue is not properly establishedto facilitate its proper implementation.

The above examination revealed that the duties of officers havenot been properly interpreted with a view to establishing theirresponsibilities while proper authorities have not been delegatedfor them to perform their duties. This had resulted in the irregularperformance of operational and administrative functions whilethe maintenance of discipline had reached problematic levels.

Thus, it was observed that appropriate criteria had not beendetermined to measure the performance of each officer anddivision while a management information system capable ofgenerating accurate and efficient data to assist the preparationof forward planning for the future, estimations, supply ofstatistics for national economic data and taking decisions oninternal and external policies had not been establisthed in thoseinstitutions.The absence of a management information systemcapable of providing information for supervision and cross -checking among the institutions such as the Departement ofCustoms, Department of Inland Revenue, Board of Investmentsof Sri Lanka, Textile.

Quota Board, etc. can be cited as an example. Further it can bepointed out that the Department of Customs did not have thefacilities to obtain the exports data prior to June 2005. Thus,the matters referred to in this report confirm the position thatin addition to the lack of close co-ordination among theinstitutions as well as among the various divisions of eachinstitution, information made available by the various divisionsdiffered from one another.

While emphasizing the inappropriateness of appointing officersof other Services who do not belong to the Customs Service to thehighest positions in the professional Customs operations thepossibility of such weak organization structure being a contributoryfactor to the growing irregularities cannot be ruled out.

The inappropriateness of attaching the Excise Duty function whichcontributes nearly 20 per cent of the total Government Tax Revenueas a Project of the Department of Customs is also observed.

The need for the transfer of this division to an independentdepartment is observed. It is also essential that a methodology forcreating a strict supervision by the Excise Officers to ensure theaccuracy of the Excise Duty collected from the institutions fromwhich a substantial portion of Excise Duty is collected should beprepared.

It is also observed that the opportunities as well as motivation forcommitting huge tax frauds had been provided by these institutionsthemselves due to lack of proper supervision and co-ordination asshown above.

5:3 Internal Control

The overall internal control including the Internal Audit and theInternal Check of the institutions subjected to examination, is at anextremely weak level and the matters referred to in this report confirmthe fact that the weaknesses mentioned had provided a base forcommitting large scale frauds.

2006 24919920

The institutions subjected to examination, as a whole, had notappointed professionally qualified and proficient officers to thepost of the Chief Internal Auditor while it was observed that eventhe support staff were not professionally proficient. It was alsoobserved that the support staff comprised officers of the PublicManagement Assistant Service appointed for a period of about 5years.

The institutions did not have any facilities to provide systematicand adequate training or to motivate them for professionaldevelopment to enable them carry out their work efficiently. Alsorisk based audits had not been carried out by identifying the areasprone risk. It was also observed that the Internal Audit Programmeswere weak and that the primary objectives of the Internal Audithad not been achieved through them.

It was observed that the weaknesses of the Internal Check had, toa large extent, formed a base for the large scale tax frauds. Thefailure to segregate dissimilar functions in the VAT refund processof the Department of Inland Revenue resulting in one and thesame officer deciding on 4 major functions is seen as an extremelyunsatisfactory situation. This clearly proves the prevalence ofinefficient and incomprehensible control in the highermanagement.

The policy of retaining promoted officers in the same Branchafter promotions can be cited as an example of a very weakmanagement decision.

5:4 Problems relating to non-furnishing of Information to the StateAudit

It is observed that the neglect, long delays and supply of incompleteinformation when explanation is called for by the State Auditunder the Constitutional rights could lead to a limitation of thescope of audit. This position was a common feature among theinstitutions subjected to examination.

6. Recommendations

Special attention is needed for, strengthening the Government RevenueManagement and making it effective. It is recommended that a Boardcomprising appropriate academics should be appointed with a view toobtaining recommendations thereon.

Nevertheless, the following recommendations based on theobservations made during the course of audit are forwarded as a briefproposal for the immediate attention of the Legislature and Executive.

Accountability

*The Strengthening of the accountability in the Government TaxRevenue Management process is needed and for such purposethe following are needed.

- Regular reporting of the performance to the Chief AccountingOfficer under the close supervision of a Committee set up toconsolidate the overall Tax Management.

- In addition to the general instructions issued to the AccountingOfficers, special instruction should be issued.

- Definite and clearly stated function and powers should beassigned in writing to all Supervising Officers of Taxmanagement.

- It is necessary to review the discretionary powers granted forassessment and determination of taxes by individuals.Nevertheless, the desirability of individual assessments anddetermination being done by a group of appropriate officerswith transparency instead of being done by a single officer ispointed out.

Staff

*It is necessary to strengthen the Tax Management as well theManagement Assistant Staff.

*The expansion of the staff to commensurate with the functionsis needed.

*It is necessary to provide them with training and knowledge ofthe subject.

*They should be a satisfied staff.

*They should be encouraged with reward schemes,commendations. etc. for dedicated and honest performance.

*The staff should be evaluated on a regular and timely basis.
