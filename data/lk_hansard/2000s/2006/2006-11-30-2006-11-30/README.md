( , )( - [,, )(The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman - Minister of YouthEmpowerment and Socio Economic Development) , + + + Mr. Deputy Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to brieflyoutline some of the more important areas of activities thatmy Ministry is engaged in.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, before proceeding any further,I wish to place on record my appreciation of the gesture ofHis Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa forappointing me as the Minister of Youth Empowerment andSocio Economic Development which is a high profileportfolio providing me considerable responsibility to upliftthe human and socio economic development of the peopleof Sri Lanka, more particularly the youth in the plantations.

I am conscious of the immense potential within myMinistry to address the felt needs of young people who ifleft unattended are the most vulnerable group of thepopulation to fall prey to undesirable elements andpreoccupations.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, it is within the knowledge ofeveryone that I have a special empathy with the hopes,aspirations and the dreams of people in the plantationswhose welfare had been an abiding attachment of my lategrandfather, Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, and myself ofcourse presently.

I was appointed as a Minister in His Excellencys Cabinetat the end of August this year and since then I have preparedan extensive programme both for the empowerment of youthand for the socio economic development of depressed areasin the country. My Ministry has already held several mobileoffices in depressed areas to collect information for theestablishment of a data base on youth and to understandtheir aspirations. My Ministry will be liaising with severalother Ministries and agencies on implementing training andskills development programmes for youth.

One of the depressed areas that I paid special attentionto is the estate communities, not only because my partyand I represent those communities, but because they are alsorelatively much depressed in comparison with the rest ofthe country.

As you are aware Mr. Deputy Chairman, life is changingrapidly in the estates. Heath indicators have improved inthe past five years due to the work of concerned agenciesin the estate communities and especially due to the workof the Plantation Human Development trust which functionsunder my Ministry. Average education levels are also

2006 3021892190

increasing in the estates and as a result expectations arechanging. Furthermore, as technologies such as electricity,mobile phones and computers slowly enter estate life, thedynamics of the estate communities will continue to changeat a rapid pace. Estate communities receive access otinformation and opportunities through these technologicaladvancements. However, new technology needs bo beintegrated into these communities in an equitable andsustainable fashion. Therefore, future investments will haveto accommodate and support incoming appropriatetechnology. The challenge that my Ministry will face duringthe coming years will be to focus more and more on thesocio development of the work and the non-workenvironment of plantation communities.

Accordingly, Mr. Deputy Chairman, my Ministry will,during the next year, address several issues ranging from;estate housing, community infrastructure and services suchas health and sanitation, education and the introduction ofincome supplementation.

My Ministry will Mr. DeputyChairman, pay specialattention to youth and women in developing our strategies.Women who form the backbone of the tea industry, yet asa group constantly exhibit some of the worst healthindicators in the country. The Government as well asmanagement companies should take a keen interest inpreserving womens health and well-being. For example,improved access to water and firewood, as well as crechesand dispensary services would held to reduce womensburdens in the estate communities.

At the same time in addressing the aspirations of the youth,my Ministry in association with existing training institutionswill take steps to provide employment-oriented vocationaltraining as well as on-the-job training and work opportunitiesto unemployed youth.

In conclusion, it will be remiss of me if I don not mentionthat programmes, projects and activities identified by myMinistry and made operational are due to the personalcommitments of the staff of the Ministry from the Secretarydownwards to the execuitve and other staff of the PlantationHuman Development Trust and the Thondaman Foundadion.

[. . 4.14]

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Bismillahir Rahmanir RaheemThank you for the opportunity given to me to speak atthe Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministryof Education.

First of all, I would like to commend the Hon. Ministerfor there is no doubt that he has been doing a wonderfuljob of work starting his career from the Provincial Council.Just as the Hon. Hasen Ali mentioned; without any partydifference, without any community difference he has beencontributing impartially towards everybody. So I applaudhim.

Hon. Minister, when the SLEAS, Sri Lanka EducationAdministrative Service was established it was decided thatthe candidates for SLEAS will be selected on the followingcriteria. That is, an open competitive examination - 25per cent, limited competitive examination - 45 per cent andseniority - 30 per cent. But so far SLEAS candidates havenot been selected on that basis. So an injustice has beencaused especially to the Grade I Principals who are actuallyeligible under the seniority category which as I mentionedis 30 per cent.

Sir, on the 1st of March, 2002 Circular 1225/32 revealedthat 1783 SLEAS vacancies have to be filled. So 30 percent from the seniority category have to be recruited. Butwe see that action has been initiated to select people froma limited competitive examination. That is, by anexamination conducted in 2006, whereas the results of theexamination held for the married and the seniority categoryin 2002 have not been released. So they will be affectedand therefore you have to take into consideration thecomplaint of the candidates from the seniority and themarried category. Their exam results have to be releasedbefore the SLEAS selections are made.

The other complaint that I received was from thePresidents of the National Colleges of Education. As youknow, out of the 17 National Colleges of Education youhave only five colleges where you have permanentPresidents. There was an interview conducted on the 3th ofFebruary but the results have not been released nor haveappointments been made. So they feel as if they are drivinga vehicle without a licence and that they have beenperforming the duties as the Presidents of the Colleges ofEducation for the last four or five years without any rewards.

( )(The Chairman)Order, Please! . .

( )( - , + )(The Hon. Felix Perera - Minister of Fisheries and AquaticResources) , .

, . Question put, and agreed to.

, . , , Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair and THE HON.VIJITHA RANAWEERA took the Chair.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Hon. Musthaffa, you may continue.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Now only five Colleges have permanent Presidents. SoAddalaichenai, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, Mahaweli, Uva,Pulathisipura, Aluthgama, Ruwanpura, Sariputhra, Nilwala,Sripada and Jaffna do not have permanent Presidents. Sothe persons covering up this duty feel frustrated anddisappointed for the long delay. Therefore, you have totake into consideration the interview they have faced. Theirresults should be released and appointments made at theearliest.

Now coming to the main point which is regarding theNational Schools and the Provincial Council schools. Thissystem is not moving smoothly, Sir. These National Schoolswere selected on an ad hoc basis. I do not see the basis onwhich those National Schools were selected and there arevery good schools which have all the facilities to getqualified as National Schools. But, you do not have thechance as you are restrained; you are constrained by theWorld Bank that you cannot go ahead and have more andmore National Schools. On the other hand, we know thatwhatever instructions given by you are not properlyimplemented at the provincial level. For example, withregard to the selection of whatever category of teachers. Wehad a tough time in the past appointing volunteer teachers,English teachers and minor employees. The relevantauthorities may have sent out the circular stating the basisadopted in appointing them. But, we do not see any basisbeing adopted at that level. So, what I feel is that the timehas come to abolish this system and bring these schoolsunder one administration. Either you bring the NationalSchools under a provincial administration or bring theprovincial schools up to the level of National Schools. Asit is, you have a lot of problems. Even the problems facedby the school teachers are due to that. I know that. Suppose

2006 3022612262

there are just two National Schools in a particulareducational zone, then the transfer could take place onlybetween those two. For example, in Kalmunai, one is aMuslim school and the other is a Tamil school. So, transfersbetween those two schools cannot take place. Even to gettransfers to schools in other provinces is a tedious task. Asyou know, it never takes place. So, the time has come forthe Hon. Minister of Education to take it up at theEducational Reforms Committee. Hon. Minister, you haveto do something.

As you know, teachers are idling in certain schools. Insome schools, there is a need for teachers, but you cannotfind them. This is one of the drawbacks in the system.Especially about the North-East Provincial Council, I donot know what you are going to do. After all, the SupremeCourt judgment was to demerge these two provinces. So,we do not know what will happen. Everything is going todepend on whether you are going to take the North andthe East separately. Anyway, you are going to have a toughproblem.

We see a disparity, a great disparity between the NationalSchools and the provincial schools. Some schools havebeen given the proper facilities: teachers are there; sportsfacilities are there; laboratory facilities are there, everythingis there. On the other hand, you do not find all thesefacilities in other schools. So, the time has come to addressthis issue.

The other thing is that, as you know, we need more andmore technically qualified people for this country. Theprevailing system has to be changed.

(+ )(The Presiding Member) , .

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Sir, the change of Chair took one minute. So, you haveto give me that time.

I propose that you have a degree programme for peopleto get technically qualified and also a BSc degree for nurses,which is a gold mine. I mentioned this at the Debate onthe Votes of the Ministry of Labour Relations and ForeignEmployment. You must definitely bring in a BSc degreefor nurses. It is a gold mine. It will bring in a lot of foreignexchange to the country. Next to you, Hon. Minister, yourDeputy Minister, who is also the Deputy Minister ofFinance, is seated there. You will have less problems whenyou improve the foreign employment sector. In additionto that, you should have more nurses training schools,vocational training schools and technical schools becausethere are thousands and thousands of vacancies all over worldand even in the Western countries for technically qualified

people. If you could take necessary action, I am sure theforeign exchange in this country would not be US Dollars2.2 billion, but would multiply by fivefold and become USDollars 10 billion so that you could solve this problem aswell as half of the countrys problems.

Today, the problems are due to the economic disparity. Ifyou can serve the people of this country with equallydistributed economic benefits, there would not be anyproblem; there would not be any ethnic problem in thiscountry. So, basically, education should set the foundationto solve this problem.

Sir, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

( )(The Deputy Speaker) . .

MIHIN AIR AND THE CIVIL AVIATION POLICY

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me theopportunity to present the following Adjournment Motion.

Today the aviation industry is not only turbulent but verycompetitive and profitability is a big question mark. SriLankan Airlineswas privatized by the Peoples Alliance administration on the 30thMarch 1998. With that today the 10 year exclusive period is comingto an end on the 30th of March 2008. The Government has notconfirmed the way forward for SriLankan Airlines. In the meanwhilewe are informed that second budget airline in the name of MihinAir has been incorporated. Is this with state funds? If so, is thiswith Cabinet approval? And if not, how has the Governmentexpenditure been expended without Cabinet approval. Would theMinister of Aviation please inform this House on that and aviationpolicy that is being implemented at this moment.

The Adjournment Motion deals on the aviation policyof Sri Lanka, especially on Mihin Air that has beenimplemented as of today. Hon. Minister, you being a veryresponsible and an active Minister, once again I would liketo see the activeness that would come up with some of thepertinent questions that come up for public probity.

Today, as you know the Governments aviation policyhas yet to be spelt out properly, because this is an industrythat is very, very turbulent. Owing to the external factorssuch as the fuel prices going up et cetera, today the aviationindustry is in the doldrums. We are worried as to how itsfuture is going to be.

On that basis the open skies policy is something whichthe Government has to spell out very emphatically. It hasgot to say whether it is open skies, whether it is open tosome and closed to the others or whether it is for the purposeof a restricted basis. In todays competitive world openskies is obviously the answers to this and what we arelooking forward to is, as to what Sri Lankas open skiespolicy would be. In this context, today you are talking ofa new budget airline that is supposed to have beenincorporated. I would like to know the answers to certainquestions which I will be asking.

In 1979 we had Air Lanka. This was set up with thetakeover of Air Ceylon which was running at that particularmoment in an inefficient, haphazard and lethargic manner.

2006 3022892290

From 1979 to 1998 Air Lanka was flying the National Flagof the country. Then, they decided to sell 40 per cent ofits shares. The reason being, the profitability and theefficacy was in question and there was a decision to privatizeit. Whether it was privatized in the right manner or not, isnot the question at this particular moment. It is still goingon. Then what happened was, owing to the fact that 40 percent of its shares were sold, a ten-year exclusive periodwas given for Emirates to manage it. This was simplybecause we felt that we did not have the proper managementto do so.

Going on further, with enormous amounts of money thatstill needs to be collected, the Government has only 15months more before the exclusive period comes to an end.The exclusivity given to Emirates Airline will come to anend on the 30th of March, 2008. So, we want to knowwhether the Hon. Minister or any entity has decided tonegotiate with them further or is it going to come back tothe Sri Lankan Government on the basis that there is noprivatization - [Interruption.] That will be 2008. . Then, on the other side, if itis not being discussed or if it is being discussed, then, haveyou accepted privatization as a panacea for certain ills thatare there and is that one of the reasons for going forward?

The next one is, even if you decide not to negotiate orto negotiate, the very aspect of talking of a new airlinecoming up such as Mihin Air, only devalues the ultimateprice that you could get from anybody if you intendprivatizing or with Emirates et cetera. So, we would liketo have an answer from the Government on that score.Further, we are going on the hypothesis that there is theopen skies policy. The private sector has been told tocome and operate as freely as they could. Tourism-ledeconomic growth is what is being looked at for Sri Lanka.You have private companies such as Expo Air, Holiday Air,Deccan Air that have got Government approval to flyinternationally.

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva)

Also Mervyns Air.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I will ensure to bring in another shareholder, the Hon.(Dr.) Mervyn Silva also into that Company. Going onfurther, owing to the fact that there is a time restriction, mostof these airlines are holding on until such time theexclusive period is over because they cannot flyinternationally or wherever air routes need to be shared.

Hon. Minister, my direct question is, going on from therehas Mihin Air been incorporated on the 27th of Octoberwith its registered office at the 35th floor of the West Tower

of the World Trade Centre. The Articles and Memorandumof Mihin Air states that its first directors will be Mr. SajinGunawardena - CEO, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa - Director,Dr. P.B. Jayasundera - Director and Mr. Roshan Gunatilaka- Director. But Mr. Roshan Gunatilaka is the Air ForceCommander, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera is the Secretary to theTreasury and Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is the Secretary tothe Ministry of Defence.

How do they come into the formation of this companyas the first directors of it? Is it a Government owned airlineor not? If it is an airline incorporated with the full blessingsof the Government, then has Cabinet approval beenobtained for such a thing? As you know, any cost over Rs.25,000, which is a puny amount of Government moneynot spent in its proper order is deemed to have been misuseof public property.

Then when you go on further the ex-officio officers thatneed to come in would necessarily mean that the consentof the Government has been given, if not, how couldthese officers sign in for and on behalf of Mihin Air? Is itin their personal capacity or is it in their official capacity?

Then, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we see that they have writtento Mr. Chandrasena Nimalsiri of the Civil Aviation Authorityof Sri Lanka, on the 7th of November, saying that there isan intention to start a fully owned government budgetairline. Now the connotation of a budget airline has yetto be spelt out. Most of the budget airlines in the worldtoday are running at absolutely colossal losses except forone or two which are very, very properly run where thecosts are almost negligible. The rest of the budget airlineshave spelt disaster. Budget airlines are especially beingoperated in countries where tourists are flocking in bymillions but not in a country where tourism is beingaffected for the simple reason that the peace process issubjected to certain ongoing problems.

Hon. Minister, Mr. Sajin Gunawardena signing as theCEO of Mihin Air in a letter to Mr. Chandrasena Nimalsiri,Director-General of Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka- I will read a line from the letter - says that We appreciateyour fullest co-operation for this national carrier. Hon.Minister, as this subject matter comes under you, have yougiven approval? If so, when and I would appreciate forpublic probity to inform this House as to what that particularthing is?

Then on the 21st of November, Sir, that was just ninedays ago, the same Sajin Gunawardena who happens to beappointed by either the Minister or somebody else as theCEO of this Government-owned budget airline says thatthe pre-application form is being sent to the Director-General of Civil Aviation Authority.

Now, Sir, the Civil Aviation Authority is a very importantAuthority in this country which looks after the safety ofthe passengers who come and go and also protects the

22912292

[ ]aviation industry of this country. It has been doing a verylaudable service. There are very eminent people who hadbeen running this organization. Mr. Nimalsiri who is alsoanother expert in this field will tell you whether any airlinethat has not even run a taxi service will apply to have apre-qualification application sent just nine days ago sayingthat they are going international. This is the danger andthe seriousness of this particular thing.

Now, Sir, on the same score private airlines such asHoliday Air, Expo Air and Deccan Air had gone through arigorous process to say what the aircraft is, the people whoare running it and whether the people who were behindthis are competent and it took two or three years to get theapproval. Therefore, Hon. Minister, on what basis has theGovernment spent money for Mihin Air to advertise todesign a logo as well as to recruit staff in the SundayObserver of 19th November and on the 26th in other privatenewspapers? I would basically mention - for the sake ofsaving time - the advertising agency happens to be TradLanka Advertising- what they have said in theiradvertisement. They have said it is to give life to thevision encapsulated in the Mahinda Chintana. This iswhat has been mentioned in the advertisement. Theseadvertising companies have spent a colossal amount ofmoney for these advertisements. The Mahinda Chintanashould not be loosely used. After all he is the President ofthe country. He has a vision that has been expressed.

He came to this House just 15 days ago and presentedthe Second Budget of this Government. In that he did notdeem it fit to talk of Mihin Air. If it is a Government airlineand if it is fully owned by the Government, has the Hon.Minister who is actively involved in protecting the fallingGovernment today given his consent to it?

( )( + - +, )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairsand Minister of Ports and Aviation)Not falling.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Not falling. May I say propped up, and getting theassistance of the United National Party to give additionaloxygen to hold on the falling Government? Why did HisExcellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa not take twominutes of his time to mention about this Mihin Air which isso gloriously being shown in advertisements. You can see inthe advertisements planes coming through paddy fields andalso airline engines turning around. If this is the case, His

Excellency the President would have not forgotten such athing. What we would like to know is if His Excellency thePresident does not know about this and if the Hon. Ministerdoes not know about this, is this a voyage of somebody else?They are spending Government funds.

On the 35th floor of the World Trade Centre there was anempty office. Over the last 6 to 7 days millions of rupeeshad been spent to refurbish this. I guess the proper namefor the budget airline is yet to be known. If it is a budgetairline, normally it is meant for budget passengers and youdo not need to spend money. But here you are spendinglavishly. Mr. Chandrasekera, the former FinancialConsultant of SriLankan Airlines has been recruited at anexorbitant salary, I am told. I may be subject to correction.If that is the case, has it been advertised? If it is aGovernment owned airline, it needs to pursue certainrigorous budgeting procedures. There are ARs and FRs thatneed to be obtained.

Just before I came to this august Assembly, Hon. Minister,we were examining the officials of the Airport and AviationServices (Sri Lanka) Limited at COPE. At that meeting theSecretary to the Ministry of Ports and Aviation did mentionthat there was no Cabinet approval that seemed to have beenobtained for this. I asked the Chairman of the Airport andAviation Services as to whether the Mihin Air is supposedto be operative in the next two to four months - he maybe a visionary in his own dream world - and he said thatthere were no discussions held with the Airport andAviation Services for slot arrangements. Hon. Minister,I am sure if an airline comes into operation tomorrow, youas the Hon. Minster will not be able to do slot arrangementsowing to the fact that there are peak jobs that are going onat the Airport. In that case, how is this Government-ownedairline coming so stealthily into the system? Airport andAviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited does not know it. TheSecretary to the Ministry does not seem to be knowing it.He very openly said, I am sorry. I do not think my Ministryknows it or my Minister seems to be knowing it. If it wasknown to you, at the Committee Stage discussion on theVotes of your Ministry which was discussed two days agoyou should have been proud as the Hon. Minister in chargeto say, We are starting the second budget airline. WhenBOI starts a taxi service of 100, they make a big noise. Ifyou are starting an airline, will you not make a noise? Therehas to be something wrong here. It is Rs.160 million, I ammade to understand, that is going to be spent. This is notMr. Sajin Gunawardenas personal property. This is notthe Directors personal property. I am informed even whenthe Secretary to the Treasury was asked whether this is anational airline or not he has said, I am sorry. I signedcertain documents. I am subject to correction. I do notwant to use somebodys name here without his approval.But he has gone on record in a newspaper saying that hedoes not know it but he has signed a document. He doesnot know whether Government approval has been obtainedor not. In that case, Hon. Minister you have an absolute

2006 3022932294

right to tell this House as to what is going on. Not onlyMr. Chandrasekera who was a former financial consultantof SriLankan Airlines, even Mr. Sudath Rajapaksha who wasknowledgeable in the aviation field retired from -

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Member, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Please give me another two more minutes, Mr. DeputySpeaker.

Mr. Sudath Rajapaksha is basically running the commercialaspect of this supposed to be budget airline. With regard tothis Mihin Air, what is its correct name? Has it got Cabinetapproval? If that is the case what is the share capital that isauthorized to this particular airline? Who has mandated forthe Board of Directors to be appointed? It has to be done byyou, as the Minister of Ports and Aviation. Like the land inTrincomalee that has been taken from your Ministry evenwithout your knowledge, has there been somebody who hadarrogated your powers from your Ministry and appointedthe board of directors? We would like to know it. After all,devoid of politics what we only want is to ensure that wehave a better Sri Lanka tomorrow. On that basis a budgetairline would mean that every single cent is saved. Reducedcosts would mean that you are able to give at cheaper costs tothe passengers. But with the lavish spending that seems tohave made on the World Trade Centre office and theexorbitant prices that you are paying there, I think the veryaspect of a budget airline has been taken away from the veryconcept.

Hon. Minister, if airlines can be started at every corner,a budget airline in Colombo, one airline in Trincomalee,another airline in Jaffna and if that is going to developtourism in this country, then we will be the happiestpersons to support any amount of airlines. Like aninternational airport coming up in Weerawila, if you canput up one in Anuradhapura and another one inTrincomalee, and if that develops tourism, well and good.But this is Sri Lankan citizens money. We are the peoplewho control the purse of the country. If that is the case, weneed to be told whether the Cabinet has approved this ornot. If it was not approved, then what action will you takeagainst the people who are responsible? Who is thesecretary who has permitted that? Who is the official whohas permitted that? A proper explanation needs to be givento this House before too long. Hon. Minister, I am surewith the speed that you work, you will be able to answer atthe conclusion of this Adjournment Debate. But if a personof your nature is unable to answer this, then there issomething serious that has happened. We like to know fromthe Hon. Minister as to how you are going to take this

forward. The question once again is, has this got the expressapproval of the Cabinet? When was the Cabinet paperforwarded? When was the approval given? What is thecapital of this airline? Who are the ones who are subscribingto this airline and who are the first directors authorized andwhat are their professional qualifications? And how are you,at a time when we have 15 months more to re-negotiateSriLankan Air lines with whoever, may be with the Emirates,may be with any other airline that is being sought of, ableto get the best deal possible? If you are able without anotherairline to get one deal, when you have another airlineobviously it is devalued. Is that not right? So is it notasinine even contemplating bringing a budget airline atthis time? Is it not a national crime that is committed? Notonly selling SriLankan Airlines to the Emirates was anational crime. You are creating the second crime. I amsure there must be a justifiable, a laudable decision as towhy not. Otherwise, we need to know in this House beforetoo long as to what action will be taken. So once again,what experience has the CEO, Sajin Gunawardena got?How has he written to the Director Civil Aviation sayingthat this is a fully government owned airline? -[Interruption]. That is the thing. . . .

In fact, the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon.Ravi Karunanayake, I believe, has raised three main issues.Firstly, the Hon. Member in his Adjournment Motion says

[ ]

2006 3022972298

that the Government has not confirmed the way forwardfor Srilankan Airlines. In fact, in reply to that, I am happyto inform this House today that already a Committeeheaded by the Secretary to His Excellency the President,comprising of the Secretary of the Ministry of Ports andAviation, the Secretary of the Treasury along with the Boardof Directors of Srilankan Airlines have been assigned thetask of starting negotiations with the Emirates to renegotiateand to identify matters which may need improvement oncethe new Agreement comes into effect in March of 2008, asthe Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said. So the Governmenthas already started the process of renegotiating with theEmirates.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)That means, has this Government accepted theprivatization policy because if you have got an opportunitynow and if -

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)No, I think, we are getting into another area of debatewhether privatization is correct or not. It is somethingthat we should perhaps take up at a different forum. Butof course, we will continue with this policy as far asSrilankan Airlines is concerned.

As for the second issue raised by the Hon. RaviKarunanayake and the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka, first of all,let me say that our Government believes that theintroduction of budget airline services in Sri Lanka inkeeping with international trends at the moment will be ofgreat benefit to air travel consumers of our country. Ofcourse, we must ensure that the safety and sustainability ofsuch operations are in order.

Of course, as for the subsequent questions which wereraised. So far, no Cabinet Paper has yet been presented butI believe in the next few weeks a joint Cabinet Paper willbe prepared by the Ministry of Finance along with theMinistry of Ports and Aviation which will givecomprehensive details regarding the formation of such abudget airline venture. But, for the moment I cannot giveyou any more details because no Cabinet Paper so far hasbeen presented by my ministry or any other ministry but asI said, most probably, it will be done in the next week orso. Of course, once the Cabinet approves this proposal-

( )(The Deputy Speaker) . ?

( )(Hon. Members)Aye !

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Once the Cabinet approval is granted for this project, ofcourse, there are certain procedures we will have to follow.As you know the application at that particular point in timewill be processed by the Civil Aviation Authority and inthat process we will give priority to ensure that thisapplication is in accordance with the air navigationregulation and the applicable international standards andrecommended practices which is basically the bible of theInternational Civil Aviation Organization. So, all thoseprocedures will be followed. All I can assure you, the Hon.Members and this House, is that the safety and the securitywill never be compromised in processing such applications.

Finally, as for the Hon. Ravi Karunanaykes commentsabout the need for an Aviation Policy, again I would liketo inform the House that the Aviation Policy of Sri Lankahas now been completed and the final draft has been sentto me last week and we hope to present that to Cabinetduring the month of January.

I thank you. ( ) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister you very openly gave an answer to that.We appreciate that. We have only mentioned, throughthe process, to look at as to how money has been spentand with what authority has it been spent. We wouldgreatly appreciate if this is looked into.
