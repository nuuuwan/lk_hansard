. . ( )( () [ - )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala Minister ofParliamentary Affairs)Mr. Deputy Speaker, I propose to intervene in this Debateon the Emergency in order to make use of the occasion tohighlight certain aspects of the ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka.Mr. Deputy Speaker, today the ethnic crisis whichdestabilized this country for more than two decades hastaken a new turn. The LTTE and its supporters in all western

2006 07935936

capitals including the Tamil diaspora, internationalizedthe conflict with a view to deriving a variety of advantagesfor themselves. They did this with great success and theentire Tamil diaspora began supplying funds and all typesof things which the movement needed. All this happenedamidst violence perpetrated by the LTTE. The turning pointfor all terrorist organizations in the world came on 11thSeptember, 2001 when terrorist violence reached thedoorstep of the United States of America. It was the USAwhich gave leadership to a global coalition against terrorismand today a similar global coalition has come into existenceagainst the LTTE with the ban on this organization by theEuropean Union.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, in the past the LTTE whenever acountry banned it, ignored it saying that it makes not muchof a difference to their struggle. With the decision of theEuropean Union the situation in respect of the LTTEactivities in European capitals has undergone a change andthe motives of the European Union was to get the LTTE togive up violence and enter the democratic stream ofpolitics. We, in Sri Lanka expect the ban to be an effectiveone where attempts are made to weaken the LTTE as aterrorist organization, and the international communitywith the power and influence at its disposal should takeeffective measures, strong measures to prevent fund-raising,purchase of arms and propaganda. The internationalcommunity should take steps to impress upon them of theneed to eschew violence. In our view, the ban by theEuropean Union should not be a mere pledge on a pieceof paper. The European Union and others of theinternational community should take effective steps toconvert the Tigers into a set of a paper tigers. The LTTEshould realize that the international scenario is going againstthem and their isolation in the eyes of the entireinternational community is inevitable. It is now impossiblefor them to restore their image as an organization committedto liberation of a community. This label has no relevanceat all. The international community in the past two decadeswas duped to believe this but with the LTTEs own violentactions this has been overturned. Today the LTTE isregarded as one of the dangerous terrorist organizations inthe world and its activities are a threat to regional stabilityas well as international security. The reason is that terroristorganizations with similar backgrounds and experience area major threat, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to international security,stability and democracy. That is why most western countriesamidst opposition from their own people constitutedthemselves into a global coalition against terrorism.

Sri Lanka, since the assumption of power by HisExcellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has beenmaking efforts to build a consensus in order to find anacceptable political solution to the ongoing ethnic conflictwhich has destroyed the very fabric of the Sri Lankansociety. His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa is a politicalrealist, Mr. Deputy Speaker. He is committed to a negotiatedpolitical solution to the problem and it was with this pledge

that he obtained a mandate in November, 2005. The samemandate was renewed in March, 2006 and the people areready to support His Excellency the President, MahindaRajapaksa to prepare a roadmap for a negotiated politicalsettlement to this question. His approach to the issue isrealistic. It was this approach which brought him credibilitywithin the international community.

Today, through the All Party Conference, Hon. MahindaRajapaksa is engaged in a consensus building process. Inother words, he wants to bring about a Southern consensuson the matter. To a great extent this exercise has beensuccessful. He rightly declared that this issue whichthreatened the very foundation of the Sri Lankan State,cannot be solved by a single individual. This is the messagewhich His Excellency the President delivered at the All PartyConference. It cannot be solved by a single political party.In other words, he seeks the support of all political partiesand the strategy needs to be multi-party oriented.

In my view Sir, a Southern consensus is emerging and itneeds to be properly channelled in the right direction. Thiscan be done only in the context of the right responses fromthe LTTE. They must openly give up their demand for aseparate state which, in the given international context, isimpossible to realize. A second state is not viable. It isnot viable both politically and economically.Demographically, it is not possible because the Tamilcommunity at the given point of time is not concentratedin that particular region any more. Fifty three per cent ofthe Tamil people are today living outside the North andEast. Therefore, the traditional homeland theory is not afact, but a fiction.

The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, despite provocative actsof violence by the LTTE in the past six months, remainscommitted to a political settlement. We are now determinedto introduce a home-grown or a home-made scheme ofdevolution, where substantial autonomy would be concededto the North and East. This means that we would constructa system on the basis of our own experience in the area ofdevolution of power. Many proposals have been made inthe past and their contents would be studied. Sir, we donot propose to import a model. We will construct a modelon the basis of our experience, history and our politicalculture.

Sir, we do not want a war. War is dangerous. I wouldlike to quote from Carl Von Clausewitz, a German theoristwho wrote the wonderful book On War. I would like toquote a passage from it;

The War of a community - of whole Nations, and particularlyof civilized Nations - always starts from a political condition, and iscalled forth by a political motive........

We see, therefore, that War is not merely a political act, but alsoa real political instrument, a continuation of political commerce, acarrying out of the same by other means.

937938

[ . . ]Therefore, what we need is to eliminate it. This showsthat war emanates from political conditions and we needto eliminate them in order to avoid a war.

There are people in Sri Lanka, who say that Sri Lanka,is a failed state. This question also needs to be answered.Let us begin with the definition of a state. Harold Laskyin his Grammar of Politics states:

A state is in fact the supreme coercive power in any given politicalsociety. It enjoys the monopoly of power.

What is a failed state? It is a weak state in which theCentral Government has little practical control over muchof its territory. According to Noam Chomsky this conceptof a failed state is a controversial term in political discourse.

Ethiopia at one stage, Mr. Deputy Speaker, was a failedstate because the writ of the state, the power of the statedid not extend beyond the capital, Addis Ababa. There weresimilar states where the power of the state, the monopolyof its power, did not extend beyond the seat of thegovernment.

My good Friend, Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the other dayquoted a document issued by an unknown NGO inWashington to say that Sri Lanka is a failed state. I cannotunderstand as to why my good Friend, such a responsibleperson, quote publications without examining whether itis a reliable document or not. What is this NGO, Mr. DeputySpeaker? Today NGOs are kingmakers in this country aswell. They want to teach all governments as to how theyshould govern their countries and practise democracy.According to the index prepared by this particular NGO inWashington - Fund for Peace- Sri Lanka is ranked 25out of 148 states and this assessment is based on 12indicators. Those indicators are not at all representativeand some of them are not relevant in the Sri Lankan context.The Sri Lankan embassy has protested against this particularNGO which is indulging in some kind of political mischieffor the benefit of some concerned group here in Sri Lanka.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Minister, your time is coming to an end.

. . ( () [ )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala)The Hon. Prime Minister has given me extra time.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Yes, inclusive of that you have about two minutes left.

. . ( () [ )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala)All right. In fact this organization has now agreed thatthey made a mistake in ranking Sri Lanka as a failed state.This so called NGO which characterized Sri Lanka as afailed state is an unknown organization with no widespreadinternational recognition. If Sri Lanka is a failed state, Mr.Deputy Speaker, how did Sri Lanka get into the PeaceBuilding Commission of the Human Rights Council in theUnited Nations? If Sri Lanka was considered a failed statethe international community would never have thought itfit to include Sri Lanka in the 47-member UN Human RightsCouncil. This is all what I want to say.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

[12.05 p.m. ]

( )( - )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike - Minister of Tourism)Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am indeed privileged to address thisHouse while the distinguished junior lion from Boralugodais presiding over the affairs of this House.

Sir, I will not take very long because it is ridiculous tospeak for 15 minutes on a matter as serious and grave as this.But, may I say that I have not spoken on the Emergency for along, long time because, Sir, we have been speaking on theEmergency for the last 23 years. Since 1983, Sir, since yourbrother entered Parliament - I have been a Member ofParliament for the last 30 years - we have been speaking onthis problem repeatedly ad nauseam. We have been speakingon various issues but, at the end of it, nothing has happened.

Talking about the efforts made by the UNP - I do not wantto criticize them for this - they tried their level best to solvethis problem, but they failed. The former President ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga, having had personally beeninjured, having lost an eye, never gave up her struggle tofind a political solution to this problem. Now PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa has also gone that extra mile, as hecalls it, to find a solution to this. Sir, that is why, throughabsolute disgust, that I have not spoken on this matter becausethere is no point in speaking, except highlighting variousincidents. Having political pot-shots at each other and talkingridiculous rubbish, we are wasting the time of this House, theHon. Members and the staff.

Sir, during the last Presidential Election, the UnitedNational Party branded our campaign as a chauvinistcampaign. Whether it be right or wrong, it was perceived by

953954

[ ]the people that it was a very pro-Sinhala, anti-Tamil campaign.From that time onwards, if you see the conduct of PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa, he has, in fact, proved to be a realist andflexible enough to change his point of view, change thecommitments he has made in the greater interest of thiscountry. India, the Co-Chairs, the United States of Americaand the EU have been pressing us, particularly when I wasthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, several times to find a solutionto this problem. But, I think, since this Government cameinto power in November last year, President Rajapaksa hasbeen - I do not want to use the word advise - told by themthat there is no other solution except a political solution,maximum devolution within a united Sri Lanka and nochasing away of Norway. Even India said that very clearly -that they were not prepared to be monitors; that they werenot going to have a defence pact with us. Mr. PranabMukherjee, who is the Defence Minister of India, hasrepeatedly said even in Tamil Nadu that India is only takinga back seat.

Sir, the realism of President Rajapaksa is a refreshing thingbecause he has, in fact, defied the other Members of the ourAlliance - with all due respect to them, I have nothing againstthem, but their views have been defied - and made a pragmatic,realistic approach to this problem. In fact, the main pointwhich I see in his conduct on this ethnic problem is thepatience he has shown in spite of severe provocation. TheHon. Prime Minister would have read out all the details ofwhat happened in the last one month, particularly theattempted assassination of the Army Commander, the attackon the Dvora and the ship carrying 700 soldiers in the North.Those are acts of absolute provocation. To attempt to kill theArmy Commander of a sovereign State is an act of war. So, inspite of all these provocations by the LTTE, the President hasexercised utmost patience, which, probably, I would nothave exercised or anybody else would not have exercised. Ithink, that says a lot on the thinking of President MahindaRajapaksa.

Sir, for example if you take China, I am sure many peoplehave been to China, had the Chinese followed the principlesof Chairman Mao Tse-tung, China would have been still inthe doghouse. Chairman Mao was a great man; he createdChina; was the Father of the modern China. But yet, whilethey pay him all the respect, they have taken a completelydifferent turn; they have moved from the Left to the Rightand today, China is a capitalist country with a CommunistGovernment. By the year 2020, China will be a superpowerand might even precede the United States of America. If yougo to China, if you go to Vietnam, you will see the change.The largest investor in Vietnam is the United States. Havingdropped more bombs than in the First and the Second WorldWars on Vietnam, today the biggest investor in Vietnam is theUnited States of America . So, the world changes and so must

we. Therefore, Sir, we cannot be dogmatic; we cannot bestubborn. Our views must change according to the times andour views must change with the changing situation all overthe world.

Sir, this war cannot go on. I think all the Members on bothsides of this House, from every single party, particularly thetwo main parties, the SLFP and the UNP, have agreed that wemust devolve power, maximum devolution - I do not want toget involved in an argument about the word federalismbecause that is counterproductive - within a united Sri Lanka.That is what the former Prime Minister, the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe, throughout said in his election campaignand that is what former President Chandrika BandaranaikeKumaratunga said throughout her speeches before theelections and even during the elections. Unless you do thatand unless the world forces the LTTE to accept it, there cannever be any peace in this country. Sri Lanka is bleeding todeath, Sir. Every month we are reminded of how much wehave bled. The Hon. Prime Ministers opening remarks wouldhave shown to you that violence is increasing, the murdersare increasing, the killings are increasing and there is not asign of peace in the distant future.

Now, Sir, for example take my Ministry. The moment theArmy Commander was attacked, 400 French tourists whowere coming here immediately cancelled their visit to SriLanka. I heard that once the Dvora was attacked, 1,000 oddJapanese tourists, who were due to come here, have allcancelled their visits. Sir, nobody is going to pay and comehere and get killed for somebody elses cause. Even if youhave the cleverest Minister of Tourism, you can neverpersuade them to come here and get killed for somebodyelses cause.

Sir, the third largest foreign exchange earner is tourism.Investment is number two. If the second and the third largestincome earners of this country are affected by this violence,how on earth can we rebuild the economy? Be it the SLFP, beit the UNP, be it the JVP or be it anybody, whoever is rulingthis country, you cannot bring in tourists or investors as longas this absolutely confused state in the mind of the tourist orthe investor remains because of the continued violence.Therefore, Sir, may I say that we publicize Sri Lanka as Aland like no other. We are carrying on a campaign nextmonth in the United Kingdom during the cricket matches onthe theme Refreshingly Sri Lanka. All that is true - a uniqueland, a refreshing land. But for them it is not refreshingbecause as far as they are concerned, they pay large sums ofmoney and they come here to find things not at all refreshing.Now, Sir, if an Englishman wants to go to the sun and the sea,he can go to the Caribbean , he can go to Barbados, he can goto Jamaica, he can go to Nassau, he can go to the West Indies-

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne)

He can go to Male.

2006 07955956

4 PL 001207 (2006/06)

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)He can go to Male, precisely. Do you know Hon. Senaratne,there are 125,000 tourists from Japan going to the Maldives?We have only 10,000 or 15,000 coming here. Right nextdoor! They are going there because there is no violencethere. Therefore, Sir, this country cannot go on with this war.That is the point I am trying to make. Whether it is tourism orinvestment or employment or bringing down the cost of livingor anything, none of those things can be done. They are onlypipedreams as long as the war remains. Therefore, the warmust stop. And, now how do we do that? Sir, very brieflymay I say - because I have no time, I do not want to impingeon somebody elses time - that we have different views in thisHouse, Sir. We have from the extreme point of view of theTNA to the extreme point of view of the JHU various pointsof view. But it is time that we bury all these, bury ourprejudices.

( )(An Hon. Member)

And the SLFP?

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)The SLFP is in the middle. The UNP and the SLFP havetaken a similar stand on this matter and that is what mattersbecause we have polled nearly 85 per cent of the vote in thelast Pradeshiya Sabha Election. Sir, in this situation we mustas a government build confidence so that the Opposition cantrust us. During the times of my father, Mr. G. G.Ponnambalam, Mr. Dudley Senanayake, Mr. D. S.Senanayake, Mr. J. R. Jayewardene in the State Council andalso Dr. N. M. Perera, Mr. Philip Gunawardena, greatpoliticians, great statesmen, they were able to bury the hatchetwhen it came to the nation. Here, Sir, we are burning. Thereare murders going on day in and day out, both in the Tamiland Sinhala areas and we are coming here and bickering.Yesterday I heard - I was not present here when it happened- that there was a big fracas over the appointment of theChairmen for the PAC and the COPE. These are matters, Sir,which are political. If you want the support of the UNP whichis the other main Sinhala party, the second largest Sinhalaparty, you have to give in. You have to win their confidencebecause we are not playing politics. Now there is no time toplay politics. We have finished two elections. The peoplehave given their verdict. We are going to be here for anotherfive and a half years. Therefore, in that five and a half yearslet us build a consensus on matters of the utmost importancelike the ethnic issue. We will fight on other matters. On othermundane things, let us disagree or fight or assault each otheror do what we want. It is a democracy after all. But onfundamental matters like the ethnic problem, we have to winthe confidence of the second largest political party. We haveto win the confidence of the JVP which is a partner in our

Government, no longer a partner but supporting theGovernment. We have to win the support of the TNA. Wehave to win the support of the SLMC because so long as theyare kept out of the political geography of this situation,trouble will continue to be there. If you keep the Muslimsout of the talks you will have another problem between theTamils and the Muslims. I have been a great advocatepersonally of the fact that the Muslims should be invited forall the talks. Though the LTTE opposes it for some politicalreason or the other the participation of Muslims is very, veryimportant in this discussion because one-third of the Muslimslive in the Eastern Province.

( )(The Hon. Hasen Ali)Thank you very much.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)You are from the SLMC? -[Interruption.] Ah! Thank you.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Minister -

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)I am winding up, Sir.

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)Sir, he may continue for another five minutes.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)I know the Chair will not stop me. I am just finishing up,Sir.

Now, Sir, to wind up, may I say that we have got the lastchance for peace. There is going to be no more chances. Thiscountry cannot wait for another five and a half years foranother government to come, for another government to makea mess up. We have been elected by the majority of thepeople of this country to solve the economic problem andthe ethnic problem. Those are the two basic things that thepeople of this country want. Therefore Sir, in this situation itis entirely up to His Excellency the President and hisGovernment of which we are all a part, to bring anunderstanding and confidence amongst the various politicalparties representing various shades of opinion and therefore,Sir, I think it is time we stop playing politics. We justplayed politics and finished less than a month ago. We arenot playing it all the time. For one thing it is boring, the

957958

[ ]people are disgusted. For example, if you look at the numberof people who watch the Thulawa and all these debatesthat have been going on during the General Election - mygood Friend Mr. Johnston Fernando and my good Friend Dr.Rajitha Senaratne did extremely well for their parties and sodid our people - the figure has dropped drastically. It hasdropped. Because there is no election going on -[Interruption]. You are very wise. Nobody is watchingbecause it starts at 10 o clock, goes on till One oclock, youare half asleep when the programme is over and you havemissed half the arguments. But I must say that it was verylively, it was very entertaining and extremely educative evenfor us because those who take part, study their subjects andcome and they get very heated. That is very good. More hot,hotter the better.

( )(An Hon. Member)

People think it is a nuisance.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)Now it is a nuisance. That is true. But before that it wasnot a nuisance. In fact a lot of people enjoyed it.

Sir, let me wind up by saying that every citizen in thiscountry to whichever race he belongs or to whicheverpolitical party he belongs has an equal right to live withdignity, with the respect that they deserve and it is up to theGovernment to ensure that. So let us build a consensusbetween the North and the South. We are talking of aconsensus, building a consensus in the South when we cannotagree on the chairmanship of COPE and PAC. If you cannotagree on the chairmanship of COPE and PAC, how can youhave a consensus in the South? If you cannot have a consensuson a fundamental matter like that, how can you have aconsensus on a matter as sensitive as the ethnic issue? It is ajoke, Sir. We quarrel over two posts and we are talking abouta southern consensus. We cannot have a consensus acrossthe House. They are against; you are for onething; we are foranother. I do not know what the TNA and the SLMCsposition on this matter is. Therefore, Sir, let us first build aconsensus in this House where the peoples representativesare. We are the representatives of the people.

Sir, I do not want to embarrass you any further by takingmore time than it is necessary. Before it gets too late, Sir,before time runs out, let us all together as Sri Lankans, sitdown and find a solution to this problem, however difficult itmay be, however sensitive it might be politically, let ussurpass all that. Let us forget the past, bury the past and thinkof a new future which the people of this country richly deserve.

Thank you, Sir.

[1.48 p.m.]

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)Sir, when the Government of the day declared a state ofEmergency, the justification that was given to us on the firstoccasion was that Emergency was required for the properinvestigation of the assassination of the then Foreign Minister,Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar. Of course, we have moved onsince then, Sir. Today not one Member, certainly whilst Iwas here, that spoke on the side of the Government usedthat as an excuse. Instead the explanation that has been offeredis to try and combat the violent situation and the escalationof violence that currently prevails in Sri Lanka.

Now, Sir, let us for a moment just take both theseexplanations that have been offered. Even if we are toaccept the first explanation that was given that a state ofEmergency is required for a proper investigation of theassassination of Mr. Kadirgamar, clearly that has failed.And, if we are to go by some of the media reports, whichis these days the only source of keeping up with theinvestigation, clearly every effort that has been taken bythe Government thus far, has resulted in nothing.

One prominent Tamil expatriate was taken into custodypresumably under some provision of the EmergencyRegulations. Subsequently he had to be released. He wasportrayed as a key person in the assassination bid, butsubsequently he had to be released because he succeededin a Fundamental Rights application. Then of course thereis another, the more recent explanation. That is to curb theescalation of violence, the downward spiralling towards aviolent situation and very clearly since the declaration ofthe state of Emergency, violence has only increased. Therecertainly does not seem to be any reduction in the violence.

It has only aggravated the situation and the brunt of theRegulations and the most draconian elements of theRegulations are actually being used today, as we havecomplained several times against innocent Tamil civilians.So then, Sir, that is the reality with regard to theGovernments explanations for declaring a state ofEmergency. Let us extend these reasons given to maybeother investigations.

There have been several incidents that the TNA hasbrought to the notice of this House. We have made specialstatements, the Leader of our Parliamentary group has madeseveral of those statements. The Hon. Mavai S.Senathirajah has made several statements whilst there wasthis state of Emergency.

Particularly, I would like to draw the attention of theHouse to four matters. First, is the murder or rather theassassination of the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham. Soonafter the murder, a TNA delegation met with the President.At that meeting, associated with the President was hisSecretary, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga as well as Mr. MaithripalaSirisena. In the course of that meeting, Sir, we specificallymentioned the name of the individual who had in fact goneto the church on Christmas eve and shot at and killed, Mr.Pararajasingham. The following day was a ParliamentarySitting day, we were having a Parliamentary Group Meetingin Committee Room No. 8. The President contacted theTNA. He asked for me personally. I spoke to him and onceagain we repeated the information. Not only did we mentionthe person who was involved in the killing, the triggerman,but we also gave him the army camp which this particularindividual had escaped to. Thus far we have had absolutelyno follow-up in that regard.

Then Sir, there is the infamous execution-style killingof the five students in Trincomalee. There was an activeeffort on the part of the Government to cover it up and onceit became impossible for the Government to cover it up,once again we had a meeting with the President and at thatmeeting the President confided in the TNA and very clearlytold us that he knows who is behind it. He mentioned thatthe STF was sent to Trincomalee without his approval. Hementioned the individual who had given the orders to sendthe STF to Trincomalee and who had in fact been behindthe execution-style killing of these five students. So farwe have had no progress in that regard. In fact, there weresome media reports to suggest that the few individuals whohad been taken into custody on suspicion are now goingto be released and we are told that it is because theGovernment Analysts Report does not match with theevidence that was recovered at the scene of the crime.

Then Sir, there is also the question of the attack on theUdayan newspaper and the killing of two individuals whoworked in that newspaper. I can reveal to the House that Iam reliably informed that the proprietors of the saidnewspaper have in fact revealed to the CID which is

981982

conducting the investigation the identity of one of theindividuals who was present and who took part in theviolence and the assassination, by name. They have alsoindicated in which EPDP camp this particular individualis staying. They have also given details of the revenuelicence number of the motor bicycle which this particularindividual had used as a get-away. But so far we havehad no reaction, no positive developments with regard tothat investigation. In fact, there were five or six innocentindividuals from far, far away who were taken into custody.It was quite clear that they were being framed. Subsequentlythe Magistrate was forced to release them.

Then Sir, finally there was the incident at Allaipiddi, inthe islands. Very clearly once again despite several neutralhuman rights bodies pointing to the culprits involved, thusfar we once again have no progress with regard to thatinvestigation.

Now Sir, the explanation, quite a remarkable explanation,a very pompous explanation that was offered by HisExcellency the President for not having pursued or not beingable to pursue these investigations was that his Governmentis a democratically elected Government that is committedto the rule of law. That means, if there is insufficientevidence that is offered they have to free these individualsand unfortunately according to him that is the state of affairs.There is no evidence.

Now Sir, here is a President and a Government that sopompously declare their credentials with regard todemocracy and also their commitment to the rule of law.But it is this very same Government -

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Member, you have used up the ten minutes.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)

That cannot be, Sir. Anyway I will take some more time.There is another ten minutes and I will take some time outof that.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)

From us, not from you all?

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)

But you also can give if you want - [Interruption].

[ . . ] ( )(An Hon. Member)

No. We are running out of time.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)

Then Sir, we have this explanation offered. I think itwas offered to the Bishops of Jaffna and Mannar when theymet His Excellency the President about this commitmentto the rule of law. We have also this so called commitmentto the rule of law that was used to scuttle every effort thatwas taken with regard to the peace process thus far, in facteven to question the existence of the Ceasefire Agreement.Now Sir, this very same President and this very sameGovernment disgracefully flaunts this concept of rule oflaw on the one hand when it comes to Tamil issues andTamil concerns, but has absolutely no hesitation whatsoeverto throw that very same Constitution that is supposed tooffer this rule of law into the dustbin when it comes toenhancing their own power and when it comes to makingdecisions and appointing committees which are supposedto be independent for their own purposes. So very clearlythis duplicity on the part of the Government today isexposed and the world is beginning to see the true colours,that we have only rhetoric coming from the Government,but in reality every step that is taken by this Governmentis to scuttle the peace process and to create a situation ofwar. That is the reality. Whether you take the declarationof high security zones which once again is ultra vires theConstitution, it is illegal, there is not even a GazetteNotification to demarcate these areas. All of these thingsthat affect the Tamil people can be ignored, the rule oflaw does not exist and this has not been lost on the Tamilpeople, Sir.

Now the tragedy Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that despiteall these being available to the international community,this very same international community that talks of theneed to freedom, democracy and I think there is anotherterm that the US President uses quite often, has chosento go ahead and support this Government. In fact theyhave made certain statements to say that they will providemilitary assistance to this Government to fight terrorism.So, here we have the United States and Members of theCo-Chairs branding the LTTE as a terrorist organization.But they very clearly also say at the same time the causeof the LTTE and the cause of the Tamil people is legitimate.It is only the means, that is the use of violence, that isunacceptable. And any form of violence however just thecause is, is terrorism according to the US and some membersof the Co-Chairs. If we are to apply that very same policyand extend it to history then the founding father of theUnited States, Mr. George Washington is a condemnedterrorist and so are renowned liberation fighters such asNelson Mandela. So the point here Mr. Deputy Speaker,

2006 07983984

is the credibility of the international community, whenthey use terms such as terrorism and when they refuse todistinguish between terrorism and an unjust struggle onthe one hand, and a just cause and a liberation armedstruggle on the other. And till such time as they refuse tomake that distinction, the credibility of our actors that arewaging this war on terror is certainly, gravely in doubt andwill be called into question.

Then Sir, there is also very clearly by this action onthe part of the international community, an attempt, theonly way we can see it is an attempt to appease this veryhard line, chauvinist, if not racist Government. They feelthat by appeasing such a racist Government one day theycan use the fact that they have appeased them. They havebranded a just liberation movement as a terrorist movementand they think that they can one day try and urge them tomove in the direction of peace. Tragedy, Sir, is that neverin history has appeasement ever succeeded. And those whofail to learn the lessons from history and there are plenty,are condemned to relive history. And that is what we willsee. On the other hand, the failure of the internationalcommunity to distinguish between a legitimate freedomstruggle and terrorism in the case of Sri Lanka, in the caseof the Tamil people, is certainly not going to deter us fromwhat we see as our only way to survive as a people. If theinternational community thinks that by branding usterrorists, by humiliating a liberation struggle as terrorismthat they can deter legitimate support for freedom, thecraving for liberation, then once again they very clearlyhave not learnt the lessons of history.

I would like to conclude, Sir, by making two comments.One is that, by the recent actions of the Co-Chairs,particularly the European Union, the internationalcommunity has condemned themselves to be slow-learners.But, mark my words. If one believes in the truth and theultimate victory of truth they are slow-learners but willultimately learn the reality.

Finally, Sir, may I repeat a quote that was used by, Ibelieve, a TULF or if not an ITAK Member many, manyyears ago. He said this of the type of racism that exists inthis country. It was a comparative sort of analysis. Hecompared the South African State at the height of theapartheid era and said,

In South Africa you have racism indeed; racism that is skin-deep.

Then he looked at Sri Lanka and said,

The Sri Lankan State is also racist. But, the difference is theracism that you have here is soul-deep.

I thank you, Sir.

I need not go into the details of the peace negotiations we had withMr. Ranil wicramasinghes Government in various world capitalsunder Norwegian facilitation. It is suffice to say thar Mr. RanilWicramasinghes administration was unable to resolve even the basicexistential hadrships and urgent humanitarian needs of our people.Adopting delaying tactics, Ranils Government was primarily focusingon setting up an international safey net aiming at decommissioningour weapons. An international aid conference was organized in Tokyoin June 2003 as an essential element of this subversive scheme. Havingrelized the implications of the international safety net we decided toboycott the Tokyo conference
