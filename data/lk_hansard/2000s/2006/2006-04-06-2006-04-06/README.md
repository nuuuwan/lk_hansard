( )(Mr. Navin Dissanayake)Sir-

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)Sir, I want to make a clarification to what Mr. PiyasiriWijenayake said.

, .

10011002

_ ( )(Mr. Navin Dissanayake)Hon. Bogollagama, you are breaking into my time. Aftermy speech

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama )I will just finish. Give me one minute. You can take ourtime.

( )(Mr. Navin Dissanayake)Okay.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama ) . . , , , . , . .

( )(Mr. Navin Dissanayake)Sir, the Hon. Bogallagamas timely intervention on thismatter is greatly appreciated. Of course he is seen as a verydynamic Minister who takes immediate remedial action.

I am very thankful for having been given the time to makea few comments on Rubber Replating Subsidy (Amendment)Bill. I note that the former Minister of Plantation Industries,Mr. Lakshman Kiriella also just walked into the Chamber. Ofcourse the Ministry of Plantation Industries has been a Cabinetrank ministry all along. So I do not know whether this is ademotion or a promotion to our Hon. Minister. But I hopethat very soon it will be made a Cabinet portfoio once again.Given the importance of this Minister for the nationaleconomy of this country, I feel that it is vital that the Ministryof Plantation Industries is given due recognition in thisGovernment. Thefact is that there are so many Ministers inthis Government, may be about 70 or 80. Some of them are-Ishould say-cardboard Ministers, who do not have thenecessary power to do anything. But I am very happy to notethat the Ministry of Plantation Industries has about 20 Boardsand Institutions coming under it. So I hope that you are not acardboard Minister, I know that. Please make sure that youuse the Ministrys recources for the benefit of this country.

I would like to mention the fact that Mr. Lakshman Kiriellaappointed me as the Chairman, when I was the Deputy

Minister of Plantation Industries, to head a Committee toinvestigate into measures to be taken to improve the rubberindustry. In that Committee, one of the main proposals thatwe made was to impose a cess on rubber because we felt atthat time the rubber prices were picking up and it wasnecessary to revive the industry. But funds were lacking. Wefelt that the Treasury and the Government was not givengenough support to the rubber industry. At that time the ideaof a cess on tea was there. As you know, the cess on tea comesto about Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 million a year. It is divided intothree aspects ; the Tea Research Institute. the Tea Board andthe Ministry of Plantation Industries. So we felt that cess onrubber would be of importance to revive the lagging rubberindustry and I do not know whether it is from that Committeereport that this idea has come in.

3 . , , .Today I would say, out of these three industries the rubberindustry is the industry that has suffered the most. Tea, as youwould know, is doing very well. We are getting record pricesfor tea. The management companies re managing the estatesvery well. There are issues, but those issues can be resolved.The coconut industry is also doing relatively well. But therubber industry is the one that has suffered the most.

If you look at the overall macro-economic picture of therubber industry in the world, today the demand for rubber isin value added rubber products. If you look at the tyre industryin the world you will see how competitive it is and what thecost structure of the industry are. Look at the importation oftyres from countries like Korea, Malaysia and Japan. In ourcountry we are not producing a single good tyre for the localmarket. Why are we not looking at these things? We hadKelani Tyres earlier. Now it is managed by an Indian company.When we have a domestic market in Sri Lanka and when wehave rubber in Sri Lanka we must look at the cost structuresto make this rubber industry competitive. As I mentionedearlier, the cost structures are too high. The investments aretoo high. So how can Sri Lanka become a manufacturingcentre for rubber? It cannot. SO we must go for value addedservices. We must make sure that we have investments comingin for the rubber industry and we must encourage value addedservices and value added production in the rubber industry.This is the only way forward. Otherwise we will just lagbehind compared to the other countries in the region who arealso rubber producers. Particularly Malaysia has investedheavily in the rubber industry and has gone was ahead of us.

Sir, what happens is, when the rubber prices are goodeverybody gets active. Now what is happening in the teaindustry? When the tea prices come down they invest inrubber. This cannot go on. If ou want a sustainable agriculturalindustry, if y ou want a sustainable plantation industry, youmust have continuous investment otherwise you cannotsustain it.

In the 70s we had a good rubber industry. Then in the 80sand the 90s it came down. Now again the prices have pickedup and people are investing again in the industry. Whenhappens when the prices come down again? Are we going tolost interest again? No! Through this cess that is being imposedand the money that is coming in we mustmake sure that theinvestments this cess that is being imposed and the moneythat is coming in we must make sure that the investments aremade in the correct way. THis is; in technology, research anddevelopment. We must of course have an incentive regimefor people who want to invest in the rubber industry.

I mentioned earlier about Lalanka Rubber. It is doing verywell because the management structure is very good. Theyare controlling their costs, and they are going for higher valueadded goods. This is the way forward.

If the Hon. Minister can conceptualize a way forward forthe rubber industry with his experts, then I think many goals

can be achieved. But if the Minister is going to allow, forexample, certain individuals to monopolize and dictate therubber industry, then it is not going to work.

What I am saying is that the Hon. Minister should have amacro-picture and a conceptualized vision for the rubberindustry to take it forward. I am very optimistic about therubber industry in Sri Lanka. I think, it is an industry whichhas been neglected for long time but which can be revived.

There are three main districts ; Kegalle, Kalutara andRatnapura that are depending on the rubber industry. If youcan revive the rubber industry in these three districts youwill be able to generate employment as well. What I am sayingis, the rubber prices are good now, make use of this for thebenefit of the rubber industry. How are you going to do that ?

You have taken the first step by imposing the cess. So,make sure that the cess money that is coming in is propoerlyutilzed for research and development and I would also sayfor marketing. Because the local companies have not got thestrength to have marketing operations overseas. When Hon.Lakshmane Kiriella was the Ministery of Plantation Industrieswe were on the verge of forming the Rubber Cluster. Is thisRubber Cluster active or not ? I would like to know that. Tea,as you know, is more of a health drink now and is marketed asa health drind. Like that you have to think of new ways ofmarketing rubber. Sir Lanka has natural latex. Its RSS qualityis very good. So, now we must look at new markets. I do notsay that the Government can do all that because theGoovernment has no funds to do international marketingoperations. But, through the Rubber Cluster you can look atprocedures and methodologies to have marketing operationsand enhance private companies to do the marketing.

When we were in power and when Hon. Lakshman Kiriellawas the Minister of Plantation Industries we were able tonegotiate a grant of US Dollars 20 million from the ADB fortea marketing. I do not know whether that is now active ornot. We established the Tea Councial and we were able to doa lot through that. I do not know whether that is active now.But certainly for rubber, you need to bring all the stakeholderstogether. What I find most unfortunate in these industries,particularly tea, rubber and coconut is, that the stakeholdersdo not get together. They have divergent views and divergentinterests. One persons interest is not as same as the others.That was one of the most difficult problems that the Hon.Lakshman Kiriella and I faced. I think you are facing thesame problem. Most of the interst groups in the industry donot come together. You have to bring them together. Youhave to motivate them and also give them the leadership andsay that the overall interest of this particular industry dependson their unity. That is very important.

I hope that you will be able to bring all stakeholders in therubber industry together and have an open forum with them,perhaps once a month. Discuss issues with them ; discussaspects of financing, discuss aspects of management and

10051006

marketing and also discuss how to revive the rubber industry.One of the other problems is the acreage. How are you goingto release new lands for the rubber industry ? Earlier thelands were sold for other purposes because they were notcommercially viable. Now they are, commercially viableagain. So , how are you going to get the acreage ? Well, thecompanies will have to buy the land if they want to grow. Wedo not live an era where the market is controlled. It is a freemarket now. It depends on supply and demand. Then you cancome up with an incentive scheme for investment in the rubberindustry. Perhaps you can have a cradit scheme or give themloans.

Thise are the things which you can discuss. But, what I fellis that, we have a potential industry which can be revived,which we had in our lands and which we lost. Get it backagain immediately. Use it again for the benefit of this country.I think many improve ments, can be made. I think this is anindustry which has a lot of potential. You have to get theprivate enterprises and companies involved and you have tomotivate them. You have to give them incentives. They willcome to you and you have to be accommodative and beflexible. You cannot be taking rigid stands and you cannotbe taking idelogical stands. You have to be practical. Youhave to look at the world and see where the world is going.

This is all I have to say in a very short time. Our cooperationis available anytime you need it. You have to get everybodytogether. There is no politics in this. This is an agriculaturalproduce that can bring in an enormous revenue to thiscountry. There is no politics in this. Take our ideas. Takeeverybodys ides and I hope you have the courage to makethese reforms for the benefit of this country.

Thank you.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Regarding the statement made by the hon. NavinDissanayeke, I would like to mention this just for the purposeof record. Today we are producing one of the best tyres in thewould. In terms of hard tyre production we are leading theworld and the Sri Lankan producers are already in it. TheJinasena Group of Companies is doing it. The DSI Group ismanufacturing rubber related products in big way and theRIchard Peiris and Company is alrady into it and the FiatCompany is having a leading market in terms of rubber tyresin the world and we are encouraging that trend.

At the same time the world market is booming now withChina coming in as a major industrial base. I think, we couldbe very optimistic about the market potential for rubberrelated products in the future. We are now encouraging eventhe car accessaories sector. We are today supplying rubberrelated accessories to the motor industry like Chrysler and so

[ ]on.I am also looking forward to set up another zone in theKegalle District totally devoted for rubber production andrubber related produce. That is what I want to place on recordin relation to how we are approaching the development ofthe rubber sector through the Board of Investment forinvestment genration and exports.

Thank you.
