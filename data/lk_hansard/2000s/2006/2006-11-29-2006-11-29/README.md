( )( + - )(The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam - Deputy Minister of EstateInfrastructure Development)Mr. Deputy Chairman, the Ministry of EstateInfrastructure had prepared a three-year Investment Planin 2005 and obtained Cabinet approval forimplementation. This three-year plan was prepared inconsultation with the main the stakeholders who areinterested in socio-economic development of theplantation community. The very purpose of this three-year Investment Plan was to reduce the existing gapbetween the mainstream and the plantation community.Based on this three-year Investment Plan, an extraallocation of Rs. 2,000 million was made in addition tothe Rs. 1,500 million in 2006.

On the request of the Ministry of Finance, the three-year Investment Plan was converted into a ten-yearNational Action Plan with technical assistance from the

UNDP. I am happy to note that the National Action Plan,which outlines the investment needs for uplifting theplantation community has been incorporated in the ten-year plan presented by His Excellency the President, whois also the Minister of Finance, when he presented the2007 Budget in Parliament.

I wish to place on record that the National Action Planfor social development of the plantation community hasbeen submitted for Cabinet approval and I am sure thatthat will be approved by the Cabinet since the contentsof this National Action Plan has been included in theoverall A Ten Year Horizon, Development Framework2006-2016, which was presented with the Budget.

In the ten-year plan, Rs. 90,000 million has beenearmarked as public investment for plantation communitydevelopment. However, the allocation to be made to theMinistry for 2007 is Rs. 2,500 million. This allocationwill be made for education, health, vocational training,estate housing development, water supply, estate roaddevelopment and electricity to the plantation community.But, no allocation has been made for communitydevelopment programmes. Therefore, I earnestly requestthe Minister of Finance to allocate another Rs. 60 millionfor the development of sports, culture and othercommunity development programmes.

To co-ordinate the envisaged investment for theplantation community in the coming ten-year period,foreign donor-funded projects will have to be initiated.Sufficient domestic funds also have to be provided. It isonly through the expected investment that the existinggap between the plantation community and the othersectors could be narrowed. I appeal to the invternationalfunding agencies and the Ministry of Finance to look atproviding sufficient funds to fulfil the expectations ofthe National Action Plan. To co-ordinate the investmentprogramme among the Line Agencies and the otherstakeholders, a National Secretariat has to be established.I seek the assistance of the UNDP for the establishment ofthe Secretariat.

I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency thePresident Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Secretary to theTreasury, Dr. P. B. Jayasundera, for having included thechapter New Life for Plantation Workers Communityin the overall ten-year plan of the Government. This is inline with the policy document Maninda Chintana. Ihope the aspirations of the plantation community will befulfilled during the tenure of His Excellency MahindaRajapaksa as President of this country.

Mr. Chairman, on this occasion as I moved the cut ofRs. 10 in respect of the Votes of the Ministry of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion, I would like torecognize that this is a Ministry which has a vital role toplay in the context of economic development in our countrytoday. It is the responsibility of the Hon. RohithaBogollagama to attract into the country large volumes ofinvestment, which would energize the economy and resultin the creation of employment. These are all matters inrespect of which crucial responsibilities are assigned to theMinistry of Enterprise Development and InvestmentPromotion.

The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama and I worked closelywith regard to some of these matters during the Governmentof the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe duringthe period December 2001 to April 2004.

In the light of my own experience gathered from thefunctioning of this Ministry during that period, I would liketo make some suggestions in respect of the institutionscoming under the purview of the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama.

20532054

[ . . ]I make these suggestions in a constructive spirit and I hopethat what I say will be of some assistance to the Ministerin evaluating the progress which has been made byinstitutions under his purview and in charting a course inthe national interest for the future.

I think the most important institution, without doubt,coming under the Minister of Enterprises Development andInvestment Promotion is the Board of Investment. The Boardof Investment is the nerve centre. As far as the Board ofInvestment is concerned, I think there are some structuralmatters which require the attention of the Hon. Minister andthe House.

During the period of the Government of the then PrimeMinister Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, there was a salutarystep that was taken to bring the Board of Investment andthe Export Development Board under the aegis of the sameMinister. That was not the case in the past. I think that wasa very welcome development because these are twoinstitutions that need to work in tandem: they have to pooltheir resources; they have to co-ordinate their programmesof action and they need to work, I think, under the co-ordination and control of a single Minister. That has beenaccomplished. However, if we compare the structuralframework of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka withthe comparable institution in the Republic of Singapore,which has been phenomenally successful as the Hon.Minister would no doubt agree, there are some matterswhich, I think, need to be addressed. The whole point ofthe Board of Investment of course was to offer a one-stopshop. Investors come here; they are not driven from pillarto post; they can go to one institution and they can obtainall the facilities and resources which they require in orderto make a success of the investment that they propose toundertake.

However, as the Board of Investment is structured in thiscountry and having regard to the authority that is availableto the Board of Investment in terms of the empoweringlegislation, there are certain crucial constraints which donot apply in Singapore. The Hon. Minister and his officialscan approve a project. However, there are other facilitiesthat the investor would require: he wants electricity; hewants land; he wants telephone facilities; he requires alabour force. Of course, the Minister will do everything inhis power to help and I am aware that the Board of Investmenthas some very capable officials with some of whom I hadthe pleasure of working. They will collectively do theirutmost to assist the investor. But, the fact remains that inSri Lanka the Board of Investment does not have the poweron its own to give an electricity connection, to find landon its own responsibility for the investor. The Hon. RohithaBogollagame would have to go to some of his CabinetColleagues. He would certainly activate the machinery, buthe cannot deliver on his own responsibility, not throughany fault of his, but because the empowering legislationdoes not confer that authority upon him.

The situation is entirely different in Singapore. There,the Board of Investment and the equivalent institutions can,on their own responsibility, deliver. So, that is a great boonto investors. We are living in a highly competitiveinternational environment and I think that the effetivenessof the Board of Investment has to be increased by taking alook at the provisions of the applicable legislation, seeingwhat are the gaps, what are the lacunae that now exist andwhat are the ways in which we can enhance the authorityof the Board of Investment quite properly in order to fulfilthe objectives, for the accomplishment of which the Boardof Investment was established. So, that is one point thatI would like to make.

I think the Hon. Minister would be aware of this. Duringthe period that I refer to, a decision was made in the caseof large investments to identify one single officer of theBoard to be in charge of the investment from its inceptionuntil its very conclusion. So, the investor would not haveto go from one department to another in the Board ofInvestment, but there would be one official of the Boardwho is identified as being responsible for the satisfactoryfunctioning of the project in all its ramifications. That isthe kind of step that is useful in order to increase thecapacity and the effectiveness of the Board of Investment.

I have been talking so far about delivery, abouteffectiveness. But in our country today, the question ofsocial equity is also equally important and I would like toshare my insights on this matter with the Hon. Minister. Asthe Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama is well aware, the legislationestablished under the regime of the late President J. R.Jayewardene had at its origin the carving out of certaingeographical regions for the establishment of Free TradeZones. So, those were islets within which completelydifferent legislative regimes were applicable. In the rest ofthe country, you had certain regulations governing labour,governing taxation, governing customs, but there wereimmunities and privileges that were consciously anddeliberately created in respect of the Free Trade Zones thatwere established. So, the creterion at that time wasgeographical; a separate and distinct regime applied inrespect of these geographical regions. But in the course oftime, there was a gradual expansion of this and some ofthese privileges were then conferred outside these zones oncertain projects that were considered important enough towarrant special treatment.

As a result of this, in the fullness of time was a creationof a dichotomy, a total dichotomy. You had certain industriesset up by local entrepreneurs, for example, that weregoverned by one legal regime. Then you had an entirelydifferent, much more advantageous and an indinitely morefavourable regime applicable to industries and other venturesthat came within the purview of the Board of Investment.So, there was this sharply contrasting position between thesetwo sectors. This has led to very considerable problems.There has been a lot of heartburn on the part of the investors

2006 2920552056

who were excluded from this. Attempts have been made overtime to equalize some of this in a particular way. Especiallyacute problems have arisen in respect of the applicabilityof a separate customs regime. I am not for a momentquestioning the need for certain special privileges andimmunities to be granted where the investment entailssubstantial economic benefits to the country. But at thesame time, we have to make certain that there is noperception in the public mind that large investors fromabroad are treated in a very special way and that thosebenefits are deliberately withheld as a matter of Governmentpolicy from local entrepreneurs who, within the constraintsnecessarily applicable to them, have also rendered yeomanservice in promoting the economic development of ourcountry. Sir, there is here a problem of perception relatingto social equity, As the Hon. Minister feels a need to caterto an ever-increasing number of industries the spectrum isgetting wider and wider. Now, the essential challenge is tomaintain quality in a situation where numbers are increasingand the area in respect of which delivery is essential isbecoming increasingly more extensive. This of course, isnot an unfamiliar problem in terms of social policy. As theVice-Chancellor of one of the largest universities in thiscountry, the University of Colombo, this is one of the centralchallenges which I faced. When I entered the Faculty oflaw as a student, there were 17 people in our batch studyinglaw and the late Prof. Nadarajah thought that this was a verylarge batch because he was accustomed to batches of ten.When I was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo,a typical batch in the faculty consisted of about 270students. That is necessary. That is an essential aspect ofdemocracy. The base has to get wider and wider. You cannotconfine higher education in the professional disciplines toa small group of students coming from a privilegedbackground. At the time I entred the Faculty of Law therewas a compulsory requirement relating to Latin. In the FirstExamination in Laws there was a compulsory paper in Latinand there were only five schools in the country that taughtLatin. So, that is not a situation that can endure. You maybe able to maintain the highest possible standards in thatkind of environment but the demands of democracy willundoubtedly prove overriding very repidly. That hashappened in the sphere of industrial development. So thechallenge then, is while preserving the quality that isexpected of the Board of Investment also to ensure that theseresources and privileges are not exclusively available inthat narrow sector and to broaden access to these advantagesalso to local investors who do not qualify in terms of thecriteria applicable to the Board of Investment. So, I thinkthe point relating to social equity is as important as thepoint relating to the effectiveness of the institutions comingunder the purview of the Hon. Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion. Now, this sameproblem with regard to social equity is inherent in the needto spread the net over as wider an area of the Island aspossible.

We are legitimately proud of the fact that the per capitaincome of Sri Lanka has now passed the US Dollars 1,000barrier. Of course, this has a downside as well. We do not

now qualify for concessionary loans from the Bretton Woodsinstitutions. We cannot qualify for concessionary loans fromthe World Bank, the International Monerary Fund and othermultilateral institutions but that is an achievement. Our percapita income is US Dollars 1,000. So, we are ahead of mostof the countries in this region but there is something elsethat we cannot be proud of. That is the acute disparitieswithin the Republic of Sri Lanka. Many of the fruitfuleconomic and industrial ventures are located in the WesternProvince, in the Districts of Colombo, Gampaha andKalutara. If you compare the per capita income of the Districtof Colombo with the per capita income of Monaragala, forexample, or Hambantota the ratio is something like 6:1. Itcould even be more at this point of time. So that is aproblem which needs to be redressed and it is done by theBoard of Investment and by other institutions by means ofcertain fiscal incentives that are offered. When I was DeputyMinister of Finance, I presented five budgets consecutivelyto this august Assembly. In many of those budgets wegranted extensive concessions to investors who wereprepared to operate outside Colombo. If they were preparedto go to Polonnaruwa or Monaragala or Anuradhapura orsome areas of the Badulla District they were entitled to fiscalconcessions far more generous than the concessionsavailable to investors in and around Colombo, in the vicinityof the capital city. Now, these concessions were at that timeresisted to some extent by the Bretton Woods institutions.They gave us the traditional advice that this is not the wayto set about it but there I think that the culture of a countryhas a role to play. There are no universal panaceas. Whatmay have succeeded in one culture, in one socialenvironment is not necessarily applicable or effective in theContext of Conditions that Prevail in Sri Lanka. For betteror for worse, potential investors in this country have gotaccustomed to this culture of monetary incentives. Of course,when the minister offers an incentive, it is at the expenseof the national Exchequer. There is a diminution of publicrevenue. But then, it is a matter of the cost benefit ratio.You are sacrificing something in terms of revenue yield.But at the same time you are creating opportunities foremployment and there are other tangible and intangiblebenefits that flow from the investment. It is therefore aquestion of attempting a comparative evaluation orassessment of what is given up and the advantages that areanticipated in the future.

However - my own experience at that time and I haveno doubt the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama has the sameexperience - we can offer whatever incentives we like, butif it takes an investor four hours to get to Kandy, or eightand a half hours to get to Badulla because the roads arebad, the infrastructure is poor or inadequate, then the fiscalincentives on their own will not be successful in generatingthe kind of investment which we want in the relativelyundeveloped areas of Sri Lanka. After all our objective isto ensure a certain quality of life for our people as a whole,not just for people living in the urban sector. We do notwant in increase the chasm between the rural and the urban

20572058

[ . . ]cultures. That is an exceedingly dangerous phenomenonas this country has discovered to its cost, for example,during the period 1989 to 1991, when the country came toa grinding halt for reasons connected with that phenomenon.

One other matter which I would like to refer to is a verycontentious issue of policy that has provoked a vigorousdebate in respect of the functions of many of the institutionscoming under the purview of the Ministry of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion. This has to do withthe concept of globalization. Many people tell us, Openthe floodgates. Follow the Bretton Woods philosophy to thefull. Do not have protective barriers. This is how countriesdevelop. Examples are taken from Deng Xiaoping in China,Narasimha Rao in India, the recent experience of Vietnamand we are told Do away with all these protective barriersand mechanisms and open the floodgates.

I do not think that that is an entirely valid philosophy.We do not live in a world that is governed by absolute values.I think some degree of protection is necessary for Sri Lanka.We have to help the local entrepreneur. After all, considerwhat he pays for electricity in this country and compare thatwith what is paid by an investor having the same kind ofbusiness in India. Sometimes, the cost here may be five, sixperhaps eight times as much as the cost that has to be incurredby an Indian investor.

Ever since the time of Pundit Nehru, there was a policy inIndia which granted extensive concessions to income derivedfrom agriculture. Income derived from agriculture in Indiawas generally not aggregated with other income. So therewas an incentive to produce agricultural products. That wasnot the case in Sri Lanka. So, there are differences of this kindand I think the small industrialist in this country require alegitimate measure of protection. Otherwise, the dangerousconsequence is this. Everbody will go for trading and not formanufacturing. Rather than manufacture a bicycle in SriLanka if you can import that bicycle from India or from someother country and make the same profit, then there is noincentive to take to manufacturing. If that happens, the firstcasualty is employment because employment opportunitiesare connected with manufacturing, not with trading. Tradingis relatively easy, you open a letter of credit; you rent anoffice, you have no labour problems, you do not haveproblems connected with money that is borrowed from banks.So, I think a balance needs to be struck. This is one of theessential elements of social policy in that area. I do not thinkthat one needs to follow the traditional Bretton Woodsphilosophy of opening the floodgates indiscriminately. Infact writers like Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs have criticizcd thetraditional Bretton Woods approach in this area and this issomething that we need to bear in mind as we formulateindustrial policy in Sri Lanka for the future.

Then I would like to conclude with some remarks whichI am certain that the Hon. Minister will agree with. I knowthat he is trying hard to attract investment into the country inrather challenging circumstances. But whatever we do, the

ultimate result is going to depend on the perception ofstability in the country. It is not possible in a highlycompetitive international environment to attract investmentinto this country if there is a perception of violence. If bombsare going off, if there are suicide missions and if potentialinvestors abroad read of calamities occurring on a weekly ordaily basis in this country, that is hardly an environment thatis conducive to enhanced investment in this country whateverunrelenting efforts may be made by the Hon. Minister andhis officials. Consequently there is an intimate and inevitableconnection between the success of investment promotionpolicy in this country on the one hand and the peace processon the other. I am gled that the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagamahas participated in the last two rounds of peace talks thatwere held in Geneva with the Liberation Tigers of TamilEelam and I am sure that nobody is more acutely aware thanhe is of the need to make substantial progress in that field asa necessary condition for achieving even moderate sucesswith regard to investment promotion in Sri Lanka. WhatI would suggest is this approach. The problem is socomplicated that it is not amenable to an instant solution.One cannot realistically grapple with all the different facetsof the problem and hope to sort it all out immediately. Soprioritization is important. Let us decide where we need tobegin. Especially, as far as investment promotion isconcerned, the need of the hour is not a final solution.Obviously that is going to take time. But the need of the houris tranquility on the ground. There must be peace on theground. Therefore, the fragility of the Ceasefire Agreement, Iwould respectfully suggest, is a matter that requires urgentattention today. Let us collectively, all of us togeher doeverything on our part to ensure that the Ceasefire Agreementis protected. Let there be peace in the counry, while we addressthese substantive issues connected with the evolution of afinal negotiated settlement at the political level. So theceasefire is the most important thing in terms of attractinginvestments. Now the ceasefire through nobodys fault, it ispart of the inevitability of things, is undoubtedly going tothe fragile if there is no prospect for the resumption ofsubstantive talks at some point in the foreseeable future.Otherwise, you have a ceasefire which is unconnected withany expectation of the resumption of talks in the future. Thisis a dangerous situation. As the Hon. Minister is well aware, aceasefire is not the final solution at all. It is only a temporarydevice for enabling the parties to address the substantiveissues in an atmosphere that is relatively devoid of tensionand strain. So you have the ceasefire and that gives the partiesthe space that they need, the opportunity that they require toaddress the substantive issues. But if there are not talks takingplace and if there is no reasonable expectation that the talksare going to happen at some foreseeable time in the future,then necessarily and inevitably the ceasefire is going to befragile. So, that is a reality that we need to bear in mind andswe need to address that reality as best we can. So what Iwould suggest sequentially in terms of chronology is let usstart with the ceasefire, let us use that ceasefire to address thesubstantive issues. Now there is great deal of reference todayto the Indian model.

2006 2920592060

I think really the Indian Model is an illusive concept. Butthere are some features of the Constitution of India whichcan be extracted and adapted as the foundation of a solutionin this country, not everything that is contained in theConstitution of India. There are some features of it which areobviously not helpful in the Sri Lankan context. So, hereagain, one has to be selective and discriminative. By allmeans, look at the experience of others. There is no need toreinvent the wheel. But we must have the imagination andthe creativity to adopt that experience to suit thecircumstances which are characteristic of the nationalcondition of Sri Lanka. So, that, I think, is a way we shouldset about it.

The Memorandum of Understanding that was concludedon the 23rd of October between the Sri Lanka Freedom Partyand the United National Party provides us with a point ofdeparture. What is important is not the parchment on whichthis Agreement is written, but the political will to makepractical use of that unique opportunity which has presenteditself.

To my mind, if the Memorandum of Understanding is tobe useful and productive, it must contain two features.Without which there is a real danger that it will be confinedto a mere political document devoid of practical substance.The two features that I have in mind are the following. Thefirst is a common national agenda. The United NationalParty and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party must agree on thebasic elements of a national agenda in respect of the ethnicissue. The second feature which to my mind is absolutelyessential is a mechanism to implement this Agreement onthe ground. Otherwise, you have a series of pious aspirationswithout any practical mechanism to operationalize theAgreement in pragmatic terms. So, these are two featureswhich to my mind are absolutely essential.

Nelson Mandela did something very dramatic on theselines in South Africa in 1993. He found a country that wasliterary burning. He then said, Let all the political partiescome together, not for all time and not agreeing oneverything; that is impossible to do. But let us select theareas which are absolutely vital for the national well-beingat that time and let us agree on a set of policies within thoserestricted areas for a temporary period. Then, on the basisnot of expediency but of collective responsibility, let usaddress those issues during that period; after which we willbe able to go our separate ways.

So, I would like to conclude with that thought, Mr.Chairman. I think, this is a way to set about it. We need torecognize the gravity of the national situation. It is certainlynot hopeless. It is not beyond resumption. It is well withinthe ingenuity and the collective resources of our countryto come up with practical solutions. But we have torecognize that these are situations that call for new thinkingand innovative approaches away from the beaten track. ButSri Lanka is unique in terms of the calibre of its humanresources and I have every confidence that we will be ableto rise to this challenge.

So, with those words, I would like to congratulate theHon. Minister on what he has done, on what he isendeavouring to do. I wish him well. I think some of thedevelopments which have occurred, particularly in therelationship between the two major parties during the lastmonth, constitute a happy augury for the future. I hopethe Hon. Minister every success in addressing the dauntingtasks that lie ahead.

Thank you, Sir.

. . ( )( [ - )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala Minister ofParliamentary Affairs)

Mr. Chairman, I am happy to follow my learned Friend,the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris who as usual made a goodcontribution to this Committee Stage Discussion. Hiscontribution is from the point of view of his own experience.I agree with him that peace is vital and fundamental forfurther expansion of industrial activity and investmentpromotion in this country.

Mr. Chairman, it is with pleasure that I intervene in thisCommittee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministryof Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion.

As the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris succinctly explained, bothinvestment promotion and enterprise development, in myview, are important areas of development in the presentcontext of the impact of globalization. Since Independence,not much attention has been paid to the formulation of anambitious industrial policy in this country. As far as mymemory goes, it was the 10 Year Plan which called for theadoption of an ambitious industrial policy in this country.Though some progress took place during this particularperiod, it was with the creation of the investment promotionzones under the Board of Investment that an attempt hasbeen made to industrialize the country with direct foreigninvestment or foreign participation.

Since Sri Lanka is a small country with a population ofnearly 20 million, the country has to construct an industrialbase with a network of labour intensive industries whichwith foreign assistance could enter the global market. Mr.Chairman, UNIDO Report of 2000 argued that Sri Lankahas a good potential for industrialization and it dependedon a number of factors. Sri Lanka should try to establishindustries with a global focus. Sri Lanka, in my view, needsto device its industrial policy to cover two important

20612062

[ . . ]sectors. Firstly, the small and medium industries for whichattention has been paid where the local industries can bemade competitive to face competition in the domesticmarket. Secondly, BOI assistance could be given to largeindustries which can enter the global market and it is inthis sector that we need to pursue an ambitious enterprisedevelopment policy and investment promotion policy.

Since Independence Mr. Chairman, the country has beenfacing this problem of lack of much entrepreneurial activity.In this context, through the Board of Investment Sri Lankaneeds to device policies to attract Foreign DirectInvestments, the FDI. BOI has been set up for this particularpurpose. According to the Central Bank Report, ForeignDirect Investment flows reached a record level of US Dollars272 million in 2005. In the year 2004, it was US Dollars223 million. A major portion of this went to 69 projects inthe area of infrastructure development. This is to whichthe Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris referred. Infrastructure needsto be developed if we are to attract more foreign investors.Foreign investments continued to assist the apparel industry.Leading lending institutions assisted a number of industries.Asian Development Bank, Mr. Chairman, provided USDollars 198 million. International DevelopmentAssociation provided US Dollars 113 million. TheGovernment of Japan provided US Dollars 198 million.Citicorp Investment Bank gave us US Dollars 100 millionand European Investment Bank gave us US Dollars 17.9million. Number of projects approved by the BOI underSection 17 of the BOI Act decreased to 223 investmentprojects with a foreign investment commitment of US Dollars276 million. In the year 2004, 269 projects were approvedwith an investment commitment of US Dollars 689 million.In my view Mr. Chairman, the general political instabilityin the country, as the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris emphasized,may have contributed to this decline in investment. BOIneeds to give more consideration to promote regionallybalanced growth, again a matter to which the Hon. (Prof.)G. L. Peiris referred, a balanced growth in the economy andthis could be done by drastically changing the WesternProvince centred industrial development policy. In orderto effect such a change more infrastructure development hasto be undertaken and Mahinda Rajapaksa Regime isengaged in this task. New incentives have to be providedand I am told that the BOI has introduced a package of newincentives.

The current global economic scenario is such that nocountry can alleviate poverty through development withoutpaying much attention to direct foreign investment. Allemerging economies including China and Vietnam havedone this and it has now become a global process.

Fredrick Mishkin in his latest book titled The NextGreat Globalization states, I quote :

Next globalization will be financial in character.

The flow of money into emerging economies. In otherwords capital should be free to flow from high incomecountries to low income poorer countries. In order to attractmore and more foreign capital for investment the countryneeds a better macroeconomic environment. I think, thatis in place.

In my view, BOI must make adjustments in policy toattract more direct foreign investment. In the developingcountries with the newly liberalized trade and investmentpolicies foreign investment began flowing inside theemerging economies particularly, China, Vietnam and othercountries.

Incidentally - I am sure that the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peirisis aware of it I need to tell this as well. The author of Free Market Policies, Mr. Milton Friedman died onNovember, 12th, last week, this year at the age of 94.Mr. Milton Friedman was the most influential economistof the second half of the Twentieth Century. No Sri Lankannewspaper mentioned it because Sri Lankan newspapers donot pay much attention to this kind of thing.

Foreign investment in the context of a developing countryhas become a source of external funding for economicdevelopment. Foreign investment, Mr. Chairman, can taketwo forms. They are,

(1) Investors can buy or take a direct interest in themanagement of an enterprise. This is an indirect formof investment.

(2) Direct foreign investment involves more than justbuying a share in an enterprise.

In other words the host country needs to devise a set ofpolicies to attract foreign investment. It is difficult to attractdirect foreign investment where there is a large Stateenterprises sector in a given country. I think, this is one ofour major problems. In other words, such industries haveto be protected; safeguarded. Safeguards have to beintroduced and such industries have to be protected fromforeign competition. This is a problem faced by manycountries with large State sector enterprises. One cannotjust dismantle them to allow the free flow of foreign capital.Here in this case, one has to look at it from the point ofview of a number of factors, not merely the national interestof a given country. There are other factors as well. On theother hand, the required level of economic developmentcannot be achieved, especially in a country like that of ourswithout foreign capital participation.

Millennium Development Goals, Mr. Chairman, requirethat aid flows be doubled to around US Dollars 100 billionper year. This is one of the estimates. As I mentioned earlier,foreign investment and aid alone cannot bring development,in any country for that matter. It requires changes in nationalpolicies and the BOI in my view, should take cognizanceof this fact when devising policies to attract more and moreforeign investment.

2006 2920632064

In respect of this matter, Mahinda Chintana has a policystrategy. Mahinda Chintana under the title AFlourishing Society Sustainable Development says this,I quote :

A national economic policy to be formulated by integrating thepositive attributes of the free market economy with domestic aspirationsto ensure a modern and balanced approach where domestic enterprisescan be supported while encouraging foreign investments.

The Mahinda Chintana proposes the establishment of12 new investment zones and several concessions to theforeign investor too have been proposed. Several Ministriesare interlinked to the programme of industrial expansionthrough large scale, medium scale and small scaleindustries. The lead role in the industrial expansionprogramme is with the Ministry of Enterprise Developmentand Investment Promotion as it is this Ministry which canprovide the required financial assistance to thisprogramme, specially through promotion of foreigninvestment.

Investment promotion, Mr. Chairman, in the presentcontext, in the given context, is an aspect of foreign policy.I need to stress this. In my view, Sri Lanka must breakawayfrom its traditional foreign policy posture and it needs toadjust its foreign policy to devote more attention to whatis called economic diplomacy. Our Foreign Office needsto specialize on economic diplomacy. In other words, SriLankas foreign policy priorities should change and moreattention has to be paid to such things as investmentpromotion, trade, tourism and direct foreign investment. Itis here in this context that this Ministry of the Hon.Rohitha Bogollagama needs to maintain a direct link withour Missions abroad and the foreign office bureaucracyneeds to be attuned to this important task of investmentpromotion.

Concluding I would like to say that, the Hon. Minister,one of the energetic Ministers in our Government has boththe ability and capacity to provide proper leadership tothis Ministry which is vital and fundamental in theeconomic development process of this country.

Thank you.

( )( - )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of PlanImplementation)

Madam Presiding Member, I am indeed privileged tospeak a few words on this very important Ministry, veryimportant in the sense that it has a very able and dedicatedMinister, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, at the helm. Alsothis Ministry is very vital to the economic developmentof our country. A cursory glance at its Performance Reportthat has been presented today gives us the institutions thatcome under this Ministry: the Board of Investment of SriLanka, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the SriLanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation, the Gem andJewellery Authority and a wide range of institutions, eachof which is playing a vital role in the development of thecountry.

Now let us look at what these institutions are tasked with.It is a wide range of subjects. For instance, the Board ofInvestment is tasked with getting Foreign Direct Investmentinto the country. Despite certain criticisms levelled by Hon.Members, we must look at the way the institutions havefunctioned. Talking of the Board of Investment, it iscommon knowledge that we had a foreign investment ofUS Dollars 270 million last year. What is the figure up tonow? A figure of US Dollars 300 million was expected upto August. But today it has reached over US Dollars 600million. The achievement is from US Dollars 270 millionlast year up to US Dollars 600 million, despite varioussetbacks we have had in the country. We are talking offighting against the international media mafia which is

saying that Sri Lanka is not safe for investment; theinvestment climate is not good. Despite all that, thisinstitution has been able to bring in US Dollars 600 millionworth of investments into the country. When we are lookingat investments, we should not look at only the monetarypart of it.

( )(The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)Madam, I rise to a point of Order. Is that figure of USDollars 600 million the total investments up to now?

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)

Yes. But, that is not a point of Order. I think thePresiding Member can give a ruling whether that is a pointof Order.

( )(The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)

I just want a clarification. Hon. Minister?

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)

Do you want a clarification from me?

( )(The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)Yes, yes. From you, Hon. Minister.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I am very happy to state that the figure has been USDollars 341 million for the first eight months. The forecastis that by 31st December, 2006 it will go over US Dollars600 million.

( )(The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)What is the estimation till December?

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

To give the estimation till December, we have to collectthe figures. You just cannot get it over the telephone. Wehave to call for the figures; the figures have to come to us,they have to be audited and they have to be verified.

2006 2920712072

( )(The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)

I want to know whether it would be above US Dollars600 million.

( )

(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Yes, yes. I will announce in January the US Dollars 600million achievement.

( )(The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara)

Okay, thank you.

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)

When I was interrupted by a point of Order, I was talkingabout the investments coming into the country. It shouldnot be looked at only from a monetary point of view. Lookat the employment generated and the institutions andfactories that are going to be set up. Those areas are goingto be developed. This is the sort of thing that we have tolook at. Of course, there are the expenses. There is criticismlevelled at the Board of Investment over its expenditure.There have to be expenses. If you pay peanuts, you willget only monkeys, it is said. Therefore, we have to spendif we are to expect some development in our country.

Look at the other institution. While one institutionbrings in investments, what is the other institution, theExport Development Board, tasked with? Not only theforeign investors, but also our local producers and exportersare being facilitated by the Export Development Board toexport their products to countries which are traditionalbuyers and by finding new markets for them. It is not onlywith their export products - I am personally aware of thisbecause I was the Deputy Minister of this Ministry duringlast year - that the Export Development Board helps, but italso goes to the extent of reaching out to the exporter andteaching him the new and novel methods of preservation,packing and how to make the end of product attractive tothe consumer.

Another very important institution that comes under thisMinistry is the National Gem and Jewellery Authority. Ourcountry has been blessed with gems. But we were notproperly making use of the resources of the gem sector.We were not giving enough incentives, especially to theminers. The miners are now being benefited by the newand innovative programmes that have been brought up bythe National Gem and Jewellery Authority.

Now, I will just mention the export performance on gemsup to October, 2006. In 2005, the export performance ongems was Rs. 5,882 million, but in 2006 it has gone up to

Rs. 8,157 million. Look at the vast difference. From 6,000to 8,000, the difference may look as just 2,000. But, wetalk in millions of rupees. It is Rs. 2,000 million or Rs.2 billion, an 18 per cent increase year on year. That is thesort of leadership that has been given by the Hon. Ministerto the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, enabling themto increase this.

Now look at the jewellery sector which is more usefulto the country because that gives more employmentopportunities to the people who are manufacturing jewellarywith gems. Gem studded jewellery exports have gone upby 30 per cent year on year. Earlier, the export performanceon diamond jewellery was only Rs. 338 million and now ithas gone up to Rs. 591 million. Now what is the exporttarget that has been set? It is, overall, Rs. 40 billion forthe current year. The overall growth rate in the gem sectorhas been a staggering 15 per cent. I am told that the targetfor the next year is Rs. 60 billion. All this is our wealthlying in the earth. We need much more innovative methods.I do not say that we have got the best methods at the moment.There are certain issues, environment-related issues due towhich we are not able to get the best out of what is lyingin the earth. We should make use of new technology. I,for one, am a firm believer that we should use machineryto mine the gems that are there. I know that we may haveto look into various other aspects also: the social aspects.But using machinery to mine the gems that are lying inour earth would be one thing that we may have to look atin the future.

Madam, some of the new schemes that have been broughtin by the Ministry are worth mentioning in this augustAssembly. We can bring new investors into the country.We say we can bring them in, make products and export,but there is another thing that has been happening; a veryalarming thing: Our exporters, our entrepreneurs have beengoing out of the country to set up businesses elsewhere.We hear of local companies going to India to set up theirbusinesses, but what does the Ministry do? The Ministryhas come up with a new scheme of private-publicpartnership. Take, for instance, the Horana Export Zonewhere with Brandix a private-public partnership has beenset up, which will go up very soon, I am told. TheThulhiriya Factory was closed down resulting in a numberof people being unemployed and today that has beenhanded over to MAS Group, another company which wasalso going to take its business abroad. This Ministry hasnot only -

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Rs. 900 million have been paid as compensation.

20732074

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)

I am told by the Hon. Minister that Rs. 900 million hadbeen paid as compensation to the workers. This is the sortof innovative action that we have to think of. Let us, whilewe are discussing this today, be constructive in our criticism.Criticism has to be welcomed. I am sure the Hon. Ministeralso would not grudge criticism of the Ministry. But, ithas to be constructive criticism. Let us not talk aboutindividual officials of a particular Ministry because thoseofficials must be either sitting in the Officials Box or intheir offices with no right of reply. If we have issues, letus take them up with the Hon. Minister concerned and thentry to sort things out instead of targeting individuals whoare not in a position to reply to us.

In this export promotion exercise, another institution thatis playing a vital role is the Sri Lanka Export CreditInsurance Corporation. Look at the vast number of newschemes that have been brought in to help the exporter.Some of the schemes that are in operation help thoseexporters even in cases of default by importers. That helpsthe exporter. They do not have to worry about their moniesgetting blocked.

Another very important institution is the SME Bank. TheSME sector has been helped in various ways under theSMILE project by the SME Bank. But, of course, now I amtold that the micro credit factor, which was one of the mainthrust areas of the SME Bank, is now being slowly movedaway from it, except in special cases handled by theGovernment. Now, it is the small and medium enterprisesector that is benefitting. Before the setting up of theSME Bank, could anybody go to a bank and get even aloan of Rs. 250,000 without collateral?. Then, the first thingthat was asked was, Do you have a land? Where is thesmall or the medium entrepreneur going to get land from?But, a new concept was brought in by the SME Bank whereit looked at the project and not at the collateral. If theproject was viable, the monies were given and today thereare hundreds of people who swear by the SME Bank becausethey have been able not only to start projects, but also togo ahead with and improve on the projects that they hadalready started, which they were not able to do earlier dueto lack of funds.

Another institution is the Gem and Jewellery Researchand Training Institute. These institutions are all linked tothe economic development of our country. The Gem andJewellery Research and Training Institute is training ourlapidarists and gemologists. That, again, is going to be agreat boon to our country because our locally trained peopleare going to be of use to that sector.

One request that I would like to make to the Hon.Minister is to see whether we can get a direct Sri LankanAirlines flight to Madagascar, which is another very

important nation for the gem traders of our country. Ourgem traders who go there have to go via various countries.We also should have an embassy based in Madagascar,which will be of help to the gem traders of the country.

I know the Hon. Minister spared no pains in getting thegem and jewellery sector into the correct path. There arevarious concessions given in this Budget presented by HisExcellency the President, which we are discussing today.To protect the local jewellery industry, we managed to geta 15 per cent cess imposed on the importation of jewellery.This will give more impetus to the manufacture of localjewellery. An Economic Service Charge of 1 per cent hasbeen imposed on all local jewellery manufacturers. TheVAT rate on the supply of jewellery would be reduced from20 per cent to 5 per cent. Look at the benefits that are goingto flow into the jewellery sector.

( + )(The Presiding Member)

Order, please! Hon. Minister, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)

Give me just one more minute, Madam. I also, at thismoment, would like to thank the Chairpersons of the sixinstitutions I mentioned, which come under this Ministry,for the excellent work done by them, the support and thehelping hand given to the Hon. Minister, who is workingsingle handedly day and night for the upliftment of theMinistry. I found the Hon. Minister, when I tried to contacthim at 7 oclock or 8 oclock in the night, working at theWorld Trade Centre with his officials. I must also thankthem for the dedication with which they have been working.

Finally, once again let me thank you, Madam, for givingme this opportunity.

You have been a UNP member and you knowthat there is no way that you can short circuit macro-economicpolicies. You have to go the correct way. There are noshortcuts to this. We are not the only girl on the beachlooking for investments. So, on that score please ensure thatyou look into this. Why I am giving this, is because I wasmotivated by the latter part of the speech of the Hon. PadmaUdayashantha Gunasekera. I thought it was relevant. Theonly problem is, he did not tell how to implement it. Probablyhe must be giving a signal that this is the time to leave theJVP and join may be the SLFP, the UNP or a more progressiveforce. It is nice to see these types of things happening. Thisis the last time we see this type of red brigades that are there.I think you will basically say the same thing whether it is theHela Urumaya or the JVP. Now the people have realized.After twelve long years, there is no way that you can continueto hoodwink them.

_ agro-based economy.I think, that is the most important thing. Today, we are justtouching the tip of the iceberg which has really not percolateddown into the real economy. We have got to ensure that theagriculture commodities are industrialized in Sri Lanka. Ithink, that is most important if you are going to haveresurgence in the economic activities. But prior to all this, Iwould also like to mention like the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara,Member of Parliament mentioned during his speech that wemust ensure that we have durable peace. If you do not havepeace, how on earth can you have an economic activity ? Ifeveryday of the week you are stuck for four hourse in aparticular traffic jam, how on earth can this country progress?

Hon. Minister, you were mentioning that your target wasUS Dollars one billion for this year, but you have achievedonly 53 per cent of it. Presently, you are having an invest-ment of US Dollars 530 million, which, I am made to un-derstand, would reach US Dollars 600 million at the end.But, that is only 53 per cent of your target in the Budget.That 53 per cent is after bringing in infrastructure into theinvestments. During the United National Party days, in-frastructure was kept out of the FDIs. Then, we achievedUS Dollars 340 million to US Dollars 400 million withoutbringing in the capital infrastructure into the FDIs. But nowthat has changed. Now you are basically looking at six-

7 PL 001693 (2007/01)

21172118

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Foreign Direct Investment coming from the private sector.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Yes. The Foreign Direct Investment during our time didnot reflect the infrastructure cost. That is a very easy one.You construct a road and say that you made a historicachievement. But, that is not what is required. If you lookback and say during those days this amount of aid camein, then we would not be comparing apples with apples.But all I am saying is, forget that; never mind. It we canget US Dollars 600 million or US Dollars 6,000 million oreven 10 per cent of the target, that is good. But all I amsaying is, ensure that facilities are given to the BOI. TheBoard of Investment, I must say, is doing a good job underdifficult circumstances. You have a Chairman who is tryingto do as much as possible when there are external factorsagainst him. It is difficult, but still he is trying hard. Thereare some good officers there. But, the majority of them donot have the feeling that they should try to bring investmentinto this country. They are basically there just to prod issuesbecause they think if they solve the problem, then their jobwould become surfeit. So, we must ensure that we have aone-stop shop and the investment comes in 30 days, eitherthey are in or out. We do not want Chinese massageparlours and Chinese food parlours coming into the country.You do not need them; you can close up all of them. Youcan take them out, but still you maintain those because youwant to show the numbers. But all I am saying is, havecompanies of a qualitative and quantitative nature comein. Quality comes in when a conducive business climate iscreated here. It is on that basis that we must ensure thistakes place.

Now you are basically converting the FDIs of 2006 intothat of 2007. So, that is a postponement. But all we sayis, if you get as much as you can, well and good. You knowthat certain investments have not even been quantified. Youdid a good job with the Marks and Spencer, you now haveNext, River Island, Burtons, then you have the GermanNekeman, Nike and Polo in Italy, all of them coming inbecause of some futuristic steps you took along the ideaswe gave. You could see that just because we are in theOpposition, we are not anti-Government. We are pro-economic. If we win the economic war, we have won allwars. If we lose the economic war, my God, help thiscountry! That is why we are saying, please ensure that itis won.

You may have a rollicking holiday today. Then, you ruinthe economy and tomorrow you may hand it over to us.Thereafter, we have to kick-start the economy. We, theUnited National Party, have always been doing a janitorialservice. You ruin it, you mess it up; we come and clean itand then people kick us out again. That is the irony; the

curse of this country. If people understand the reality, thegravity of it, then they would realize that these 12 yearshave been the biggest curse that the country has been underbecause they have been completely, I would say, hoodwinkedand now people understand that. Anyway, leave that aside.

Look at the Stock Exchange, Hon. Minister. There hasnot been one single IPO that has come in, in the last 12months. So, that reflects that the people have still not gotconfidence. The Stock Exchange is booming. But, todayyou have certain Asian companies coming and gettingthemselves established here, I will not say trying towhitewash their money - any money that comes in is goodenough - but the only thing is, ensure that they are of aqualitative nature. Do no make a mockery of the exercisejust to show, number-wise, that investments are coming in.We must ensure that it is done. Then, the delays in theBOI must be corrected.

The worst thing that could happen is this. Look at whathas been stated by some of your own Members of Parliament,your own contemporaries, Members of the JVP, a party ofyour own heterogeneous Alliance :

The other important thing is entrepot trading. That is avery laudable thing that has been brought in by the Budget.I want you to develop that because by that, the competitivecost in Sri Lanka could be reduced. Now the products arebecoming more expensive. We are unable to compete withthe world trade. All we can do is to at least bring themanufactures of other countries into this country, add valueto their products and send those out.

We are geographically well located. We are down at thetip of India with all the shipping lines passing through us.The manufacturing hub in the SAARC Region being nearus, ensure that we use this base to get stuff coming intothis country, add value to it and send it off. So, I guessyou have taken a step in the right direction. We gaveimpetus to this; we gave the necessary direction. Now it isgathering momentum. Ensure that we take this on.

You know that the same thing is happening with Marksand Spencer. I am glad to say at this particular moment,that is, in the next seven days the first shipment is to gooff. I call upon you, Hon. Minister, to ensure that you flagoff the first shipment that goes out of the country, becauseyou were instrumental in helping us to make it a reality. Prof.Lakshman R. Watawala, the Chairman and the officials ofthe BOI and the officials of the Department of Commerceworked day in and day out trying to get this off the ground,because if we lost it, we would have lost it to Bangalore,which was ready to take it on without any problem. There

was no cost impact. But, there is a huge impact with all thestuff manufactured in India, Bangladesh and now also inMalaysia and part of China going into the European Union.So, that is something I would like to mention.

The other thing that has got to be done is to ensure thatyou diversify the economy.

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . 10 . . , .

( + )(The Presiding Member) ? ? [ ] .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) 2 . ensure that you diversify the economy. This is oneof the biggest problems.Diversifying the economy is the mostimportant thing. After all, when you go for free tradeagreements or when you go overseas, they say that Sri Lankais still an exporter of agricultural items, whether it is tea,coconut, rubber or the same old items such as textiles,ceramicware or footwear. So, you have to diversify theeconomy. If you do not diversify the economy, we will getdragged into a problem. We must ensure that we move awayfrom an agro-based economy.

The other thing is that now we are caught up in a war.Ensure that you have economic development throughmanufacturing helmets or body armour kits used in war. Iknow that there is a local company manufacturing those atone-tenth of the cost we bear to import them. Ensure thatyou manufacture food packets in Sri Lanka. You are stillbringing them from Malaysia; you are still bringing them fromThailand. Ensure that you give duty-free status to this typeof companies. What is your problem in getting down thevegetables that are rotting in Nuwara Eliya or Bibile? Makesure that you bring them in by giving a 100 per cent taxholiday and get them to convert our vegetables into foodpackets. So, instead of bringing those from the Bhd.Company of Malaysia, you can get a Sri Lankan privatecompany to manufacture and sell the products to the Armyand the Navy, unless there is an ulterior motive in bringingthem from Malaysia, because they think that it is more

2006 2921232124

beneficial to their pockets, but it is not so to the pocket ofthe country. That is an important thing that has got to bedone. So, the war- related industry should make use of theserequirements. If the war expenditure is going to be Rs.125billion, ensure that we convert at least 15 per cent of thatexpenditure into an income for the Sri Lankan economy. So,I guess that has got to be looked at. We call upon the Hon.Minister to ensure that we give tax incentives, taxexemptions, tax holidays and anything in order to ensurethat the CIF cost is cheaper so that, at least, the money willrotate within the economy rather than going out of thecountry.

There is value addition going on. There are wonderfulcompanies in the zone like FDKS, KIKS and so on. Then,you have backward integration that is taking place withindustries being brought in. Whether it is the factories ofAshraff Amaleen, Ashraff Omar, Malik Samarawickrema orwhoever, ensure that the backward integration process takesplace.

Then, the tile industry is something you must makemaximum use of. But, you are giving it, by default, to Indiathrough the Free Trade Agreement. This is one thing whichI put roadblocks on. But, I am made to understand that thereare more imports coming in unnecessarily when there isquality stuff here that can be exported. Owing to the factthat tariff barriers have been placed by India, our exportersare handicapped. I know that you are trying to lure theIndian investors into the country. But ensure that you lurethe administrators in India and that they open up the tariffbarriers for our exporters to go there. There are someexporters who go and stand there for 28 days. Ensure thosedefects are corrected and the exports do not get hampered.

On the other hand, you know that Marks and Spencer andTesco have made a concerted effort to buy goods from SriLanka. Highlight them and ensure that they are given theopportunity to take maximum advantage out of that.

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . CEB is an institution which handlesindustrial activities. They are trying to install a plant atKerawalapititya in order to generate electricity at Rs.26 perkilowatt-hour, when the purchasing power in the private sectoris in the range of Rs.9 to Rs.12. So, please ensure that thistype of nonsense does not go on in the name of trying todevelop the Government industries.

The last question that I would like to ask is, why on earthhas the land in Trincomalee belonging to the Ports Authoritybeen gazetted to sell-off to the BOI? There is a stealth in

the way that it has been done. There is a necessity to answerthat. The Hon. Minister of Ports and Aviation could notanswer that when we asked him as to why that land hasbeen alienated from the Ports Authority, without evensubmitting a Cabinet paper, without him knowing that. Iguess there may be different reasons. But once again it isthe country that matters. It is under one Executive. It isunder one Government. So, why on earth was such a rashdecision taken? It gives rise to various ramifications.Remember that certain misconceptions or misapprehensionsthat arose in 1977 and 1978, led to an unwanted issue whichnow exists in the North and East. This can give rise to asimilar type of issue. Therefore, ensure that it is corrected.There must be bona fide shown on that matter. But thathas not been displayed in the manner that it has been done.They have gifted 40 per cent to the Emirates. Now withoutcorrecting that, you are going to start another airline withouteven getting Cabinet approval. By spending Rs.160 millionat the moment you are trying to start Mihin Air, a budgetairline. What is the meaning of that? Is this industrialdevelopment? No, Hon. Minister.

Anyway, I do not want to take much of your time becauseI have laboured the point in trying to bring a better economicenvironment. Even your own MPs are not doing that. Weare doing it while being in the United National Party becausewe have a feeling for the country. So, ensure that beforetoo long you bring that. Otherwise, by next year I am surethat it will be a completely different aspect because thepeople will realize that the Mahinda Chintana is defunctand the United National Party is the only Party that canresurrect this country. So hand the country over to us.

Thank you.

The total Foreign Direct Investment in 2001 had been onlyUS Dollars 82 million. In 2002, under the United NationalParty administration, it was US Dollars 181 million. In 2003,under the United National Party administration, it was USDollars 211 million. In 2004, under the PA administration, itwas US Dollars 234 million. In 2005, under the PAadministration, it was US Dollars 287 million and under thepresidency of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, we wouldbe reaching over US Dollars 600 million at the end of theyear. By the first nine months we have already registeredUS Dollars 361 million.

I must also explain to Hon. Ravi Karunanayake that infact-

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, my question was, the 2003 figures did notreflect investment made towards any infrastructure project.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I am also trying to explain that.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

If you take the road being constructed by the SouthernDevelopment Authority, the investment of that alone isUS Dollars 234 million. Then altogether it was US Dollars445 million in 2003.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

No, not here. I have got a clarification on that. We havenever ever brought within the figures of the BOI any itemsthat have come in as privatized investments or any otherinvestment other than the Foreign Direct Investments madeby the private companies.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

All power generation projects are BOI projects.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Yes. We have shown them as Foreign Direct Investment.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

That had never been done under the UNP regime.It had always been under infrastructure.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

We had brought it under that. During the UNP time also,the same figures had been calculated by the sameAuthority.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

It was not reflected as FDI.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Hon. Member, I would in fact appreciate what you wenton to state. But these are the figures we have been able tosubstantiate in terms of investment getting generated.

What about the number of employment that has beencreated? Within the first nine months of 2004, we havegot US Dollars 110 million for local investment. Then in2005 it was US Dollars 140 million and within the first sixmonths of 2006 it was Rs. 22 billion. That is the differencethat we have registered as an increase.

Along with this development, we must also pursue theemployment opportunities that we have been able to generateduring this period. In that we find that we have been ableto generate over 29,000 direct employment in the countrywithin the first nine months of this year and our target is

2006 2921272128

60,000. We have to get to the 60,000 figure. We have to getour statistics of the last three months and by January wewill have a clear picture in regard to our investment figures.

The other area of concentration had been to solve andcreate a new dimension in BOIs approach to matters thathad not been touched upon hitherto in this country.Thulhiriya Textile Mill was closed and lying idle for four yearswithout an investor and, the employees had not been paid.Within the first three months of our administration undermy purview, we have been able to bring a local investorand a sum of Rs. 950 million has been paid as compensationalone bringing in a substantial investment for this zone atThulhiriya, a dedicated textile zone to be created for the firsttime in the history of Sri Lanka as promised in the lastBudget. How did it happen? Would those employeesnumbering about 3000, get a penny from any source if notfor the investor whom we were able to bring in within thefirst three months of our coming into office convertingThulhiriya into a public-private partnership textile zoneassociated with the BOI?

We have been able to attract another investor, Brandix toHorana Textile Processing Zone that we are now planningto implement. We are in the creation of a Free Trade Zonein Trincomalee and there was a concern expressed by theHon. Member of Parliament Ravi Karunanayake who wantedto get a clarification from me. Yes. An area of approximately675 square kilometres of the Trincomalee District has beendeclared for the BOI by a Gazette notification as a specialeconomic zone and that has been sanctioned by the Cabinetof Ministers. This economic zone will be utilized forindustrial, commercial, trading and entrepreneurialdevelopment for that part of the country. This is what isimportant. We cannot allow assets to be idling in thiscountry. This is how we have been looking at the investmentcreation and enterprise development in this country.
