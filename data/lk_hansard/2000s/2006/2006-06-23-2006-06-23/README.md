. . ( )( () [ - )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala Minister ofParliamentary Affairs)Sir, it is with immense sadness that I stand up here in thisHouse today to pay tribute to the late Hon. JosephPararajasingham, who, Sir, in my view, was a gentlemanpolitician. He was a decent human being. He fought for therights of the Tamil community. Like many a Tamil politicianof the period, he too died at the hands of an assassin, and inthis way several leading Tamil politicians of this countryhave been eliminated from the political landscape of SriLanka. This is a great tragedy experienced by the Tamilcommunity and this is the fact to which the Hon. Sampanthanreferred. Tamil community, whose able men, intellectualscum politicians, have been eliminated in the name of astruggle for a separate state.

Joseph Pararajasingham, whom I met in 1994, when Ientered Parliament for the first time, was an amiablepersonality, a very friendly personality, who was ever readyto interact with us in order to discuss the current issuesaffecting the Tamil community. He was a very articulateperson and believed in peace and harmony. This was onegreat quality of the man.

As several Members mentioned, he started his professionalcareer as a Kachcheri Surveyor and he later became ajournalist. It was from this position, the position of ajournalist in that particular region, he entered the arena ofpolitics in the district of Batticaloa. Since 1956 he wasassociated with the Federal Party and later became a foundermember of the Tamil United Liberation Front. He was amember of the working committee of the TULF, the TamilUnited Liberation Front, and this shows, Sir, that he played akey role in the politics of the Tamil United LiberationFront. He entered Parliament in 1989 and remained aMember of this House till he was assassinated inside achurch on Christmas eve by a coward assassin.

A couple of days before his death, Sir, the Hon.Pararajasingham spoke to me in the library and told me thatthe situation in that part of the country, he was referring tothe Batticaloa District, was deteriorating and he expectedthe Government to take corrective measures.

2006 2318671868

4 PL 001269 (2006/06)

Sir, it is my view that the Tamil question cannot be solvedby eliminating leaders of the calibre of JosephPararajasingham. Tamil community, from the British times,produced great statesmen of the calibre of PonnambalamArunachalam and they made a noteworthy contribution tothe development of Sri Lanka as a modern state. This has tobe recognized. This cannot be forgotten. I do not want to goback in history. My learned Friend, Hon. Sampanthan,referred to most of those things. But the fact remains thatmost of the leaders of the Tamil community made acontribution to the development of this country as a modernnation. The leaders of the Tamil community includingthose moderate intellectuals have been killed, have beeneliminated or have been forced to leave the country. Mygood friend, Prof. Hoole, was forced to leave this country forobvious reasons. They have left this country and it was thissituation which created a political situation in that part ofthe country dominated by political violence.

The assassination of the late Hon. Joseph Pararajasinghamgives us an opportunity to reflect upon the need for a politicalsolution to this conflict which has destabilized this countryfor more than twenty years. Since the assumption of powerby His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa inNovember 2005, the Government has taken several measuresto work towards a political solution. The Government of HisExcellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa is committedto a negotiated political solution, and it is now involved ornow we are engaged in achieving a consensus in the South.A consensus in the South is a vital requirement in order towork out a negotiated political settlement. The politicalparties in this part of the country must realize the need toachieve a consensus with a view to finding an acceptablesolution to the problem with which the legitimate aspirationsof the Tamil people could be addressed. A separate State, Sir,is not the answer, Eelam is not the answer. A separate Stateat the doorstep of India is a threat to her own security and it isalso a threat to the stability in the region. Geopoliticallyspeaking, India and the international community will neveraccept, will never recognize a second State in Sri Lanka. Mr.Bala Tampoe, the veteran trade unionist, in one of hisinterviews stated this in the clearest terms.

Therefore, one must realize that killing of people, theinnocent unarmed poor civilians in villages, will not helpthe LTTE to achieve its objective. The LTTE is specializingin suicide terrorism, the most sophisticated method of theirstruggle. And now they are engaged in killing innocentcivilians. The Kebithigollewa massacre shows that the LTTEis nothing but a fascist organization. They thought that theSinhalese people could be provoked by this kind of incident.Fortunately for this country, Sinhalese people have shownextreme restraint and patience and they do this in the nationalinterest.

The modern state has undergone a transformation in thelast 200 years. Therefore, Sri Lankan political parties insteadof clinging to concepts relating to the nature of the State,

whether it is going to be federal or whether it is going to beunitary, must work for a solution with which substantialautonomy could be conceded to the North and East. It has tobe done. This can be done through a scheme of devolutionof power. It is only through a scheme of devolution of powerthat a durable solution, that a permanent solution, could befound. Such a solution with which the legitimate aspirationsof the Tamil community could be addressed is the best tributeto the late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham who sacrificed hisprecious life for peace and harmony in this country.

Thank you, Sir.

( )( [ - , )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara Minister of Constitutional Affairsand National Integration)

Mr. Presiding Member, at the outset I must associate myselfwith the sentiments expressed by my colleague Prof. WiswaWarnapala. On behalf of the Communist Party of Sri Lankaand the Socialist Alliance and also on my own behalf, it iswith profound sorrow that I wish to convey through you Sir,our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family of Mr. JosephPararajasingham and his political party the Tamil NationalAlliance.

Our friend and colleague, Joseph Pararajasingham is nomore, but he shall live in our hearts. I knew him as a friendand as a colleague for over 20 years and have closelyassociated with him in Parliamentary affairs as well as onmatters relating to political and social activities. I think noman with a tinge of human feeling would ever have thoughtof causing his death so violently within the church premises,a place which was closest to his heart on that holy Christmaseve, so devotedly observed by the Christians the world over.

I had the fortune to associate with most of the Tamil leaders,both in the North and the East. They were very distinguishedand illustrious leaders and late Mr. Joseph Pararajasinghamwas one of them. He was a charming personality and apersonality of cheerful disposition. He is one of those forwhom we had the deepest respect.

Sir, it is rank hypocrisy if I now praise his policies which Ihave condemned earlier. Even though we do not agree withhim politically, we admire him personally as a man ofconviction and conscience who relentlessly fought for thecause of his people.

Sir, how long can we allow killings of this nature to takeplace? That brutal killing cannot be justified. In fact nocause can justify any killing. They may have only satisfiedthe carnivorous appetite of those killers or of those who haveundertaken the contract for killing. In fact more Tamil leadersat the leadership level have been killed during the last twodecades. I cannot call them traitors. I cannot call them

18691870

[ ]terrorists. They all have died for no fault of their own. Iwould say, whoever killed Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham andfor whatever reason his death was caused, he was one of ourprecious Tamil leaders. His life was snatched away by thecult of violence which today has become the culture of ourcountry. These killings have not brought about any good tothe Tamil society or to the country at large. These killingshave only caused further discord and distrust within thecommunity and between communities.

I am aware that late Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham was alittle bit quieter at the latter stage of his life, distancing himselffrom active participation in Parliament. In fact I had a frankdiscussion with him. I addressed this question to him in afriendly way and he merely laughed it off. It occurred to methat the contradictions were developing within himself.Apparently, he had the feeling that objective conditions forthe resolution of the national question were there and theobjective need was there but the subjective factor was notready.

Mr. Presiding Member, if he had this impression in him, hewas absolutely correct, honest and sincere. He was a trilinguistand had friends closer to his heart from all communities,Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim. His profession, journalismbrought - I think, it instilled in his mind - a fraternal feelingfor the other communities. We have lost so many leaders ofthe Eastern Province and we cannot lose any more.

Before me is seated, my good Friend, one of the illustriousleaders of the Eastern Province the Hon. Sampanthan to whomwe have the deepest respect.. Always when I look at him, therecollection comes to my mind of those leaders whom wehad associated with from the North as well as the East and itoccurrs to me for what they sacrificed their lives.

I have a deep respect for the late Mr. JosephPararajasingham. We may not agree with him with reagrd tohis policies but the fact remains that he was one who foughtfor the cause of his people and who wanted to live amongstus in a united country.

So, Mr. Presiding Member, in the name of late Mr. JosephPararajasingham, let us strive our every nerve and seek asolution to this problem without allowing this country toplunge into darkness. Let us commit ourselves for toleranceand not for terrorism. No cause can justify terrorism. Withoutallowing ourselves or the country to be further destroyed andwithout allowing the communities to be victims of terrorismlet us all, in the name of the late Mr. Joseph Pararajasinghamstrive to bring about unity and amity in the country.

Thank you.

, [ + , + ! + , The concept of Eelam is notdivision, not disintegration, or anything of that nature.

The concept of Eelam is nothing but the restoration of whatwe had, and what we lost. We want to regain and reassert.This comes within the category of restoration orreconstitution. This is not my language, this is the languageof a learned constitutional authority Mr. Tiruchelvam atthe trial-at-bar when 64 lawyers appeared on our behalf andthree eminent judges sat in judgment. So, the concept ofEelam is not the general proposition. It is not division. It isnot disintegration. It is not creating chaos in the country.Forget about these personalities. No less a person than thelate Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, immediately followinghis Oxford career, in 1926 addressing a Jaffna Collegeaudience said, Ceylon is not a country, it is an islandconsisting of Kandyan Sinhalese, Low country Sinhaleseand Tamils occupying clearly demarcated areas, preservingtheir language, culture and way of life intact. It is only arash man who will envisage the merger of thesecommunities. Mr. Sampanthan has not said this,Prabhakaran has not said this, Chelvanayakam had not saidthis. Bandaranaike said it in July 1926 at a meeting presidedover by an eminent judge, that Ceylon is not a country, itis an island, it is only a rash man who will envisage themerger of these communities. Political compulsions stoodin the way, the late Hon. Bandaranaike realized it. I told hisbeloved daughter, Chandrika, Madam, you know aboutyour father. He had a better vision than many of our Tamilleaders, but political compulsions stood in the way of ourachieving it. Kindly forget about the past. We cannot forget,but we can forgive the past. In the name of your father, grantus meaningful federalism. I used definitely, categoricallythe word meaningful and not meaningless. Not ameaningless devolution of powers within a unitaryframework. Certainly not. Not the Indian pattern with duerespect and love to our neighbouring country, the MotherIndia. A meaningful federalism where powers are defined ,the Central Government has only limited powers and thestates have their own powers. There is no danger of theCentral Government ever coming into the picture ofdestabilizing any of the local states. That danger is there inthe Indian Constitution, with love to India. This is what Ipleaded with the American State Authority in 1986, likeresidual powers being vested with the states in America,grant us also meaningful federalism. Then there will be nodanger of the Central Government intervening. In the case ofIndia, it is a semi-federal set up where the Central Governmentcan intervene and dissolve a state assembly. The Canadianpattern, the Swiss pattern are ideal patterns for us to follow.We are prepared to consider those things. But is theGovernment prepared when my dearest Friend, Mr. MahindaRajapaksa - he was my dearest Friend and he still remainsmy dearest Friend -I think so - says, nothing less than aunitary Constitution, nothing more for a Tamil homeland,no, we do not recognize Tamils as an entity, we do not acceptthe right of self-determination. ? So how are you finding asolution? Fifty years have rolled by. We know where we are.We are worse off than we were. Some people think thatEelaventhans memory is short or that he is a young man ofyesterday, he does not know his past. They are quoting Sir

2006 2318751876

Ponnambalam Arunachalam. He was the Father of theUniversity Movement, Father of the Labour Movement andhe was the Father of all the movements in Ceylon. Mr. PieterKeuneman once called him the Father of the LabourMovement. Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam after beingbetrayed by the Sinhalese leadership over the ColomboWestern Province Seat, formed the Tamil League and saidthat in the name of nationalism and in the name ofcosmopolitanism, I do not want my community to be reducedto the level of neither fish nor fowl. He made it very clear thatwe have to be determined to preserve our entity, the Tamilidentity. He mentioned in his last speech, before he passedaway, that there is a move by some circle to throw away thestatue that was built in grateful memory to the sea. Whomdid he speak of? Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam speaks ofhis elder brother Ramanathans statue. It was built in gratefulmemory for the service rendered by him in the 1915 riots. Inthe dire hour of our need, you came to our rescue if not foryou, we may be among the dead is what the AnagarikaDharmapala and all the eminent Sinhala leaders said. Thegreatest Ceylonese of all times proclaimed the late Hon.D.S. Senanayake. Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, an eminentpersonality only second to Ramanathan said that there was amove to throw the statue that was built in grateful memory ofSir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, to the sea. Who is at fault?He said that there was a move. Sinhala hoodlums are notonly present now, Sir, even in 1920 the story was the same.Come what may, whatever I say, there is a move to crush us,thrash us. We shall meet the challenge. The old man in his70s says there is a move to crush us. We shall meet thechallenge. This is not a new story, Sir. Sir Arunachalam facedthis problem. His elder brother who survived him whenthere was a question with regard to Donoughmore ReformsCommission, said, Donoughmore means Tamils no more,they are handing power to the vulgar mob without duesafeguards to the Tamils. If we accept it, it is going to be thedeath knell of the Tamil people.

The Hon. Dew Gunasekera and the able eminent professor,Sir, I am no comparison to you. I have no academicbackground of your calibre. But I plead, what makes mespeak is my humble heart and my bitter experience. Myexperience certainly overshadows all your career, Sir. I amasking you, devolution of powers, parrot like repetition ofdevolution of powers will not take us anywhere, Sir. It willonly worsen the situation for us. The Hon. Dew Gunasekeraspeaks of Dr. N.M. Perera and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. Dr.N.M. Perera once said, I think on 6th June 1956, Do notblame the Tamils if they do not believe us. We have neverhonoured our word. From the Donoughmore era, the storyhas been the same. But this very Dr. N.M. Perera finallysuccumbed to Sinhala pressure and my learned friend, Prof.Sundaralingam said - I do not want to use the same harshwords of Prof. Sundaralingam, but what did Dr. Sundarilingamsay about Dr. N.M. Perera because of his later politicalsomersault - Double doctorate with double tonguedtreachery. Double doctorate with double tongued treachery!I do not want to repeat those words. This is what promptedour Professor Sundaralingam.

When Senator Nadesen pleaded with Dr. Colvin R. deSilva, the man who drafted the Constitution for Mrs. SirimavoBandaranaike in 1972, and said, Please do not nullify themeagre concessions like Article 29, the Public ServiceCommission and the Senate, what did Dr. Colvin R. de Sivatell Mr. Nadesen? Mr. Nadesen, politics is the art of thepossible, and nullified even the meagre concessions weenjoyed under the Soulbury Constitution. So, where did westand, Sir? Two languages, one nation, one language, twonations, what a lovely pronouncement by Dr. Colvin R. deSilva? In reality what happened? He was also finallypolitically somersaulting accepting one language and nowwe are going to have two nations. Sir, I am not here to speakill of the dead. Whether it be Dr. Colvin R. de Silva or Dr.N.M. Perera, I had the greatest respect. We used to cut classesin our schools and attend the meetings addressed by them.We were so mesmerized by Dr. N.M. Perera and Dr. Colvin R.de Silva. I think I should conclude my speech. I should notexploit the kindness and the generosity and the magnanimitybestowed by the Chair.

But before I conclude, Sir, I had an important meeting withthe late Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, my Friend. I have noenemies here. At the Consultative Committee meeting, Ithink, three weeks before he passed away we had a lovelypersonal chat.

I told him, Sir, I have the highest respect for you. You arean Oxford product. But when we, Tamils like Mr.Pararajasingham and others are giving information to theworld about the plight of the Tamils, why do you go aroundthe world and give disinformation? When we are givinginformation to the world about the plight of the Tamils, yougo around the world and give disinformation. Is it becomingof an Oxford product? I do not want to use the words, sell-outs, weaklings and collaborators although other Tamils areusing those words because I feel hurt as you are an Oxfordproduct. I would like to quote from Thirukkural but sinceyour knowledge of Tamil is limited, I will give the Englishtranslation.

The translation says, sharp intellect, shrewdness, will not beof any benefit to humanity, if the knowledge is not appliedfor the well-being of humanity. Again I repeat, I do notwant to speak ill of the dead. So, I gave a translation to thelate Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar and said, Your intellect is ofa high nature. We all envy you. But how could youconsciously or unconsciously be a party to the selling orweakening of the Tamil peoples mental framework , thepolitical set up? He put on a smile and said, You are a nicespeaker. I said, I am no match to the Oxford accent. Irepeat, we are no match to the Oxford accent. But I am nowpleading, tell us a way out. We, Tamils are not bloodthirsty.Prabhakaran has no love for war. He made it very clear. Henever thought of an armed struggle, if Mr. J. R. Jayewardene5 PL 001269 (2006/06)

18771878

[ . . ]had strictly adhered to the Buddhist philosophy of theBuddha, Dhamma. There is no Buddha, Dhamma here. Thereis Buddha Adharma here. That is why we are getting killedat Pesalai, Vankalai, Mutur , Trincomalee and Batticaloa.Yesterday when I spoke, at about 3.30 pm, at Kiran, aidedand abetted by the Government, the Karuna Group wasplaying havoc and boys and girls have been removed inthree vans. Three hundred persons were missing. Where arethey? Who is to give the answer to this question?

At the meeting in Geneva on 22nd February what is theissue that was discussed? Of dispensing with the elementslike the Karuna Group, paramilitary forces. After that wethought we could discuss on 19th April the issue of throwingout the armed forces in occupation in the name of highsecurity zones. When the first was not done, what is the use ofspeaking of the second issue of dispensing with the armedforces? So where are we, Sir? This is what is haunting us. Ido not want to exploit the time. I want to appeal again -whether my appeal will have any weight I do not know - toHis Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa who remains my Friend.You are the all powerful Executive President. You are veryanxious to speak to Mr. Prabhakaran. Prabhakaran alsorespects you. He has once called you a pragmatic leader butif you want to talk to Prabhakaran on a unitary Constitutionnot recognizing the Tamils as an entity, do not want to accepta homeland for the Tamils, then where are we? This is thequestion. This is where we are. The Hon. R. Sampanthan haselucidated it enough. He made it very very clear that whenwe speak of a homeland for the Tamils we are not fanaticallyinclined to say not a single Sinhalese should be in the entireterritory. What we oppose is the state-sponsored colonizationwith a determined and calculated move to make us a nonentityor a microscopic minority and change the demographicfeatures. That has happened in Ampara; that has happenedin Trincomalee. and there is a move for the same thing totake place in Mullaitivu. Land is necessary not only for theself-expression of an ethnic group. It is necessary for itsphysical survival, Sir.

All these things were haunting Mr. JosephPararajasingham. He was a very mild mannered person, Sir.But he knew what he was dealing with. He never used wordsto hurt the feelings of even his worst political opponent. TheHon. Dew Gunasekera said he was distancing himself fromthe movement. Certainly not Sir. He was deeplycontemplating and meditating as to what could be the solutionto the problem. He never ran away from the scene. He knewthe heavy odds before him. He knew his life was in danger.The Hon. Dew Gunasekera, you are my Friend for ever. Theother, Professor, the Hon. Wiswa Warnapala is also myFriend, please do not distort the history, do not discard thehistory. My Friend the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, JVPParliamentary leader said the late Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakamand the late Mr. Cumaraswamy Vanniasingam killed theSinhalese. Will anybody even in his dreams believe such athing? Will anybody, even the worst political opponent,

accept such a thing? But Chelvanayakam and Vanniasingamsaid, We love the Sinhalese, but do not make it a state-sponsored colonization which. changes the demographicfeatures and make us a nonentity. That is why Ampara isvirtually lost to us. A seat was created in Trincomalee. Nowthere is a move even to create a seat somewhere in Mullaitivutoo. So that is what we are opposed to and that is what wehave pleaded with our Muslim friends. You want a separateentity or some kind of a unit for you. We are not opposed toit but for that you join with us and tell the Government,whatever the Government, that you can never be a party tostate-sponsored colonization which is making a determinedmove to change the demographic features, the character, thelanguage and the culture of our link. So I repeat, land isnecessary not only for the self-expression of the ethnic group.It is necessary for its physical survival. I plead to my MuslimFriends who are part and parcel of Batticaloa, we have noanimosity towards you. We have a love for you.

Sir I would like to conclude my speech by reminding whatMuhammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan said when he addressedthe students of the Aligarh University in 1942, Oh youMuslims, you are not a minority. You are a nation. But anation does not live in the air. It must have a clearlydemarcated area, a zone. The greatest task that has befallenon you after the fall of the Mogul empire. Sir, I repeat whatMuhammad Ali Jinnah said in 1942, You are not a minority.You are a nation. But a nation cannot live in the air. It musthave clearly demarcated areas. My dear Muslim Friendswho are virtually worshipping Jinnah, I am one with you asregards Jinnahs concept of the Pakistan but that does notmean you could just blindly worship him and discard hisadvice.

The late Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham who loved BharathaMatha often said - both of us virtually said the same thing -enlightened self-interest must make India, re-think, re-shapeand re-orient its foreign policy. There is an umbilical cordbetween the Eelam Tamils and Tamils of India and also theEelam Tamils and India.

Now, I see a visible change with Mr. Manmohan Singhmoving in the matter. We see a visible change in Dr. KalaignarMuthuvel Karunanidhi - - shedding tears,genuine tears for the refugees after seeing their plight.Therefore, we are appealing to Dr. Kalaignar, we are appealingto Vaiko, we are appealing to Nedumaran, we are appealingto Thirumavalavan -

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)I am conscious more than anybody else of others followingme. I make now a final appeal to mother India, a lovingneighbour of ours, to come to our rescue and find a solutionto the ethnic problem. We need Indian help, but not invasion.We need intervention, understanding. We want India tounderstand the historical background of the Tamils whichthe Indo - Ceylon Agreement recognized, that the Tamilshave a historic habitation. So, help us to preserve the historichabitation of the Tamils.

On the 19th of August, 1983, Indira Gandhi made it veryvery clear that something has to be done to the issue that ishaunting the Tamils here and added, I am conscious morethan anybody else. That is why for the first time in the historyof India I have used the word genocide being perpetuatedin Sri Lanka. This, I reminded Mr. Manmohan Singh in myletter, when I was at the time propagating for our cause inNorway. At the dire need of the hour you must come to ourrescue and help us.

And to my Sinhala friends here, I have lived with you foryears. My father has served in the Department of Railways,mixed and mingled with our Sinhala friends. I have had myeducation at Wesley College. I had a 25 years career in theCentral Bank. I have no personal problems with any of ourSinhala friends. Sinhalese are our friends, I repeat like aparrot. The Constitution is our enemy number one. ThisConstitution, this unitary Constitution will only result in -as the Hon. R. Sampanthan put it - democracy here descendingto the level of mobocracy.

Dr. E.M.V. Naganathan said, Counting your heads willlead to the cracking of heads. A perpetual rule of thepermanent Sinhala majority will result in liquidation of theTamil minority. Therefore, we are not opposed to a federalset up. We repeat. It should be meaningful fedaralism. Butfor fedaralism to succeed other people must co-operate. Icannot have a one sided love affair. If the Sinhalese do notrespond, the unpalatable but unavoidable decision is judicialseparation.

Thank you, Sir.
