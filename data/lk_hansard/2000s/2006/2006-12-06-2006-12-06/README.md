( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. Today the MahindaChintana has celebrated one year and we see a lot ofcelebrations going around in the country. But the question

is, what is there to celebrate? I am happy that my Friend, theHon. Deputy Minister of Finance, is in the House because theonly thing that they can be proud of, is the rising inflationwhich is 19.8 per cent in the country within a period of oneyear and having made the poor in this country much poorerthan they ever were.

The Hon. Deputy Minister himself has made a statementto the newspapers. He says, .. Now I can refute that and tell the Hon. DeputyMinister that under the Regaining Sri Lanka from January2003 to March 2004 the inflation reduced to 0.5 per cent.As per the Colombo Consumer Price Index, it was one ofthe lowest levels of inflation; it was almost zero inflation inthis country and the cost of living came down. So the Hon.Deputy Minister will have to learn some economics, .

We were accused of not looking after the poor of thiscountry at that time. There is no better way to look afterthe poor of a country than reduce inflation and the cost ofliving. That was the greatest service we could do to thepoor of this country.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)

Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now takethe Chair.

, . , () , Whereupon THE HON. (MRS.) NIRUPAMA RAJAPAKSA left theChair and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( )(The Chairman) , .

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)Thank you, Hon. Chairman. Sir, today a wage earneris earning 19.8 per cent less than what he would haveearned a year ago or what it would have been worth becauseof inflation. According to the Central Banks recentEconomic Development Report of 2006, which was issuedto this House on the day the Budget speech was made, itsays the salaries were increased only by 17.2 per centwhereas inflation increased by 19.8 per cent which meansthat all wage earners have a negative real income withinthis one year. But also, take the six million private sectorworkers who have not had any salary increase during thelast year. You also take the self-employed persons of therural village areas. They have not had any additional

27032704

[ ]income but the cost of living has gone up tenfold. I amafraid to say, Sir, that the Mahinda Chintana is damagingthis countrys economy irreversibly. The Hon. BandulaGunawardane tried to point this out by giving a veryfocused argument. Unfortunately there are no people whohave the capacity to understand the basic economics inthis House.

Look at the national currency today. When we gave overthe government the currency value was Rs. 96 to the USDollar. Today it is Rs. 108 to the US Dollar. Is this a reasonto celebrate after one year? You have weakened the nationaleconomy and weakened the Rupee. Up to now the Rupeehad been held because of tsunami aid coming in and hugecommercial borrowings that have been taken. And thesecommercial borrowings have been in Dollars. This is notsustainable and it harms our economy in the long-term. Lastyear all the money in the NRFC accounts were taken throughDollar bonds, which the Government calls developmentbonds. But, in my opinion, they have not been fordevelopment or capital investment.

I would like to explain that between the 6th of Septemberand 12th of October, just within the short period theGovernment had to forego US Dollars 120 million in orderto try and sustain the Rupee value. You just threw USDollars 120 million into the drain. That shows how poorthe economic thinking behind this Government is. Forgetabout politics. As the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane said, theCentral Bank has a responsibility. Like you would takethe Dalada Maligawa or the Shri Maha Bodhiya as the mostvenerable place for a Buddhist, in an economy the CentralBank is a key focal point. It cannot do politics. But duringthe last one year, the Central Bank has been involved intrying to pursue political targets than sustaining theeconomy of this country.

The Government is also planning to issue a US Dollar500 million sovereign bond. We heard that the Governorof the Central Bank and a couple of other specialists havegone to various foreign countries to put on a roadshow toissue a US Dollar 500 million sovereign bond. We are beentold that this is also to fund development projects. Buthow can you say that you are issuing sovereign Dollar Bondsto find money for development projects, when the Budgetsays all the development projects are funded by foreignfunding agencies? So, this is a total lie. I would like toshow a graph. You are talking about development, that youare borrowing from the commercial Dollar market for capitalinvestment. But what happened in 2006? You have slashedthe capital expenditure by 30 per cent. What was budgetedand whatever cuts that have been moved on capitalexpenditure was around 30 per cent. Whateversupplementary estimate that was brought into this Housewas for recurrent expenditure.

In 2005 what happened? The graph given in the Reportof the Central Bank of Sri Lanka shows very clearly that in2005 there was an under- expenditure of approved capital

estimates. If you take education, there is a minus 34 percent cut in capital expenditure. Education is necessary.Hon. Deputy Minister, this is the real fact. You can talkabout lots of other things. But these are figures that theCentral Bank itself has given. In highways, there is a minus25 per cent under expenditure in capital estimates and inpower and energy, a minus 29 per cent. It you take theMahinda Chintana, the main areas you spoke about isSME, Small and Medium Enterprise development wherethere is a minus 43 per cent cut in capital expenditure. Youspeak about agriculture so much. In agriculture there is aminus 49 per cent cut in capital expenditure in 2005. Butfor the expenditure of His Excellency the President, thePrime Minister and the Supreme Court, there has been aplus of 334 per cent. So, now we know where all the Dollarbond borrowings are going. It is not going for capitalexpenditure or for developing the infrastructure of thiscountry. It is going to maintain the political hierarchy ofthis country. This is sad.

I would like to say, Sir, that this is a dangerous path thatwas trodden by Latin American countries. Ultimately, thecountry may have to default on these loans just likeArgentina did. Already commercial dollar borrowings areat a historic high in this country. We understand that it ismore than a billion dollars. I would like to ask the Hon.Deputy Minister, if it is over a billion dollars, tell us fromwhere you borrowed this money, how you are estimatingto pay back this money and how you have invested thismoney? Because this is necessary for us, in the Opposition,to know how you have been using a billion dollars ofcommercial dollar borrowings.

This is how you are planning to hold the Rupee up tonext year by borrowing Dollars at high commercial rates inthe international market. The 500 Dollar million sovereignbonds that you all are planning to borrow from the foreignmarkets again will have to be repaid at some point and ifthe Rupee gets devalued, imagine by how much times theloan repayment will cost us.

Our Rupee already has been over valued against ourtrading partners because our inflation is higher than theirs.If you take the real effective exchange rate index, it is veryapparent that our Rupee even at 108 is slightly over valuedbecause of the rate of inflation. As a result, our domesticindustries cannot compete against imports because theRupee has been artificially held up with tsunami aid andcommercial dollar borrowings. The Government claims tohelp the domestic industry. But what have you done bypushing inflation up? By increasing the local cost ofproduction and keeping the rupee artificially high, you havehurt the domestic industry and the export sector. That iswhat has really happened. You have given an advantageto foreign producers against our own and now we are payingthe price. So, today, one of the largest Sri Lankan garment

2006 0627052706

exporters has gone to India and started an industrialtownship in India. Why has he done that? Because Indiais a better place to do exports than Sri Lanka. Thanks toMahinda Chintana. You are chasing away our nationalproducers from this country.

I would like to speak about the small industries. Youspoke so much about the Desheeya Karmanathaya. Youspoke about national production. But this Chintana hasgone completely against that. The Finance Ministry hasproposed to merge the SME Bank and the Lankaputhra Bankwith the Regional Rural Development Banks. Now,I would like to ask you, Hon. Deputy Minister about 90per cent of this Regional Rural Development Bank loansthat have been given are less than Rs. 100,000 loans. Theywere micro credit loans. That is very good. From 1997 ithas been following a certain role. In 2001 after the UNPcame into power, we made sure that at least a retired CentralBank Officer was on the Board of those Regional RuralDevelopment Banks. But we had managed to take it upto a level where those banks were flourishing well. Todaythey are the best source of micro finance this countryhas. But the Government is proposing to merge them withtwo banks created in two budgets which are stuffed bypolitical appointees whose only objective is to satisfy theirpolitical friends and henchmen. These banks werecreated on the false pretext that the UNP Government didnot help small industrialists. We brought inflation downand brought the interest rates down. Small entrepreneurscould walk into any bank and borrow at low interest rates.What better way could we help the local small scaleindustrialists? But today you take the SME Bank, the Smalland Medium Enterprise Bank which was capitalized by Rs.1.5 billion within one year - within nine months this SMEBank has already had over 30 per cent of its bank loanswhich have gone bad. From last year December, 2005 upto September, 2006 Hon. Deputy Minister, 30 per cent ofthe SME Bank loans have been defaulted upon or gonebad. Look at that cost. That means, those loans havebeen given to political friends and not to the targetedrecipients. Now you are trying to merge the RRDBs withthe SMEB which has a bad history because the RRDBsalready have a Fitch rating. The Fitch rating at least ispositive for those RRDBs. I must say that the SabargamuwaDevelopment Bank has the lowest Fitch rating which isin yours and my district and we need to support thatalso. Therefore, if directions are going to be given fromColombo to give large loans, the Regional Managers willhave no say to give this micro producers the credit thatthey need. Therefore, the small and medium industries willbe as a result disturbed and damaged by this.

Now, we are about to celebrate one year of MahindaChintana. But has Mahinda Chintana focussed on thissmall and medium enterprises? Have you been able toreduce the cost of interest and the cost of production forthese small industries? No, you have not. The 19.8 percent inflation you can boast about is an achievement that

few countries in this world can talk about, I think, exceptZimbabwe where there is a much higher inflation than SriLanka. As my good Friend, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardaneis used to always say; your target is to take Sri Lanka tothe place where Zimbabwe is in.

I would talk about fiscal indiscipline. The poor is payingthe price today for backward economic policies that youall have pursued. Policies that look good on the surfaceto simple-minded people tantamounts to economictreachery and that undermines our national economy, ournational currency and the poor people of this country.Therefore it is time we stop talking popular politics andtalk reality.

Our rupee is falling because of unrestrained printing ofmoney. This Government and the Rata PerataGovernment borrowed money from the Central Bank. Inother words, it printed money all the time. Mr. Chairman,this is the highest form of economic treachery one cancreate. You destroy the value of the domestic currency.During the Second World War Hitlers Germany printedcounterfeit five Pound notes and put it into the globalcirculation in an attempt to destabilize the BritishGovernment because the best way to destabilize the Poundwas to print more Pounds and put it into the market. Hitlerwas trying to destabilize the UK Government. But todayyour own Government is trying to destabilize the countryby printing more and more money and putting it into themarket because you all cannot get your economicprinciples straight. The great Lenin is credited by no lessa person than John Maynard James, the Economist as sayingthat there is no better way to destroy the capitalist systemthan to debauch its currency. That is exactly what you aredoing. You cannot fool us. You can fool simple-mindedpeople, but we know exactly what is going on in theTreasury and the Central Bank. Mr. Chairman, you candestroy any economy that runs on paper money, whetherit is capitalist or socialist, by printing money. This is whythe Russian Rouble crashed; this is why the ZimbabweDollar is crashing; this is why inflation is rising and ourSri Lankan Rupee is crashing. According to the CentralBanks own data, by September, the Central Bank credit tothe Government has gone up by Rs.103.6 billion. That isabout Rs. 40 billion more than in February, this year.

I would also like to refer to another incident whichhappened in 2004. Under the Rata Perata programme,Rs. 70 billion worth of money had been printed. At thattime, if you look at the total domestic credit, which is themost important component of the total money supply, ithad been increasing at 7 per cent per annum since 2001,which shot up by 22.4 per cent in 2005.

So, when you look at this record, you would see that thisis total economic mismanagement. You can talk aboutpolitics. What the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane was tryingto do was to present a sensible argument here and to let his

27072708

[ ]Excellency the President know what is really happening inthe Treasury, that this is a very dangerous situation for ourcountry. On one side, we have to fight a war. If we have tofight a war, we need to have a strong economy. That is verycritical for this country at this time. I would like to saywhat John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1919. He said, Sir, Iquote:

Lenin is certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means ofoverturning the existing basis of society than to debauch thecurrency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economiclaw on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which notone man in a million is able to diagnose.

Already we have a two thousand-rupee note. I would liketo show you how the value of the rupee has gone down.What I have in my hand is the one-rupee coin we had inthose days. What I am showing you now is the one-rupeecoin we have at present. This is the result of your economicmanagement. Likewise, what I show you now is the 25-cent coin we were used to. But, this is the 25-cent coin youhave minted. I like to remind the Hon. Deputy Ministerthat in the Philippines - at one time, the coins that wereminted in the Philippines were worthless, because theircurrency value went down - people started collecting allthe coins and exporting them to China because the valueof copper was more than the currency value. Today, thathas happened to the Sri Lankan currency and the only thingyou could do was to print a two thousand-rupee note becausethe value of the currency has gone down so badly.

Mr. Chairman, you cannot run a country with Central Bankcredit. If you do this, that means the economy wouldcollapse like it happened in Zimbabwe. I would like totell you something that was said by a great person whom Irespect, Dr. Goh Keng Swee. He was the first FinanceMinister under Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore. Singapore optednot to have a Central Bank when they got independence,but continued to have a currency board like system becausethey did not want to be tempted to print money. Dr. GohKeng Swee said this, I quote:

Financing budget deficits through Central Bank credit creationappeared to us as an invitation to disaster. There was no effectiveway of exchange control in an open trading economy like ours todeal with the inevitable balance of payments troubles.

Another contributing factor was the world outlook of my colleagues- the old guard asthey are now called. We all grew up underdifficult conditions and did not believe anybody owed Singapore aliving. The way to a better life was through hard work, first inschools, then in universities or polytechnics and then on the job inthe work place. Diligence, education and skills will create wealth,not Central Bank credit.

This is the lesson that the Central Bank of this countryhas to learn; this is the lesson that the Treasury officials ofthis country have to learn; this is the lesson that thepoliticians of this ruling Government have to learn.

Mr. Chairman, we have been told that there is economicgrowth in this country. Yes, there is economic growth, infigures. Like the good Colleagues of the JVP used to say,this is all an ilakkan vijjava. The growth that has risen isbecause of the tsunami aid, the service sector and the telecomsector growing, as I said before. But, the growth is notbecause of the domestic economy, the domestic productionand the manufacturing units showing any sign of growth.There is a lot of growth we can see in the City of Colombo:we can see Prados, Pajeros, Monteros and the MercedesBenz. The affluent class is having more wealth. We cansee high-rise buildings coming up and being sold at Rs. 30million, Rs. 40 million a unit. But that does not indicatethat the countrys economy is growing and the rural sectorsare growing.

( )(The Chairman)Hon. Member, I think you will have to conclude soon.

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)I will wind up, Sir, on time. Therefore, I would like tosay that today, the Government is stealing through inflation -

( )(The Chairman)Hon. Member, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)Sir, please give me just one more minute. I will wind up.

The Government is stealing through inflation by printingmoney and with negative real rates. Today, the inflation isat 19.8 per cent whereas the NSB saving rate is a little over10 per cent. That means, Sir, the EPF and the ETF savings- the workers savings that are put into the EPF and ETF -the Government is actually robbing them and giving thismoney to the richer people.

Sir, therefore, I would like to say, since my time is up -I could speak about a lot more things - that this Governmenthas a responsibility. That is, to make sure that there isfinancial discipline in this country. This is not to makepolitical gain because this Budget Debate is important forus to bring to light the wrongdoings in the country. I amsad to say that there is hardly anybody sitting on theGovernment benches for us to speak to and to brief us.I hope, at least, the officials will take note of this becausethis country cannot afford an economic crisis like the onewe are going to see in the future.

Thank you.

( )( - )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Planand Plan Implementation)

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportunityto speak a few words on the Budget, very specially at theCommittee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministryof Finance and Planning.

Before I start my speech, I would like to respond to a fewmatters that were raised by the Hon. Members on the oppositebenches. Firstly, I would like to categorically state withresponsibility that there was an attempt by the the Hon.Bandula Gunawardane, to mislead this House by saying thatthe Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal,had attended a money laundering conference in Queensland.I categorically state that he has never attended anyconference since becoming the Governor of the CentralBank.

Today, when we are discussing the Votes of the Ministryof Finance and Planning, I expected a person of the calibreof Mr. Bandula Gunawardane, who had been a DeputyMinister of Finance, to be more objective in his speech.Of course, we do not expect any Hon. Member to just getup and say, It is a very good Budget. We heard a Memberof the Government ranks today talking about variousshortcomings within the system. We appreciate all those.But, please do not try to make undue, cheap politicalpublicity at the expense of officials who are not able todefend themselves. This, I have mentioned even on anearlier occasion during this Budget Debate.

Sir, there was also a comment by the Hon. BandulaGunawardane that the VAT refunds are not being paid ontime. They are being delayed, yes. There is a slight delayin paying VAT refunds. Does he want us to go back tothe 2002 era where Rs. 390 billion of VAT refunds weremade on false claims and forged identity cards? Shouldwe not inquire into those, see if the claims are genuineand then refund? The VAT scam that has been hitting theheadlines in recent times started in the year 2002 and itwas we who were able to stop it in 2004. Everybody knowswho was in power during the period 2002 to 2004 andwho the Deputy Minister of Finance in charge of theDepartment of Inland Revenue was at that time. I am happythat he is now promoting building contractors, Prima andthe IOC. He says we have not been making payments tothese organizations. That shows the people he wants torepresent. My Friend, the Hon. Kabir Hashim, just left theHouse. He said that one of our largest exporters has goneto India to set up an export zone. Yes, they have gone.Does he not want our entrepreneurs to go out of the countrylike the multinationals, who come here and take away ourmoney? So, let our people go-

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)

Mr. Chairman, as I was saying, they were talking aboutour entrepreneurs going out of the country to set up factoriesin other countries. Is that not good for our country? Theybring back their earnings into our country unlike themultinational companies that are coming here and takingaway our monies to their countries. Talking about thatparticular exporter, the Hon. Kabir Hashim seems either notto know or has conveniently forgotten that we have giventhem a similar export township in Horana to set up theirbusinesses. These are matters which should be brought tothe notice of the public without hiding.

He also mentioned that they know exactly what ishappening in the Treasury. Yes, they know what ishappening in the Treasury and we also know what ishappening in the Treasury. But, what we know is not whatthey are trying to allude to because they only know whathappened in the Treasury during the period 2002 to 2004and not now. As we know, at present the Treasury isfunctioning under the able leadership and the direction ofthe Minister in charge of Finance and Planning, HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, together with the supportof the able Deputy Minister, the Hon. RanjithSiyambalapitiya and the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B.Jayasundera. So, we have no problems at the Treasury atthe moment. Definitely, whatever the problems that youhad in the years 2002 to 2004 are now matters underdiscussion at the COPE and the PAC as mentioned by theHon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. These are matters for whichinterim reports will be filed very soon and the public willbe made aware. In that context, I would also like to mentionand second the views expressed by the Hon. WijeyadasaRajapakshe that those committee meetings should be opento the public and the media.

[ ]Mr. Chairman, going to the basics of the Budget that waspresented this year, there was some mention that there havebeen no increases in salaries to public servants, but thatincrease had already been promised in the 2006 budget -50 per cent being apportioned for the year 2006 and thebalance 50 per cent for the year 2007. This is adevelopment Budget. Of course, every sector of societyhas not benefited immediately but the 10 Year DevelopmentPlan amply shows what benefits are to be given to thepeople over the next 10 years. Prices have gone up. Yes,we admit. But there are many underlying reasons for theincrease in prices. There are short term difficulties that thepublic is facing. But, one of the main impacts on the priceshas been the rising1 oil prices. Though I know that that isa flogging horse - oil prices are the flogging horse ofeverybody - but that is a fact. We cannot get away from it.But, the Government has taken many steps on the demandand supply side improvements that will gradually lowerthe pressure on the prices.

Look at the unemployment rate. In 2004, when we tookover it was 8.3 per cent. We brought it down to 7.7 percent in 2005 and this year it has come down to 6.3 percent. In the 2007 Budget, we have placed emphasis onvarious other things which will reduce unemploymentfurther. We have also shown a further improvement in theprocess of moving towards a comprehensive medium termapproach in the preparation of the Budget. Routineoperational expenditures like salaries and pensions cannotbe curtailed, but however, we are making every effort tocurtail or reduce recurrent expenditure at ministries.

The general public also has benefited though we havemade it a development Budget. Look at the reduction inthe normal passport fee from Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 2,500. Whomis it going to help? It is going to help the ordinary travellerwho is going abroad to the Middle-East for employment.We are also improving the skills of the worker so that wedo not have to send unskilled labour, especially to theMiddle-East, where there is a high demand today for semi-skilled and skilled labour.

What did we do for the person who is living on the interestincome from the gratuities he received from theGovernment when he left service? The threshold forWithholding Tax has been increased from Rs. 108,000 toRs. 300,000 so that the pensioners, the people who areliving on the fixed deposit income, are able to live withoutany taxation.

Everybody talks about the transport sector and thedilapidated buses we have today. What has His Excellencydone in this regard? We have exempted from VAT and dutythe new buses that are being imported to replace the oldbuses that run on permits.

The film industry exemptions were also spoken abouttoday.

Look at the leather industry. All the materials that arebeing imported for the leather industry have been exemptedfrom duties. There will be value additions by that. Thosewho are in the leather industry will be exporting goods inthe form of bags, handbags, shoes and slippers.

Those are the development work that we are trying to do,so that in the course of the next few years we would be ableto come back here, to this Parliament, after the next electionwith our hon. Members of the Opposition also overflowingto our side and would be able to say that what we presentedin the Budget for the year 2007 has borne fruit and as aresult people have elected us back to power.

Of course the impact of any Budget proposal does notdepend only on legislation. There should be a will toimplement it. We assure you, Mr. Chairman, that on theGovernment side the will to implement each and everydevelopment work mentioned in the Budget is there andwe will continue to ensure that not only these BudgetProposals but also the Budget Proposals of the year 2006,which were presented on the Mahinda Chintana, areimplemented to the letter so that when we stand up beforeyou the next year, we will able to tell you that we did whatwe have been asked to do.

Thank you very much.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman for giving me time toconclude the Committee Stage Discussion on the Budgeton behalf of the United National Party, at a time the countryis at crossroads without knowing whether to go forward orbackward or whether there is peace or war, I think financeis the most important aspect as I have been repeatedlystressing. I am sure the hon. Members on both sides of theHouse would no doubt agree that there has to be a collectiveapproach in handling the economy of this country. Youknow the Government is made up of a heterogeneousalliance and the parents of it are the SLFP, the JVP and theJathika Hela Urumaya. Unfortunately today, the child - theGovernment - is an orphan. We, the United National Partyhad to become the foster father of this particular child. Inshort, the Government is going astray without knowing asto where the country has to be driven. Whether it is driventowards the economy, whether it is driven towards the peaceprocess or whether it is the international relations or comewhat may, has been the general tendency that has been

2006 0627452746

displayed to the general public. . I thinkit is time that we take the mask off. The darkest hour isnearest the dawn, they say. If the future is looking dark,we are the ones who have to make it shine. If there appearsto be no one in control, we are the ones who have to pullthe curtain. Though we live in trying times, we are the oneswho have to try. Though we know that time has wings, weare the ones who are left to fly.

Sir, today we are debating the conclusion of the 60thBudget of this country. At a time there is almost a Rs.265billion Budget Deficit with no meaningful proposals giveneither to alleviate poverty or to increase investment, it ismore or less a stand alone Budget or it seems to be a lessfar-reaching attitude Budget that has been presented. I liketo mention certain highlights which I think would be usefulif the hon. Ministers and the Government can takecognizance of that fact, if not at least posterity willremember that we, from the United National Party had thecourage and the conviction to say that these were right orwrong.

There is a revenue surplus that has been shown in theBudget, which is a meaningless approach. They are justtrying to show that there is a surplus, may be to appeasethe donors. Also they say that 7.2 per cent of the GDP isthe Budget Deficit and then they say that 8 per cent of GDPis basically meant for provisions for certain investments.They say that inflation is 9 per cent. Growth rate is 7.5 percent of the GDP. A 10- year plan has been introduced.Public debt to GDP is mentioned as being reduced to almost92 per cent of GDP and the unemployment figure issupposed to be coming down to 6 per cent. We have beenhearing the same story over the last 10 , 12 or 15 years.The inflation rate today is 20 per cent.

With regard to investments, even though they say thatthere is US Dollars 700 billion that has come in, theChairman of the BOI mentioned just a couple of minutesago at the COPE meeting that the actual investment intothis country has been US Dollars 320 million. The rupeeis depreciating almost to Rs.109 to Rs.110 against the USDollar. The Sterling Pound is Rs.208 to Rs.209. The Eurois roughly about Rs.140.

Going on further, Sir, the import cover to this country hascome down to a drastically low level of 2.6 months at thismoment. Normally three months or below is supposed tobe critical. But now we are at 2.6 months. Then, peopleare unemployed. There is underemployment. Then, thereare cash crumbs and furthermore there is a general tendencyof a brain drain taking place in this country. So, if all theexternal factors are perfect then why are these negativefactors being highlighted today?

Sri Lanka, I guess, is being shown as the island ofprosperity in an ocean of poverty. We are trying to show aslight blip that is here in certain places and try to highlight

and interpolate that into the entire country and say that thisis the general environment of our country. I think, we havegot to change this. There has to be a paradigm shift in this.It is enough that each one has fooled the other. Thecountrys economy cannot be played about in the mannerthat it has been done at the moment. There is nogovernment that is poor, Sir. It is bad governance and itonly leads to poverty owing to the wrong policy that isbeing adhered to. . . .

Today, there are two attacks on the economy. One is aphysical onslaught by terrorist leaders like Prabhakaran andthe second is the termite attack by the officials of thiscountry. There is a war of attrition. When you put bothtogether, we have an internal as well as external problemwhich is very dangerous.

So, I would like to ensure that we address this issue. Wehave come to the tail end of the year 2006. It has been avery tortuous year. It has been unproductive. But, we havebeen staying alive. Can we take this forward to the year2007? No, Sir. We collectively have to change thisapproach and that is why the wisdom of His Excellencythe President and the UNP Leader and the party decidedon the 23rd of October, 2006, that there is a necessity towork together. That is not just to bring numbers but forthe simple reason that there is a necessity to look at it froma point of view of our countrys need. But, today, is it beingtaken into consideration? There is more window dressingbeing talked of. But, there is no national importance thatis being placed on that. Yesterday, the Hon. Leader of theOpposition and His Excellency the President met. But, thesincerity in purpose is yet to be displayed. I have beeninformed that Committees were put into place today. Letus take this forward. I have been informed that theGovernment and the Cabinet of Ministers today have re-invoked the Prevention of Terrorism Act once again. Thiswas deemed to be bad by the Peoples Alliance a couple ofyears ago and the same Government brings it back. Thesetypes of meagre reactions, I only hope, do not have anexternal dimension. We certainly do realize that, if thereis a military pursuit then there is a necessity to give amilitary answer. But in dextrous situations as of today, whenthere is a necessity to luring the people who are pursuingaberration of peace, bringing in Prevention of Terrorism Actor extension of Emergency and all should be looked at ina much more careful manner. But, the Government has takenthat decision. So, the United National Party will see howit responds to that.

Going on to the economy, I would like to touch upontoday, out of the expenditure, almost Rs. 129 billion hasbeen allocated for defence expenditure. You are talking ofseven to eight per cent growth rates and then you have thistype of unproductive expenditure. The expenditure incurreddoes certainly come in for computing the Gross Domestic

27472748

[ ]Product of this country. Now, going on further, in thisBudget, is there any emphasis placed on the pavementhawkers - , , , ? . , , . , , . , 122_ 1,22,000 _ Tax Amnesty . ? , ? . 15 :

I quote:

Collection of Tax in DefaultMr. Speaker, recognizing the difficulties faced particularly by thesmall and medium business sector, I propose to waive all penaltiesaccrued on any tax in default for the past 5 years and give a periodof 3 years to settle all such arrears in instalments. Any party whofails to comply with this arrangement, will be liable to pay the fullamount with penalties.

Now, Sir, the very aspect of going to the Supreme Court,getting to say that that was illegal, retrospective action wastaken and now you bring it to same Parliament and tell thedefaulters, You can take your time to pay. We basicallydid it in good spirit. There was the necessity to do so. Theprofessionals came forward and told this. Now you arebringing back the same type of thing. Now is this illegal?If the Supreme Court did say that the United National Partysaction was illegal, then why are you trying to incorporatethis at this particular moment? Due to lack of time,I wantto table this. But let me go forward.

Going into other areas of the Budget, there is a greatpursuit to reduce cost. Almost Rs.25 billion capitalexpenditure has been reduced. Elimination of duplicationof capital projects et cetera are mentioned as Rs.16 billion.Going on further, there are allocations made to theLankaputhra Bank, to e-village, to the Presidential Task Force;you have done everything. But one thing that has not beenmentioned in this, Deputy Minister of Finance and Hon.Prime Minister, who is here, is the Mihin Airlines. On oneside you say Rs.3600 million is going to be the cost, butnot a single cent has been allocated for this. Is there a Cabinetapproval obtained? No. was the answer that was givenby the Hon. Minister of Aviation.

Going on further, the revenue which is spelt out here insuch a huge budget only Rs.16 billion revenue increase hasbeen mentioned. So is this a step forward taken in a Budgetthat is supposed to be development oriented? There is a lotof smoke in this. This is like a Roman candle. You lightthe candle, it goes up in flames and nothing falls down. Thatis exactly the situation of this budget if you may sum up.

Going on further Sir, , .. If thatis the case how is it that the country which has had PeoplesAlliance Presidents for the last thirteen years hit all time highinflation during the last month? Inflation hits 10- year high.Sri Lankas annual inflation rate is 19.8 per cent in November,2006. This is what is said by the Department of Census andstatistics. Let me table* this for the sake of saving time. Butwho created this inflation? Inflation is not something thatis self-created. It has many components. It has the importcomponent. It has a domestic component. Is it cost-push?Is it demand-pull? All of these are looked at and then finallyyou come into an inflation trend. But what in Sri Lanka todayis, absolute mismanagement. It is owing to excess subsidiesthat are given without relevant income. Today a huge monsterhas been created. Macro economic policies have been putaside. You all politicize the Ministry of Finance. Macroeconomic policies were set aside for the simple reason oftrying to win elections.

The mentality is like a lighthouse theory which reflectslight without knowing what is out there in the vicinity.That is the policy that is being pursued, Hon. DeputyChairman.

The Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Ministers are hereand all we say is, please ensure that the economy of thiscountry is protected, nurtured, fostered and that it goes intothe future. If we do not increase capital expenditure today,how are the earnings of tomorrow going to come in? Thatis all, what we are saying.

Going on further, there is a necessity to ensure that thereis peace in order to develop the economy. The mostimportant ingredient is the peace process. If we do not

* .{ Placed in the Library .

27512752

[ ]have peace, the country is in pieces. We, the UnitedNational Party on 22nd February, 2002 brought these piecestogether and put forward a peace process which was termedthe Ceasefire Agreement. There may be many faults in theCeasefire Agreement but to date this Government also, intheir own sagacity, has decided that they should carry itforward. The reason being that there is no other alternative.Now, is the alternative war? Well, that is the Governmentschoice. We have seen the international community speakingwith the President and they feel that the Ceasefire Agreementneeds to go forward. There is a general saying that youget the chicken by hatching the egg and not by smashingit. But this Government seems to be smashing that egg.We have got to ensure that there is dexterity in handlingthis.

The JVP, in 1998 was banned. The ban was lifted andthey were brought into the political mainstream. Todaythey are basically talking of banning. I, on this Floor, inthis august Assembly say that one of the biggestcontributory factors of this terrorist organization in thiscountry is because of parties like the JVP.

In 1987, when the Vadamarachchi attack was going onthey were saying one thing. When the Indian Peace Accordwas signed, they were fighting to get the Indian Army outof the country. They opposed the Ceasefire Agreement in2002. Then the P-TOMS Agreement came they opposed itagain. Now when President Rajapaksa is having a verydifficult task on his hands, he is called to India, theinternational community is there, the JVP say Ban theLTTE. Is this a way of trying to basically eradicateterrorism or is it to perpetuate terrorism, is the question thatwe are asking.

Going on further, today we feel the absence of peoplelike the Hon. Raviraj, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham andthe Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. All of them are no morewith us. Their silence only says, have we pursued the correctway? On 12th August 2005, the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamarwas killed in Colombo. On 25th April 2006 an assassinsationattempt was made on Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka,the Army Commander. Then on 14th August 2006, therewas an assassination attempt on the Pakistan HighCommissioner. Then on 1st December 2006, the Secretarywho is handling Defence was almost assassinated. So goingby these, is Colombo safe? In that case the military pursuitis not being been done by the Government in a proper way?The Government is in full control from April 02,2002. ThePresident of this country for the last fourteen years hasbeen from the Peoples Alliance. Then where are we goingwrong?

Sir, I table* a letter from the Express Newspapers (Cey)Limited addressed to the Hon. Minister of Media signedby Kumar Nadesan where the Hon. Ministers assistance is

sought to ensure the distribution of Tamil language papersin the Eatern Province. Mr. Kumar Nadesan has also dawnthe attention to the media communiqu from theGovernment Information Department issued in thisconnection. The truth must be disseminated to all parts ofthe country. Otherwise what will happen is, we are onlygoing to be stuck in the mud by not realizing what is goingon in the outside world. We were accused. We were accusedwhen certain houses at Athurugiriya were raided by thesecurity. They said it was the UNP that was behind thatconspiracy. Then when we expended almost Rs.65 billionfor capital expenditure they were saying that the UnitedNational Party was very weak on the LTTE. Today, whathappens? Today, the Government is saying that an ArmyMajor admits spying for LTTE. Then it goes on furtherto say that the Major went out of his way to offer MajorGeneral Parami Kulatunga to the Tigers. All these are doneby the existing army that is there. All these sins were puton the United National Party. Today, the same Governmentis coming and saying, I am sorry. There seems to besomething wrong in what we told.

Then, the President goes to India and says, TheDevolution Package would be placed before Parliament nextmonth. The PTA has been brought into effect. Then,Prabhakarans statement came from the Wanni. Not that itneeds to be taken cognizance of, but still he said, Nooption, but Eelam. Are we, as a Government and anOpposition supporting you to develop the economy andfor the dexterous handling of the ethnic situation, able toprovide an answer to them? The Hon. Members of the HelaUrumaya , the Venerable Monks who are supporting theGovernment, say, State your stand on the de-merger. TheJHU asks the UNP. We are in the Opposition. The problemis, the Members of the heterogeneous Alliance are tryingto run the Government through the Opposition these days.If you cannot, please tell us, we would be able to providethe answer that is required for that.

Sir, I would like to come back to the most important thing.That is, peace needs to be brought back again. Then, aboutthe revenues that are being collected, there is a generalperception among the people that monies paid as duties,excise duties and in various forms are today going in thewrong direction. On VAT there is a huge scandal. Why isthere a stony silence on that? The Hon. Minister, thePresident, did not even utter a word on this in the entireBudget Speech. We like to know as to what is going onwith that mega fraud? Is it because there are certain namesthat have got highlighted that there is a stony silence or isit an attempt to cover up and sweep everything under thecarpet once again? If we are unable, if we do not have thesophistication and the skills, to ensure that we run the VATsystem in a proper way, then make sure that we do awaywith it and go back to the BTT or the simple Turnover Taxcollection process which would be regressive, but, at least,the point of collection would be known and also cheaperin administering.

2006 0627532754

Then, Sir, I would also like to take up the rupeedepreciation, which is creating a major problem in thecountry today. On 2nd April 2004, when we handed overthe country, the US Dollar was at Rs. 93. Today, it is almostRs.109. So, it is obviously mismanagement of the economythat has taken place. The rapid appreciation of the rupeethat took place in those days is today a rapid devaluation.All this has an impact on the countrys economy. If, bychance, on one side, the rupee depreciation helps theexporters, on the other, it basically defeats the importers,who are dealing with an import-based economy today. So,overall, there is an outflow of money. There is almost USDollars 950 million a month being remitted on imports andonly about US Dollars 650 million is coming in on exportson a monthly basis. So, there is a deficit that needs to becovered. It is the remittances of the innocent people whogo overseas that keep the economy afloat. How long canwe afford to go on like this? We are living beyond ourmeans and in this state, how are we going to tackle this?

The interest rates are another big burden. But, this again,Mr. Deputy Chairman, is a self-created situation. Thiseconomic path we are leading is by choice, not by chance.If it is by chance, we all can be sympathetic. We havebeen telling the Deputy Minister of Finance, the Ministerof Finance and the relevant officials that this is a difficultpath we have to go on and if we do not go with caution,what the ramifications would be. Today we are feeling thoseramifications.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, the Answer I got for Question No.0479/06, gives the interest and the capital paid out peryear as amortization. In the year 2006, there is almost Rs.379 billion that needs to be paid out as capital and interest.So, that is a huge amount.

Then, Sir, on the Question that I had asked, What is theinterest on the local borrowings?, the rough average costgiven on local borrowings is, 10.9 per cent. On foreignfunds, it is almost 0.79 per cent. This is why we have beensaying that there is a necessity to ensure that macroeconomicpolicies are pursued to the letter. There is a general apathywhen you try to get loans from lending institutions. Onthat score, when we told them, These are the conditionsthat you have got to make because you give soft loans,they disregarded that. Today we pay the price: we payalmost an 8 per cent, 9 per cent interest rate when we earnonly 3 per cent to 4 per cent. If you do a cost benefitanalysis, you would find that the revenue that comes in forthe expenditure incurred gives a negative return.

So, on that basis, how are we going to go forward? Weare living well beyond our means, is what is visibly seenhere. I tabled the document for the simple reason that itneeds to be perused. This information, very well collatedby the Finance Minister, has been given to us. We need tostudy this and ensure that before we get caught in a deathtrap, we extricate ourselves out of it. There is no fun insaying this, but we need to ensure that we correct thissituation at this particular moment.

Then, Sir, I would like to refer to another matter in theBudget that was presented, which was reported in TheIsland newspaper of 17th November, 2006 as Public sectorurged to control finances. Very good. That is the way;it is a laudable attempt. But then, is that what is beingpursued? I mentioned on an earlier occasion that the salaryincreases promised to the public servants and the relief tobe granted to the general public need to be given. Nowcertain people who have got money voted for their salaryincreases must ensure that the innocent people are lookedafter today. We are supposed to be representing them here.Why is there a stony silence on that? They need to beprotected and immediate action should be taken to givetheir salary increases.

Going on further, Sir, if you look at the Samurdhiexpenditure - I table* a document on Samurdhi reliefincurred for the last ten years - in 1995, when this was started,there was an expenditure of Rs. 2,300 million.

Thereafter, in 1996, Rs. 6.7 billion was allocated and inthe year 2005, Rs. 8,900 million was spent. But, if youlook at the real value of money then and today, taking theinflation out, the money that was allocated from 1995 upto today has drastically reduced. That is, from Rs. 6,700million in 1996 to almost Rs. 3,100 million in real termvalue. So, what is the purpose? We are giving money,on one side, to alleviate poverty and on the other, owingto the wrong policies that are pursued by theGovernment, we are making the people more impoverished.

So, if we do not correct ourselves, we will have morepoverty in this country. If you look at the year 1994, thepercentage of people who earned less than Rs. 1,000 a monthwas almost 46 per cent of the families in this country.Today, Sir, it is reported that the percentage of people whoearn less than Rs.1,000 a month has gone up to 55.4 percent. So, that means that the United Peoples FreedomAlliance Government has been creating more poverty in thiscountry. Is that a fashion? Is that the political basis onwhich you are going on? Is that what Governments areelected for? Today, the people must get to know this. Thereis fallacy put forward. At every corner, there are postersand billboards coming up. But, is that bringing indevelopment to this country?

There was a newspaper article under the headingReducing public expenditure. Sir, I am tabling* anewspaper article which appeared in The Sunday Leaderof 3rd December, 2006 under the heading ANCL writesoff Rs. 43,000,000 debt of the SLFP.

[ ]Then, you can see the front page headline in The SundayTimes of 3rd of December, 2006 which states, I quote;

Big fraud and billion-rupee scandal in latest MiG dealThe same newspaper also reports, I quote:Probe on luxury cars held up in Port

The CEB buys duty-free cars using tsunami funds.Tsunami-affected people are languishing in huts today notknowing what their future would be.

The Government borrowings come from two sides: one isfrom the foreign elements and the other is from the localelements. Today we have a manipulated money marketbecause the EPF and the ETF, which are the captive sources,are being utilized to pay the Government deficits that arethere.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, the most striking thing which Iwould like to bring to the notice of the House is that almost51 per cent of the savings portfolio of the Bank of Ceylonis collected from the innocent savers right round the countryand today those savers are getting only a 6.1 per centinterest. You rob from the peoples savings by paying themonly a 6.1 per cent interest. When the interest rate onTreasury Bills is 12 per cent, inflation is at 19.9 per cent,how dare you pay these savers only a 6.1 per cent interest?So, I call upon the Hon. Minister of Finance and the Hon.Prime Minister to immediately look into this and ensure thatyou do not rob the money of the innocent people of thiscountry. You go to the outskirts and ensure that you collectmoney from the people, paying them more than a 6 per centinterest. How can you convert that into expenditure? Your

Government expenditure is at 11, 12 or 13 per cent. If wetake the Treasury Bills, you pay a 12 per cent interest. So,why are you paying the innocent investors only a 6 per centinterest?

This matter was brought up in the COPE. I like to sharethis information because this is the same thing that ishappening with the EPF and ETF funds. You take the EPFfunds and the ETF funds and pay them a return of almost10 per cent. Now you are giving them a negative return.Why should they work, give the money to the Governmentand get a negative return just because the Government isborrowing? What a colossal sin it is!

Likewise, you look at the foreign element. Today we mustensure that the excessive borrowings are properly handledby the professionals who are there. Today, I am informedthat there is US Dollars 2,400 million, which is beinghaphazardly handled overseas. I hope the Central Bank andthe Ministry of Finance and Planning would get togetherand ensure that we provide them with a necessary answer.We can make a huge amount of money for the country asthe Central Bank is doing a professional service.

Today, with the Budget we have done one thing: we havedistorted the save for the nation concept in this country.We have been told to go and consume rather than save.They have discouraged saving. For the first time, theGovernment steps into the boardrooms of privatecompanies. They tell the banks or other companies, Youmust pay this amount of dividends. Where in the worlddoes this type of thing happen? You have been unable torun your own Government well. You are unable to run theGovernment institutions properly. Now, you go into theprivate companies and say, If you want tax benefits, youmust ensure this amount of dividends is paid out. Wheredoes this type of thing stop? You, on one side, create cost-pushed inflation; you break the competitive advantage ofSri Lankan companies and on the other side, you go andtell them, This is the way you have got to expend thesavings of the company. So, please ensure these arecorrected. If we do no arrest this type of situation, what wehave got to do is to reduce the savings of this country.As I mentioned before, today there is a negative return. Ifpeople are consuming rather than saving, you must rectifythis anomaly. Otherwise, we are going to be in seriousjeopardy.

I would also like to, at this particular moment, touch uponcertain other institutions that come under the Ministry ofFinance and Planning. Two such most important institutionsare the State Banks, the Bank of Ceylon and the PeoplesBank that came under the supervision of the COPE. Wewere astonished at the information that was placed beforeus. Collectively devoid of politics that we were investigatinginto this. The most important thing was the cost of capital.The cost of capital of the State Banks was roughly about 14per cent. The administration cost roughly was around 4

2006 0627572758

per cent to 5 per cent. The most striking factor was the costto income ratio, which was 74 per cent at the Bank of Ceylonand almost 76 per cent at the Peoples Bank. So, how onearth can you make a profit when the normal expected normin commercial banks is in the range of 45 per cent to 55 percent? When the State Banks are having such a high rate ofcost to income ratio, how can they afford to lend at a lowerinterest rate to the people who are borrowing? So, this isthe reason why our manufacturers, who want to go overseas,are today hampered and this is the price we pay forcommercializing or politicizing our economy. Therefore, themacroeconomic policies need to be re-looked at. Instead oflooking at it in a micro sense, look at it in a macro senseand bring about the financial discipline that is required,which is absolutely essential. I table*, for the sake of savingtime, this Table for the simple reason that I like it to be studiedand a professional to have a look at it as to how we canextricate ourselves from this mess we are in.

Then going on further, there has been taxation on banks,which is being very vigorously pursued. But one elementwhich I would like to recommend to the Government ispawning, which is in the hands of the private banks andprivate registered institutions. There is a whpping Rs. 130billion that is involved, which does not seem to be gettingcaught up in the network or on which we are not able tocollect money. Sir, I would appreciate if this is beinglooked at. If there is a method of collecting more revenue,this should not be allowed to go on like this. If thecommercial banks doing pawning are faced with a problem,then let the others in the industry also face the sameproblem. If not, let the Government take the advantage ofit. I just put that forward as a suggestion. Then, Sir, on thesame score, when we try to reduce the expenditure of theGovernment, we have huge anomalies taking place.

When the Katunayake International Airport was bombedby terrorists in the year 2001, what did the Ministry ofFinance and Planning do in order to motivate the foreignairlines? They said that they would ensure that a specialsubsidy is given only to the Srilankan Airlines so that theycould start the flights as soon as possible.

That was looked at a point of time when it was bombed.From then upto today, this subsidy has been going on. Untilsuch time that this entity had to come before COPE, whichis six years later, this subsidy was being paid to the Sri LankanAirlines. This is apart from a special subsidy being givenduring the privatization owing to the quantity discounts thatwere being bought. Today they buy 63 per cent of the totalsales of the Petroleum Corporations aviation fuel. They buyabout 600,000 litres of fuel a day. This concession was givenin 2001 when it was bombed. Six years later, can the Finance

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . . , , ,when the Government is basically sinking with additionalrevenues being difficult to find and expenditure being pruneddown at every single place, here is Sri Lankan Airlines, whichis providing the highest cost factor tickets to the Sri Lankans,today enjoying a concession of US Dollars 0.10 per litre,which is basically a loss of Rs. 2.1 billion for the five and ahalf years that it was being implemented. Who is heldresponsible for this? We are taking away every singlesubsidy that is there from all the innocent people and hereis the Sri Lankan Airlines, which is not even owned andmanaged by Sri Lanka any more, basically getting thisbenefit. I table* letters that have been exchanged between;the Chairman, Petroleum Corporation, Hon. Minister Fowzie,Chairman, Sri Lankan Airlines and the Secretary, Finance whois giving this benefit. For six years how did this benefitcontinue? When we asked this question in Parliament wewere not given a proper answer. All that we want to do isto ensure as to who is responsible for this.

Time and time again politicians are being blamed for themess in this country. As I said before, the economy is facedwith a two pronged attack. One is, external, from a militarypoint of view from terrorists and the other one is a termiteattack which is taking place from the bureaucrats in thiscountry. We have got to correct this. Why are we beingbranded as part of the problem? We may be, as some ofthem say so. But are we the whole problem? No. We needto correct this and ensure that it is rectified.

Once again I would like to speak about another importantpoint that was mentioned in the Budget. The Hon. President,who also happens to be the Minister of Finance, presentedcertain very detailed booklets that try to show that everycorner in this country is being developed from some fundor the other. In the process he did mention about special

27592760

[ ]projects for accelerated development in Sri Lanka. He alsomentioned various items that are there covering from Northto South and East to West. In the process he looked at thetransport sector and mentioned certain things like, light rapidtransit from Ratmalana to Battaramulla and Battaramulla toDematagoda, upgrading the coastline track from Matara toColombo and also purchasing a fleet of new buses to replacethe old fleet, et cetera.

Then he goes on to the Ministry of Ports and Aviation.On the Ministry of Ports and Aviation he mentioned aboutthe Colombo Port expansion, the Galle Port development,development of sea port in Hambantota, development ofOluvil Port and the development of the second internationalairport at Weerawila. All these are looked at. But the mostimportant and striking thing is that the Mihin Airlines whichis the budget airline that has been mentioned, has not beenallocated in this. Has the Cabinet given the approval wasthe question that we asked in an Adjournment Motion whichwas placed before the Minister of Ports and Aviation onthe 30th of November, 2006 and No was the answer. Soin that case, how are things going on without the knowledgeof the Cabinet? There is expenditure which is being incurred;whether it is for the office at BMICH, or the World TradeCentre, whether it is for trying to buy wet lease aircraft fromDubai or whether it is for going and speaking to BalkanAirlines and trying to take two aircraft from there. All thisinformation is before us. Who has authorized this type ofthing? This is the same Government that is today deprivingthe kerosene subsidy to the people. They have deprivedthe trishaw drivers and lorry owners. They are not gettinga subsidy on diesel or petrol in this country. You are utilizingRs. 3.6 billion in order to have a budget airline for people togo frolicking on their own. Is this the financial discipline inthis country? Who is held responsible for this? Look atthe companies of a similar nature like Asia Air, Expo Air andDeccan Air. They have taken almost 16 months from thepoint of registration to getting the aviation licence to aircraftor the operating licence. Sir, I here table* a letter dated 13thOctober,2006 from BOI which is addressed to Mr. Sajin DeVass Gunawardena. As the CEO he had made the requestonly on the 12th of October.

And on the 13th of October, the BOI confirms SajinGunawardena, Presidents office, Colombo 1, getting an airlinelicence. Is this the Peoples Alliance Government that issupposed to be? ? BOI , , , 01 . BOI . 24 . trishaw 10 24 . , . -

After all, this land belongs to all of us.This does not belong to some chauvinistic elements thatbasically ruined the economy in 1971 or in 1988 and whoare trying to bring in problems now. It is the collectiveresponsibility of people that helps to bring peace to thiscountry. With the help of the Sri Lankan citizens and theinternational community let us put Sri Lanka back onthe map.

So, I wish all the Members of this House and the citizensof this country a very happy Christmas and all the best forthe year 2007 as today is the last Sitting day in this year.

Honarable Sir

We greatly appreciate the consistent stand youhave expressed in the matter of media freedomand feel confident that you will be able to assist usin the challenges facing us.

As you are aware two months ago a consignmentof our publications bound to our Batticaloa officewas stopped and the newspapers were set on fire.This matter was reported to the Police We alsoinformed the Secretary Ministry of Defence andother relevant authorities.

Consequently a Media Communique was issuedby the Department of Government Informationunder the hand of Mr. Anusha Palpita Director.

The Communique was a strong one and statedinter alia that the GOSL recognizes that an attemptto prevent distribution of newspapers is an attackon the right to information and it is totallyunacceptable in a democracy. Further it mentionsthat the GOSL. will not tolerate any attempts byany group or person to harass or intimidate mediaand every possible step will be taken to foster,strengthen and sustain media freefom in SriLanka.

Subsequently our publications were permitted tobe distributed in Batticaloa. Unfortunately we areonce again faced with a similar problem withunnamed groups preventing the transport andprevention of our Sunday Publication.

We would be most grateful if you would pursuethis matter and assist us in every way to ensurethat Tamil lanuage newapapers (including theThinakural and the Sudaroli which have sufferedthe same fate) are distributed in the EasternProvince.

Thank you.

Yours respecfully,Express Newapapers (Ceylon) Limited
