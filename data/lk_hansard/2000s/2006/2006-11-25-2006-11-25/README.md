Hon. Chairman, I am glad to follow my Friend, the Hon.Mahinda Samarasinghe and I am also equally happy that theHon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle is also present in the Housetogether with my Colleague Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

I wish to deal with just one subject and one subject alone.That relates to this Parliament passing enabling legislationto adopt a treaty. That was an issue that was raised thismorning and it became a virtual hornets nest. We also didnot fail to see some degree of difference of opinion evenamong the Cabinet Ministers in the Government ranks.Though the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle tried to douse thefire a little, I know where his heart lies. We have aresponsibility to bring out certain issues in their correctperspective.

Sir, we have a privilege today, which we did not enjoy inthe earlier days. We have a seat in the UN Human RightsCouncil. But just having a seat alone is not enough. Withthe seat, comes certain obligations as well. From what hasarisen as a result of this famous case of Nallaratnam Singarasawho has been sentenced to 50 years imprisonment, laterreduced to 35 years in appeal on the basis of an allegedconfession, was given a ruling in his favour by the UN HumanRights Commission which the Government sought to ignore.

Singarasa petitioned Supreme Court for a revision orreview of earlier decisions of the Supreme Court and othercourts. None other than Mr. R. K. W. Goonesekere, a championof human rights in this country, who is a very respected lawyerin Hulftsdrop and somebody who has even declined to acceptsilk, though he has better credentials than many who hasassumed silk, was the counsel in this case. It is very interestingto see his comments regarding the unanimous ruling of theSingarasa case. That is a notable fact that the justices wentout of the way to rule on a matter that did not arise. Ignoringwhat was at issue 0 the petitioners plea for justice was thematter in issue - they ruled on the legality of Sri Lankasaccession to the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.

Mr. R. K. W. Goonesekere says this. Not only did thisnot arise in the case, it was never raised by court and wasnever argued. Indeed the time given to make oral submissionswas limited and an application on behalf of the petitioner fora further date of hearing was ignored. We must also rememberArticle 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.The Convention says this. Every treaty is binding on stateparties and must be performed by them in good faith. Suchtreaties, Mr. Goonesekere submits, are not subject to judicialreview. This is where the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, myselfand the Hon. Kiriella are in agreement, I am sure. Hon. JeyarajFernandopulle knows, I defended him when the SupremeCourt found him guilty on -

15311532

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

That matter was never argued in court.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

That is right.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

That was not an issue. But in the judgment, justice MarkFernando found me guilty.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Exactly. This is repeating. We see that various viciouscycles are now returning. If you look at the nationalistssentiments, I am sure that Mr. R. K. W. Goonesekeressentiments are not different to many others. But then heis a champion who would not compromise on basic humanrights of the citizens of this country. That is why we respecthim. That is why, we, legal practitioners always respectedhim for having refused to accept silk, because he is a manof principles. He says this. When he says this we got totake note. Of course, he was the counsel in the case. Thatis a different matter.

Let us look at some other facts. Sir, all of us have a veryhigh regard for our former Minister of Foreign Affairs, thelate Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. He had rather painstakinglybuilt up a platform to project Sri Lanka to the world as amodern civilized nation needing help to contain the LTTE.Are we not, by doing some things which we are doing today,fighting to become the mirror image of the LTTE in abusinghuman rights of our own people? When I raised some issuesregarding what happened in Mutur and in Pottuvil, therewas contempt for me amongst some in the Government ranks.But it is my bounden duty as an elected representative of thepeople and of a party which got the largest mandate fromthe Muslims in the North-East, to air my grievances in thisHouse. I did not nothing but that. There were severalMinisters who came with me to Pottuvil who heard the samesentiments in sufficient measure from the local people of thearea. But today we are worried about the direction in whichwe are heading.

In May 2006 when the European Union banned the LTTE,we were very ecstatic I was the only one who said that thisoption was available to the former administration, the UnitedNational Party as well. But we never thought that it wasopportune then. Perhaps it became opportune later for thisadministration. But now, the international criticism of SriLankas worsening human rights situation is bringing us backto the mid 80s and the early 90s situation.

I pity my Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe. Nowhe has a very difficult brief. I know that. The Hon. MangalaSamaraweera whose Ministrys Votes will be debated thisafternoon has a much harder brief perhaps. But then we havecreated certain institutions in this country. When theNineteenth Amendment to the Constitution was to be moved,I was one of the persons who insisted that certain changesmust be made.

( )(The Chairman)

Hon. Member, I am sorry to disturb you. But you haveonly a couple of minutes more.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

I am concluding, Mr. Chairman. Let us not allow ourselvesto virtually become lackeys defending everything just forthe sake of being in Government. Let us have a backbone tofight. This is the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksawho was a champion in his own days. He understands usbetter, perhaps, than most of them. But then he may be acaptive of circumstances today. But he has to realize thatthere has to be some reform in the hallowed institutions ofjustice in this country.

We cannot allow things to happen as it happens today.That is why we wanted some reform and I am not going tospeak at length because my time is running out but, I mustsay that the Government, if it thinks it fit, must bring theenabling legistlation, which I feel may not be necessary, I amat cross purposes with the Supreme Court on this issue likemy learned Friend the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. But now,the Government has to oblige the Supreme Court as the Hon.Lakshman Kiriella said because we cannot allow; becausethere is this hallowed principle in State craft. There has to bea separation of powers. We have to respect the Supreme Court.Parliament should not go beyond the bounds set by theConstitution for us. Therefore, we need to bring inamendments, but let us not delay this because some of us mayhave to go and invoke the jurisdiction of the Human RightsCouncil. Every citizen has got to have that right and this isthe very right which the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar foughtfor during his lifetime and he acceded to the Optional Protocol,not anybody else. He is not a mean legal luminary and duringthat time it was the current Chief Justice who was the Attorney-General advising the Government. Did he not see it fit toadvise the Government about the lacuna that was there whenwe acceded to the Optional Protocol? So, these are questionsto ponder, Mr. Chairman, and with those comments I conclude.

I thank you.

( )(The Chairman)

Thank you. Hon. Ameer Ali, please.

( )( - )(The Hon. Ameer Ali - Minister of Disaster Relief Services)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Mr. Chairman,

During the year 2006, my Ministry did relief andreconstruction activities throughout the country. Relief wasprovided to families displaced by floods and landslides. Alsoemergency relief were provided to people displaced in Muturand Vakarai.

Families displaced by disasters caused by both nature andhuman activities were provided cooked food and wherenecessary dry rations for longer periods. When people werekilled by disasters their families were given financialassistance to meet their funeral expenses. The victims ofdisaster were also helped financially to repair their houseswhen their houses were damaged.

My Ministry deviated from the concept of relief and moreemphasis was placed on disaster reduction and prevention.Rs. 10 million was spent for widening and cleaning canalsin Gampaha, Colombo and Puttalam Districts. A majorreason for the floods was due to canals and drains beingblocked.

Action was taken to construct rain water tanks withcommunity participation in Badulla and Trincomalee toprovide drinking water to the people during the drought.This will also solve health problems caused by drinkingpolluted water. This Ministry also assistance to sink commonwells for drinking and agricultural purposes in the DivisionalSecretariat at Pottuwil.

Awareness is extremely important for the people to protectthemselves from disasters. Accordingly, my Ministry hasconducted training for the benefit of Divisional Secretaries,other public officials, members of non-government alorganizations and school children.

One of the major problems in responding to a disastersituation is, necessary resources not being available at Districtlevel. As a solution to this, a Resource Centre with all thenecessary equipments and resources has been established inRatnapura. Action is being taken to establish similar Centresin Matara, Ambalangoda, Nuwara-Eliya and Batticaloa.

My Ministry has started publishing a quarterly newspapercalled . Also action has been taken topublish books for educating the people about disasterreductions.

The National Disaster Management Centre under myMinistry has started a database of all information with regardto disasters that occurred during the last 20 years. Those whoare interested in getting information about disasters in SriLanka can have this information from this database.

Mapping the areas in Kalutara District which are affectedby floods has been completed. This was done as a pilotproject. I like to thank the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe inthis regard. By using these maps the areas can be identifiedbefore a disaster occurres. Also the areas affected by tsunamiin Peraliya, Hikkaduwa has been mapped. A project hasalready been started in small scale level to provide drinkingwater in the dry zone, in Welikanda, Polonnaruwa area. Atpresent more than fifteen thousands families in Valaichenaiarea undergo suffering as a result of there houses andcultivations going under water. Their livelihood is affected.Their childrens education is affected. My Ministry hasdisigned a Storm Water Drainage Project with the assistanceof Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and DevelopmentCorporation to slove this problem. The KOICA of Korea andthe KfW Bank of Germany have agreed to provide fundingfor this project. The two agencies will agree to give a grant ofRs. 715 million to implement this project. On completion ofthis project Valaichenai will be a flood-free area. I take thisopportunity to thank the Korean Government and the GermanGovernment on behalf of the Government and the people ofSri Lanka.

( )(The Chairman)

Your time is up. You can table your speech.

( )(The Hon. Ameer Ali )Give me two more minutes Sir. On the direction of HisExcellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2007 myMinistry will focus more on disaster reduction and preventionrather than on relief. I am having discussions with all theparties concerned including local government authorities,district administration, relevant government agencies and soon. My Ministry will implement a project that will reducethe impact of disasters.

In order to respond immediately to disaster situations myMinistry is taking action to establish an Emergency ReliefUnit which will have all the necessary resources. Once this isdone, the district will be able to tackle disasters withoutwaiting for assistance from Colombo. I take this opportunityto thank the Secretary, Mr. M. A. R. D. Jayatilake and all staffof my Ministry.

Thank you.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Sir, to begin with the discussion in the Committee Stage,first of all, I would like to draw the attention of the Hon. D. M.Jayaratne, Minister of Posts and Telecommunication, to thestrike of the Sri Lanka Telecom staff. Ninety per cent of theSri Lanka Telecom staff is on a strike. Their grouse is that theengineers are being given a 40 per cent salary increase whereasthe technical, clerical and the minor staff are being givenonly a 6 to 7.2 per cent increase. I think on Thursday 90 percent of the staff were on strike. But the Chief Executive Officer,Mr. Annan, a Japanese national, is not prepared to talk tothem. The only request from the 23 unions is for the SLTManagement to talk to them and settle this simple problem.So, I kindly draw the attention of the Hon. Minister to takenecessary steps and ask Mr. Annan, the Chief ExecutiveOfficer to settle this problem. Otherwise, as you know, Telecom

is losing a huge amount of money each day as a result of thestrike. So, that is one request that I would like to make fromthe Hon. Minister.

Sri, regarding the Disaster Management and Human RightsMinistry I do not need to say anything. We have to applaudthe Minister. That is all we can do, applaud the Hon. MahindaSamarasinghe, who chaired the Select Committee toRecommend Steps to Minimize the Damages from NaturalDisasters when he was in the United National Party. Whereverhe is, he is a Minister who is so efficient and so capable. Hecan do anything. So within a short period I see from his reportthat he has done so much. He has set up a new Ministry in anew place and organized the office. And also he has set up acentral office and district offices and gone to the villages tosee you cannot avoid natural disasters in future how youcould take necessary action to prevent natural disasters. Sowe have taken steps to face future natural disasters. The Hon.Minister is now chairing another Select Committee toInvestigate and Recommend Steps to Prevent Man-madeDisasters and I am a Member of that Committee. I could seefrom the three meetings he had already conducted, hopefullyhe would come out with the best results.

I have to applaud the Minister of Disaster Relief Services,the Hon. Ameer Ali also. I see within his capacity he is doinghis best. Though he could not take part in the tsunami reliefactivities I see him actively taking part in the flood reliefwork and in the earth slip relief work. Because of the civilwar situation the people are suffering in the Mutur, in Vakaraiand in Sampur area. His Ministry has done a lot even forthese people. As far as the Ampara District is concerned, thisis the district Sir, which suffered heavily. More than half thetotal number of deaths in the Ampara District occurred inKalmunai. Specially in Kalmunai, almost 8,000 people died,about 17,000 houses were destroyed and almost 5,000 to6,000 houses were completely destroyed. So many lost theirlivelihood, but I am sorry to say here that the Minister whowas entrusted with relief assistance as an urgent need,temporary need or permanent need, is so inefficient,ineffective, does not possess any knowledge and has notdone a proper job. People call that particular Minister, atraitor of that community. We even had a GA who was veryinefficient Sir and very ineffective. I refer to speciallyKalmunai Sir. People who were affected by tsunami inKalmunai are still suffering.

By next month, the tsunami disaster will complete twoyears. You have declared December 26th as the National SafetyDay. But our people are still suffering. As you know, thesedays, there is Chikungunya fever. Almost everybody issuffering from Chickungunya fever. Suffering is such, Sir,mosquitoes are on one side, and on the other, people cannotlive because of the dust due to the wind. They cannot sleepin the night. The day time is so hot. The roofs put up by therelief organizations and the NGOs are leaking, and they havenot got their permanent houses yet. You have to build about1000 houses within the 65 metres. The Minister concerned

15431544

[ . . . ]waited for one year, to find land to build houses. Until HisExcellency the President sent a special team to find out aboutthe strike that went on in the Kalmunai DS Division, peopledid not know where their houses were going to be built.

In our area, there is no land, Sir. But at the beginning itself,people wanted to take up the issue with the Government, askthe Government to find funds to purchase paddy lands tobuild houses. Let them find money to fill the land,for infrastructure and then build houses for them. It took sucha long time. Still they are filling lands of five acres or tenacres.

I hear that there has been no meeting regarding the tsunamiin the Ampara District. There has been no such meeting. Hon.Mahinda Samarasinghe, you are here. I have told you aboutthis at one of the meetings, Sir. I wanted even you to organizea meeting and sit together. The Hon. Anver Ismail is there.You can ask him. He can be a witness. We have two CabinetMinisters and two non-Cabinet Ministers, Sir. You ask themwhether they know anything about this. You ask them whetherthere is any consensus amongst these Ministers. So how canyou expect the Opposition Members of Parliament to be there?There are no meetings held to discuss, Sir; as to where tobuild, what is to be built and how to assist the people wholost their livelihood. There are no discussions taking place.Sir, only one meeting took place. At that meeting, we took upso many matters. But after that nothing has happened. Weeven asked them to set up an office in Kalmunai to discussthese matters. The particular Minister is sleeping in Ampara.We requested even the GA to come on and off to Kalmunaiand see the situation. We even asked them to hold a meetingin Kalmunai. But there is no unity amongst these GovernmentMinisters. This is one failure.

Secondly, there are no discussions taking place with theother Members of Parliament. Now, I hear the particularMinster is trying to build houses on three perches for twofamilies to live. Is it possible, Sir? Is it acceptable for twohouses to be built on three perches of land, we do not know.There was no discussion. We just overheard from others. Sheis trying to build houses on three perches; ground floor forone family and the upper floor for another family. It has to bediscussed. Our poeple are not used to living in flats and apart-ments. If you cannot build a house, at least give a minimumof six perches of land per family. They can build on theirown. But if the Government is allocating Rs. 250,000, thatshould go to them. It is you who asked them not to go within65 metres, the buffer zone. It is you who asked them not tobuild houses there again. So the Government should pro-vide them relief. But the problem is, the people do not knowwhat is going to happen. There is no communication withthe people. The particular Minister comes and goes, takesad-hoc decisions. Ask the Hon. Anver Ismail who is presenthere.

A disaster naturally causes pain to the masses. But, some-times, a disaster is an opportunity. It can be mere luck. Some-times, it is like a gymkhana and some people make money.Some people hang aroud the Minister and make money. Thereis an incident, Sir, that I would like to mention in this Forum.

( )(The Chairman) , .

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

I will finish in a minute, Sir.

I hear that in Kalmunai a particular piece of land of fiveacres was filled and they had charged Rs. 69 million. This isone of the reasons why they did not want to propose to theGovernment to fill any more land. Already the people aroundthe Minister have played out Rs. 69 million by just fillingthe land with the debris from the disaster. They had claimedRs. 69 million. It may be due to that reason that they did notake up further filling with the Government.

But we thank His Excellency the President. Alfter the peoplecame onto he streets and demonstrated, he sent a team fromColombo and relief was given soon. He instructed to fill 50acres of land.

That is one thing that has to be inquired into, Sir. How canthe filling of five acres of land cost Rs. 69 million? We alsohear that soon after the tsunami disaster, the then Ministry ofInfrastructure Development in the Eastern Province had spentRs. 128 lakhs. We do not know where that money went. Weknow that soon after the disaster, people went towards theSamanthurai and Ampara areas. The residents in those areaslooked after them: they gave then shelter, they gave themfood; they gave the shelter; they gave them food; they evengave them clothes. But, we understand that under the thenMinistry of Infrastructure Development in the Eastern Prov-ince they had charged; they have produced bills amountingto Rs. 125 lakhs. So, this is the state. On one side, people aresuffering from a natural disaster while on the other side, thereare people who celebrate.

( )(The Chairman)

Hon, Musthaffa, you will have to conclude.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Therefore, I request the Ministers concerned to go intothese in detail and take necessary action because at leastafter two years, the people of that area, who were victims ofthat disaster, will be able to live better.

Thank you.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Sir, I move,

That the Programme be reduced by Rs. 10.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)Sir, before I get on to the main Discussion on the Votesof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I would like tocongratulate Dr. Rohan Perera PC, the Legal Adviser to theMinistry of Foreign Affairs who has been elected to theInternational Law Commission. He has secured a seat. Hehas brought honour to Sri Lanka. He is a very good officerand an asset to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

I also learnt that the present Secretary to the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, Mr. Palihakkara is retiring. He is one of thefinest officers in the Foreign Ministry, in the Foreign Serviceand has rendered a very good service. I think his retirementcould be considered a loss to the Ministry of Foreign Affairsbecause he was not only a good diplomat but anadministrator as well. I only hope that the Hon. Ministerwill consider him for a post that may fall vacant in one ofthe embassies because I am sure he knows the Sri Lankansituation quite well.

It is also a pity that Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala could notbe the Secretary General of the United Nations. This wasthe only opportunity that Sri Lanka had of securing this

2006 2515611562

post. He is such a knowledgeable person and held the postof Under-Secretary General. I do not know why theGovernment did not push adequately. But, ultimately whathappened was, I think the Government compromised withSouth Koreans and he was asked to withdraw. I do not knowfor what reason. I do not want to come out with more detailsof what the compromise was. I will leave it at that butexpress our sadness that he was completely thrown out.

Sir, with regard to the functions of the Ministry of ForeignAffairs, according to a gazette notification there are a seriesof functions. There are about eight functions noted there. Iwould like to refer to the aspect of External Publicity. Thisis what is causing damage and loss and so much ofunpleasantness prevails in the minds of the internationalcommunity about the affairs of Sri Lanka. This is one ofthe most important functions, I would say, among othermatters of foreign relations enumerated in that gazette.

The situation today is that, Sir, Sri Lankas image istarnished abroad among the international community andthey hold a very poor or for that matter, a bad reputation ofSri Lanka both in the eyes of the international communityand the donor agencies. Never in the history of Sri Lankahas it been so bad. I do not know whether the Hon. Ministerwill agree with me but as far as I see, nothin is being doneto salvage and put the record straight. What is being done,the efforts made by the respective ambassadors appear tobe ineffective. We have zero results. The situation isdeteriorating daily. For this, the Hon. Minister of ForeignAffairs, I am sorry to say, has to be answerable. He has tobe held respeonsible to the people of Sri Lanka for thesituation the country is facing today. We need not go veryfar. I will just elaborate on what your own Minister, yourCabinet Colleague who is no less a person than the Hon.Anura Bandaranaike the other day stated in Parliament thatSri Lanka is fast heading towards a failed State. This isa very serious indictment, that Sri Lanka is heading towardsa failed State. It is a statement made by the Hon. AnuraBandaranaike on the Floor of the House. What more? Thereis nothing more for us to say about it. It is a seriousindictment referring to what is going on here in Sri Lankaand the opinion of Sri Lanka among the rest of the world.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

..Seconded.

, . " " Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair and THE HON.(MRS.) RENUKA HERATH took the Chair.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)Madam, Sri Lanka is now considered one of the counteiesthat records the highest number of incidents of human rightsviolations. There is no debate on that. If you read anynewspaper or magazine, you will find that we are consideredas coming into the higher category in the violation of humanrights and that is confirmend by the Human RightsCommission in Geneva and also by the Human RightsCommission in the United Nations to which I will refer later.

Another report by an international organization states thatSri Lanka is one of the countries that records a high level ofcorruption. I have got the name of it. I do not want to wastetime on that. But that is the impression that is now createdabroad.

Yet another report states that Sri Lanka is one of the mostdangerous countries to visit or live in. This is stated in whatyou call a Travel Advisory issued by the respectivecountries.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Hon. Member, can you please specify which countries havesaid that?

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)I am coming to that.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Please talk with responsibility if you do not mind.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)Your own Minister said that, not I.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Also with regard to corruption, please take responsibilityand submit the report you are quoting from to this House.

15631564

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)I am only quoting what your own Minister of Tourismstated in this House.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)But the other reports you are talking about, please tell usfrom where you are quoting them. That is all we are asking.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)I am stating from the information we have obtained fromthe respective embassies.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera )

Say which organization, which page et cetera.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Right. Now this is proved by the fact of the Travel Advisoriesissued by almost all the developed countries, the USA, theUK, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia and many othercountries. I mean, there is nothing to deny in that, Hon.Minister. It is very well known. Why should we hide this?Why should we debate on that?

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera )

You have to take responsibility, hon. Member of Parliament.I can assure you that things are not as bad as they used to bewhen you were the Minister of Interior in this country.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)Yes, I know that. I know that you are very good. You arevery efficient. Keep it for yourself. Why do they not visit SriLanka? That is because it is unsafe. They say it is unsafe.What have you done? My question is, what have you done tocorrect this situation? That is your responsibility.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera )

I will tell you.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)You are the Minister. You and your officials have to put therecord straight.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera )

I take full responsibility for everything that happens in myMinistry, Hon. Member.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)What have you done? Okay, you say you will prove that.

Within the last one month or so, there was a meeting of theCo - Chairs held in Washington, the observations of theHuman Rights Commission in Geneva, then the remarks madeby the State Department of the USA for not taking theperpetrators to rask; not filing action, not taking appropriateaction. So many other institutions like the World Bank, theIMF, the ADB, the Co - Chairs and the United Nations haveexpressed continuosly and they continue to express theirconcerns over the deteriorating situation in Sri Lanka. TheWorld Bank Representatives in Sri Lanka had made astatement. I have got a copy of that. It is very unfortunate.They have condemned and expressed their displeasure of allwhat is happening in the North - East, not only in the North -East but in the South as well.

Now, Hon. Minister, look at the summary of the Budget inthe last page, Annexure V. Under this, the Foreign Grants in2006 received by your Government was Rs. 45,725 million.In 2007, you have budgeted only for Rs. 24, 075 million,which is half of what you received in 2006. Now what is thesituation? This merely shows the very sad situation that SriLanka is placed in. Most of the countries of the Aid Group,may be the Co - Chairs, no longer want to support Sri Lankapurely owing to the bad record of violence, lack of goodgovernance, high level of violation of rights and once againthe question of corruption et cetera.

Now, I would like to read out a list of this foreign assistance,how we have been deprived of them. As I mentioned earlier,the foreign grants have come down by 50per cent all becauseof the adverse reports that are circulating among theinternational community. The European Union aid iswithheld. They have not committed themselves nor havethey agreed to give aid to SriLanka for the year 2007. The USNaval Training Programme for SriLankan Navy Personnelhas been suspended. This is all because of the situation thatis prevalent here. Then the German Development Aid also isbeing put on hold. Now, I have stated only a part of this butthere are many more institutions that are watching thesituation. As a result of the quantum of grants being very low,you have been compelled to go in for foreign borrowingswhich is the highest in the Sri Lankan history. That is Rs.114,789 million. Now that is what we are going for in ForeignBorrowings. That means there is an involvement of interestplus repayment instalments. So this is going to have veryserious repercussions because of the adverse publicity,because of the violations that are taking place and the balance

2006 2515651566

of payments will be upset. Finally tha people will have topay because the cost of living will go up.

Then, Sir, during the UNP regime from 2001 to 2003, SriLanka had enormous support from the donor community.Large sums as outright grants, soft loans and so many otheropportunities were there for us to obtain funds for thedevelopment of Sri Lanka. The goodwill that Sri Lankaenjoyed among the international community and the hardwork that was put in by the then Ambassadors and the ForeignMinisters themselves has been of no avail. My question onceagain is, what are you going to do? How are you going torevive this situation? When will you be able to bring backthe glory of SriLanka and ensure that Sri Lanka is the Paradisein Asia as was referred to in those days?

Now look at the statement of the Co - Chairs issued on 21stNovember, 2006 after the meeting in Washington. For thefirst time the SriLankan Government has been found faultwith for the violation of the Ceasefire Agreement. So this is avery serious situation. In the good old days, there weremeetings in the UN but they only found fault with the LTTE.But today they are finding fault with the Government of SriLanka for the ceasefire violations. I have got here thestatement. It is very sad to see what they have been pointingout. This is a very serious situation.

I quote form the Joint Statement by Co-Chairs of theTokyo Donors Conference issued on 21st November, 2006.It says:

The Co-Chairs view with alarm the high rising level of violencein Sri Lanka....

They also blame the LTTE. I do not deny it. It says:

The Co-Chairs condemn the continued and systematic ceasefireviolations by the Government of Sri Lanka.....

They blame the Government of Sri Lanka and also theLTTE for the ceasefire violations. At the same time theysay that the Ceasefire Agreement should be upheld by theGovernment of Sir Lanka.

I furthur quote:The Co-Chairs particulary condemn the LTTE for initiatinghostilities from heavily populated areas and the Government of SriLanka for firing into such vulnerable areas and killing and woundinginnocent civilians.

So, this is the situation. I do not know whether they willgive us any form of aid until this situation is corrected andthat is another matter for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs toput the record straight.

Then, I would like to move on to an article appeared inThe Morning Leader newspaper of 22nd November, 2006which is very important because it states.

I quote:

Complicity of govt. troops in child recruitment UN confirmsRocks report will go before SC.

It is a very serious report. I am told that it is going to betabled on the 28th and we do not know what the SecurityCouncil will decide on it. They might decide on sanctionson Sri Lanka.

( )( + - +, )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairsand Minister of Ports and Aviation)

Where is it going to be talbed, Hon. Member?

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

In the United Nations Security Council. Here is the article.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Please, before you come to this House, hon. Member, getyour facts straight. The European Union has alreadywithdrawn that resolution.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

No, no.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

It has been postponed till March. Pelase ger your factsstraight.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

This further states, I quote:

CREDIBLE evidence on complicity of government troops withthe Karuna faction in the recruitment of child soldiers will be presentedto the UN Security Council by Allan Rock in his report.....

Not in Geneva;

It goes on to state, I quote:

.....the UN office in Colombo said.

Then again this article states, I quote:

Allan Rock says he has evidence against the government. Well,lets see what he has. It is only after we see the evidence....

Your Minister, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella makes thatstatement. He makes a statement and says. There is noevidence. What right does this man has to give reports of

15671568

this nature? After all, Allan Rock is a respected person inthe international circles. He was a former ambassador and aformer Minister in Canada. Also he is a special representativesent by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It youantagonize him, undoubtedly they will make adverse reports.

This is the situation now. All these are going to contributeto the tarnishing of the image of Sri Lanka. This matter isbeing taken up for the first time. I do not know what othersanctions the United Nations may adopt. Your GovernmentsDefence Spokesman and even the Hon. MahindaSamarasinghe made those remarks and they appeared in theheadlines of newspapers which I think were unwarrantedand should never have been made, because when thesereports are considered they will have a terrific adverse effecton us.

Now I would like to move on the Indian concern. I wouldlike to ask this question. Will the Hon. Minister of ForeignAffairs table the letter that the Foreign Secretary of Indiabrought to His Excellency the President? We would like toknow that. If you cannot table that letter, pelase tell us whatthe contents of that letter are.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

What is the letter you are referring to, hon. Member?

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

The letter brought by Foreign Secretary of India. Hebrought a document.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

No. Absolutely not.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Okay. Then, it does not matter.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

There was no letter.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Then please inform this House of the contents of themessage that he brought from the Indiak Prime Minister.We would like to know that. People must know that becausethere is a lot of pseculation. They say that the

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Responsible Members like you should not base yourarguments on speculations, hon, Member.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)

No. The situation in India is critical. Your President isgoing there. There are going to be demonstrations againsthim. Some of the Indian Mayors are boycotting thatmeeting. They are saying not to allow Sir Lankas Presidentto come to india. They are putting pressure on the IndianPrime Minister. That is the sitution today and do not wantto divulge what the Indian Prime Minister wanted conveyedto the Sri Lankan President. There are various stories. Insome papers, they say that letter is calling for progress bothin the peace takls and human rights violations. Some say,it is an ultimatum given to the Government by the IndianGovernment. The Defence Adviser, Mr. Narayan and ShankarMenon both went to South India before they left to Delhi.They went ad saw Karunandhi and tole him and appraisedhim of what is going on in Sri Lanka, what they have toldthe President of Sri Lanka and what India wants the SriLankan Government to do. It is a very serious situation.Do not understimate Karunanidhis position. This issomething that we have to take seriously. We must bringback the Indians on to our side.

Sir, the situatiion is that. This is a very unusual step. Thisis not the first time. This is the second time. India hasdelegated Foreign Secretary Mr. Shankar Menon to conductan on the spot study of the deteriorating Sri Lankansituation. Dr. Manmohan Singhs Government in Delhi underextreme Pres particularly from Tamilnadu, where newspaperscarry in their banner headlinesss daily the suffering of SriLnakan Tamils,. Mr. Karunanidhi, the Chief Minister ofTamilnadu has said that the Sri Lanka issue is a recurringheadache for him. And, mind you, the Indian Governmentis hanging on because of Karunadhi. Regulardemonstrations against the Sri Lanka Government for itsallegd military excess against excesses against the Tamilpeople take place in various parts of Tamilnadu, in Chennai,in Trichy, in Madurai and in other cities. Men like Vaiko,popular with the Tamilnadu masses, have brought in severalthousands of demonstrators in front of the Sri LankanMission in Chennai when the police barricaded and arrestedhim and put him in jail for a couple of hours.

The other strongmen like Dr. Ramdoss is bringing pressureon Mr. Karunanidhi. Even the former Chief Minister Miss.Jeyaram Jeyalalitha who rarely agrees with anything doneby Karunanidhi is now united with him on the Sri Lankanissue. So it is a very serious situation. In Tamilnadu they areunited in their stand that Delhi must take a strong and finalstand to ensure the peaceful living and future of the Tamils ofSri Lanka.

[ ]

2006 2515691570

This is not a joke. I have the list of Tamil parties that havejoined hands. Jeyaram Jeyalalithas party, then we have theparty of Gopalaswamy, Vaiko. There is a series of politicalparties that have come together to fight the Sri Lankan issue.

Then, Sir, when I spoke on the last Debate on the Extensionof Emergency Regulations, I reminded the House what Mr.Karunanidhi has recently said. He said, around 1990, he hadbeen asked by the late Rajiv Gandhi, as Prime Minister, touse his personal influences with Prabhakaran of the LTTE tobring about a settlement to our ethnic problem. When Mr.Karunanidhi referred to this matter recently, I thought he wasleaving the door open for the Sri Lankan Government tosnatch this opportunity, for the High Commissioner,particularly who is in Madras, could have gone and seen himand then appraise him of the situation and invited him to tryand come forward to settle this.

I believe, Sir, the test of our diplomacy today is to explainthe Sri Lankan position carefully and convincingly to Mr.Karunanidhi and his colleagues and other Tamil leaders inSouth India and make them understand that neither theGovernment nor the Sinahalese have any intention to harmthe Tamils in Sri Lanka. This is the concern and the fear of allthe Tamils in Tamilanadu and, if this is done efficiently andin time, through diplomatic efforts, the pressure on the SriLankan Government would have reduced. I know this becauseat the time that I visited India along with my leader there wasa lot of goodwill and people spoke well of Sri Lanka. Theconnections and the relationships between South Indiansand the Sri Lankan Tamils are very close. So, the ForeignSecretary has arrived to explain the situation and request theGovernment to take immediate action. Now, Sir, in thissituation, I think the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs willhave to take the South Indian issue quite seriously because ifyou cannot get India on to your side you are going to haveserious problems. Do not take it very lightly. I request you totake very serious note of what is taking place.

Now, I wll come to the Presidents visit to India. Accordingto newspaper reports, there is going to be protests in India. Ido not know whether the President should visit India in thosecircumstances and whether it is advisable. Most of the SouthIndian Mayors, as I mentioned earlier, are not going toparticipate in this meeting. The allegation that they aremaking is, that the Presidents hands are stained with blood.So it is a very serious allegation. Therefore, you must counterthese reports. I mean, you should not allow false propaganda.How can the Presidents hands be stained with blood ? He isnot responsible for any murder. But this is what is beingtalked of in that part of the world.

Then, Sir, there was a statement released by the AnmestyInternational. They have completely refused to send anyrepresentative to the Commission that has been called uponto investigate into the matters of Sri Lanka. That statement isdamaging our image. It is very clear. The AmnestyInternational says in a statement :

In the light of decades of impunity for perpetrators ofviolations of international human rights and humanitarianlaw in Sri Lanka, characterized by the failure of the authoritiesto investigate and prosecute such perpetrators effectively,only an international and independent Commission wouldhave the credibility and confidence of all parties to the conflictand sections of society to be able to conduct meaningfulinvestigations,....

They have no faith in the Commission or whatever that theGovernment wants to appoint. - [Interruption] Yes. They arenot going to appoint. These are matters which you will haveto take notice of and take necessary action to win over theconfidence.

Then Sir, in regard to the functions and the responsibilitiesof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a lot of rumours are goingaround. This is the propaganda that is spread by the LTTE.This is what they did during our regime as well. But we wereable to counter those rumours and false propaganda. So it isup to the Minister, your Ambassadors, High Commissionersand the diplomatic staff to work round the clock to arrest thissituation and bring back the good name and clear Sri Lankasimage and make sure that no further deterioration or damagewould be done to the good name of Sri Lanka.

Finally Sir, I would like to inform the Minister - I took upthis matter at the last Consultative Committee Meeting also- the situation of the Sri Lankan workers in Cypres. There area large number of workers in Cypres. I had the opportunity ofvisiting Cypres recently. They were all stating that their visasare now going to be cancelled. They are not gettingextensions. There are about 15,000 to 20,000 men and womenwho are working there bringing in a large amount of foreignexchange to Sri Lanka. With Cypres joining the EU, there aresome restrictions that have been brought in. They insist - theworkers there are very keen - that the Foreign Ministry shouldappoint a diplomatic officer to look after their interests. Atthe moment there is an Honorary Consul who is a Cypriot.But they are not happy with him for some reason. I do notknow why. I urge the Hon. Minister to take immediate stepsto see that the interests of the workers there are being lookedafter. They are also claiming that the insurance deposits thatthey have made, whilst in employment, which theGovernment has agreed to refund, is not being refunded. So,they made this complaint to us. I will leave it to the Hon.Minister. I hope he will make amends.

So, Hon. Minister, finally, what matters is you are theMinister who is in charge of Foreign Affairs. One of yourmain responsibilities is to safeguard the good name of SriLanka. If there are agencies that are trying to tarnish ourgood name, then you have to do your very best to rectify it.You have to make use of your diplomatic officers. You haveto make use of the ambassadors, high commissioners andother staff. Make them work round the clock. Explain SriLankas position. We are quite aware that the LTTE is theoffending party. There is no debate on that. But now what has

15711572

happened is that it has turned the other way as if Sri Lanka isthe offending party. That is what the Co-Chairs have statedin their statement. So is the Amnesty International, so is theHuman Rights Commission in Geneva, in the United Nations.So this is a very serious matter and you and your Governmentis answerable to this House and through this House to thepeople of Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

[01.52 p.m.]

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Bismillahir Rahmanir RaheemMr. Chairmam, I notice that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera hasleft the Chamber. Perhaps he must have gone for lunch. Mr. Chairmam,the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is wearing many hats Today, in mycontribution I will direct a few bouquets at him as well as brickbats.When it comes to the Ministry of Port Develoment and Shipping, asthe predecessor in office of that Ministry, I must grudgingly admitthat the Hon. Minister is doing a good job in a period where manychallenges are posed in running the affairs of the Ministry. This isparticularly so under the Chairmanship of Mr. Saliya Wickramasuriya,the new young Chairman. He himself in one of his interviews recentlyhas conceded at least that the work we did during our period wassomewhat salutary. As a result of reforms initiated by the Sri LankaPorts Authority in 2002, we achieved double digit growth for the firsttime and it was quite apparent that despite the locational advantage wehad, our growth was flat during the previous years and it was a matter

15831584

of pride for us that the Jaya Container Terminal ranked best amongthe productive organizations in the large category in 2003 at the Na-tional Productivity Awards. We were able to ensure that Colombosannual capacity expanded to 3.5 million TEUs and this we were ableto achieve without affecting the existing capacity by adopting somenovel methods. But, there was just one black spot during the Hon.Ministers tenure that arose as a result of the wildcat strike that tookplace recently. We had an Adjournment Debate in this House wherewe discussed this matter in detail and Iemphasized the need to havecontingency plans to address possible labour unrest in the future if itdose arise. I need not elaborate on the impact it has on the reputation,credibility of the port operations particularly since it is considered asa hub port in the region and as a matter of fact we achieved the hubport status many, many moons ago. Now, it remains for us to graduatefrom this status and then expand capacity to meet the challenges in thecoming years.

There are three important areas to which the Hon. Ministerhas to pay attention to. That is, capacity enhancement in theterminals that we have, a very efficient new terminalmanagement system and a state-of-the-art security systemcomplying with the latest standards. The Sri Lanka Port, theColombo Port as you know, Mr. Chairman, is in a very uniquestrategic position to function as a gateway to North Indianand Middle Eastern ports. But, we must together with theprivate sector pursue a policy to become a regional multi-port operator, which I am sure the new Chairman of the SriLanka Ports Authority is quite consciously pursuing. We willvery carefully monitor their job and try and offer whateveradvice we could in improving the standards that we wereable to set in the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

During my tenure, we did a survey on the growth potentialof container traffic in the East-West trade route and it wasforecasted that by 2040, our capacity should reach up to 20million TEUs on order to cater to the heavy demand thatmight occur by than. So we have a long way to go.Subsequently, we should, the Colombo Port shouldconcentrate only on container raised traffic with of coursethe exemption of cement and oil-related projects which arealready in place within the Port of Colombo. Here of coursewe may have to move, break bulk cargo to other ports likeGalle, Trincomalee and perhaps Hambantota when it isdeveloped and other Ports like Oluvil which hopefully wouldbe developed in the near future.

I would like to come now to the agreement signed recentlywith the Asian Development Bank for the breakwater initialphase of the South Port. It is reported that Expressions ofInterests from local and international parties would be calledafter the initial phase is over. I read somewhere that the newChairman had stated that that South Port should beoperational by 2009. I doubt, Mr. Chairman, whether at thecurrent speed at which we are proceeding on the South PortDevelopment whether that target is realizable. It would indeedbe a proud achievement if the Hon. Mangala Samaraweeraand his team could have the South Port operational by 2009.But I doubt, given the current climate where the internationalshipping lines are losing confidence and the current state of

the security situation in this country, our ability to raise fundsfrom local and international parties to build four terminals.It is going to be quite a difficult task.

In the meantime, we see that in deference to the proposalscontained in the Presidents Mahinda Chintana Programme,they have identified Hambantota as the next best alternativeafter Colombo exceeds its capacity. I think, there is somethingmutually contradictory in saying that Hambantota is the nextbest alternative after Colombo exceeding its capacity. I think,it is very prudent to say that Hambantota, as it is envisagedby the current leadership in the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, isto be developed primarily as a service port, subsequently tograduate on to an industrial port and when time approaches,final phase of Hambantota will be embarked on as aninternational container terminal. This is a very realistic andprudent approach to develop the Port of Hambantota. But itis my contention, that in a small country like ours to havetwo hub ports with container terminals would be too much ofa dream to aspire.

Having said that, Mr. Chairman, I must say that theauthorities in the Sri Lanka port sector have now tried tosettle some difficulties that arose with the public andfisherman in Oluvil where long-standing disputes which aroseduring my period are yet to be resolved. Several teams havegone to Oluvil. Their compensation issue is yet to be settled.There is some political interference in the payment ofcompensation to the fishermen. The Hon. Minister is quiteaware of the nature of the interference. Recently manyemployees have been transferred to Colombo, again perhapsdue to political interference. I hope that the Hon. Ministerwould be very apolitical in his approach. We need not punishthe poor workers in the Port of Oluvil simply for the reasonthat they held on to a particular political belief. But, I amsure that the Hon. Minister would be doing justice by them.I would not say much more than that except to look forwardto some reasonable means of dealing with the upheaval thathas taken place in that part of the country.

Having said that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to move onto the other area, which is of course very much foreign to meas much as it is to the Hon. Minister when he took over, theMinistry of Foreign Affairs. My sympathies are with theHon. Minister since he has entered into a field which wasmanned by a colossus, a person of the calibre of the late Hon.Lakshman Kadirgamar. He indeed has a very difficult job toperform. But then, this is a Ministry, where there would bemany people, not only in this Debate, but in many a debatesto come, who would make enough criticism. He would haveto face enough criticism.

Let me start by this particular quotation by Mark Twain.In his War Prayer he reminds us that even to pray for victoryin war is tantamount to asking that horrors be visited uponthe innocent of the opposing side. By saying this, I am notignoring the integrity in the argument that non-violencecannot always be the best moral course. But, Mr. Chairman,

[ ]

2006 2515851586

the duty of leadership, however, is inescapable to try to makemoral choices despite the immense difficulty of doing so andat the risk of being wrong.

Sometimes, Sir, the only way to achieve peace is to fightfor it. But then, we cannot simply ignore basic human rightswhen we pursue an agenda to establish peace. The Hon.Minister was an able lieutenant during the CBK times as welland he particularly knows the gravity of the situation. Theissue of human rights cannot simply be a matter of policy, Sir.It must be a mission. Respect for international norms and totest it in the hard grounds of diplomacy is a very, very difficulttask to perform.

I would like to quote from the Hon. Ministers speechduring the Discussion on the Vote of the Ministry of ForeignAffairs, last year where he says, I quote :

My Ministry attaches great importance and priority to the promotionand protection of human rights in all our international endeavours. Iam pleased to inform this House that Sri Lanka has continued to play avery positive and protactive role in promoting human rights. We willcontinue to follow this practice through co-operation at variousinternational human rights fora.

This is where I would like to come to the issue of theaccession to the Optional Protocol of the ICCPR which is amatter regarding which I spoke in the morning also. But Iwould like to advert this part. Under the guidance of the lateHon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka had very painstakinglybuilt upon a platform to project itself to the world as a moderncivilized nation needing help to contain the LTTE.Committed to human rights and accountability, it pursued avery clear agenda.

In its second periodic report to the Committee AgainstTorture in August 2004, Sri Lanka stated in conformity withthis outlook this way, the Government of Sri Lanka havingratified the international Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights in 1980 also acceded in 1997 to the Optional Protocolto the ICCPR, providing for individual complaints. Sri Lankais one of the few countries in Asia that has adhered the OptionalProtocol to the ICCPR. One thus sees that commitment toICCPR was pivotal to Sri Lankas credibility.

Having said that in your report, Mr. Minister, the situationthat has arisen as a result of the recent Supreme Court judgmenthas created a very serious anomaly. The Government has tovery quickly correct this situation. If we are to bring enablinglegislation to honour our commitment under thisinternational treaty obligation, we need to do what isexcepted of us. We do not have to look beyond. We do nothave to even seek advice from the Attonery-General on this.We do not have too far except to ask the Foreign Ministrywhich has very able persons in its ranks. Mr. Rohan pererawho has assumed an important international office recentlyis there. I must congratulate him for that. He is quite awarewhat needs to be done, if at all it is to be done, and yousimply have to give instructions and bring that enablinglegistation without any delay.

I would now like to come to another area relating to thesummoning of all the Ambassadors and Heads of Missions toColombo for briefing by the Government, His Excellencythe President and all those who matter. I felt the desiredobjective of getting them to understand the need to improvethe quality and capacity of our foreign service was leftwanting when finally they were leaving the country. I felt themorale and confidence of some of them were affected as aresult of the way in which criticism was levelled at not inperhaps the discussions, but when you see the media, it gavethe impression as if the foreign service is a bed of roses and asif it was a proverbial Lotus-eaters paradise. Is this image ofthe Foreign Service true? I beg to differ, Mr. Minister.

I would also like to pose the question as to why the ableSecurity of Foreign Affairs has gone on leave prior toretirement? This is quite unprecedented in our countrysForeign Service. We are informed that there were no less thanfour outsiders who were directing foreign affairs includingone from the United States and that the Secretary of ForeignAffairs has thrown in the towel. I am not levelling this as anallegtion. It appears to be quite strange as to why an ableSecretary of Foreign Affairs [Interruption]. I will take it ifyou say so.

Now the question is who would be the next. Quite certain,there would be many outsiders who would aspire to theposition, but whether they could command the respect ad co-operation of the Foreign Ministry staff is another matter. Youknow it is a specialized service. We have very good officersin this service and important positions such as the Secretaryof Foreign Affairs in such troubled times will have to be, inmy opinion, in the hands of a career diplomat. I am sure theHon. Minister will fight for the rights of the career diplomats.Your predecessor did that, several of your earlier predecessorsdid that and I am sure you would do that.

Mr. Chairman, now I would like to move onto a much morecontentions area and that relates to the Indo-Lanka relations.Mr. Shankar Menon, has come and gone. An impression hadbeen created as if everything is hunky-dory, but I beg toagree with my friend, the Hon. John Amarathunga who spokeopening the Debate that the ralations with India appear tohave taken a very regrettable turn. Until now it was onlyTamil Nadu politicians who were interested in the ethanicproblem here. But, now I see Members of the Lok Sabha fromother States have also expressed serious concern. We have avery able High Commissioner, Romesh Jayasinghe in Delhi.I have met him several times. He is cultivating a relationshipwith many Members of Parliament and others of influence.

( )(The Chairman)Hon, Member, your time is up.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)I would just take five more minutes and wind up,Mr. Chairman. I will sort it out with my side.

15871588

( )(The Chairman)We can stretch a couple of minutes but not more than that.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Thank you. We need to cultivate a caucus in Delhi amongParliamentarians. We have such a caucus in London, but it ismuch more important for us to have this caucus in the LokSabha. We have also in the recent times neglected, not onlyTamil Nadu where we have had our Deputy High Commissionperforming a very difficult job during very tryingcircumstances, but we need to concentrate in the other threeStates; Andhra, Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala in South India.But do we have a conscious policy to cultivate relations withthese States? It was done to some extent during the Hon.Ranil Wickremasinghe administration but we seen to haveveered away from that concept. The management of ourrelations with India needs to be improved through our foreignoffice. We cannot pay a heavy price for incompetence in thatarea. We may have to have a separate India Division in theMinistry if we are to meet the challenges.

There are many other matters I would like to deal with, butsince the time is limited I would say that the Hon. Minister istrying to do the best in a very difficult situation. It is not aneasy situation, but yet I am confident that the Hon. Ministerwho though is a newcomer to this area of foreign relationswill live up to the expectations of the Government, the peopleand everyone of us in dealing with this difficult period where.

We come under a very strenuous microscope by theinternational community on the conduct of the affairs in thiscountry.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Hon. Minister, I am very happy that you are modernizing theBandaranaike International Airport to international standards. But,there is a little inconvenience caused to the people who are goingthere to send off their kith and kin. I know it is quite difficult whilethe renovation is going on but I kindly request you to make somealternate seating arrangements for those who go there

One other matter that I would like to bring to your attention isthat the airfare from Colombo to Trichy is very exorbitant. The airfareto Trichy is more than that to Chennai. Therefore, I would requestyou to look into these matters and bring down the airfare to Trichybecause Trichy is the gateway to South India. The only airline thatis operating to Trichy is the Sri Lankan Airlines. I would like youto have a dialogue with them and bring down the airfare to Trichy.

Moreover, the Hindu people go to the Ayyappan Temple onpilgrimage. I would request you to make some special arrangementsat the airport itself for them to perform prayers in order toproceed to Trichy safely. Our people do not get anyemployment opportunities either in the ports or airports. Iwould request you to consider giving some sort ofemployment in the ports and airports for these plantationyouths because they are being deprived of theseopportunities.

As far as the foreign policy is concerned, I request you toconsider giving employment for our educated youth who areunemployed. Moreover, we will have to develop a very goodrelationship with India. Today, India is becoming a veryimportant country and our relationship with India shouldimprove a lot.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I rise to speak on a veryimportant Ministry handled by certainly a very competentMinister. But I do not think his competency is made use ofthese days. He is a person who can deliver much more than

16111612

[ ]it is open to vicissitudes of many things and I guess you havethe capacity, you have the ability, but ensure that theGovernment has the will to carry on what is expected of it.This is what I would like to say at this particular moment. Ifyou move from the SAARC regional partners or theneighbours to the Asian area, we have got China, Japan andKorea which are very instrumental in these types of activitiesbecause of the funding that is talking place. But there againwe should not pay off Asian friends for our SAARC regionfriends. By trying to tease or annoy our regional neighbourshere and trying to support somebody far away does not help.It must go hand in glove. It must fashion the overall foreignpolicy of this country. That is why I did ask whether there isa foreign policy that is pursued with the ultimate objectiveof getting Sri Lanka where it wants to get to. When it comesto the United States of America, I guess your ownheterogeneous partners do not allow you to pursue a policythat is vigorosuly good for the countrt Just because it is theUnited States of America, it does not mean that you have gotto slave yourselves to them. Neither do you expect that fromthem. But unfortunately, the Free Trade Agreement that waspursued by the United National Party Government is a deadduck today.

When you come on to the areas of the European Union,once again the labour ralated GSP is in jeopardy today andthat is for the simple reason that we are not walking alongwith the internationally expected norms that Sri Lanka shouldbe moving along. Conventions that are signed are practisedin the breath today. You, from the judiciary itself, havementioned that we are not bound to implement whateverprotocol or otherwise that have been signed. These types ofheinous crimes being committed by some people only put ademocratically elected Government such as this Governmentinto further disarray, into isolation and that is what led yourColleague, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike to say that we areheading towards a failed State. That is why, Hon. Ministerthe Government must be able to have a policy and pursuethat. You have the team behind you. You must get the mandatefrom the Cabinet to ensure that you move along. I know thereare many things that are sometimes well planned from oneend but executed from another. Now can that happen in aforeign policy approach? Please, ensure that you take fullcontrol of that. When it comes to the UN Council, we arehappy that with the moral persuasion that has taken place,certain resolutions detrimental to Sri Lanka which were tocome up were postponed and I hope that will never ever bedebated Three months time has been given. It is very shorttime. I am made to understand that this time has been givenfor the simple reason that putting committees together takesthat amount of time. If you sit on your laurels and say, Yes,it is postponed, then I guess we are just heading to disaster.So ensure that we can catch more bees with honey than withvinegar. Let us try to get the international community together.Let us ensure that at this hour of need we get the support ofthe international community. Otherwise, we will be puttingSri Lanka into jeopardy. When you look at the foreign policy,it should be able to fashion them, and at the end of the day

what he does. I guess the people concerned should be ablemake the maximum use of his potential. Mr. Minister, I amnot saying this to flatter you, but for the simple reason thatthis country is in absolute jeopardy today. Your Colleagueused the correct words by saying that this country is headingtowards a failed State. We have no pleasure in re-echoingthose words.

I guess, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister ofPorts and Aviation, you have an absolutely important role toplay. I guess that that should be used for the betterment ofthis country. I am on the basis that a foreign policy isabsolutely essential for our country. But my first question is,do we have a policy at this moment that is being pursued? Itis not something that has been created. It has been inherited.But the inheritance should be utilized in a manner thatprojects as to where we want Sri Lanka to be placed andtaken to.

If we start from our region, we have our regional friendswho are dear and close to us. But are we utilizing them to thebest of our ability? We have India who is standing tall there.Certainly with their regional power, they do influence on SriLankan activities. We cannot ignore India when we takedecisions in this region. But the way you are pursuing theforeign policy has made India neither a friend nor an enemyof ours. On the other hand, we also have Pakistan, who hasbeen very close to us. So, I guess that there is a necessity tochange the way we handle our foreign policy. The Governmentpolicy should not change with every foreign diplomat whocomes here. It should be one coherent policy from thePresident and the Government down to the Foreign Ministry.

You would see that the Opposition has a very coherent andconsistent policy when it comes to foreign affairs. We havetaken the difficult path. It may have not been what wasexpected by the people then. But a negotiated policy is whatis required for the country. We were virulently attacked duringthe election on 17th November, 2005 on the basis that this issomething premature and not something which is good forthe country. But today every particular person, theinternational community, has endorsed this view. One of themajor aspects in the Memorandum of Understanding betweenthe United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party isto see how we can get this moving. Whether the Secretary ofForeign Affairs from India comes to Sri Lanka or whether it isthe ambassadors belonging to the United States or EuropeanUnion, Britain, Japan or Norway or the internationalcommunity at large, what they want to know is why thisGovernment cannot accept genuine assistance that has beenoffered by the UNP in order to fashion their foreign policy.We do not want to be slaves of anybody. We have the courageof conviction to stand on your own. Just because we are asmall country, nobody should force us to do what they want.But certainly, we have to be politically realistic, regionallyrealistic and ensure that we walk along with the world. Theworld is not in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is in the world. Therefore,

2006 2516131614

7 PL 001663 (2006/12)

the trade policies of this country are developed. As Imentioned before, the Free Trade agreement with the UnitedStates of America is just a non-starter. I mentioned in thisHouse what the Trade Secretary then said about the TIFA thatwe moved forward. He said If you are able to implementwhat you did, you win the elections and come, and we willensure that we have a free trade agreement given to Sri Lanka.It is more today.

Today the democrats have taken control of the House. Thatwould definitely mean that there is no international tradeapproach that will be pursued by the Congress. So, on thatscore the next available option is to protect the EUs labourGSP that is there. Today, quite a lot of trading is taking palcebetween the European Union and Sri Lanka. So, please ensurethat the duty free states is protected through the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, despite the fact that the Minister of Trade,Commerce, Consumer Affairs and Marketing Developmenttoday seems to be somewhat in slumber. Whether it is theBIMSTEC, the World Trade Organaization or whatever, ensurethat we fashion ourselves to take the full internationalcommunity into our confidence in a manner that they expectSri Lanka to move forward.

I like the statement that was made saying that theambassadors should be doing the role of not attendingcocktails and wasting their time. They should be targetoriented. My feeling is that it is also necessary to reducecertain embassises in order to rightsize them. Today whetherit is a trade counsellor or ambassador, sometimes we feelashamed, not due to any fault of theirs, the allocation that isgiven from Sri Lanka does not suffice. If they take someforeign investors around, they should be able to spend. A lotof them are unable to go forward with entertainment becauseof the fact that they are not given the encouragement.Sometimes, it is embarrassing that I, my self have beenassisting in certain areas, because they themselves have beenlamenting. I guess, Hon. Minister it is necessary for you togive them the necessary facilities. They are very competentambassadors. They have been able to get the investors to thedoorstep. But they are unable to make the final conclusionbecause of the fact that the Government does not have thewill to carry it forward. So, please ensure that their facilitesare re-looked at. If you have 55 embassies reduce it to 25 or30 as long as we get the best out of them. I guess that is theway we need to fashion this.

Unfortunately, there is only a couple of minutes left. Withthe three important subjects. I will just browse through theother areas. Once again in conclusion I say, please ensurethat we fashion ourselves, that we get the internationalcommunity into our confidence so that we are able to takethe world by storm.

Then coming on to the area of the Ports Authority or theports activities in this country, once again there is a sub-optimization that is taking place. Today, the revenue of thecountry is determined by external factors. But the cost of this

country is determined by you. There again it is divided intotwo areas. One is the cost push on areas where externalinflation takes place and the second is politics with pricesthat are controlled from Sri Lanka. This is the area that weneed to control. Today you have the Ports Authority. TheColombo Port is playing a very pivotal role but slowly andsteadily losing its value in the region, because the other portsin the region are overtaking Sri Lanka. They are more efficientand cheaper. At the end of the day, these vessels are calling atthe cheapest port in this region. When we look at all theareas, starting from Hong Kong to Singapore, to Malaysiaand going on further to Dubai, Yemen or India, we are in acompetitive world.

It is ironic that the Ports Authority came before the COPEjust a couple of days ago. At that investigation, we found thatthere is an absolute sub-optimization and on certain areasabsolute misues of powers by some. I guess, sometimes itmay not even come to you. But if it has not came to you,please ensure that you pursue it vigorously and rectify thesegrave errors that are taking place, because this is one of themost biggest assets that are there. Whether it be the ColomboPort, Trincomalee Port, Galle Port or whatever, do not takethe revenue that is earned from one port cross subsided on tothe other area and ensure that the value asset is not spent onunwanted things.

If look at the Port of Colombo today, it is handling aroundthree million containers. It is virtually coming to a saturatedpoint. But once again this is not due to our own activities,but owing to the fact that there are problems in the regionand we seem to be getting a growth by default. But eventhen, let us be thankful for that. We must be able to take thegrowth that is there on a consistent basis. But by year 2008and 2009 you will find the port fully congested. So, are weready to take growth on that area? The South Portdevelopment has still to take place. It is made to understandthat tenders are being called but how long will it take? Thereare ports, Vallarpadam in Cochin is basically aggressivelycampaigning against Sri Lankan ports and its competitivewages are going to be much greater than Sri Lanka becauseafter all the containers originate from India. So, whilemaintaining the productivity we must be much more costefficient and make Sri Lanka a point where a foreign vesselwould like to call rather than we basically be left aside, andmove forward on the international shipping lines. Now thereagain while we are talking of the activities that are takingplace in the Port of Colombo, I guess that the most importantaspect is efficiency. Today, efficiency has reduced fromaround 25 to 27 moves per hour to almost 18, 19 moves perhour. This is something very alarming. Because if theproductivity increases the cost to the international ships willbe reduced. As a result, we will be making it more competitivefor them to call on the Port of Colombo. [Interruption] WhatProfessor Silva? [Interruption] You are talking to your DeputyMinisters on either side or you have got your wires crossed.[Interruption] The best thing is, you come on to this side andwe will come on to that side. We will do that job without any

16151616

[ ]cost needs to be spent by the Government. I am informedthat ADB is there. But the present cost is around US Dollars410 million. But going on further, I guess when this reallygets moving, it should be around US Dollars 500 millionwith total cost of almost US dollars 75 billion. That is by nomeans a small cost. Now, US Dollars 75 billion cost involvedover a period of may be ten twelve years, -

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Sir, the most important thing is to ensure that we spend itin the correct way. Otherwise, let it be outsourced, where theprivate sector comes on with a BOO-BOT Agreement orsomething like that. That is my own feeling, but I may besubject to correction. I guess it is necessary where theprofessionals are all brought in and checked. But this needsto move out quickly. The Vallarpadam or the Cochin Ports isgoing to be ready from 2009 and on the basis of what we aregoing to do, it will be only ready in the year 2011. Socompetition will sit in. Already the port is congested. Soyou will be running into a problem. Once we lose the market,it will be very hard to get it back all over again.

Then going on to the areas of Trincomalee, I am astonishedthat I saw a gazette notification where lands of the Port ofTrincomalee has been taken over from your Ministry and

problem. I guess Professor, from your level of intellectualityyou should be able to think like that. [Interruption] That iswhy, the two brothers are speaking these days. , , . . . []

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

This is obviously about space travel.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Ah! Space travel. Because he is living in space. ? So, Hon. Minister, all I want to say is thatefficiency in the Port needs to be absolutely improved.Seventeen, 18 moves must be able to go to about 25, 30. It isalready prevalent in SAGT. So, it is not somethingunthinkable. It is absolutely thinkable. I guess we are havingan extraordinary factor where a lot of our staff is being eroded.They are being taken into South African ports. So, we mustbe able to pay the wages that are relevant to the correct people.Just because Unions get up and make big demands, it is nota clarion call that you have got to ensure that those are paidfor. But the people who are working, may be a limited number,they should be well looked after. After all, you cannot saythat South Africa is taking our staff and ensure that we are leftwith a substandard level of staff. We must be able to do thatand today, as I said the international players are hoveringaround this area. You have got Deep International who hasbasically bought the shares - I am informed of the P & OShipping that they are interested in selling off their shares inColombo and looking at Cochin very aggressively. So allthis will have international ramifications, and we must beable to maintain the Port of Colombo in a hub state. That isthe most important thing. I guess there must be moreshipping-related people brought into the industry. There arepeople on the shipping lines in the private sector who arethere. I guess their knowledge should be brought in through,may be by brainstorming sessions or whatever it is, becauseshipping as I said is not just bringing one container. Youhave the transport field, you have the banking field, youhave the hotels, all of them revolving around this shippingindustry.

Going on further, I guess the Colombo South Port needs tomove forward and if you have got to move forward, you haveto ensure the breakwaters because that is the infrastructuredevelopment cost and whether the Government needs tobring this out is not the question. I was corrected when it wastold by the experts that are there that the breakwaters issomething which the Government has to do. My questionwas that whether it should be paid by us or whether it shouldbe outsourced. I am informed by the professionals that this

2006 2516171618

divested in the BOI without even your knowledge or a CabinetPaper originating by you. I myself was horrified because youbeing the Hon. Minister of Ports and Aviation, should haveoriginated this and said, Yes, we will be ready to giveanybody if required. But why does it need to be stealthilytaken? When there is a gazette notification, it wouldnecessarily mean that the entire Cabinet knows about it.When it is not known and it is suddenly taken away andgiven to another entity which is also within the Government,it only leads to speculation. What is this? All these lands aretaken away. It is not only the Port of Trincomalee, I am madeto understand it is almost half the District of Trincomalee. Soon that score what is going on? Is there an ulterior motive tobe given to somebody? If so please, tell us. If not, it is yourbounden duty to tell this House as to why it was taken withoutyour knowledge.

,( )(The Deputy Chairman) , .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , .

Then again, the Port of Galle is also very important. Iguess it was three years ago when the famous Mundo gastanks were there, that such a fuss was made by the Oppositionwhen we moved the Navy storage tank from Galle to Welisara.They made such a big fuss. But if not for that move, today bythe time they bombed that place there could have beenabsolute disaster. So, I guess it was a rightful thing that wedid then and the Port of Galle was saved. Likewise theHambantota Port, I am informed that there is a further delaythat is taking place. Is it correct? On the other hand, has therebeen a feasibility study done to see whether there is a necessityfor a port on the basis of containerization? Or is it deep-seabunkering that needs to take place. After all, the cost thatgoes in is no mean cost. Then the other area is IT related costin the Port. I am informed that there is a tender going out. Youshould see whether calling for tenders or outsourcing is whatis required. That is the most important thing. Today, it isbecoming obliterate so quickly.

,( )(The Deputy Chairman) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , .

,( )(The Deputy Chairman) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)We must ensure that this is looked at in the proper way.

Then the issue of the Sethusamudram project. That is anexternal factor, but see whether that has an impact on theshipping industry of our country. The Ports Authority stillhas not taken over the shares of the SAGT. Is that the properperspective? The valuation is still in doubt. You as theMinister must be able to ensure that directions are given inthat regard and within the next couple of weeks that isrectified. Otherwise, the benefits that have accrued to us willbe delayed.

Talking of the aviation industry, while we have theKatunayake Airport and when tourism is dwindling today,you have started constructing an airport at Weerawilaspending US Dollars 400 million. We are very happy thatinternational-

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)US Dollars 125 million.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am sorry, US Dollars 125 million. I guess, Hon. Minister,with US Dollars 125 million you cannot build an internationalairport. So, let it not be just a small airport built somewhere.If you can build international airports -

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)It will have a 4,000 - metre long and 75 - metre widerunway.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Okay. But, if building international airports in every townincrease tourism, then let us build airports all overthecountryside. But that is not what is expected. If you look atthe weather pattern, when it rains in Colombo, it also rains inthe down South. So, you should look at the weather patternbefore you start these projects. I guess the ICAO has certainregulations in this regard. This is not the correct place, iswhat has been stated.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Then, on 30th March, 2008, the Agreement with theEmirates comes to an end. It is just one year and three monthsaway. Please ensure that you do the proper thing. It has to beyes or no, whoever runs it. Then you are going to start MihinAir, which will be handled by a company formed with Mr.Sachin Gunawardena, the Secretary to the Treasury and theAir Force Commander as shareholders and directors. Is thislegitimate? Is this Cabinet approved? Who has given themoney? These are State funds. How can we just allow this tohappen? This is not a holiday airline. Please ensure, Hon.Minister, that you disclose to this House what is going on. Iknow you have been speaking to the Director, Civil AviationAuthority, to find out whether there is a possibility andsuddenly, you find a company being incorporated with fourdirectors appointed and money put in. Please, ensure that thecountrys aviation industry is protected. We must have anopen air policy. But that does not mean that you should havea closed-knit group to run the open air policy.

All we have got to say is, protect the important aviationindustry; protect the shipping industry and ensure that youbring in a foreign policy that would be able to put Sri Lankaon the world map.

( )(The Hon. Neomal Perera) , . Anyway, thank youvery much for giving me this opportunity to speak. I wouldlike to start by saying that one of the senior Ministers in yourGovernment had stated in this House that Sri Lanka is headingtowards a failed State. I think you will have to look it intoas to why he said that it is heading towards a failed State.It contradicts the statement made by the Hon. SripathiSooriyaarachchi. Probably he knows exactly what is goingon within the party and the Government especially.

Also Hon. Minister, you are holding one of the keyportfolios in this country which accounts for whateverdevelopment in this country; whether it be trade, security,tourism, defence or highways. You can build airports. But, ifthere is no infrastructure, those airports will be of no use. Youcan develop harbours. But again, if there is no ininfrastructure, those harbours will be of no use.

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake who spoke prior to me saidthat the Cochin Harbour is being developed in that region.We are depending very much on the Indian sub-continentand using our Colombo Port as a hub. In two yearss time, thearea where we hold containers will definitely not be enoughto hold whatever contains that come in, as a transit hub. Andalso, since it a gateway in Asia, we can really take betteradvantage if you handle this situation properly.

I do not know why the Colombo Ports harbour basin wasmade smaller and the jetty was not extended. I do not knowwho was behind it, whether it was due to internationalpressure, pressure by international contractors or whether theGovernment itself was not interested in developing theharbour. Now where in the world have they made the harboursor harbour basins smaller because in time to come there willbe bigger vessels coming in and they will not be able tocome inside the port, turn and get back. There are suggestionsto extend the jetty. I hope that will be done.

There are competitive examinations held to fill thevacancies in the Foreign Ministry. There are efficient andeducated offcials with a lot of experience. They arecomplaining that they are wasting their professionalismbecause they are not given due place. They are saddendedwith this situation. There are political appointments takingplace. They get appointments due to pressure by the Minister.They appoint their political stooges who have absolutely noexperience in foreign affairs.

I must also state that I have gone on several foreign trips,to the various embassies. The professionals there are doingwell despite the fact that there are less funds available forthem. I hope you will continue in your endeavour to appointprofessional diplomats to Foreign Missions so that they willbring repute and credibility to the country.

It is stated in the newspapers that the Emirates Agreementis coming in for negotiations. In that Agreement, one mistakeI see is that the Emirates Airline owned by the Middle East isgiven subsidized fuel by us. So I hope that will be removedand you will not give them subsidized fuel. If it is an Airlinewhich comes from a country that does not have fuel, then it isokay subsidizing it for them, if there is any advantage. It isalso saddening to note that the Members of Parliament arenot upgraded when they travel in Economy Class even thoughthe tickets are bought by the Government. It was so earlier.But only the officials of the Petroleum Corporation, theChairman and the Directors are upgraded. It is stated in theAgreement also because they have got fuel at subsidizedrates.

There is another issue, the landing rights in Rome. As far asthe Sri Lankan Airlines is concerned, that is one of thelucrative airlines. There are so many thousands of peoplefron the area of the Deputy Minister who live in Italy andthey do not have direct flights to come to Sri Lanka throughSri Lankan Airlines. The Emirates is using its airline, deprivingthe SriLankan Airlines from getting landing rights in Rome.

As far as trade is concerned, when I go through the relevantgazette of 2005, I find that external policy as well asinternational agreements come under your Ministry. As far asthe agreements are concerned, trade comes under you. Tradeagreements that we have enjoyed with India have beenscrutinized and they are taking advantage of the situation.Whoever is in the Trade Ministry is not negotiating inproperly and because of that we are suffering, our industriesare suffering and therefore our country is sufferingeconomically.

I would also like to mention about our area. We also havean airport in Palaviya, an area represented by your Hon.Deputy Minister. This is a small country. We do not have totake everything to Hambantota itself. Although you are fromMatara, do not take everything to Matara and Hambantota.Think about Anuradhapura as well. Your other DeputyMinister is also from that area.-[Interruption] I hope youdevelop the airports in the North-Central Province and theNorth-Western Province as well, so that we can improvetourism in those areas also.

I know how the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar handledforeign affairs at that time. I hope you get enough time tohandle foreign affairs and look after the countrys image.Asit is, we are losing our image and credibility in theinternational arena, especially in India. There are a lot ofadverse reports. I hope you will get enough time to correctthem and see that they will not jeopardize the name of ourcountry.

( )(The Chairman)Hon. Member, you will have to conclude now. You havetaken six minutes now.

2006 2516291630

( )(The Hon. Neomal Perera)Okay, I am winding up. Today we did not get the ProgressReport of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the next year. Itis the only report that we have not got. I do not know how theprogress is going to be. I hope within the next few days wewill get the Progress Report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Reports of other Ministries have been given. I hope you getthe money allocated to your Ministry, so that you couldcontinue with the development work and keep up your workas you have done earlier.

Thank you.

( )(The Chairman)Thank you. .

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Hon. Neomal Perera, I can assure you that the ForeignMinistry certainly will not appoint stooges to the ForeignService and I can also assure you that unlike the previousadministration, I will not he appointing carpenters or evenblue-eyed policemen to the Foreign Service. I can assure youthat. Thank you.

Mr. Chairman, first of all let me thank all the Members ofthis House who participated in the Committee StageDiscussion on the Votes of my two Ministries, the Ministry ofForeign Affairs and the Ministry of Ports and Aviation. Iwould also like to take this opportunity to thank all theMembers for their kind words of encouragement and of course,the constructive criticism also put forward by the Memberswill be taken note of and I am sure some of the ideas putforward by you will help my two Ministries become evenmore efficient in the years to come. However, due to theconstraints of time - I have only about 25 minutes to dealwith both the Ministries - I will try to give you a very briefoutline of some of the chasllenges we have faced as well assome of the achievements we have gained in the last year.

If I am not able to answer all the questions you have raised,I will certainly write to all of you once the Hansard is out andreply whatever clarifications you may have needed.

A little while ago the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake asked avery relevant question. He asked if the Government has aspecific foreign policy. Yea, I would say, we have a veryfocused foreign policy. In fact our foreign policy has beenguided by an approach which can be termed as pragmaticidealism. Pragmatic idealism, Mr. Chairman, is in short, inreply to Mr. Ravi Karunanayake, what guides our foreignpolicy a envisaged by my predecessor, the late Hon. LakshmanKadirgamar and now continued under me. Our foreign policyis pragmatic and practical and the first and foremostconsideration in our foreign policy is the country and ourpeople. I firmly believe that our foreign policy should not be

bound by or beholden to any ideological sentimentalities.In fact, earlier in the day Hon. Vijitha Herath also talkedabout our foreign policy and I think ideologicalsentimentalities have no place in todays world and we alwaysmust put the interests of Sri Lanka first and foremost as I said.

In fact, the global geopolitical framework over the pastfew years, as you all know, has undergone a considerabletransformation. Traditional alliances have given way to morepragmatic and practical partnerships where nations, as I said,are no longer bound by ideologies.

However, our pragmatic approach, I firmly believe, shouldbe tempered with idealism; idealism based on our vision forthe country. And as you know, Hon. Members of this House,our vision is for the creation of a modern multiethnic,multicultural nation where the Sinhalese, the Tamils and theMuslims and all the other communities which live in ourcountry can live together in dignity and honour within asunited country; a country despite its size that will not beservile to any nation; a country which will harness its naturaland human resources in order to achieve a sustainable andequitable economic development.

The important areas to which we in the Foreign Ministrygive priority are, as you know, first, the external aspects ofthe peace process- an area where we have made significantachievements during the course of this year.

The next area as equally important is, our economicdiplomacy initiative. Our Missions will be restructured toplay a central role in attracting foreign direct investment toour country as well as encouraging and promoting other formsof economic co-operation with other countries.

The third area we will also be concentrating upon, in theyears ahead, will be the area of cultural diplomacy, thepromotion of our cultural heritage and our cultural diversityabroad in order to improve Sri Lankas image as a key touristdestination. In fact, the Refreshingly Sri Lanka Festivalorganized by my Ministry in June this year was the launch ofthis initiative and we hope to have such programmes in 2007in India and China and in January 2008 we will also havesuch an event in Japan.

During my tenure as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, duringthe last twelve months, I am happy to state as I said earlier wehave made some significant achievements. Here, I would veryquickly like to refer to some of the salient aspects of the workof my Minister during the past year.

As mentioned by many of our Colleagues here on bothsides of the House; Sri Lankas diplomacy faces newchallenges due to the highly internationalized nature of ourpeace process at present. This international transparency ofour peace-making effort balanced with our sovereignty, ouraccountability both to our people and in relation to SriLankas treaty commitments in different areas of governanceespecially human rights are priorities in our foreign policyand foreign affairs agenda.

In fact, my Ministry and the relevant Missions overseashave taken immediate measures to voice our concerns andpresent correct and accurate facts when some foreign observersrecently raised certain issues based on disinformation andspeculation in their statements of our country. The Ministryremains engaged in active dialogue with the diplomaticcommunity. We carry out regular briefings and discussionswith the participation of relevant line ministries and lineagencies including the armed forces whenever necessary. Wealso maintain a similar dialogue and close contact withforeign Governments through our Missions overseas.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs as you know have hadconsistent and constant dialogue with a number of countrieswhich are interested and assist us in the peace process. Theobjective of this dialogue was to show to the LTTE that theircontinuous acts of terror would entail negative consequencesto them. This dialogue through Missions abroad and inColombo as you know was intensified after the assassinationof my predecessor, the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. Theseefforts were the forerunner to certain decisions of countriessuch as Canada and the 25- member European Union listingthe LTTE. I must emphasize as President Rajapaksa said inNew York last September, that the LTTE by its own actionshas brought about these measures by foreign Government.

The listing of the LTTE as a terrorist organization by theEuropean Union, the steps in enacting domestic legislationin certain countries leading to the arrest of persons engagedin terrorist related activities overseas against Sri Lanka, thecurtailing of activities of LTTE front organizations; like TROin Australia, like TRO in Great Britain, like TRO in Canadaand the United States, countering false propaganda, increasedbilateral and multilateral co-operation in the fight againstterrorism and support for the peace process are but a fewmeasures taken in support of Sri Lankas position in theinternational arena.

Following the ban in Canada and the European Union thisyear, our efforts of countering the LTTEs illegal fund-raisingactivities have intensified. Procurement of arms have alsocome under intense scrutiny and as you know a contact groupinitiated by the Government of the United States has nowbeen formed and is working very actively. In addition theFrench authorities have arrested suspected LTTE activistsemployed at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris as a followup to the Global campaign against terror.

The Government is of the firm conviction that solutions tothe issue at hand have to be sought through political meansand not through military means. His Excellency the PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa has continuously reiterated his visionfor maximum devolution of power in an undivided Sri Lanka.My Ministry and our missions have been consistent infactoring policies supportive of this process in our foreignrelation activities.

I must especially mention that since the meeting I had withthe US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice and other leadersof Capitol Hill in January this year, the United StatesGovernment has been extremely responsive in taking tangibleaction against the LTTE and its front organization in theUSA. Increased vigilance exercised by the US authoritiesresulted in the arrest of 16 LTTE agents, as you know a fewmonths ago, in what was called a Sting Operation by theFBI. As you know the bilateral relations between the twocountries have been further strengthened due to the highlevel visits and meetings including a meeting with HisExcellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa and PresidentGeorge Bush in New York, in September. Also, the UnderSecretary, Nicholas Burns and the Assistant Secretary, RichardBoucher are in constant touch with me and I would say therecent statement made by the Under-Secretary Burns at thepress conference held in Washington immediately after theCo-chairs meeting on Wednesday clearly reflects theinternational view of Sri Lanka. I would like to quote whatthe Under Secretary Burns said at the Press Conference :

And in the case of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan people and Governmentare a good friend to the United States. We support the government. Wehave a good relationship with the government. We believe the govenmenthas the right to try to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty ofthe country. The government has a right to protect the stability andsecurity in the country. We believe that the Tamil tigers, the LTTE, is aterrorist group responsible for massive bloodshed in the country andwe hold the Tamil Tigers responsible for much of what has gone wrongwith the country. We are not neutral in this respect.

In the other areas, Mr. Chairman, we have also had asignificant achievement by being admitted to the ASEANRegional Forum (ARF) this year. ARF Provides the oppotunityto discuss pertinent issues to regional and national securitysuch as illegal fund-raising, money laundering and armsprocurement. This is of particular importance as the curtailingof illlegal fundraising activities in North America and Europehas given rise to other regions becoming vulnerable to suchactivities.

As you know the Government in keeping with its policy ofopen and constructive co-operation with the UN human rightsmechainsms facilitated the visit of two UN special rapporteurson freedom of religion or belief and extrajudicial summaryor arbitrary executions this year.

This fact is something I must stress because it came upseveral times. The Government of Sri Lanka has had and ishaving excellent relations with India. I hope I do notdisappoint some of our hon. Members in the Opposition andsome members of the media who try to make out that SriLanka and the Government of India has certain problems.No. India of course has certain understandable domesticcompulsions. But despite these political compulsions of theGovernment of India they have been consistent in theirsupport, in their reiteration of their commitment to a unitedSri Lanka.

In fact, as you know, during the past year I have been toIndia five times as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. HisExcellency the President was there. His first State visit, in

2006 2516331634

fact was to India last December where he had extensive talkswith Dr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India. He hadextensive talks with the Prime Minister of India in Havanathis year and he will also be meeting the Prime Minister ofIndia on Tuesday. They have been very very helpful and ofcourse we have a new Foreign Secretary, Shiv Shanker Menonwho is a friend of Sri Lanka and who knows the nuances andcomplexities of our problem and also the new ForeignMinister, Pranab Mukheree, one of the most senior politiciansof India who is also deeply sympathetic to Sri Lankas cause.

I again take this opportunity to thank the Government ofIndia for the support they have been extending, as I saidearlier, despite the domestic compulsions they have to face.And, of course we have also retained a sound momentum inour economic and commercial collaborations with India.Many issues pertaining to the Comprehensive EconomicPartnership Agreement (CEPA) that seeks to build on theFTA have been agreed upon. We are confident that thesenegotiations would be completed within the next few months.

Of course, our Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan is fullyoperational and President Mahinda Rajapaksa who undertooka State visit to Pakistan has brought bilateral relations betweenour two countries even closer. In addition to that we havesucceeded in singning a Memoranda of Understanding withCambodia, Malaysia and Thailand during this year and ofcourse as was mentioned the conference for all heads of SriLanka Missions abroad held in Colombo after many yearswas a great success. As an outcome of that conference we willinstall a set of benchmarks that will measure the performanceof each mission and its personnel. Such guidelines will helpus monitor those who perform well to be earmarked forpromotions and extentions and I call this a Performancebased diplomacy and we hope that it will come intooperation from next year.

Again another important area I must mention is, the massiveoperation that was carried out by my Ministry, our mission inBeirut and the Ministry of Labour at the onset of the Lebanoncrisis. Over 6,000 of our nationals safely returned to Sri Lanka.In fact Sri Lanka was the first country which brought back itspeople; those who wanted to come back to their respectivehomes. In this respect I also must thank the Governments ofQatar, India, Lebanon, Cyprus, Syria as well as the IOM fortheir extremely valuable contribution.

Despite the gloomy picture painted by some of the membersin the Opposition, I would say that there are positiveimplications in the international arena because we seldomspeak of the action taken by my Ministry in avioding negativeactions. In September this year the European Parliament tableda resolution on Sri Lanka which in its original form wasextremely prejudicial to Sri Lanka. However followingintense lobbying by our missions in Brussels, Vienna andLondon. the final resolution, as you know, was consideredlargely as being favourable to Sri Lanka.

As was mentioned earlier the other resolution which was tohave been discussed on the 28th of this month has now beenrescheduled for March mext year. However, I also tend toagree with some of the Members of the Opposition as well asof the Government that we should not take this internationalgoodwill we have earned during this period for granted. Asthe Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said we should not rest on ourlaurels. In fact, we should now build upon the goodwill whownto us by the international community and in order to do so,Sir, we must ensure the safety and security of all our peoplewherever they may be in our Island. In facing the forces ofterror, terrible as they are as a responsible Government, as Ialways say, our responses should always be within the rule oflaw. An elected Government never has the luxury of resortingto counter terrorism even to face terrorism. This we have tokeep in mind.

Although, as you know, Sri Lanka was not successful in itsattempt to secure the post of Secretary-General, UnitedNations for Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala, I must inform this Housethat Sri Lanka and our candidate Ambassador Dhanapala werecommended by many countries for the dignified manner inwhich we conducted our campaign and the timely withdrawalin favour of South Korea also has been appreciated and welook forward to working closely with the new UN Secretary-General His Excellency Ban Ki Moon in the years ahead.

And of course as all the other Members did, I must alsocongratulate the Foreign Ministrys Legal Advisor, Dr. RohanPerera, Presidents Counsel for having brought great honourto our country by being elected to the International LawCommission by an overwhelming 138 votes. Thank you Dr.Perera. Of course, as you know, another great achivement thisyear was our entry into the Human Rights Council at its firstever election in May this year.

In addition to that, Sri Lanka and China, of course, willcelebrate 50 years of Diplomatic Relations next year, on the7th of February, 2007. His Excellency the President will bepaying a State visit to China and we also hope to have, as Isaid earlier, a cultural diplomacy initiative in Beijing duringthe course of next year. Similar programmes will also beplanned in Malaysia and in the Russian Federation in additionto India and Japan.

I would like to table* the rest of my speech , Mr. Chairman.Finally, I am very happy to say that the Lakshman KadirgamarInstitute of International Relations and Strategic Studies wasinaugurated in August this year. It is now headed by one ofour very senior diplomats, the present High Commissioner inMalaysia, His Excellency C.D. Casie Chetty. In fact, I havealready held the first Board Meeting on the 11th of thismonth.

Finally, before I go through very briefly the Ministry ofPorts and Aviation. I would like to say a special word ofthanks to my outgoing Secretary, Mr. Palihakkara who hasbeen a tower of wisdom and strength to me over the last year.In fact, there is nothing unusual about a senior Governmentofficial taking leave before he retires. I believe the Hon. JohnAmaratunga tried to impute certain motives into theretirement of Mr. Palihakkara. I can assure you that Mr.Palihakkara will come back to the Foreign Ministry as aSenior Adviser from January next year. I hope he agrees.

I would also like to thank Mrs. Geetha de Silva, the ActingSecretary and all the other officials of the Foreign Ministrywho work round the clock to bring glory to our country. Iwould like to thank all our Ambassadors, HighCommissioners, Consul Generals and Honorary Consulsabroad and of course, last, but not least I would like to thankthe members of my personal staff at the Bureau of the ForeignMinistry.
