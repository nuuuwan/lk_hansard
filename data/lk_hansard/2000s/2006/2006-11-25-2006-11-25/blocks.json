Their grouse is that theengineers are being given a 40 per cent salary increase whereasthe technical, clerical and the minor staff are being givenonly a 6 to 7.2 per cent increase. I think on Thursday 90 percent of the staff were on strike. But the Chief Executive Officer,Mr. Annan, a Japanese national, is not prepared to talk tothem. The only request from the 23 unions is for the SLTManagement to talk to them and settle this simple problem.So, I kindly draw the attention of the Hon.

He has set up a new Ministry in anew place and organized the office. And also he has set up acentral office and district offices and gone to the villages tosee you cannot avoid natural disasters in future how youcould take necessary action to prevent natural disasters. Sowe have taken steps to face future natural disasters.

Is it possible, Sir? Is it acceptable for twohouses to be built on three perches of land, we do not know.There was no discussion. We just overheard from others. Sheis trying to build houses on three perches; ground floor forone family and the upper floor for another family. It has to bediscussed. Our poeple are not used to living in flats and apart-ments. If you cannot build a house, at least give a minimumof six perches of land per family. They can build on theirown. But if the Government is allocating Rs. 250,000, thatshould go to them. It is you who asked them not to go within65 metres, the buffer zone. It is you who asked them not tobuild houses there again. So the Government should pro-vide them relief. But the problem is, the people do not knowwhat is going to happen. There is no communication withthe people. The particular Minister comes and goes, takesad-hoc decisions. Ask the Hon. Anver Ismail who is presenthere.",

They have not committed themselves nor havethey agreed to give aid to SriLanka for the year 2007. The USNaval Training Programme for SriLankan Navy Personnelhas been suspended. This is all because of the situation thatis prevalent here. Then the German Development Aid also isbeing put on hold. Now, I have stated only a part of this butthere are many more institutions that are watching thesituation. As a result of the quantum of grants being very low,you have been compelled to go in for foreign borrowingswhich is the highest in the Sri Lankan history. That is Rs.114,789 million. Now that is what we are going for in ForeignBorrowings. That means there is an involvement of interestplus repayment instalments. So this is going to have veryserious repercussions because of the adverse publicity,because of the violations that are taking place and the balance",

When Mr.Karunanidhi referred to this matter recently, I thought he wasleaving the door open for the Sri Lankan Government tosnatch this opportunity, for the High Commissioner,particularly who is in Madras, could have gone and seen himand then appraise him of the situation and invited him to tryand come forward to settle this.",

This is the concern and the fear of allthe Tamils in Tamilanadu and, if this is done efficiently andin time, through diplomatic efforts, the pressure on the SriLankan Government would have reduced. I know this becauseat the time that I visited India along with my leader there wasa lot of goodwill and people spoke well of Sri Lanka. Theconnections and the relationships between South Indiansand the Sri Lankan Tamils are very close. So, the ForeignSecretary has arrived to explain the situation and request theGovernment to take immediate action. Now, Sir, in thissituation, I think the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs willhave to take the South Indian issue quite seriously because ifyou cannot get India on to your side you are going to haveserious problems. Do not take it very lightly. I request you totake very serious note of what is taking place.",

But once again this is not due to our own activities,but owing to the fact that there are problems in the regionand we seem to be getting a growth by default. But eventhen, let us be thankful for that. We must be able to take thegrowth that is there on a consistent basis. But by year 2008and 2009 you will find the port fully congested. So, are weready to take growth on that area? The South Portdevelopment has still to take place. It is made to understandthat tenders are being called but how long will it take? Thereare ports, Vallarpadam in Cochin is basically aggressivelycampaigning against Sri Lankan ports and its competitivewages are going to be much greater than Sri Lanka becauseafter all the containers originate from India. So, whilemaintaining the productivity we must be much more costefficient and make Sri Lanka a point where a foreign vesselwould like to call rather than we basically be left aside, andmove forward on the international shipping lines. Now thereagain while we are talking of the activities that are takingplace in the Port of Colombo, I guess that the most importantaspect is efficiency. Today, efficiency has reduced fromaround 25 to 27 moves per hour to almost 18, 19 moves perhour. This is something very alarming. Because if theproductivity increases the cost to the international ships willbe reduced. As a result, we will be making it more competitivefor them to call on the Port of Colombo.
