: - : EXCESSIVE MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THENORTH-EAST: STATEMENT BY THE HON. MINISTEROF HEALTHCARE AND NUTRITION AND LEADER OFTHE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT

( )( - " )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Healthcare andNutrition and Leader of the House of Parliament) , , .

Hon. Mavai Senathirajah, on behalf of the Tamil NationalAlliance made a statment in Parliament yesterday accusingthe Government and the secutity forces of engaging in Stateterrorism and of creating an utmost situation of genocidalactivities. The statemtnt further lists out varous incidentsfor which the security forces and the so - colled Tamilparamilitaries have been held responsible.

Firstly, on behalf of the Government I wish to statecategorically that allegations of State terror andgenocide are mere justifications for LTTE terrorism. Asa case in point, we are shocked by the statement issued bythe TNP Parliamentary Group, following the suicide attackon Army Commander Lieutenant General Sarath Fonsekaon 25th April 2006,

I quote:

It was a direct consequence of the State terror that has beenunleashed against the Tamil civilian population of the North - East

At a time when terrorism is totality denounced by theentire civilized world, I am totally amazed by the callousjustification given by the TNA. I would also draw yourattention to the Report of the UN Secretary General on 27thApril where he pointed out,

I quote:

Terrorists must never be allowed to create a pretext for theiractions. Whatever the causes they claim to be advancing, whatevergrievances they claim to be responding to, terrorism cannot bejustified.

It is also unbecoming of the TNA parliamentarians toremain silent in the face of tactics employed by the LTTEof using civilians as human shields an attacking the securityforces in civilian populated areas.

Hon Speaker, for instance, on 10th April, the LTTEdetonated a claymore mine on the A9 highway in Mirusuvilkilling 5 soldiers and 2 civilians. The following day on 11thApril, as bus carrying Navy personnel on leave came underattack in Thampalagamuwa in Trincomalee killing 10 Navypersonnel and a civilian.

Two foreigners were also injured in the incident. On 4th

May, following the lobbing of grenades by the LTTE cadresat a police duty point in Vavuniya Town in which one armypersonnel and two police constables were killed, tencivilians sustained injuries in the explosion as well as inthe cross-fire. These are only some instances of what isalmost a daily occurrence of the most heinous acts ofterrorism perpetrated by the LTTE.

What is particularly unacceptable is the deafening silencemaintained by the TNA Parliamentarians to the LTTEs ployof holding civilians responsible for the spate of claymoremines and grenade attacks against the security forces. Thisis a total betrayal of the trust that the Tamil people havebestowed on the TNA Parliamentarians since it placescivilians in an extremely vulnerable and dangerous situation.

I also wish to respond to the allegation levelled by honMavai senathirajah that the aerial strikes and navalbombardment on the 25th April of the Sampoor area, whichis under the control of the LTTE and its Sea Tigers, was adeliberate attack on residential areas in retaliation to thesuicide bomb attack on the Army Commander.

On the contrary, the Head of the Sri Lanka MonitoringMission the (SLMM) at a meeting with Dr. Palitha Kohona,the Secretary -General of the Peace Secretariat (the SCOPP)on 28th April, 2006 had said that the Sri Lanka Air Forceand the Navy had definitely targeted military positionsand offices of the LTTE and that the security forces hadnot launched attacks deliberately and entirely directed atcivilians settlements. We reiterate that the limitedoperations by the security forcs was in response to asustained campaingn of LTTE terror attacks and specificattacks against the Sri Lankan Navy in the Trincomaleearea and was designed to deter further attacks. It was carriedout as a deterrent to neutralize the threat posed by the LTTEto the harbour and key naval installations in Trincomalee.

What is of deep concern to the Government and allpeace-loving people is the attempt by the LTTE to provokeand ethnic backlash by attacking Sinhala civilians. Thecycle bomb in the Trincomalle market, which claimed thelives of Sinhales as well as Tamils, was exploded in thevicinity of the vegetable stalls where the vendors are mainlySinhalese. Likewise, the attack on six Sinhala farmers at

2006 10129130

Gomarankadawala when they were working in their paddyfields was another act aimed at provoking maximum outrage.It is indeed to the credit of the security forces that the mobviolence that followed both these incidents were quicklybrought under control and not allowed to spread to the otherareas.

Despite these outrageous acts of terror by the LTTE, theGovernment condemns all forms of reprisal attacks againstinnocent civilians. His Excellency the President in hisaddress to the nation on 25th April, 2006, following thesuicide attack on the Army Commander Lieutenant GeneralSarthat Fonseka, specifically expressed awareness of thekillings of several Tamil civilians and deep concern overthe killing of Mr. Vigeswaran in Trincomalee. HisExcellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his addresssaid that he had ordered the arrest of those responsible andinstructed the police to se that the perpetrators were broughtto justice.

I have been personally instructed by His Excellency thePresident to inform Parliament that the Governmentvehemently condemns the recent spate of killings ofcivilians in Jaffna, Vavuniya and Avissawella and will takeall necessary action to punish the perpetrators. This includesthe killing of the five students in Trincomalle where theinvestigations are in progress. The Government considersas a curse the culture of impunity that this country has beenwitnessing at various dark periods since the 70s. As ademocracy and a mature society, we will not tolerate thisany longer. We urge the police and the security forces toperform their duty to the country by maintaining law andorder and in protecting the territorial integrity andsovereignty of the country. This is what the citizens of thecountry expect from them.

Meanwhile, the Government is taking all measuresnecessary to create the conditions for the recommencementof the Geneva Talks. Here we urge the LTTE to immediatelycease all attacks on the security forces as well as the civiliansand to respond positively to the flexibility demonstratedby the Government in providing transportation facilities tothe LTTE to enable it to have its internal consultations.

The flexibility shown by the Government deserves tobe placed on record. The initial request for Governmenthelicopters made by the LTTE on 20th March 2006 was totransport six persons from Batticaloa to Kilinochchi andsix persons from Trincomalee to Kilinochchi and bring backan equal number as replacements. The government policyon theatre-to-theatre transport of LTTE leaders after theassassination of the late Mr. Lakshman Kadiragamar wasmade clear to the SLMM. In that, the Government said thatit will provide helicopter transport for senior LTTE leadersto travel to the Airport for peace process related overseastravel, but no theatre-to-theatre transfer of leaders will beaccommodated. However, the Government provided severalalternatives, such as escorted surface transport, a navy ferryand the option of a civilian ferry.

On 15th April 2006, when the civilian ferry was madeavailable for the transport of Eastern Leaders, the LTTErequested that 16 leaders be transferred from Batticaloa toMullaitivu and 16 leaders from Trincomalee to Mullaitivuand bring back an equal number as replacements. The LTTEunilaterally aborted the sea movement, citing flimsy excusesthat SLN craft were escorting the civilian ferry. The SLLMwritten procedures clearly stipulated the presence of SriLanka Navy craft to follow the movement.

Hon Speaker, when the Government facilitated the useof a civilian helicopter, the LTTE insisted on a helicopterwith a capacity to carry 10 passengers as they had to transfer10 leaders from Batticaloa to Kilinochchi and 10 leadersfrom Trincomalee to Kilincochchi.

Though is was noticed that the so - called CentralCommittee appeared to be an evolving and fluid notion,the Government continued to oblige with the LTTEs requestin order to ensure that the talks in Geneva can take placeas scheduled.

When the Government made facilities for the RoyalNorwegian Government to engage a civilian floatplane withthe capacity to carry the required passengers, the LTTEresponded with a list of preferred water-body locations toland the floatplane. The Government acceded to this requestand made all arrangements with the Civil Aviation Authorityand the Aviation Operator in consultation with the Sri LankaAir Force to prepare a safe flight path.

In terms of the Civil Aviation Regulations and safetyconditions, the Aviation Operator is required to conductwater depth-checks and on-site inspection of the water-bodylanding zones prior to authorization of the flight plan bythe Civil Aviation Authority. On Saturday, 6th May, 2006ther inspection team from Sri Lankan Airlines together withSLMM were scheduled to visit the water-body locationsfor an on-site inspection and to conduct depth-checks.Discussions are continuing. We hope that at least on thisoccasion, the LTTE will act responsibly and agree to usethis mode of transport.

The Government is hopeful that the LTTE will desist frompresenting excuses to delay the proposed air movement afterall logistical arrangements have been completed and asrequired proceed with the air movement and follow throughwith its participation in Geneva.

We urge the TNA Parliamentarians who are here torepresent the interests of the Tamil people to exert whateverinfluence it has on the LTTE to bring it to the negotiatingtable. This is what the Tamil people want. This is what allpeace-loving people of this country want.

Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake )Sir, the Private Medical Institutions (Registration) Bill waspresented to Parliament and some amendments to it weregiven to us yesterday. The general procedure that has beenadopted in this Parliament is that-especially during the period2001 and 2004 when there were a lot of animosity andproblems created, - all these amendments to be brought beforethe Consultative Committee forum This has not been done.Besides that there are amendments that have been brought inby the Hon. Minister for which he has full powers and that wedo not deny. But, on the same score, I wish to know whetherthis has got the approval of the Attorney-General because

there had been two completely different views expressed.While the Attorney-General at one point had said that thiswas in accordance with the law, the supreme Court had saidthat it was not and now there are amendments that have beenbrought in. So, first of all, the entire Bill and its amendmentshave not been brought before the Consultative Committee.We want to ensure that that practice is maintained becausethere seems to be a general trend of moving away from allStanding Orders. I can remember when we brought in a veryimportant Bill like the Consumer Affairs Authority Bill, cetaininimical clauses were there and we wanted to remove them,but that was stopped by the Opposition and the Hon. NimalSiripala de Silva was one of them at that time. so, all I want totell you is, please ensure that the principles and the StandingOrders, and the deviations of the standing Orders that havebeen adopted to-date also, be maintained in the same way.

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake ). . . Andalso Sir, the main thing is that there is a vast difference betweenwhat was presented then and today. You connot say that itwas brought four years ago and request us to approve thesame thing. It is out of context as of today. We have no problem.I fit can be done tomorrow, then it is a different thing. But wecannot allow things to come into this house surreptitiously.
