: + :PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF SRI LANKAACT : RESOLUTION

. . . ( )( - , )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Railways andTransport and Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum ResourcesDevelopment)

Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Prime Minister, Ministerof Internal Administration and Deputy Minister ofDefence, I move,

That this Parliament hereby resolves that in terms of subsection(3) of Section 1 of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri LankaAct, No. 35 of 2002, the Schedule to that Act is hereby amended asfollows as such amendment is considered necessary and expedientin the public interest :-

1. in item 1 of that schedule, by the omission of the wordand immediately after the words Electricity industry

2. In item 2 of that Schedule, by the substitution for the wordindustry of the word industry and and,

3. by the addition, immediately after item 2 of that Scheduleof the following item :3. Petroleum industry

Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the government, I wouldlike to open this Debate on the inclusion of the petroleuminsustry in the Schedule of the Public UtilitiesCommission of Sri Lanka, commonly known as PUCSL,Act No. 35 of 2002. Let us first trace back the history ofthe petroleum industry, its legislation in this country andsee why we thought it necessary to have this inclusion inthe PUCSL Act.

The petroleum industry comprises of upstream anddownstream activities. Upstream activities include theexploration and recovery of petroleum resources, whiledownstream activities include the importation,exportation, refining, blending, storing, distributing,transporting, wholesaling and retailing of petroleumproducts.

For over three decades since its inception in 1961, thestate - owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation wasresponsible for almost all the activities in the petroleumindustry. Since then the industry has undergone significantstructural changes. As a result, at present there are a numberof private partifipants operating in different marketswithin the petroleum industry.

2006 05877878

In 1994, Caltex Trading and Transport Corporation ofDubai entered the lubricants market by acquiring amajority of shares in Lanka Lubricants Limited. Thereafter,six other parties entered the lubricants market in 1998and 1999.

In 1995, Shell Overseas Investments BV of theNetherlands shell - entered the Liquified Pertoleum Gasmarket by acquiring a 51 per cent stake in the ColomboGas Company Limited. With the expiry of the five - yearexclusive period granted to shell in 2000, two otherparties entered the LPG market, but one party has sinceceased its operations. The Government has adopted apricing formula to adjust domestic LPG prices in line withinternational market prices.

In 2002, John Keels Holdings Limited entered thebunkering market by acquiring 90 per cent of shares ofLanka Marine Services private Limited. The offshoreunloading facilities at the Dolphin Berth with thebunkering south jetty as well as related pipelines at theColombo Port were hived off to form a Common UserFacility operated by CPC. Thereafter, six other partiesentered the bunkering market.

Mr. Speaker, in 2003, Lanka Indian Oil Company enteredthe petroleum fuel market as the second player by acquiring100 retail stations of CPC and one third of shares in CeylonPetroleum Storage Terminal Limited. It also secured a 35 -year exclusive lease for the China Bay import terminal andstorage facility in Trincomalee. The Government haswarranted that market participation will be restricted to threeplayers for a five-year exclusive period until end 2008, duringwhich the retail pricing will be determind as per an agreedformula.

Let us see what has happened with regard to the differentlegislation in the petroleum industry.

The upstream petroleum industry, that is exploration andrecovery of petroleum resources, is governed by the PetroleumResources Act, No. 26 of 2003. The Petroleum ResourcesDevelopment Committee has been tasked with implementingthe provisions of this Act.

The downstream petroleum industry is primarily governedby the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act, No. 33of 2002 and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28of 1961. The regulation of the downstream petroleum industrycame under the purview of the Minister in charge of petroleumindustry based on the recommendations of the Energy SupplyCommittee established under the Energy Supply (TemporaryProvisions) Act, No. 2 of 2002. The term of this EnergySupply Committee lapsed in 2004. As a result, the activitiesof parties carrying on business in the downstream petroleumindustry and their contractual undertakings are not regulatedat present.

In the absence of a regulator there is no effective mechanismfor protecting the interests of the consumers when it comes toregulating prices and the formulation of quality, safety,operational, environmental and emergency standards.Adulteration of petroleum products and tampering of metersin the dispensing units are common complaints made by theconsumers. These complaints presently go on unheeded dueto the lacuna in legislation. This is only one of the manyissues arising out of the absence of a proper regulatoryframework in the petroleum industry.

This problem was clearly understood by my governmentboth during my time as the Minister of Petroleum andPetroleum Resources Development as well as during mypredecessors, Hon. Susil Premajayanthas, time in theMinistry. We have already initiated action on a new legaland regulatory framework for the industry. This is to beestablished by the proposed amendments to the PetroleumProducts (Special Provisions) Act, No. 33 of 2002 which myGovernment has already initiated and is almost in the finalform. Let us now see what PUCSL is all about and how itcomes in to the picture.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL)was established by Act, No. 35 of 2002 as a multi-sectorregulator for the regulation of all physical infrastructureindustries commencing with electricity and water servicesindustries. Telecommunication industry was excluded fromthis since that already had a regulator established. Thisexercise of setting up of a regulator for the infrastructuresectors, particularly for the electricity industry had started asfar back as 1998 and had gone through many a discussionand review. Finally it realised in 2002 and it became operativein 2003 and in 2004.

The PUCSL Act is a unique piece of legislation coveringall aspects of infrastructure regulation in line withinternational best practices. Some of the main objectives ofthe PUCSL include protecting the interests of consumers,promoting efficiency of operations, promoting safely andservice quality in industries it regulates. Therefore, thePUCSL is expected to ensure smooth operation with the sectorlooking after both the consumer as well as the investor. Thisis essential for rapid infrastructure development withoutwhich we cannot even imagine achieving our economicgrowth targets.

The PUCSL Act, No. 35 of 2002 follows a modular designwhere the regulation of industries that come under its purvieware identified in its Schedule, administered through a seriesof separate industry states. At present, the electricity and waterservices industries are included in the Schedule, though theyare not yet regulated by the PUCSL due to the absence ofrelevant industry states. Any other infrastructure sector needsto be added by a Parliament resolution as per Section 1 (3) ofthe PUCSL Act, No. 35 of 2002.

Being a multi-sector regulator indentified and establishedfor the purpose of infrastructure regulation, we have decidedto entrust the regulation of the downstream petroleumindustry too, to the PUCSL. In order for the PUCSL to regulate

879880

[ . . . ]the downstream petroleum industry as proposed, it isnecessary to include petroleum in the Schedule of regulatedindustries in the PUCSL Act, No. 35 of 2002. Mr. Speaker,this is why we are moving this Resolution today. Further, thePUCSL will be fully empowered to regulate these sectorsonce the industry statutes come into place. As I indicatedbefore, my Ministry has been working on the PetroleumLegislation which is already in an advanced stage. As Iunderstand my Colleague Hon. John Senevirathnes Ministryhas already finalized the Electricity Industry Legislation.

At this stage I must mention that in March 2003, the Oiland Gas Regulatory Authority was established in Pakistan toregulate the midstream and downstream petroleum industry,with the aim of protecting public interest, fosteringcompetition as well as increasing investment. Similarly, inMarch 2006, the Indian Parliament, including the Oppositionpassed the Petroleum Natural Gas Regulatory Bill of 2005 toset up a regulator for the downstream petroleum and naturalgas activities, aimed at protecting the interests of consumers,seeking to boost investments and creating competitivemarkets.

Therefore, it is time that we expedite establishing thisregulatory framework for the Petroleum industry, particularlyto protect the interest of the consumers and to create a levelplaying-field for all the investors. This will increaseconfidence within the industry eventually leading rapidexpansion of this sector which is an essential component ofthe rapid economic development of this country.

Thank you, Sir.

( )( - )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of PlanImplementation)Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Today, we discuss theResolution under the Public Utilities Commission of SriLanka Act, No. 35 of 2002. First, I must congratulate the Hon.Minister, Mr. Fowzie, for having brought in a very importantsector of public utilities, namely the petroleum industry,within the ambit of the Public Utilities Commission.

As we are all aware, the Public Utilities Commission wasestablished by Act, No. 35 of 2002. While having performedits functions now it has a wider role to play. The Act has awide scope. Now bringing in the petroleum industry alsounder this will give it additional muscle and power to lookinto matters relating to the consumer very specifically.

This Act which has been there for the benefit of theconsumers has wide ranging powers and functions. As we cansee, one of its tasks is to ensure that it will be a benchmark toensure international standards of the services rendered bythe industries that are mentioned in the Schedule to the Act.

Internationalization is here to stay, whatever anybodymight say. It is for the good of the consumer. We also see thatthis Act empowers the Commission to regulate tariffs.Regulating tariffs does not mean only looking after theconsumer. While we also look at the consumers side of it, itis also mandated by the Act that the Commission will ensurethat no undue financial impediments are placed in the way ofpublic utilities when performing functions and givingservices to the consumer at large. We have noticed in certaininstances that anti-competitive practices, monopolysituations, and mergers are taking place in the trade sector.Because of these mergers and monopolistic instances theconsumer suffers. The Commission is empowered to lookinto these aspects also either on its own or on a complaintreceived. The Commission should look into these matters onits own rather than waiting for any complaints to come fromthe general public.

[ ]The hon. Member, who spoke before me spoke about thetelecommunications industry. He spoke about the VOIP-VoiceOver Internet Protocol. That has been very lucrative. Myattention was drawn to The Sunday Leader of last Sundaywhere the illegal practice of VOIP is utilized and a dailyincome of Rs. 1 million to Rs. 2 million per line has beenearned by the operators of this illegal practice. But,whose names were mentioned? I am referring to TheSunday Leader. The Minister who was in charge oftelecommunications during the UNP era and the Chairmanin charge of Sri Lanka Telecom are the people who had giventhe VOIP facility which is also known as E-1 during thatinfamous era of 2002 to 2004. This is related to the VAT scamthat is being talked about today.

Yesterday, one of the Members questioned as to what hadbeen done about the VAT scam and why has been going onfor two years? I would like to remind them, again looking atThe Sunday Leader which is their very own news paperthat this scam had taken place during the period 2002 to2004. Rupees three hundred and fifty seven million of publicmoney which could have been used to develop public utilitieshave been fraudulently taken away from the people of SriLanka during the period 2002 to 2004. This is somethingthat happened during that period and today some Membershave the audacity to ask us as to why we did not take actionduring that period. I must thank the hon. Members who raisedthis issue about the VAT scam because there seems to be somesort of indirect indictment on the government at that time. Iam not surprised, taking into consideration the problems thatare faced by the Opposition, we find that they may be tellingus to take strong action not only against the people, thebusinessmen and the government officials, but also the highpoliticians who kept quiet during that time when this scamwas being manipulated and the people of Sri Lanka werebeing deprived of the services that could have been providedby that money. The scam is not only Rs. 357 million. We findthat it is now going even further and His Excellency thePresident has already instructed the officials, the police andthe CID to inquire into this and bring to book even the highestpeople involved in this scam.

The people of Sri Lanka gave a mandate to this Governmenttwo years ago, reinforced it in November by electing HisExcellency the President and now on the 30th of March havegiven an overwhelming mandate to the Government to carryon its policies and to carry on the Mahinda Chintana forthe benefit of the people. This again takes me back to anarticle in the Daily Mirror newspaper wherein certain peoplehave stated that the UNP will take over the government after30th March. Another former Minister has said that within sixmonths the UNP will take over the government and that theywere only waiting for the results of the local governmentelections. The people have rendered their verdict. A formerMinister was quoted as saying that they will control 75 percent of the local councils. Seventy five per cent of the localcouncils remains a dream! But the governing party has got

over 90 per cent of the local councils as at date. I am happy tosay that some Members have made constructive criticism,which is always welcome. We, in the Government alwayswelcome constructive criticism. If there are any matters thatare raised and if they are raised on the Floor of the House oreven outside, our Ministers are ever-willing to give a fairhearing and ensure that we all get together and work for thebenefit of our people. But, unfortunately some speakers havetried to pick holes in various ways. To them also, I would say,let us get together to rebuild a new Sri Lanka.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have one other matter which alsocomes under the mandate of the Public Utilities Commission.That is to regulate tariffs, but not to add financial burden onthe utility. As I mentioned, in certain instances, there is waste,there is corruption. If we look at the overall electricityindustry, illicit tapping of electricity has reached greatproportions. Therefore, I would request the Hon. Minister ofPower and Energy to strengthen the hands of the officials inthe Enforcement Division so that they could perform theirduty by trying to stop illicit tapping of eletricity. We, on ourpart will assure the officials of the utmost co-operation of theGovernment by not interfering in any way in their activitiesof detecting illicit tappers. Over the last few days we haveread in the newspapers the amount of fines and penalties thathave been imposed on illicit tappers by the EnforcementDivision of the Ceylon Electricity Board.

While thanking you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me anopportunity to speak a few words on this subject, I commendthe amendments to the Schedule of the Public UtilitiesCommission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 35 of 2002 to the House.Thank you very much.

. ( )(Mr. T. Kanagasabai)Thank you, Sir.

This is an opportunity that you get once in a way. -[Interruption.] Thank you, Sir. Sir, the CTB in the BatticaloaDistrict has been very badly neglected. From Valaichenai toKalawanchikudi, you must do something to upgrade it. Giveus more buses.

His Excellency the President says ; that we must have aunitary Government, that we must all be together, that everyone must enjoy their rights and all that but we cannot achieveall that under a unitary system of Government. We are definitethat we cannot get our due independence and due rightsunless we have a Federal System.

But anyway it is my duty to come and tell you what mypeople are tell me although we have an agenda for our party.However it is my bounden duty to tell you that the CTB mustbe looked after, that it must be upgraded and that you mustprovide buses.

There is no point in saying that we are all together, that weall have the same rights and that this country belongs to theMuslims, Tamils, Sinhalese and Burghers. Just speaking willnot help. Hon. Minister, you are also from a minoritycommunity. We know that you did an excellent job whenyou were the Minister in charge of health services and theCTB for which we are very grateful to you.

It is said that the tsunami affected areas will be providedwith buses but we have not got many buses. We have gotonly one bus. For the tsunami affected areas there are somany things that are coming from abroad as aid, but we arenot getting a sufficient share of those things. You Mycolleague says that certain depots have received assistance.Therefore Sir, our humble request is, please look into theCTB services in the Batticaloa District. That is the first request.

The second request is regarding the railway services. Sir, Ionce went to the USA and I visited a museum. There theyasked me whether I liked to see train which is a hundred yearsold. We had to buy a ticket to see that. So I managed to buy aticket to see it. It is not second to what we have in Batticaloanow with all deteriorated compartments. We like to travel bytrain but it is not running to schedule. There are not sufficientcompartments.

Sir, make a surprise visit there as you did earlier. Come toBatticaloa and see what if happening at the railway station,at the CTB depot and elsewhere. + + Sir ++ [] +,+ + , + + !+ +

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunityto conclude the debate with special remarks on currentprogrammes being implemented in the petroleum industryduring the last few months since I took over. I thank allthe Members who participated in the deliberation andpresented their views and observations. I have made anote of all what they have said.

Mr. Speaker, this is not an amendment to the PublicUtilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No.35 of 2002. Itis just an inclusion to the Schedule of the Act. AlreadyElectricity industry and Water service industry areincluded and any other industry can be included by aResolution in Parliament. Petroleum industry is one ofthem. The definition of petroleum industry is containedin the Industry Act. Petroleum industry includes allpetroleum products including gas. So it includes gas alsowhen you say petroleum. There is no serious matter to bediscussed in this.

Now we are speaking of the downstream, not theupstream. Upstream is the one that is involved withexploration. Downstream is the petroleum industry. Whenwe come to petroleum exploration, already, there is anAct. There will be an amendment to that Act. That is thetime at which the Members of the Opposition and the JVPcan make their representations. Do not worry, there isnothing controversial involved. . . . . . , contract . 12.00 . . . . contract . contract . , . . . . . downstream . downstream Petroleum industry . consumers , _adulteration , . regulate , . , . , , . , .

As you know the petroleum industry comprises ofupstream and downstream activities.

Expeditious implementation of the upstream activitiesis of crucial importance to achieve the economicdevelopment of the country. Seismic surveys carried outso far have revealed that the potential for petroleumresources in the territorial waters of the country issignificant specially in the Mannar basin.

My Ministry has altready taken measures to set up thePetroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS)which is the implementing arm of the upstream activities.We are awaiting the Cabinet approval for the appointmentof a Director-General to the PRDS. For the post of Director-General we had to call for applications internationallythe 53 applications received were short-listed to 13. Ofthe 13, three applications were from expatriates. But wethought it was better to give it to our own people who arequalified. We have selected a person and he will beappointed very soon. We intend to call for internationalbids in early July this year. Mr. Shivajilingam said wemust make use of our people here. But we cannot do this.We have to call for international bids. If you call forinternational bids only you get a very big rvenue a verybig income. There must be competition. You cannot justgive it over the counter to somebody. I should mentionthat greater transparency is assured in the whole process.There will not be any sort of hide and seek or foul play in

931932

[ . . . ]this. There will be transparency. We are in the process ofstudying profit sharing agreements of the leading oilcompanies in the world in order to get the maximumbenefit to the country.

We have a high concern for the legal and environmentalimplications of the upstream oil exploration activities.

Now let me briefly explain the progress of downstreamactivities. The refinery is the most important sector in thepetroleum industry. But at the moment our refinery is notable to meet the demands of the country. Therefore, we havealready initiated action for the expansion of the Refinery atSapugskanda. A concept paper has already been preparedand feasibility studies will be implemented soon. With thisexpansion, we will be able to meet the full demand of thecountry assuring quality and more satisfied services to thecustomers. The most important factor associated with thisproject is that the major share of the cost will be borne by thethe CPC. We are trying to invest the entire capital withoutgiving it to any foreign country. We either have to borrowmoney or make use of our Petroleum Corporation funds to dothis. This will cost about US Dollars 400 million to 500millon. It is a large amount of moeny. But if we can get thisthrough, we can save a lot of money. We can sell our productsat a cheaper price. That is my intention.

Concurrently, we have been continuing with themodification of petrol stations in order to provide moreefficient and satisfied services to our customers. While CPCundertakes some of the modifications, dealer-owned petrolstations are also given assistance by the Corporation.Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have spent a lot of money onimplementing a refurbishment programme for CPC ownedfilling stations islandwide to international standards. Thelatest technology, degital pumps and digital air meters arebeing installed. Proper calibration of pumps are being ensuredfor customer benefit reliability. Fully automation of fillingstations in Sri Lanka was pioneered by the CPC, the first atTissamaharama and the second at Balangoda. An islandwideprogramme has commenced.

Dealer-owned stations are also being developed withinterest free loans provided by the CPC to dealers. The badlymaintained ones are the ones that have been owned by theTreasury. But we are trying our best to keep those under us.We have already prepared a Cabinet Paper to own the thirdplayer also without selling it. This is now before the AttorneyGenerals Department. Very soon we will know what the legalimplications are.

Now, let me briefly say about the CPSTL, which wasestablished in 2003 as a private limited liability company.As you may know, it was established despite the protest ofmajority employees of the CPC. However, I will assure that

there will be no more privatization. The hon. Joseph MichaelPerera wanted to know whether this is part of a privatizationprocess or not. This is not part of a privatization process. Weare trying to make use of the piece of legislation that is thereto include the petroleum sector so that the consumer will besafeguarded. I assure you that there will be no moreprivatization in the CPC.

In addition, we have taken steps to enhance thetransportation of fuel by train. Our target is to increase thisup to 75%. We are planning to purchase new engines andother spare parts to facilitate the process.

In view os the security situation we have taken severalprogressive steps to ensure security to the refinery andpetroleum terminals. For example the acqusition of Nylon-6plant land. After closing down of the operation of Nylon-6,that land became a serious threat to the adjoining refinery atSapugaskanda. The adjoining land which belongs to the shellGas Company at Orugodawatta Tank farm will also beacquired in view of security reasons.

Above all, I would like to say about the recent measuresthat we have taken to streamline the importation of lubricants.In this connection, I am proud to say that during the last fewmonths since I took over, we have been able to raiseGovernment revenue by way of imposing a licence registrationfee for importation of lubricants. Now, we have obtained theCabinet approval to liberalize the lubricant market to createa level playing-field for the potential importers. My Ministryis in the process of formulating a policy considering all aspectsof this industry. In this context, the inclusion of the petroleumsector in the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act,No. 35 of 2002 will be more beneficial to the consumers aswell as to the business community involved in this industry.

At this moment I would like to thank the Secretary to myMinistry Mr. A. P. A. Gunasekara and his team and also Mr.Jaliya Medagama, Chairman, CPC and his team for theirfullest co-oporation in achieving these objectives.

Finally, let me also thank my Colleagues and hon. Membersof Parliament in the Opposition for their valuablecontributions made in this Debate. I hope they will not requestme to refer this to a Committee because it is very importantthat we pass it today. And it has no serious implications asmentioned by the hon. Members of the Opposition.

Thank you, Sir.
