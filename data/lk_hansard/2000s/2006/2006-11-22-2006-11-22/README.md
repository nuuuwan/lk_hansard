ExtractonFlooding Situation &Proposed Remedial Measures to be takeninJa- Ela & Suburbs

Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development CorporationNo. 03, Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha, WelikadaRajagiriyaE-mail : Sltrdcrd@sltnet.LkNovember 2006

Flooding in Ja-Ela & Kalu Oya Basins

It has been noticed that the surrounding areas of Ja-Ela & Ragamaare gettiong flooded frequently during the rainy season.

Causes for the recent floods and increase in frequency of occurrencehave been idenfified as the improper operation and maintenae of theexisting canal systems, adhoc filling of low lying lands, encroachmentsof canal banks, illegal construction across the canals, unplananneddevelopment without paying proper attention to the drainage inadequacyof drainage crossings across CKE during construction.

This situation has been noticed since few years back and small -scalestudies were carried out in this regard. In addition, these areas were alsoconsiderd in preparation of storm water dranage plan for the ColomboMetropolitan region under JICA study in collaboration with SLLRDCin 2003. Preliminary studies have already been done anda storm waterdrainage plan was proposed accordingly. This plan consists of thefollowing compoents

* Structural measures* Non strutural measures* Institutional development plan* Operation and maintenance plan and* Human resources development plan

The Structural measures proposed under Ja-Ela basin storm waterdrainage plan are,

*Improvements to Ja-Ela Channel -Widening, dredging andfortifying the embankments (Length 7Km width 60m)

*Improvements to Dandugam Oya-widening, dredging andfortifying the embankments (length 9.9 km width 70-80 m)

*Identify and keep storm water drainage retention areas infact(lower area 500ha, upper area 376 ha)

The structural measures proposed under Kalu Oya basin storm waterdrainage plan are;

*Improvements to Kalu Oya Channel -widening, dredging andfortifying the embankments (Length 5 Km width 25-50 m)

*Improvements to Old Negombo Canal - widening, dredging andfortifying the embankments (Length 4.5Km width 40m)

*Identify and keep storm water drainage retention areas infact(Lower area 360 ha, upper area 89 ha)

The storm water drainage master plans for Ja-Ela and Kalu Oyabasins proposed under preliminary studies are attached hereto for yourreference. (detail designs and implementation of these projects aredelayed due to non availability of funds)

Meanwhile stome water retention area management with legaldesignation of storm water retention areas, regulation of land use instorm water retention areas and strict legal actions for illegal activities isthe most important non structural measure to be worked out in bothwater sheds. Development controlling in urban areas and Land useregulation in lowland areas are the other non structural measures to belooked into.

In addition to the above, Demarcation of responsibilities among thestakeholders for the management of the storm water drainage systems(Irriggation Department, SLLRDC, RDA, UDA, CEA & LocalAuthorities) and taking necessary actions in time is essential.

Under the same study. no environment issues which could hamperthe implementation of the proposed storm water drainage projects areexpected Also, it has been identified that the above proposed schemesfor Ja-Ela &Kalu Oya Basins are economically, technically,environmentally and socially viable for the planning scale of 50 yearturn period.

The relevant water level measurements and discharge measurementsat idenfified locations of Ja-Ela and Kalu Oya basins have been carriedout by SLLRDC to make the detailed study and designs moreconservative.

2006 22895896

Based on the above master plan study and small-scale detailed studiesdone within this area, we higly expect that this flooding problem can beminimizsed after introducing the above mentioned improvements tothe existing drainage system. Not only that but also it is very importantto maintain the canal system as well as keep the required retention areasintact.

At this moment, we (SLLRDC) are doing our best in our maximumcapacity to stop illegal filling of this marshy areas which can aggravatethis flooding problem. Now it is time to get all the agencies and local

autorities together to stop illegal filling of low-lying areas encroachmentof waterways, unauthorized construction etc.

Once we receive the required funds for the detailed study and theimplementation of the above improvements, we will be able to get ridof this flooding problem.

For the time being as a short term solution, desilting and dredging ofJa-Ela and Dandugam Oya can be carried out with the availability offunds, 115 million and192 million rupees respectively.

( )( - )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike - Minister of Tourism).Hon. Speaker, this is the thirtieth successive BudgetDebate that I am participating in this House and I am notbeing immodest, I think this is a record for any Member ofthe Government to have spoken without a break on a BudgetDebate for a period of 30 years.

From 1977 - you were a Member of Parliament, Hon.Speaker - to 1989, 12 long years of anguish but interestingand challenging, I defended the Sri Lanka Freedom Partyvirtually single-handed. Later on with the assistance of mygood Friend, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena who came intothis House in 1983 and a bare handful of Members ofParliament, we were able to take on the might of the UnitedNational Party and its 145 Members of which you were one.Those were the days when we were heckled, we weretraumatized and even the man who was sitting behind mewas shouting at me. I am glad those days are over. A lotof people forget the difficult times we had in Parliament atthat time and what we went through.

( )( [ - , )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara Minister of Constitutional Affairsand National Integration)I also joined.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)

Yes, yes. That is right. The Hon. Dew Gunasekeraalso joined us at one stage or the other. And those years,Mr. Speaker, I remember we fought with giants of the UNPlike President J.R. Jayewardene, President R. Premadasa, Mr.Gamini Dissanayake, Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali, Dr.Anandatissa De Alwis, Mr. Ranjan Wijeratne, Mr. Ronniede Mel and Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne. It is sad to say, Mr.Speaker, that the United National Party today has not got asingle speaker who can measure up to even their little toein comparison to those giants who adorned the seats ofGovernment from 1977. Whatever mistakes they may havemade, they were the cream of the United National Party.Unfortunately, they were the victims of this ongoing terroristwar that has taken the lives of so many valuable peoplein this country from both sides of the House.

Now, Sir, I remember the first Budget of Mr. Ronnie deMel. In 1977, he came to this House with his polishedoak box, grinning like a Cheshire cat, charging like an enragedrhinoceros and burping like an outsized elephant, he landedhis box. With all the lights on in the Old House of Parliamentglaring down on the Chamber, he made a performance of alifetime. So much so, that he mentioned my mothers name46 times in the Budget. It was a Budget not on the UNP,but on Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. To the laughter of the145 elephants and the full glare of TV publicity, Ronnie deMel had a field day. It was abuse, more abuse, vulgar abusetormenting her, fully encouraged by the Leader of the UNP,President J.R. Jayewardene and Prime Minister R. Premadasa.Compare that delivery with the delivery we had five daysago from President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He came in simplywith a file. There was no vituperation, there were no attacks,there was no abuse, there were no political points scoredoff the Opposition. He delivered what he had to say. Youmay agree with him, you may not agree with him but hedelivered what he had to say and walked out quite simplyand that, Mr. Speaker, in comparison to what Mr. Ronnie deMel did 30 years ago is vastly different. Mr. Ronnie deMel was performing like performing in a circus to the lightsand the clowns of Parliament that day. I commend HisExcellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa on his SecondBudget. I do not do so as a Member of the Sri Lanka FreedomParty; I do not do so as a Member of his Cabinet; I do notdo so because I have known him personally for 37 years;but, I must say, Sir, that this Budget was presented underthe most difficult circumstances. There are very validcriticisms from the UNP which we must listen to. But, apartfrom that we must understand one simple fact that this is aBudget that was presented under very serious circumstances.

We are in the throes of a major civil war. When wewalk into this House, we are checked. When we drive intoParliament, at the entrance our vehicles are checked. Weare searched. I am not saying that it is bad. It is very good.There are Air Force guns pointing to the sky. Why are theypointing to the sky? Because you think that the LTTE willattack you by air. There are naval boats going around theDiyawanna Oya. Why is that? Because you are scared thatthe LTTE navy will attack you. You have very wisely, as Idid from that Chair, banned the Hon. Members from bringingcellular phones into this House. I commend you, Mr. Speaker,for that. We are living in a state of fear, in a sieged mentality.This House itself is living in a sieged mentality. When wecome to this House we keep switching cars, we keepswitching roads. But, in this country, as you know thereare only a few roads that lead to Parliament. Why is thissieged mentality there? Because there is a dangerousongoing civil war in this country and in the circumstancesof this war that His Excellency the President MahindaRajapaksa presented his Budget. Sir, we must keep that veryfirmly in mind when we criticize this Budget and I fullyappreciate the criticisms that came from my Friends in theUNP, particularly the most articulate man on the Budget, Hon.Bandula Gunawardane, who was with the SLFP at one time

2006 22911912

and now has unfortunately gone to the other side. I hopehe does come and join his former leader again-[Interruption.] I referred to Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena-[Interruption.] Yes, yes.

Sir, look at the cost of the war. I do not want to go intovarious aspects of the cost of the war. The cost in terms oflife, the cost in terms of anguish, of despair, the cost in termsof money in buying arms, the cost in terms of sheer mentalanguish. The destruction of the Sinhala, Tamil and the Muslimpeople of this country is something that we are living with,which we must accept, which we cannot run away from. Sir,the Second Budget of His Excellency the President MahindaRajapaksa was brought not only in that context but also inthe context of a series of natural disasters. The tsunami oftwo years ago followed by a major flood as Hon. JayalathJayawardana just mentioned, which has not only affectedhim but affected all of us in the Gampaha District and allcitizens of Sri Lanka, all the landslides in the Nuwara EliyaDistrict, Kandy, Kalutara and other areas. In this context,Sir, I think, His Excellency the President Rajapaksas Budgetwas indeed a Budget presented under very difficultcircumstances and therefore the Budget is to be commended.

Sir, I wish to say that a lot of people expected a sort ofa Christmassy like Budget, full of goodies, full of bonhomie,a Santa Claus carrying a bag full of goodies, twiddling hisbeard. But, no, Sir. We cannot do that. We would haveloved to have done that. But, we cannot do that. Thiscountry is not in any financial state to deliver any of thegoodies that were promised at the last election or most ofit.

I, Sir, now wish to refer to some of the positive aspectsof the Budget. I have criticized 28 budgets. It is very difficultfor me to praise a budget. I have spent all my life attackingit.

Taking this Budget, Sir, the most positive aspect as I seeit is that the Budget of 2007 is perceived as an integral partof the Ten Year Horizon Development Framework 2006 - 2016,which derives its conceptual strength from the MahindaChintana, the Presidents vision for Sri Lanka. The Budgetplaces a focal emphasis on infrastructure, developmentprojects, in particular, roads, power generation and ports.Greater emphasis will be placed on improving theinfrastructural facilities at the regional and provincial levelswhich is very important, Sir. Because however much weinvite investment or tourism into this country, theinfrastructure in Sri Lanka is so bad. It is so bad that reallyyou cannot get off the ground on either investment or ontourism.

We see the finest surfing beaches in Arugam Bay. Apartfrom being in a danger zone, the access road to ArugamBay is deplorable. The access road to Arugam Bay doesnot exist. So, with such inferior infrastructure, how can weever call ourselves a developing nation? You and I take

[ ]the road to the Airport very often. You would take it moreoften than I do, Mr. Speaker. We have been using that roadfor the last fifty years. Thanks to the British. Today, fiftyfive years after Independence, we are still struggling to buildan alternative route to the Airport. It is a sad commentaryon our affairs, Mr. Speaker. Not only a sad commentary onthe two major parties, it is a sad commentary on the wholesociety of Sri Lanka that we have only one road; full ofhuman beings, full of children, full of dogs, cats, cows, cattle.Every living thing four legged and two legged is on theAirport road and we call ourselves a developed nation. Lookat the airport roads in India. Look at the airport roads inBangalore, in Chennai, in Mumbai, in Delhi, in Calcutta, inNepal, in Dhaka, in Karachi, in Islamabad. You do not haveto go the Western countries. Forget the Western countries.Even the under developed SAARC countries airport roadsare far better than ours. So, the infrastructure developmentis vital, Mr. Speaker.

Therefore, Sir, the Presidents Budget will help in a moreequitable distribution of the benefits of economic growthas well as encourage development oriented activities in theregions and rural economy. The Budget targets a GDPgrowth rate of 8 per cent per year. In fact the quarterly resultsannounced so far clearly shows that the economy is wellon course towards achieving this target, despite the heavydefence expenditure - as I mentioned before - massiveoutflows on oil imports, continuing corruption and escalatingcrime rate. I will deal with them separately, Sir.

This development effort in the economy is entirely dueto the resilience of the economy and the dedicatedcontribution of our private sector. The workers in the fields,in the factories and the professionals in the private sectorand the State sector, I pay a handsome tribute to them all,for the efficiency of our countrys private sector and thepublic sector and their commitment towards sustaining themomentum of economic growth.

Mr. Speaker, the concessions given to the private sector,especially the removal of VAT on electricity, heavy fuel andfurnace oil will make our manufacturing industries globallycompetitive and efficient.

Sir, the next is the construction industry. Look at theCity of Colombo, look at the number of high-rise apartmentblocks that are coming up. Each is sold before it isconstructed. I hear the Hyatt Regency which is coming upin Colpetty in Galle Road already has sold their apartmentsfor something like Rs. 200 million or Rs. 150 million each. Iam not saying that is for the common man. But it showsthat the construction industry is booming and that is indeedsomething we should be glad about. There are lots ofincentives and concessions given in this Budget. TheGovernments intention is to encourage the constructionsector to emerge as a global player. Architects and Engineersare on the rise and we praise them today for thecontribution to the economy.

[ ]Now, Sir, having dealt with some of the major highlightsas I see them, I do not want to keep repeating the samearguments that are being placed before this House byMembers of the Government, but I wish to deal, Sir, verybriefly with the Norachcholai Project. This project broke allbarriers. No government had the foresight or the courageto go ahead with this project until the former President,Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranike Kumaratunga had theforesight and the courage to initiate it. I myself as Ministerof Industry and Investment Promotion and Minister ofTourism went to the Peoples Republic of China twice andthey gave us their fullest cooperation, their fullestencouragement and when she went on a State visit last yearas the President of this country she signed the NorachcholaiProject agreement with the Chinese Government. Now it isoff the ground. We are very glad about that, because onesingle individual who happened to be a priest was blockingthe development of one of the most crucial projects thiscountry needed. We would have had total blackouts fromthe year 2009 or periods of blackouts. Now the beginningof Norachcholai not only consolidates the relationsbetween the Peoples Republic of China and Sri Lanka,which my father began in 1956, but the overall supply ofelectricity too will increase. It will offer cheaper power as itcomes from coal. Coal generated power is cheaper Mr.Speaker. We can bring our tariff structures in electricityon par with the region making our industries globallycompetitive. These are the three major results of theNorachcolai Project once it is concluded.

Now Sir, in short the Second Budget - Sir, may I ask myFriends of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to hold theirgroup meeting in their room, if you do not mind. My goodFriend, Mr. Wimal Weerawansa is holding forth. So please,I appeal to him. Thank you. I always like to hear him speaking,but not whispering.

Now, Sir, the Second Budget of His Excellency thePresident, Mahinda Rajapaksa deals with the incentives topromote savings. These tax benefits give relief to pensioners,senior citizens, a much neglected segment of our societyon their retirement. This is something which has beenneglected by many governments. I am glad that this Budgethas dealt with that issue comprehensively. Encouragementto small and medium enterprises, giving them reduced ratesof import duty on new raw materials, machinery and accessto bank facilities on concessionary terms are very important.

Now, Sir, I wish to deal very briefly with the involvementof the private sector. The private sector in Sri Lanka, Sir,either does a summation of the Budget after the Budget isover or makes pontifications before the Budget. There isno active participation by the private sector in theformulation of a budget. It is true that the Budget isformulated by the Minister of Finance, Secretary to theMinistry of Finance and the officials of that Ministry. Butthe inputs from the private sector into the formulation of abudget are very important. Therefore, I urge the private

sector as well as the Ministry of Finance to share their viewsbefore a presentation of a budget rather than pontificate onthe good and the bad of a budget after it is done, so thatwe can incorporate their good ideas while rejecting the badones. Therefore, I think, this dialogue with the private sectormust exist before the formulation of a budget, not after thedelivery of a budget.

Now, Sir, having made that point, I wish to talk about thetax administration in this country where we increase thenumber of tax officers and make the Inland RevenueDepartment more customer friendly. This is very good. Butwe are all aware from the newspapers that there has been avery bad scandal in the Inland Revenue Department in recenttimes, a massive fraud of Rs.400 billion swindled by seniorofficers of the Inland Revenue Department in connivancewith some shady rogue businessmen. This should be fullyinvestigated as soon as possible and no cover-ups please.It would be disastrous to cover-up these horrendous actsof corruption indulged in by the officials of the InlandRevenue Department. We should take the firmest possiblesteps to freeze their bank accounts and seize their assets.Already people have lost confidence in the Inland RevenueDepartment and the taxing system. The only way that theGovernment can restore confidence is by dealing with errantand corrupt officials of the Inland Revenue Department.

I would also like to congratulate His Excellency thePresident Mahinda Rajapaksa on the concessions he hasgiven the cinema industry. Sir, my two favourite hobbiesapart from politics - it is not a hobby - are reading and seeingfilms. I spend most of my time doing either. Now, Sir, thePresident has in fact given a lot of concessions in his Budgetto the entertainment section, because in Sri Lanka, Colombois a city which has absolutely nothing to do after 6 oclockin the evening. Sri Lankans complain and the touristscomplain. The Colombo City is dead after 6 oclock in theevening. Now it is accompanied by rain, thunder andlightning. Be that as it may, the kind of entertainmentavailable in Colombo is either in a casino or in a brothelhouse. Both are thoroughly undesirable. Our people areglued to the television watching politicians arguing orwatching politicians performing before the TV or they watchteledramas. Let us rebuild the cinema industry. HisExcellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa fortunately inhis Budget is giving positive incentives in the right directionby giving concessions to the construction of new cinemas,upgrading the ones that are already there by giving taxconcessions and giving concessions to digital technology,Dolby and will be allowed duty free which is an excellentconcept.

We do not have enough cinemas in this country. Ourpeople are entertainment starved. As a result, they seek theIndian cinema. Sometimes it is good. Sometimes it ismuckish. They are all the time watching some old Hindi filmswhich Sivaji Ganesan, M.G. Ramachandran or Jayalalithashaking their fat bottoms and dancing around. The local

2006 22915916

cinema industry has gone down to the dogs. There is nolocal cinema industry at all, in fact. I am glad that theseconcessions that he has given in his Budget will resuscitatelocal film industry. And we can see better films from theUnited States of America, Europe, India and parts of Asia.It is indeed a commendable move.

Sir, let me deal with one other aspect. I think, thisconcerns all the hon. Members of this House. You are theHon. Speaker of this House and the custodian of our rights.I had the privilege of sitting on that Chair for nearly oneyear. The behaviour of certain hon. Members of this Househas been deplorable. The kind of things they say, the kindof language they use to vilify their opponents borders onvulgarism. I am not referring to anybody or any party. I amtalking about all hon. Members of Parliament. There was anunfortunate incident where a Buddhist monk was physicallyattacked on the Floor of this House and the poor monk hadto be hospitalized. The kind of language that was used, Iremember when you were presiding one day, Sir - I also loudlyprotested- that one of our Hon. Ministers used such foullanguage that the children in those galleries covered theirfaces in shame. Are we the representatives of the people?Who sent us here and who will send us out from here? Thepeople of this country. Never forget that.

Unfortunately - I do not blame my good Friend, Mr. R.Sampanthan - there were a multitude of problems,multifaceted problems which they have to face. Therefore,they launched a democratic protest in this House. I am notcondemning you for that. There were some ugly scenes.But may I say this. As you have no other platform, you doit here. I understand that. But there are other parties here,they have other platforms which you are not entitled to,unfortunately. This House must be sacrosanct. Thebehaviour of the hon. Members of Parliament must be abovequestion. My mother as Prime Minister of this country, in1977 when she made her last speech - Hon. DineshGunawardena is a witness to that - she appealed to herMembers of Parliament to behave themselves and not to putthis House to shame. This is a House which has producedgreat men like, D. S. Senanayake, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike,Dudley Senanayake, Mrs. Bandaranaike - a plethora ofleaders of this country, great men and women - SirPonnambalam Ramanathan and G. G. Ponnambalam. Also Iwould say Mr. R. Sampanthan, Parliamentarians, parexcellence. Now unfortunately, it is slightly veering awayfrom its usual eloquence, but still eloquent to an extent.This House has produced some of the greatest minds of thiscountry. Therefore, our conduct in this House must beexemplary. I know the constraints you have. You are aMember of the UNP. You have defeated our nominee forthe post of Speaker and got there by one vote. All goodluck to you. Since you have got there you have conductedthe affairs of this House with total independence. You area man whom I have always respected from either side of theHouse. Now, Sir, it is not entirely up to you. The only wayyou can ensure that the Members of Parliament conduct

themselves as the people expect them to conduct themselvesis to kindly televise live proceedings of the House and letthe country see how their Members are behaving. Now inIndia, when the Lok Sabha sits, they have a live telecast ofthe Lok Sabha proceedings. They have a live telecast of theproceedings of the House of Commons in England, theGeneral Assembly in France, the Bundestag in Germany, theHouse of Representatives or the Senate in the United Statesof America. They are all telecast live. Let the nation judgehow their representatives behave. Then, I will assure you,Mr. Speaker, you will find a much better House. Some of themwill go to beauticians. Some will have their hair dyed. Somewill have their eyebrows clipped. Some might even applylipstick because I know Sir, when Britains sessions weretelevised live, all the beauticians in London were full. Allthe MPs rushed into the beauticians. You also might go Sir- you never know - for a nice facial massage, a slightcolouring of your hair. Now apart from that joke Sir, I thinkit is very vital to televise the proceedings of this House live.If nobody wants to see, let them switch it off. It is up tothe public. But, have one channel. May it be a governmentchannel or a private channel. I am not getting into thatargument. But, have one channel that concentrates on theproceedings of this House which will have a great bearingon the conduct of its MPs. Now, Sir, having said that letme very briefly - How much more time do I have, Sir?

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)

Now, Sir, I will quickly quickly rush through this. I wantto just say one thing about tourism, Sir. The MahindaChintana which is the vision of President Rajapaksa dealshere extensively with the subject of tourism. I think, it goesinto about 7 or 8 pages. I will not read that out now due tolack of time. But, may I say this, Sir. Tourism has beenseverely affected by the travel advisories that unfortunatelyhave been issued by a number of countries. Australia,France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy have condemnedSri Lanka to the devils. France has gone to the extent ofsaying that all non-essential travel to Sri Lanka must stopimmediately. The only country that has given a balancedview is Britain, the United Kingdom which has not takenany hard positions on this. So, this time there will be notourists from France, none from Germany, none from theNetherlands, none from Italy which is about 40,000 to 50,000tourists because of the situation here. When there was anattack on the Galle Harbour unfortunately the BBC went onlive saying that the tourist hub of Galle has been attackedby terrorist forces. Galle is not a tourist hub. Galle is onlya city. They will never attack tourists. They only attackedthe naval headquarters there. I must say that the LTTE hasnever targeted a tourist for the last 22 years unlike in Sharmel-Sheikh in Egypt or in Bali, Indonesia. They never targeteda tourist as such. That is the only argument we have whenwe go to those countries. I met the Foreign Minister ofFrance. I met the Tourism Minister of France. I met all thetourist industry people in the United Kingdom. They kepton plugging this line. But, Sir, the adverse publicity thatwe have received in the West has done an irreparabledamage. But, Sir, my Ministry will launch two massiveprojects at Kalpitiya which involves nearly 40,000 acres. Weare laying the foundation stone for that in January. We arestarting a huge project which was begun by the Leader ofthe Opposition, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe when he wasthe Prime Minister, at Dedduwa in the Galle District. Withthe assistance of my good Friend the Hon. DineshGunawardena, with Japanese funds we are doing therestoration of several cities. We are beginning this Saturdaywith the City of Negombo. Then, we are going to the Citiesof Galle, Kandy , Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Dambulla andso on and so forth, Sir.

. . - ( ( - )(The Hon. T. B. Ekanayake - Minister of Road Development andDeputy Minister of Public Administration)

Yapahuwa.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)

Yapahuwa, of course. I am sure, we are giving the entiretyof the development of the Kalpitiya Project to the UDA and

to the State Engineering Corporation. I am sure both theefficient ministers will expedite the work and make it viablein the next 3 or 4 years.

Now, Sir, I will come to the conclusion of my speech. Allwhat we are planning will not take off the ground if we donot find a solution to the ethnic problem. Therein lies themain cancer or the core issue of the problem. If there is nosolution to the ethnic problem and if the war goes on therewill be no investment, there will be no tourism. The countrywill go down. Look at all the countries that are surpassingus. Vietnam, a war ravaged country, Singapore, Malaysia,India and the Maldives. We are standing in one place . Theyare all walking past us. It is a tragedy beyond understanding,Sir. Therefore, let us end this unlimited cost of lives,anguish, death and destruction. This is a chance of a lifetimethat a MoU has been signed by the two major parties ofthis country, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the UnitedNational Party. For 55 years we have fought each other. TheHon. Wickremasinghe has said at the Annual Conventionof the UNP three days ago that my father had said in 1956,it seems that he had driven the last nail in the coffin of theUNP. Several nails have been driven after that. My motherdrove two nails into the coffin of the UNP. My sister drove12 nails, one after the other, year after year into the coffinof the UNP. Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa also drove a nail intothe coffin of the UNP last year and now Hon. KaruJayasuriya, I hope, will not drive the last nail. [Interruption.]You will not. I know that. [Interruption.] No, I will not. Ihave too much regard for you personally to involve you inthis Debate, but I said that as a joke.

Sir, this is not a question of driving nails into anybodyscoffin. That must stop. Let us stop trying to drive nailsinto each others coffins. This country demands more fromus. They voted for us expecting a better tomorrow, not tobe driving nails into each others coffins. This country issick and tired of this charade. Dirty politicians playing onthem year after year.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, let us bury the past and look tothe future. Let us reach for the stars, even if the stars seemunreachable. Eighty five per cent of the people of thiscountry are together in the attempt to find a solution to theethnic problem. I am glad that a majority of the parties ofthis country are veering to the position that maximumdevolution, call it federalism or call it what you may, maximumdevolution is the only answer to the ethnic problem withina united Sri Lanka.

This is the position of India. India has reiterated thisover and over again to Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, to me whenI was Foreign Minister, to President Rajapaksa, to PresidentKumaratunga and to Mr. Wickremasinghe. Indias positionis perfectly clear. They do not want a division of Sri Lanka,but they want maximum devolution within a united Sri Lanka.Mr. Shiv Shankar Menon, the new Foreign Secretary, a dearfriend of Sri Lanka and one of the finest men in the Indian

2006 22919920

Civil Service I have met, is due here today or tomorrow. Iam sure he will carry a message from the Indian Government.Do not forget that Tamil Nadu has 70 million Tamils. TheCongress Party in power is hanging on a thread. They needthese alliances with the DMK. If they walk out, out goesMadam Gandhi, out goes Manmohan Singh. Therefore, theIndian Government has to tread a very thin line. You mustunderstand that and appreciate that. I am not askinganybody to be Indias lackey. Since the last time I spokehere and caused a furore, Nirupama Rao had to go to Beijing.But that is not a reflection on India at all. I love India. Ihave always urged on the Floor of this House that India isthe cornerstone of our foreign policy. Whatever we doreverberates on India and vice versa. India is not only ourfriend but our comrade in arms. India is the only super powerin the Asian Region not only because of their power, becauseof their humanity, because of the greatness of people likeMahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Thecountry has become today what it is because of them. TheIndian position has been made clear to all the Sri Lankanleaders. Talk and talk immediately. I am sure Mr. Menonwould come here with that same message. Find, forget yourextremism, leave aside the war mongers, get to the table, talkthe issues, devolve power within a united Sri Lanka and Indiawill be fully behind us. Talk about the Co-Chairs, talk aboutthe United States, talk about Japan, talk about Europe, leavethat alone, that is the message the whole world has for usand we must heed that, Mr. Speaker.

Let us attempt now that we are together even for a limitedtwo years to cleanse public life of corruption and graft.Corruption in this country stinks to the heavens. Both ourparties are responsible for this. You cannot blame anyoneparty. Nothing gets done here without money passing.When I was the Minister of Investment, I was the only manwho did not make money. From the clerk to the peon, to thelevel just below the Minister, everybody takes money. Soinvestors get tired, they get sick and they go back.Corruption must be wiped off the face of this country. Weare not in politics to make money. If anybody wants to makemoney, do business or go abroad. Politics is not to makemoney. I have been in public life for 30 years. Three membersof my family have ruled this country for 28 years. Nobodyin this House has pointed a finger and said that I have beencorrupt. That is the mantle I wear with greatness. Thanksto my father and to my mother. I am not talking, boastingabout myself. I would like all of you to wear that mantle.Every single Member must make it worth their while that weare here not to make money and go home, but we are hereto serve the people.

The other thing that we must do together, the Hon.Jayasuriya, I know you agree with me on this, is to securetotal independence of the judiciary. From the highest courtof the land, the Supreme Court, the judiciary must seem andmust be totally independent. It cannot be the fiefdom ofone judge or his insatiable fantasies; the Supreme Courtmust be truly independent.

Let us together wipe out the killings, the rapes and thethefts that are going on day after day unchecked. In myadjoining electorate, Mirigama, a young girl of 16 was raped.In your home town, Hon. Jayasuriya. The young girl wasraped for no reason at all and murdered. This goes on dayafter day in every part of the country. How long are wegoing to go on like this? Whoever is responsible must bebrought to book. If any Member of Parliament or anypolitician is behind it, punish him in heavens name; thecountry comes before party. Therefore, Sir, let us restorehuman rights. Our name is mud all over the world. A lot ofpeople do not accept this. I was accused by the FrenchGovernment of representing a nation of brutal killers. Letus wipe that off from the reputation of this country. Let usnot kill innocent people; be they Sinhalese, Muslims orTamils. Let those who are killed be properly investigatedindependently and swiftly.

Not only the question of Mr. Raviraj whose death wasmost unfortunate but even the deaths of PresidentRanasinghe Premadasa, Mr. Lalith Athlath Mudali, Mr.Gamini Dissanayake, the bomb attack on PresidentChandrika Kumaratunga and the countless number of peopleyou all lost and, Mr. C.V. Gooneratne and Mr. LakshmanKadirgamar from our side. Let there be investigations rapidlyand the culprits brought to book.

Now, Sir, let us all join hands because this country isheading towards a failed state. Whatever we say, whateverwe do the stark reality lies in the fact that we are headingfast towards a failed state and we are all responsible for it.It is not only the responsibility of the President or myselfor Mr. Wickremasinghe or Mr. Jayasuriya or PresidentKumaratunga. All of us are to be blamed if this is a failedstate. Let us together with all our friends and allies, evenwith our opponents in the Opposition, make this a countrywhat is worth living in. I am sure that destiny has bestowedon President Mahinda Rajapaksa this duty. As I know himwell for 37 years I am sure that he will not fail this nation.The nation has turned to him in an hour of great need. I amsure he will not fail you and the Sri Lanka Freedom Partyand our allies and our Friends in the Opposition, the JanathaVimukthi Peramuna, the JHU and the United National Partyand hopefully the TNA and the Muslim Congress. Let usall join together whatever our political differences are. Atthis hour of need let us put shoulder to shoulder and savethis nation and start our battles the day after tomorrow.Nobody is asking to dissolve your parties or give up yourideologies.

Before that let there be a Sri Lanka that will exist. But atthe rate that we are going there will be no Sri Lanka left.Therefore, Mr. Speaker, to create more employment, to createmore houses, to create more income we have to have a climatefor investment and the climate must be peace at all costs.For that to happen the war must end. War is no solution.From President J.R. Jayewardena to President MahindaRarapaksa, all the presidents that have ruled this country

921922

have realized that war is not a solution. The hour has come,seize it before it is too late and let us hope Sir, that we areprepared to go that extra mile, not one mile a thousand milesor a ten thousand miles or a million miles to make every citizenof this country feel comfortable, feel wanted so that theywill not resort to acts of terrorism as a last desperate hope.

Sir, may I wind up with my favourite quotation from WilliamShakespeare. It states, I quote:

There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

Let us take the tide as the flood and lead Sri Lanka tofortune. The chance has come now after 55 years. Thechance has come now not only because we have got togetherbut the nation demands it so from all of us. Let us seize itwith both hands before it is too late to save mother Lankafrom the terrible catastrophe that awaits it.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you my Colleagues.

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)

Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

I listened to the Hon. Dilan Pereras speech in the earlypart of the day and I wish to state that the Hon. DilanPerera has taken a stand to stand for peace in this country.

2006 22971972

I have admired his stand on that and I wish to place thaton record today because he took that stand yet again inthis House. It takes a lot of courage to speak up at a timewhen our country is torn by war.

I am also happy to speak after my good Friend, the Hon.Mahindananda Aluthgamage. I was happy to hear him cometo the position that the CEB needs urgent reforms andopportunistic political parties such as the JVP have beenputting the spanner in the works of trying to reform theseinstitutions. I can remember the Hon. Sarath Amunugamawhen he was the Minister of Finance, very clearly stated, Ithink about an year ago, that if these institutions were notreformed, they will be monstrous liabilities on the country.Now it has come true. -[Interruption.] Right. And nowthe Hon. Deputy Minister says the same thing. What I wouldlike to say is, this was the stand of the United National Party.When the United National Party took this up, for politicalpurposes those reforms were bashed time and time againin this House.

Today, we have an MoU where, for the sake of thiscountry, the leader of our Party, the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe, has agreed to support His Excellency thePresident and the Government to bring about peace. Sotoday the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthagamage has come tothe position that the United National Party has taken thecorrect step. I am glad to hear that.

The Mahinda Chintana was a JVP inspired document,according to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. They saidthat it was inspired by them. In Sinhala if you say, theywere the Nirmathru of the Mahinda Chintana. Sowhatever good that comes out of it or whatever bad thatcomes out of it has to be the responsibility of the JVP becausethey have to share it according to what they said.

Coming on to the Budget of 2007, His Excellency thePresident in the Budget has set aside a total revenue ofRs.559 billion, a very ambitious target and a total expenditurefor 2007 at Rs. 834 billion. This is a huge amount of money.What I would like to put forward to the officials who arehere is, because the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance isnot here, that this expenditure increment; is it forinfrastructure, is it for capital expenditure, is it for a requiredpurpose, or is it going to go down for purely RecurrentExpenditure and wastage? Because we have seen in the pastone year almost 100 ministries have been created andtherefore is it to pay the salaries, the monies to upkeep theseMinisters and the staff or is it for the well being of thecountry?

If you take the experience of 2006, this year, capitalexpenditure has been slashed. So whatever you would sayin the Budget document itself, ultimately there aresupplementary estimates that come into Parliamentincreasing Recurrent Expenditure with subsequent cuts inCapital Expenditure and Capital Expenditure being divertedfor Recurrent Expenditure.

The Hon. Dilan Perera said that the allocation for educationhas been increased for this year. It may be increased. Butare we seeing it as going into good causes? Is it going todevelop the infrastructure of the education sector or is itgoing into Recurrent Expenditure for wasteful expenditurethat the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage himself nowadmitted is taking place in Ministries? Now this is not atime, when a country is at war for such wastage totake place.

Sir, I would also like to say that a 7 per cent growth inGDP is being talked about by the Central Bank Governor,Mr. Nivard Cabraal at every forum as if that is the greatestachievement this country has got in the past few years. ButI do not believe so. Look at from where this 7 per cent growthis coming. Eighteen per cent of the growth is attributableto the telecommunication sector because there is vast growthin the telecommunication sector. There is a huge gap in thenumber of telephones in the rural sector and about 18 percent of the growth is from there and most of the growth isfrom the service sector. It is from the service sector that itis coming and this is not in line with the Mahinda Chintanabecause the Mahinda Chintana talks about developing therural economy and it is not. The growth is not spurred bythe national economy or the rural economy or the industrialsector growing. Of course, I do admit that agricultureproduction went up in this year.

( )( () - , )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of PublicAdministration and Home Affairs)

Can I disturb you for a minute?

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)

Yes, of course.

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)There is growth in all sectors. In agriculture there isgrowth, in manufacturing there is growth and in the servicesector.

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)

Can I

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

I agree with you that there is a much more pronouncedgrowth in the service sector.

973974

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)

Exactly. It is not uniform

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

But, nevertheless there is growth in the other two sectorsalso.

( )(The Hon. Kabir Hashim)

I will explain how that is. In the agriculture sector therewas growth as you said. There was a record crop of 2.1million metric tonnes in the last Maha season but you mustaccept that that 2.1 million metric tonne growth was becausethere was a fertilizer subsidy. People who were not intopaddy farming jumped in to get the subsidy. But is it asustainable growth? There was a 6 per cent growth in Mahabut in this Yala season there is a 6 per cent decline Hon.Minister, in the paddy production, in the agricultural sector.Now Yala of course is a much lower crop than Maha. I acceptthat. But there has been a decline. You had a growth butwhat happened to the paddy farmers? The paddy farmerscould not sell their paddy. The minimum guaranteed pricejumped down from Rs.14 to Rs.8. There might have been a mafia as you call it but there was a responsibilityfor the Government to maintain the sustainability of thatgrowth. Within one year you have destroyed the paddysector. The Central Bank Governor saying that there is a 7per cent growth is a joke because the agriculture sector hada spur but now it has fallen back. So do not believe in thesethings because we can identify figures. We can see throughfigures.

Now coming on to public debt, another myth, theGovernment always talks about this. If you take the totalpublic debt in relation to GDP, it has reduced. Of course,GDP in nominal terms has gone up by a huge amount. Sopublic debt becomes a smaller percentage. But if you takethe public debt as a whole and look at how public debt hasbeen increasing in the past few years, public debt hasincreased by a huge amount.

Right now, if you take the foreign debt in this year, foreigndebt has increased by 19 per cent and even at this momentthe Government is negotiating with the HSBC for a hundredmillion dollar loan. Now this is, we are giving up the futuregenerations to foreign commercial loans. When these comeup for payment how are you going to pay all this money?These are real issues that the country is going to face.

Sir, I quote from the Daily Mirror of Wednesday, 22nd

November, 2006. JHU, JVP for maximum devolution ofpower. They may refute this. But it says, that at the AllParty Representative Committee meeting the JHU andJVP have said, We are willing to talk. Now they say, whenI talked to somebody, that they are willing to talk aboutdevolution. At least if you are willing to talk that meansyou have accepted that the UNP position was correct. Iam happy today to say that we are working with HisExcellency the President to bring peace to this country.Unconditionally, we are supporting the President, becausethis country needs peace. It is a national crisis and we arehappy that the JVP and the JHU also have realized that weshould not do politics on the peace issue and that the peaceissue is above everything. It is a national question. We arehappy that -

YoY percentage increase in food has been 17.3 per centup to the month of October. When you look at from April,there has been a huge increase in the food prices. If youtake that as an index, food price increase, if you take theYoY percentage increase in April, the index was 4829.7.By October, it was 5356.1. Now this is the rise in price offood, the Cost of Living. Those are the basic essentials.

. . ( )( [ - )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala Minister ofParliamentary Affairs)

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy indeedto follow my Learned Friend, Kabir Hashim. His Excellencythe President, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa needs to becongratulated for introducing a realistic Budget under verydifficult circumstances, and that was the point which theHon. Anura Bandaranaike made in the morning. And thisis the second Budget introduced on the basis of the packageof policies called the Mahinda Chintana which in myview, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is targeting therural poor in Sri Lanka. It is intended to rejuvenate andreconstruct the rural economy of Sri Lanka, and his firstBudget too targeted the rural poor and this is in keepingwith the development strategy adopted in the MahindaChintana which I emphasize is a realistic bundle ofeconomic and social policies. No Government as far as Ican remember introduced such a comprehensive set ofpolicies in the past. This is a scheme which has to beimplemented within a period of six years. One must notforget the fact that His Excellency the President, Hon.Mahinda Rajapaksa has been elected for a period of sixyears and he still commands massive popular acceptancein this country.

In my view, Mr. Deputy Chairman, there are twodimensions to this Budget, both local and international. Onedimension, in my view, relates to globalization, theimportance of it and the impact of it cannot be ignored.

Globalization can be defined, Mr. Deputy Chairman, asthe process towards the integration of national economiesinto one global economy through free movement of goodsand services, factors of production such as capital labourand technology and this process of internationalization ofeconomies is today facilitated by the variety of advancesmade in the area of information technology. Today thereis a borderless world and the national sovereignty to alarger extent has been made irrelevant. Today nationalboundaries of economic activity do not exist. People thinkthat globalization is a new process. No, Mr. DeputyChairman, it began in 1776 when Adam Smith wrote thatseminal work, that celebrated work, Wealth of Nationwhich I read as an undergraduate at Peradeniya. It was theEnglish economist David Ricardo who developed it throughinternational specialization and international free trade.

Modern stage of globalization began in the late seventiesand two important factors contributed to it. Firstly, thecollapse of the monetary relationship developed at BrettonWoods Conference and secondly, the emergence of thenewly industrialized countries in East Asia, primarily,Japan, Taiwan and Korea.

Technological progress, Mr. Deputy Chairman, in the lastthree decades reduced the cost of transporting goods,capital, people and ideas across the globe. Japan has nowemerged as an important source of FDI -Foreign DirectInvestment and in the periods 1960 to 1995 Japans shareof global FDI increased to over 10 per cent. The entry ofChina into the world economy is yet another importantfactor with which the process of global economicintegration has been accelerated.

It needs to be emphasized, Mr. Deputy Chairman, thatno country in the given global context can escape theimpact of globalization and it needs to be taken intoconsideration in formulating economic policy. This isthe point which I would like to emphasize. My youngFriends in the JVP with a lot of idealism, need to realizethat economic policy cannot be formulated in isolation. Ifwe do attempt to do that in isolation we would beenthroning Pol Potism in this country. This is anotherpoint which I would like to emphasize.

Next important dimension is the political scenario in thecountry to which my good Friend Kabir Hashim referredto succinctly. Ours is a conflict-ridden society and thecountry has suffered in the last 20 years as a result of thisongoing conflict. It needs to be immediately solvedthrough a package of devolution of power. Power needsto be devolved within the framework of a single state.President Mahinda Rajapaksa has created a process for thisand today two important committees are working on ascheme of devolution of power which was referred to byHon. Kabir Hashim. Yet another factor is in our favour. Forthe first time in the history of post-independent Sri Lankatwo major parties have reached a consensus on the needto find a negotiated settlement to this problem. It is inthis scenario, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that theSecond Budget of the Rajapaksa regime has beenintroduced.

Before I begin to discuss the budgetary proposals andtheir impact on development, I need to refer to the economicachievements of 2005. I need to do this because severalspeakers including my good Friend Hon. Kabir Hashim andmy learned Friend Hon. Bandula Gunawardane argued thatnothing has happened in 2005 or thereafter. Let mecatalogue one by one. One, the GDP grew by 6.2 per cent.This happened despite the tsunami in 2004. Two, theagricultural growth expanded by 1.2 per cent and theThousand Tank Rehabilitation Programme and good weatherconditions had an impact. Three, the industrial sectorexpanded by 7. 9 per cent. Four, the construction andhousing sector grew rapidly. Five, the services sector alsogrew by 6.7 per cent. Six, the levels of investment andsavings also rose. The investments increased from 25 percent to 26.8 per cent. The savings rose from 15.9 per centto 17.2 per cent.

981982

[ . . ]The Governments fiscal position too was good. Therevenue increased to 16 per cent of GDP. The fiscal deficitalso declined and the public debt, to which my learnedFriend Hon. Kabir Hashim referred, also fell. The rate ofinflation began to fall. In August 2005, it was 12.8 per centand it fell to 11.6 per cent in December, 2005. In April,2006, it was 9.2 per cent. This would be attributed to thetight monetary policy adopted by the Central Bank of SriLanka. The unemployment level, Mr. Deputy Chairman,has been reduced from 8.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent. Exportearnings too have increased. These are some of theachievements of the early part of 2005.

Economic and social infrastructure too underwent atransformation especially in such sectors astelecommunication to which my good Friend referred,transport, education and health services. These are basicsectors which need further improvement. They need furtherinvestment. I do not deny that. In the first half of 2006,there were similar achievements. The economy grew by 8per cent and this was in comparison to the growth rate of5.3 per cent in 2005.

This Budget, Mr. Deputy Chairman, as His ExcellencyMahinda Rajapaksas Second Budget, has given dueconsideration for infrastructure development with a viewto accelerating the development process in the rural areasof this country. The Mahinda Chintana from thebeginning recognized the need to reconstruct and transformthe rural sector of the economy. The aim was to tap thepotential in the rural economy. The Mahinda Chintana,as the leading economist Mr. G.V.S. de Silva said twodecades ago, recognized the development of the ruralproductive forces as the central economic question in ourcountry. It is on this basis that the new proposals have beenformulated. In order to assist the formulation of policy, theformulation of economic and social policy, several importantdocuments have been produced and they are as follows: A Ten Year Horizon Development Framework 2006-2016",Medium Term Budgetary Framework 2006-2009,Partnership Towards a New Sri Lanka, Special Projectsfor Accelerated Development in Sri Lanka andDevelopment Expenditure Identified by DivisionalSecretary Division - 2006-2009. These are importantdocuments. They were placed before this House. Theseare vital documents, Mr. Deputy Chairman, containing quitea bit of information which could be used, fruitfully usedfor the formulation of public policy for economic and socialdevelopment in this country. Take, for instance, A Ten YearHorizon Development Framework 2006-2016". It hasidentified the areas which need immediate transformation.

In this Budget, there are a number of taxation proposals.Companies with a dividend payout of less than one-thirdof profit will pay a tax of 15 per cent and the purpose is toencourage capital market development. The EconomicService Charge has been reduced. The tax defaulters have

been given a concession and they need to settle tax defaultswithin three years. Yet another taxation proposal, Mr. DeputyChairman, is the one relating to the Withholding Tax. Itsthreshold for liability has been raised to Rs. 300,000 andthe rate of tax has been reduced to 5 per cent on interest.If the interest is greater than Rs.600,000, the tax is 10 percent. This would benefit the people who live on fixeddeposit earnings and also would provide incentives forsavings.

The tax free threshold for terminal benefits has been raisedfrom Rs. 2 million to Rs. 5 million; the tax on shares heldby employees will be removed; newly purchased buses byprivate operators with a route permit will be exempted fromVAT; a reduction of VAT has been proposed on high-techmedical equipment; a 5 per cent Excise Tax on polythenebags will be imposed; a BOI duty-free facility will beextended only to products that are not available throughlocal industries and an exemption of VAT has been proposedon heavy fuel and electricity. These are the tax concessionsgiven. They are likely to generate more economic activity.

A comprehensive package of credit and tax rebate hasbeen introduced. This would help those engaged in inlandfishing, agriculture, livestock production et cetera. TheVAT on jewellery has been reduced and leather productswill be exempt from Import Duty and VAT. These incentives,Mr. Deputy Chairman, are certain to generate more industrialactivity in this country. There is an increased allocationfor research and development - R and D - in order to improvecompetitiveness in key industries. In the past, not muchattention was given to research and development.

As I mentioned earlier, the Mahinda Chintanarecognized the need to disperse development activity inthis country, especially in relation to the establishment ofindustries. In other words, it advocated the need to breakaway from the Western Province centred industrialdevelopment policy or industrial development strategy. AsJoseph E. Stiglitz, whose book is here with me, has argued,the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime recognizes the role of theState in development. In other words, when it comes toeconomic development in our part of the world, especiallyin the Third World countries, we should not deny thepositive role of the State in development. State, in my view,still has a positive role in relation to social and economicdevelopment.

Today the developing world is divided into two sets ofcountries: low income countries and middle incomecountries. Middle income countries have a per capitaincome of more than US Dollars 735. Sri Lanka falls intothis category. In order to overcome this situation, adeveloping country like that of ours needs to engage itselffully with world trade. We need to attract Foreign DirectInvestment. In my view, my good friends of the Treasury,the mandarins of the Treasury should pay much moreattention to trade and Foreign Direct Investment and must

2006 22983984

device policies to attract Foreign Direct Investment. Short-term capital flows are not enough as long-term investmentis not possible with short-term capital. This has to berealized. In other words, short-term capital does not bringin development transformation. Therefore, what needs tobe done or what needs to be encouraged is more and moreForeign Direct Investment. It is my view that localinvestment is not enough to alleviate poverty in this country.In order to attract Foreign Direct Investment, Mr. DeputyChairman, political stability is a fundamental requirement,a vital requirement.

This is why we need to enter into a permanent, negotiatedpolitical settlement on the ethnic question. My goodFriends of the TNA are here. We are ready to devolve powerwithin the framework of a single State. I, as the memberrepresenting the Sri Lanka Freedom Party at the APRC,about which a question arose in the morning, can assurethis House and the TNA as well that we would produce ascheme of devolution of power that would address thegenuine and legitimate aspirations of the Tamil community.We value peace, Mr. Deputy Chairman, - [Interruption.] Ilistened to you in the morning. I never disturbed you. Youwere championing the cause of Eelam in the morning.Please do not disturb me. - [Interruption.]

Mr. Deputy Chairman, we value peace, which he does notwant. We value peace and we need to live in peace. Thisis what we need to stress: we value peace and we need tolive in peace. Lord Beveridge once said that. I am quotingLord Beveridge to conclude my speech. This is what hesaid. Lord Beverage once said that many things right inpeace are utterly wrong in war. I repeat it: many thingsright in peace are utterly wrong in war.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me thisopportunity to speak on the 60th Budget that has beenpresented after Independence in this country.

The country is at a very crucial juncture. The economy,we do not need to mention, is in dire straits. We do notneed to gloat about it. Together, we need to ensure thatthis economy is brought to its correct base. But that wouldnecessarily mean that instead of having blinkers on, weshould accept the reality and ensure that we make a non-political approach in regard to this very important subject:the economy. After all, I have been saying repeatedly thatif we lose the economic war, we have lost all other wars.Going further, at a time when the country is looking forleadership, direction and as to how little Sri Lanka mustintegrate with the world, a Budget has been presented. Theimpact of this would be felt in the years to come.Unfortunately, what was expected is not what has beendelivered. But it could have been worse and therefore, letus take what is delivered at this moment. The intention ofa Budget is to ensure that the limited resources are dividedand directed for the best use in the areas that they shouldgo into. It is expected by the people, the internationalcommunity, the business community and in short, the entireworld looks at the policies stated in the Budget.

Has this Budget achieved this? A direct answer is, no. Inthis Budget emphasis has been placed on some sectionsof the country only and not the country as a whole. That

is why it looks more or less, almost like a municipal councilbudget that has been presented. No Government is poor.It is bad governance that leads to poverty. . .

If I may just refer to the statements issued by the keypeople in preparing the Budget, I guess it would be a usefulcontribution to the debate that I intend to conclude onbehalf of the Opposition. The Secretary to the Treasury,no doubt, has a very difficult task. On the 1st of October,the Irudina newspaper states, I quote:

.

Then The Sunday Times of 19th November, 2006 states,I quote:

Economy on recovery path: Treasury Chief

He has been for 11 years in charge of this. He mentionsthat, but how will it be put into action? A wide developmentspectrum has been envisaged in the Budget. The Hon.Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Deputy Minister of Financesays, I quote from the Dinamina newspaper of 13th

November, 2006:

.

. Thenthe Governor of the Central Bank says, I quote from theDivaina newspaper dated 19th November, 2006:

.

Sir, this is the situation. Inflation is definitely a majorproblem. But who created it? That is the problem. Youcreated the problem. You give promises that cannot bedelivered. We, for telling the truth, are in the Opposition.The Government, which is led by the Janatha VimukthiPeramuna, the Jathika Hela Urumaya and the SLFP, forconning, is in power. Now they say that there is inflationand inflation is created by expenditure which is well abovethe revenue.

plug ? ? ? , .

Sir, if you go further and look at the 2006 Budget, therehad been many promises given in that. The 2004 Budget,they said, was a budget that gave something for everybody.Had it been implemented? So, that is the reality we arespeaking about at this Budget, at this particular moment.For the most number of years from 1994 to 2006, the PeoplesAlliance Government has been at the helm of running this

10011002

[ ]economy. During the 13 consecutive years, except for threeBudgets, they have been mostly in charge of the economyand it was only those three years at least was a saving grace.

Because of the impact, the economic boom that tookplace from 2002 to 2004, the Government is still oxygenizedto go forward. If you remember in 1995, a five-year planwas presented. In 1998, they said, We will give anotherfive-year plan. Then in 2000, Vision 2010 was presented.In 2004 the Rata Perata programme was presented andthen in 2005, the Mahinda Chintana was presented.

Now we come back again to a ten-year developmentprogramme. All these are words at the end of the day. Whatpeople want is basic assistance to ensure that they extricatethemselves from poverty that they are stricken with. Theysay that 720 proposals have been submitted to the Ministryof Finance and up to the 26 th of October, they seemed tobe corresponding and discussing with the people who gavethese ideas. So, Sir, is it possible to have a ten-year planfixed in just two weeks? Whom are we fooling?

That is why we, the United National Party realizing theimportance of the economy, realizing the difficulty theGovernment is in, gave the assistance to His Excellencythe President and the Peoples Alliance Government toensure that no chauvinistic party blackmails the Budget andruins the economy since they have been the cause of ruiningit. That is why the United National Party - the Leader ofthe Opposition, the Leader of the United National Party -said, Here is our unqualified support. With that, we didnot expect a Budget of this nature. We did not want anyburden to be cast upon the people. If we did not give thissupport, additional burden would have been brought onthe people. So, we take solace that at least owing to theeffort and assistance given by us, we have been able toreduce the suffering inflicted on the people. But let us beconstructive.

I am in no way saying that the entire Budget is bad.There are some very laudable proposals that have beeenmade and courageous decisions have been taken. Thatcourage has come from nothing else but from the supportwhich the principal Opposition, the United National Partyhas given. Today, we the United National Party is supportingthis Government that was propped by their heterogeneousalliance but our support is much more than that of theirown alliance partners. I am sure there is no dispute overthat. That is why they have had the courage of convictionto present such a Budget at a time when the economy is indire straits.

Sir, . . , com . .

Sir, peace is the most important aspect if we are to lookat the economy as the principal target. There is no secondword about it. The economy is the most important aspectin the country, Sir. In order to ensure that the economy isvibrant, you must have business confidence. The businessclimate must improve. Investors would come only if thereis a peaceful environment in this country. If bombs keepgoing off in all parts of the island, do you think thatanybody - leave alone the foreigners, even a Sri Lankan -would invest even a rupee? That is the problem we are facedwith. So, on that particular score all we can say is - ? So, all our emphasis mustbe to ensure that we bring peace to this country. , . ? . . . , , . , , , .

Sir, speaking on the Budget for 2007, the prognosis isthat there will be a Rs. 236 billion deficit. That is after avery optimistic revenue increase from Rs.482 billion in 2006- which is a revision on a reduction basis from Rs. 484billion - to Rs.599 billion in 2007, Mr. Deputy Speaker.Going on that basis, there is an increase of Rs.119 billion.This is thrust on the people through indirect taxation. VAT

2006 2210031004

is the principal collecting source that has been identifiedin this Budget. The Budget deficit is stated as 7.2 per cent- not mentioning the tsunami expenditure - which is belowthe line but in real terms it is the 9.1 per cent deficit thatwe are talking about. No Budget deficit in the recent 14years has been less than 8 or 9 per cent. In short, exceptfor years 2002 and 2003, all Budget deficits have been atleast 2 per cent away from what had been planned. So, weexpect a much bigger deficit than this. That is where theplanning is required.

Coming on to the areas of policy-making in this Budget,we must say that there is something very laudable on theentrepot trade. I think that was started by the former Ministerof Finance, the Minister who is going to wind up, the Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama. Entrepot trade is very, veryimportant. There has been a lot of emphasis given to itand I salute that from the United National Partys pointof view.

Agriculture is another aspect and a labour creation sectorin our economy and has got the boost that it required butnot to the extent that it requires. Money has been allocatedbut whether it will really flow down is the question that isin dispute. Past practice has never ensured that it did. So,it is only a direction but still it is good enough; theintentions have been pure.

The National Wealth Corporation which is to be set upto maximize the wealth in the country, is once againlaudable. I only want to draw attention to the fact that whenthe United National Party was in power and when I was theMinister of Trade, we created the National WealthCorporation. I still remember the character assassination ofus by the Members who are governing today for creatingsuch an entity. Today, it is such that retribution has comebefore too long and they themselves have to create theNational Wealth Corporation on the same basis that wecreated it to maximize this. So, I congratulate you for doingso and you have our wholehearted support. On that basisthe most laudable thing is that there are not too manypromises given in this Budget. That, being the formerMinister of Finance, I guess would be most pleasant for you.That courage came in from nobody else but the support ofthe United National Party. I am sure being a responsibleCabinet Minister, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama will findthat definitely comforting. That is the pure action that we,as the United National Party took. We could have easilybeen a stumbling-block. You get support from yourheterogeneous group. That is creating more problems thanhelping you. But, we stood the test of time and ensuredthat. On the basis of the negative aspects that are there,I would say that the biggest problem is the over-emphasison the VAT where only 85 per cent of the output tax can beclaimed which means that it would have a direct impact onthe industrialists, the self-employed or the small andmedium enterprises. That certainly is a cost increase forall these entrepreneurs.

Furthermore, the other most important thing is, today theGovernment seems to be entering the boardrooms ofcompanies. That, I guess is something which has to belooked at. The Government today is telling as to howcompanies should pay their dividends. If you do not paythis, we will impose a surcharge of x amount. That is acomplete infringement on the running of entities in thiscountry. Today, 92 per cent of the workforce is in the handsof the private sector. Today, the private sector is the engineof growth and if the Government steps in and tries to directthe way the capital formation in their companies shouldbe set about, I guess it is a very dangerous trend and I amsure the former Minister of Finance, the Minister who isgoing to wind up, will certainly give us some comfortingassurance that the intentions have not been that but in someother direction. But, before too long that needs to bechanged.

The most important is that we must create growth in thiscountry. Everything stems from growth. If there is nogrowth, that is the end of this country. Today we see ahuman-less growth in this country. The average GDPgrowth rate that had been there from 1980 to 1990 was 5per cent. From 1990 to 2000 it was 5.5 per cent, and from2000 to 2006 the average GDP has been 6 per cent. But,today the Central Bank is saying that a 7 to 8 per cent growthis taking place. So, this growth, has it permeated orpercolated down to the people? Sir, you and I should bethe beneficiaries of this. But have you felt that the growthfrom last year to today has gone up by 8 per cent? This isa fallacy. That is why I say that this is a human-lessgrowth that is taking place. Today the GDP is roughlyabout Rs.2400 billion and the GDP is calculated on anexpenditure basis. So all we could basically say is, owingto the fact that there is heavy defence expenditure thereis Rs. 121 billion that is coming to the economy and thatis what is creating the expenditure in this country theGDP has gone up. So expenditure is taken into considerationwhen calculating the GDP. So at least 2 to 3 per cent plusthe tsunami expenditure that comes in shows that we areonly ensuring expenditure related growth which is havinga negative impact.

When you have MPMGs that go and bomb schools orhospitals, does that create wealth in your country? TheCentral Bank says that we have an 8 per cent growth rate,when they are bombing every single school and hospitalthat is located by the Air Force. That is what is going ontoday. The subject of defence is entirely in the hands ofthe President and the Government and we do not want tointerfere, we do not want to demotivate the forces that aredoing a brave act.

But remember that that capital expenditure was createdby our Government during the United National Party regimewhen Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe was the Prime Minister.Those are forgotten. They talk of Millennium Cities whenthere was never such a thing in existence and then go onand on.

Today we have lost a dear Friend in this House.Mr. Raviraj is no more with us. Why? Because of theinsanity that was there. You said, We will bringhonourable peace in this country. ; . . . 2005 ;2006 . ? _

We must have real growth. Now the defence expenditureis what basically props up growth in this country. I am anaccountant and I only look at it from a balance sheet pointof view. At the end of the day the net asset is only judgedby what is there. Todays growth should be increased by itspercentage to the next day. But, that is not taking place,Sir. Today every city in the country is either having earthslips, rains, floods or tsunami residual problems - a havocsomewhere. So, let us ensure that we have the correctdevelopment strategies.

Defence expenditure, as I said, is unproductive. Ineconomic terms you say the broken window fallacy. Whenyou break a window you replace it. Now in GDP terms thatis growth. But you have the same window that is comingback. This country has been from 1994 stuck in one place.In general terms we go two feet forward and come back threefeet. So we are on a reverse gear on an accelerated basis.It was only in 2002 to 2004 we were able to reverse thattrend. We were able to bring economic boom; we were ableto create jobs. The growth rate that was negative at 1.4per cent was brought up to 6.8 per cent. The defenceexpenditure was zeroed. We diverted the defenceexpenditure into areas of capital expenditure and jobcreation. That has been the difference.

When we take other important factors into consideration,growth has to be reflected through the Budget as I said.What are the components in macroeconomic terms thatprotect this growth? One is the interest rates. In a worldwe cannot live alone, we have to integrate with the rest ofthe world with clauses such as Article VIII that is there andin open market economies with a floating Rupee. Therefore,we have to ensure that we have a stable interest rate and aforeign exchange rate. Today we have about 2,500 millionDollars in our hands in the reserves. I must thank theSecretary to the Treasury for guiding me on certain areaswhich I also was not very proficient in. I was heartened toknow that there was 2500 billion Dollars in overseas banks,just earning the bare minimum. Where are the experiencedpeople who can ensure the maximization of foreign

2006 2210071008

exchange? Today the Yen is low, the Euro is strengtheningand the US Dollar is weaker against the Sterling Pound.There must be competent people to maximize the benefitthat comes from exchange management.

Then on the area of risk management, who are the peoplewho are responsible? These are areas that should be lookedat by a Government to protect the macroeconomy of acountry.

Today, leveraging assets is a very common thing. Whenwe say this type of thing, to some, these are unheard of.The chauvinistic political parties only like to be shoutingaround the Lipton Circus. Today, they are taking an offday and trying to show that there is plunging of assetsthat is taking place. The world is changing.

. . .

Sir what has the Central Bank done in order to protect theRupee? When we handed over on 2nd April, 2004 the Dollarwas Rs.93.10. Two years before when we took over it was,Rs.99.10. So there was an appreciation of the Rupee. Sixmonths ago, when it was Rs.101 they put in US Dollars 375million in order to prop up the currency. Whatever the amountthat was put in, it did not help. It was going up from Rs.101to 102, to 103, to 105 and today it is, Rs.110.10. US Dollars375 million was pushed in, in order to ensure the proppingup of the currency, but it did not help. But what is the costof that? If they had held the Dollar input until today becausetoday a Dollar is Rs.110 as opposed to what it was then atRs.101 - they were trying to defend the Rupee against theDollar- this US Dollars 375 million would have ensured thatwe gained Rs.3.8 billion. Rs.3800 million is almost 38 percent of the Samurdhi allocation. So one insane action hascaused the loss of Rs.3800 million. This is what the CentralBank has done. What about the private sector?

This is why the COPE last year ensured that we gavethis House the management style of the Central Bank; inthe areas of foreign exchange management, in the areas ofmismanagement and in the areas of leveraging of assets.None of them have been taken into consideration. ThisHouse has just become only a talking place, I am sorryto say.

There may be only a few professionals in the Government,but you do not need hundreds of them to run countries.Five or six can run this country. But at least listen to theprofessional Opposition that is there.

As I told, owing to the fact that we - our Leader and theUnited National Party - told the truth, we are in theOpposition and the JVP and Hela Urumaya for lying to thepeople before the Dalada Maligawa and in front of TempleTrees, are governing. That is the difference.

Then going on further, look at the impact of interestrates on the Dollar.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Member, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Just another four minutes, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I willabide by your order. I know the problem that you have.

On Treasury Bills, the interest rates have gone up from6.7 per cent when we handed over on April 2nd 2004 to13.1 per cent as of today. Inflation rates are 17 per cent to18 per cent. Now if you take that seven per cent increase,that is the cost to the Government on the public debt, whichis roughly about .075 per cent of GDP, you will be spend-ing about Rs.18 billion just on interest rates increase. So ifyou take the Rs.18 billion loss on interest rates increaseowing to mismanagement of the economy, and the exchangerate loss that has been mentioned, and add them both, thenyou have lost about Rs.40 billion altogether owing to theinsanity in managing the economy. Now this Rs.40 bil-lion has been lost owing to politicization. Rs.40 billion isalmost 80 per cent of the cost of creating the Mahaweliproject.

Then going on further, infrastructure development isbeing mentioned. I mentioned Port Development. I begof the Government to ensure that we do not spend too muchmoney on breakwaters. They have laid the foundation foran airport in Weerawila. If creating airports is to bring intourism and trade, then why not in Jaffna and why not inBadulla? There must be a basis and not a political sensein doing these type of things. There is no economic sensein what you have done.

Then on to the areas of infrastructure development, theCEB is desperately trying to generate more thermal powerby trying to create Kerawalapitiya. Today, that entity islosing almost Rs.5 million a day. Please ensure that thistype of insane action does not take place.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Member, please wind up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Just another three minutes, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)The Hon. Minister has to be given twenty five minutesto reply.

10091010

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I ensure, that I will abide by your request.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)We have to take the Vote at 5 oclock.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Then on the Katunayake Expressway; when we in theUnited National Party said on the 5th of June 2005 that theKatunayake Expressway will only be costing around 180million Dollars people laughed at us saying that it was justsour grapes. But subsequently the Minister of Trade hadto admit that the 290 million that was estimated was fartoo much and it has been reduced. So we are telling allthis in a positive sense.

Then going on further, the proposals on the areas ofutilization of foreign aid must be looked at in a betterway. Specific poverty alleviation plans have not beenmentioned. There is no development on an islandwidebasis. The North and the East and certain parts of the CentralProvince have been ignored. Increase in trade has not beenmentioned. Today the Free Trade Agreement with the USAis a dead duck. There is absolutely no movement in that.The labour GSP is in jeopardy. There is no support givento tourist trade and on this basis we are not creating asaving nation. A saving nation creates investor-confidence.Investor-confidence is built up by capital formation. Todaythere is a negative return. The inflation is at 18 per centwhereas saving is at 11 per cent. So there is a negative returnthat is prevailing. Going on that basis, all we basicallysay is, look at the impact on -

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Member, you may conclude now because I have tocall upon the Hon. Minister.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Just another two minutes, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)No. I am sorry. I have to call upon the Hon. Minister.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Coming on to the area of duties, today there is an exciseduty, there is a stamp duty, there is BTT. If you cannotmanage the VAT, please do away with it and come backto the normal duties.

( )(The Deputy Speaker) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

All we can say is, the President has been saying, , . , , , . What we say is, we have nothing tocelebrate, but we have a country to build.
