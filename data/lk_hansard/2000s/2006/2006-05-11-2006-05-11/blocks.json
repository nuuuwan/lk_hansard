He reached great heights in the legalprofession within a very short period and was awarded silkand took oaths as a Presidents Counsel. It was while he washaving a lucrative practice that in 1994 when the PeoplesAlliance Government came into power, our former President,Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungainvited him to get into politics. At that stage, the country wasin a state of great confusion and uncertainty politically. Butwith all that Mr. Kadirgamar took up the challenge by takingover the office of Foreign Minister. That was the most difficulttask for Sri Lanka to handle during that period especiallybecause the whole world had formed an opinion against SriLanka.",

One was that Sri Lanka was branded as a countrywhere the fundamental rights of the people were not preservedduring the government which existed prior to 1993 and thesecond reason was that the world image was against SriLankans, and especially the Sinhalese people. The foreignmissions and foreign leaders had formed and opinion thatthere were a lot of ill-treatment and discrimination againstthe minorities in Sri Lanka. But knowing very well that itwas peace that was expected by every Sri Lankan irrespectiveof their religion, race or caste Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamarwanted to give a clear picture to the entre world. Taking intoconsideration the most genuine representations made by theLate Mr. Kadirgamar we recall that the world opinion waschanged. The worst attitude that had been formed against SriLanka by the international community was changed. Afterthat, gradually, we had the benefit of Mr. Kadirgamarsattempts as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was able toclear all the black marks against Sri Lanka. He was able togive a clear picture to the entire world that the Sinhalesecommunity or the Sri Lankan Government is notdiscriminatory, the picture that the terrorist organization hadpainted to the whole world. Although I am pleased to speakabout Mr. Kadirgamar, I am speaking with a very heavy heart,with sorrow and pain. After extending his services for a periodof 11 years, the fate that he had to face was very sad. Thequalities of Mr. Kadirgamar were highlighted due to variousreasons. The public opinion of the politicians is not so goodin this country ; not only at the time that Mr. Kadirgamar gotinto politics, but also today. According to the opinion of thepeople, the conduct of politicians is very audacious effronteryand boorish. Despite such opinions, the people had seen adifference between Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar and some ofthe politicians in the country. He maintained the dignity and",

Until Mr.Lakshman Kadirgamar addressed this issue on the VesakPoya holiday, to declare it as a day of religious importancethat issue was a not addressed by any political leader inthe world. Finally it was he who was able to achieve thatgoal. It was great consolation not only for Buddhists, butalso for each and every person who velieves in somereligion. All the important dates of Jusus Christ wererecognized are in the world and also the important datesof other political leaders, pioneers of politics, pioneers ofreligions were recognized considered as important. ButMr. Lakshman Kadirgamar for the first time made a lotof attemps to make Vesak Poya an international holidayand it was successful. This week especially tomorrow isthe most important day for the Buddhist people becausewe are celebrating Vesak . Of course, although we had thatprivilege, others who believe in Buddhism did not havethat privilege in any other part of the world. But now thisprivilege has been extended and tomorrow all Buddhists",

He did not gain anything forhimself. In fact, he adorned the office he held. The office ofthe Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka shone because Mr.Kadirgamar was the Foreign Minister.

The late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar came oninvitation from the Indian Government and we were seatedon the same receiving same row at the said parade. I canremember, the Deputy Prime Minister of the BJP Governmentof India at that time, Hon. Advani walking up to the late Hon.Lakshman Kadirgamar passing all the other VIPs anddignitaries from all other countries who were there, reachinghim and receiving him with such high esteem. At the time hewas only a Member of the Opposition, a Member ofParliament. But, he commanded respect at the highest levelirrespective of the position he held. That was reflectedthroughout his career. Having been an Oxbridge, he carriedhimself the world over with his past colleagues at OxfordUniversity in the UK shoulder to shoulder mixing well withthe highest of any land and with everybody as his equal. Henever, as I said earlier, thought he was superior to others. Hewas humble because he was full of understanding,compassion, wisdom and above all, a human being of thehighest standard. It is with sincerity of purpose that he lookedat the peace process of this country. It was confronting becausehe came from the Tamil Community of this country. He soughtto solve the issues confronting all communities andconfronting one another to live in this country as peace-loving people of Sri Lanka. It is his sincerity to the cause thatcarried the message for Sri Lanka right across all seas, alloceans and to all lands of the world. It is towards that end thathe contributed to the peace process seriously, because hebelieved that the quality of seriousness matters to retain theintegrity and the purpose and gives value to the purposesupported by all other elements which he carried throughwell. It is because of that he did not shift even in the face ofthreat. He believed peace for all people matters and that allSri Lankas must benefit from that process. It is with thatunderstanding he carried it through. That is why he earnedthe respect of the Opposition, of the Government and of twoPresidents; that of our former President, Mrs. ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga and our present President, HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
