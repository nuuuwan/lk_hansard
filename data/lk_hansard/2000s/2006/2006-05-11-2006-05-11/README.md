: : VOTE OF CONDOLENCE : THE HON. LAKSHAMANKADIRGAMAR

[. . 9.36]

( )(Mr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe)Mr. Speaker, I relish to speak a few words on lateMr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, who was one of our Colleaguesnot only in this august Assembly but also in our legalprofession.

167168

[ ]My memory goes back to 1986 when the late Mr.Kadirgamar returned to Sri Lanka after serving in the UNOfor a long period and started his legal practice at HulftdropHill. I met him for the first time in mid 1980s. I recall howwithin a very short period of time Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamarbuilt his legal practice. He reached great heights in the legalprofession within a very short period and was awarded silkand took oaths as a Presidents Counsel. It was while he washaving a lucrative practice that in 1994 when the PeoplesAlliance Government came into power, our former President,Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungainvited him to get into politics. At that stage, the country wasin a state of great confusion and uncertainty politically. Butwith all that Mr. Kadirgamar took up the challenge by takingover the office of Foreign Minister. That was the most difficulttask for Sri Lanka to handle during that period especiallybecause the whole world had formed an opinion against SriLanka.

I can recall that was a period when each and everyinternational organization, when each and every countryincluding America and the European countries had decidednot to help Sri Lanka by way of aid, either in the form ofmonetary aid or by giving any other assistance due to tworeasons. One was that Sri Lanka was branded as a countrywhere the fundamental rights of the people were not preservedduring the government which existed prior to 1993 and thesecond reason was that the world image was against SriLankans, and especially the Sinhalese people. The foreignmissions and foreign leaders had formed and opinion thatthere were a lot of ill-treatment and discrimination againstthe minorities in Sri Lanka. But knowing very well that itwas peace that was expected by every Sri Lankan irrespectiveof their religion, race or caste Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamarwanted to give a clear picture to the entre world. Taking intoconsideration the most genuine representations made by theLate Mr. Kadirgamar we recall that the world opinion waschanged. The worst attitude that had been formed against SriLanka by the international community was changed. Afterthat, gradually, we had the benefit of Mr. Kadirgamarsattempts as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was able toclear all the black marks against Sri Lanka. He was able togive a clear picture to the entire world that the Sinhalesecommunity or the Sri Lankan Government is notdiscriminatory, the picture that the terrorist organization hadpainted to the whole world. Although I am pleased to speakabout Mr. Kadirgamar, I am speaking with a very heavy heart,with sorrow and pain. After extending his services for a periodof 11 years, the fate that he had to face was very sad. Thequalities of Mr. Kadirgamar were highlighted due to variousreasons. The public opinion of the politicians is not so goodin this country ; not only at the time that Mr. Kadirgamar gotinto politics, but also today. According to the opinion of thepeople, the conduct of politicians is very audacious effronteryand boorish. Despite such opinions, the people had seen adifference between Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar and some ofthe politicians in the country. He maintained the dignity and

decorum and also the augustness not only of a political leaderbut also of the legal fraternity, to the last letter. When heappeared in court we can remember the respect that was shownto him not only by the judges but also by the members of ourprofession. That is not because of anything else but becausehe was able to maintain the dignity, decorum, augustness inthe profession and later as a political leader. Therefore, ourmemories, our cherished memories about Mr. LakshmanKadirgamar will live forever. When taking into considerationhis services for a period of 11 years, I can remember oneincident when especially a BBC journalist tried to buttonholelate Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar on this ethnic issue and thisconflict among the communities in Sri Lanka. The journalistwas trying to fix Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar by taking oncertain points by which he tried to embarrass the Sri LankanGovernment about the unequal treatment towards the peoplein the North. But I can remember that Mr. LakshmanKadirgamar was able to explain and fix the journalist bygiving correct and effectual answers within a few secondsmaking the journalist a real victim for asking wrong questionsfrom Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar. That was his ability. Thatwas his capability.

At the same time, I feel that all Sri Lankan leaders arebranded not as Sri Lankan political leaders but as leaders ofsome community or some religion or some political party. Ifyou take the past history and go back 20, 30, years, youwould see that they were giving leadership to somecommunity or some group. But the question is whether wehad real and true Sri Lankan political leaders. When weaddress that question, the model example that we can showto the whole world is none other than the late Hon. LakshmanKadirgamar.

While he was holding the very high and esteemed office ofMinister of Foreign Affairs, his forte was peace, nothing butpeace. He never made representations either locally orinternationally as a leader of the Tamil community, a leaderof the Peoples Alliance or SLFP, he was always trying to dohis maximum to justify that he was a true leader of Sri Lanka,not belonging to any particular community. Even now if thepoliticians are capable of following his footsteps to lead thecountry instead of giving leadership to a particularcommunity, either to the Tamil community or to the Sinhalesecommunity or to the Muslim community, I think we will beable to maintain a cordial relationship among communitiesand stand up as true Sri Lankans to protect the sovereignty ofthe people of the country. I think we have forgotten that issuefor a couple of decades and each and every person has to paythe price for it.

And in politics, his attitude was always dexterity andflexibility, cowardice was not among his qualities. The bestexample is that he sacrificed his life on behalf of the nation.If he was a coward then he could have had various otheralternatives and options. But he never resorted to those. Hemay have thought that it is better to die for the country afterfulfilling his duties. Those are the qualities that we expectfrom each and every leader and each and every Member of

2006 11169170

this august Assembly. There is a question today before thepublic eye as to whether the nowadays Members of Parliamentare fulfilling those obligations. In my view that is also aquestion mark. It remains a question mark. I do not think thatthere is an answer that we can give to it.

On the first day itself when I met Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamarafter I was exhausted presenting an argument for about twoto three hours in the District Court of Colombo - I knew Mr.Kadirgamar but he did not know who I was - on the corridorhe called me and said Son, come here, you are so and so.The first question he posed to me was, Are you a Royalist?I thought that after he listened to my argument for aboutthree hours he had formed an opinion that I may have studiedat Royal College. But I very boldly said, No, I have neverseen the inside of Royal College. I am from Hambantota butthere is no purpose in telling you the name of my schoolbecause you do not know. where it stands. He was so decentthat he gradually started asking me several questions and hewas really friendly with me after that. I can recall that three orfour weeks later, one evening he called me and asked, Mr.Rajapakshe, I have a couple of complicated cases in theSupreme Court where some civil issues are involved. I am notmuch conversant with Civil Law and can you help me in thislitigation? I said, Of course, yes. It is my privilege if I get achance to appear as a junior counsel to you in court. I saidvery boldly that it was my privilege. Then he invited me tocome to his chamber and I went there. I worked as a junior ato him for a period of about two to three years until he joinedactive politics in August 1994.

After he joined politics also I had a couple of discussionswith him. One day I told Mr. Lakshman Kadirigamar thatthere were certain cases pending, for which I was appearingas his junior. So, I suggested to Mr. Kadirgamar that at thatstage I would have to retain a senior lawyer or a PresidentsCounsel to lead me, because that was a case entrusted to Mr.Kakshman Kadirgamar as a a Presidents Counsel. His answerwas very encouraging. I think I learnt a lot of lessons from hisanswer. His answer was, What are you talking, Mr.Rajapakshe? You are capable enough to handle these cases.Do not retain anybody. I have confidence in you. Youproceed. Mr. Speaker, still I can remember the encouragementI got from a person like Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar. It still hasa real effect on me. It was like a breath of air blowing acrossan arid desert. Mr. Speaker, you being a member of the legalprofession would agree that when you practise as a juniorlawyer, to have that kind of encouragement from a senior likeMr. Kadirgamar is a blessing. I think I had that blesseing andcontinued with all the cases. What was not concluded byMr. Lakshman Kadirgarmar, I was able to conclude with greatsuccesss. After the completion of the cases, one day I met Mr.Lakshman Kadirgamar. Then he praised all the work I haddone and gave me more advice as to how I can reach thezenith of the legal profession. I do not want to give details ofit, but I followed all the advice given by Mr. LakshmanKadirgamar. To my conscience, I can very honestly say, Mr.Speaker, that I have acheived a lot by following that advice.

Therefore, my humble view is that, if we can fllow thefootsteps of a person like Mr. Lakshman Kagirgamar, Notonly as a lawyer, but also as a politician, there are a lotof things we can achieve and we will never lost. Mr.Kadirgamar had proved it. Therefore, I consider this a verygrand occasion because I got the opportunity to talk abouta person specially in gratitude of a person who had notonly rendered yeoman service to the country, but alsopersonally helped me to achieve success in my professionalcarrer.

At the same time, I think it is my duty to mension thatwhen he argued in a court of law he was very sober, notnasty like some of the legal professionals. He addressedonly to the point and he never attacked either a litigantor his opponent personally. He maintained the higheststandards and discipline in the legal profession, I think,it carried him a long way after becomming a politicianalso cosequently he was not subject to any allegation orblame by any politician who belonged to any otherpolitical party or group.

I can remember one of the judges saying that when headdressed court it was like a scintillating Excalibur. Thatsame phrase was used by one of our retired Jedges of theSupreme Court. I think, that was a classic assessment ofthe ability of Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar in presenting hisarguments in a court of law.

His vocabulary must be admired. Not only did he speakto the point, but he also knew how to convince the judges.At the same time, he was a lawyer who never attemptedto mislead either the judges or the opponents counsel.I think, he stood on that same principle both in politicsand as a member of the legal profession.

Therefore, it is with gratitude that we must rememberhim, specially during this wesak week, When we arecelebrating the themangula of Lord Buddha. Not only hashe rendered a great service to Sri Lanka, but also to allBuddhists living in every part of the world. Until Mr.Lakshman Kadirgamar addressed this issue on the VesakPoya holiday, to declare it as a day of religious importancethat issue was a not addressed by any political leader inthe world. Finally it was he who was able to achieve thatgoal. It was great consolation not only for Buddhists, butalso for each and every person who velieves in somereligion. All the important dates of Jusus Christ wererecognized are in the world and also the important datesof other political leaders, pioneers of politics, pioneers ofreligions were recognized considered as important. ButMr. Lakshman Kadirgamar for the first time made a lotof attemps to make Vesak Poya an international holidayand it was successful. This week especially tomorrow isthe most important day for the Buddhist people becausewe are celebrating Vesak . Of course, although we had thatprivilege, others who believe in Buddhism did not havethat privilege in any other part of the world. But now thisprivilege has been extended and tomorrow all Buddhists

171172

whether in Sri Lanka or any other country. Will beenjoying their religious freedom. Therefore, we are eternallygrateful to the late Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar and areindebted to him.

I personally believe that especially due to the North East conflict, we have suffered enough and if not for someof the attempts made by Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, thisissue may have resulted in more adverse consequencesand we could have suffered much more.

May he attain Nibbana. Thank you very much.

( )(Mr. Milinda Moragoda)Mr. Speaker more than 30 years separates me from thegeneration of Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar whom we honourtoday. He was actually my fathers friend. They had beentogether in the Law Faculty of Peradeniya, and they metagain when they worked in Switzerland. It was there, when Iwas a child, that I first met Lakshman. I could not haveimagined that in 30 years, we would be colleagues in thisHouse; not that his brilliant career would end in tragedy.

Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar was eminently qualified to beMinister of Foreign Affairs. Outstanding academic careersat Peradeniya and Oxford equipped him perfectly with botha knowledge of his own country and the ways of the foreigner,He was able to move with confidence among his own people,as well as with his political collleagues abroad. An athlete ofdistinction, he contributed generously to the developmentof sports in our country.

Although in politics our paths diverged, and we had toagree to disagree on severa issues, his commitment todemocracy, and to dialogue on divisive issues, enabledhim to rise above personal considerations and to placethe good of the country above all. He was a man ofintegrity and strict adherence to principle, an attributefor which, in the end, he paid with his life.

But we can learn from the tragedy that took him fromus. It should give us cause for radical re-appraisal ofourselves and our values, and of our claim to be a nationguided by the lofty teachings of the Buddha, and of thefounders of the other great religions. How could we justifysuch a claim when, all to often, the response to opposition,whether in politics or in private life, is a simple one :violence. It is quick, effective, and today, far lessexpensive. Besides, in the end, no one will hold you toaccount.

Is this culture of violence with impunity one thatsatisfies our individual or collective conscience? Is it theculture we want to bequeath to future generations in ourland? Is this to be a defining feature of Sri Lanka to therest of the world? I am confident that to everyone in thisHouse such thoughts are anathema, and that both sides ofthis House are united in their resolve to exorcise thesedemons of violence and impunity from our midst.

( )(Mr. Milinda Moragoda)Lakshman Kadirgamar has left us, but his passing haslessons for us that we would be foolish to ignore. In thewords of the Dhammapada, I quote :

And I close this brief message of condolence with averse from the same source. I quote :

For him who has finished his journey, who is detached inevery way and is free from sorrow, there is no burning in him bythe heat (of passions).

( )( () - ")(The Hon. (Mrs) Ferial Ismail Ashraff - Minister of Housingand Construction)

Mr. Presiding Member, It is indeed with a feeling of greatloss that I associate myself on the Condolence Vote movedon the death of Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar.

Sir, I cannot brag of having known Mr. Kadirgamar for along time or of a long association but I have to admit thatI value greatly the little I got to know of him and the littlequality time I had with him.

It was the year 2001, when I was new and nervous inParliament, in fact, new and nervous in politics. I remembernow with gratitude the encouragement and support I receivedfrom this great gentleman. I was instantly drawn to him morelike the student to the favourite teacher and from then onalways sought his views of guidance on all matters.

2006 11181182

He always had a kind word to say about my late husbandand used it to encourage me. The fond manner in whichhe referred to Ashraff and the manner in which he referredto his loss, his views of Ashraffs work and dreams were alsosome of the reasons why I was so fond of him. I found inhim a great teacher in Parliament.

Sir, I feel he stood on a lofty matchless pedestal, all hisown monarch of all that he surveyed.

I was also fortunate, Sir, to have accompanied HerExcellency former Madam President along with Hon.Lakshman Kadirgamar on two foreign tours to two of ourgreat neighbours. Here, I saw the esteem in which theforeigners held him. He was not only a remarkablepersonality at home in SriLanka but his talent andskills had extended far beyond. I also was a witness to hiswide - range of international friends and the respect he hadearned.

In all this, his greatness lay not merely in his professionalskills, acumen or statesmanship but in his humility,diligence and devotion to duty and the nation.

What struck me most in the life Hon. Kadirgamar washow much he strove to bring about a real and lastingunderstanding between the conflict ridden communities ofthis country. He held and rightly held that no real progresswas possible without such understanding. Within therestricted world he had to live in on account of securityconcerns he tried his best to read the pulse and the stirringsof the people by getting to know details from the peoplesrepresentatives he met in Parliament. I knew how troubledhe was by some of the information he received fromMembers of Parliament serving the North and the East. Hewould go into a long thinking process amidst suchdiscussions and I have seen some of their discussions to bemonologues while he was deeply engrossed in his thoughts.He was trying to find solutions, trying very hard and tryingto guide.

True greatness, it is said, does not consist in makingothers feel small. One feels elevated in the presence of thetruly great man. I saw this happen when he held suchdiscussions with Members of Parliament. Again I can sayfrom personal experience that one felt uplifted and inspiredin Mr. Kadirgamars presence.

Sir, another remarkable feature I saw in Mr. Kadirgamarwas how he kept perfect control over his sentiments. Hewas able to, I think, subordinate his feelings to a highercause and nobler principle. It is said to be a great thing towork with persons of doubtful loyalty and character in thelarger interest of your people and country and I think Mr.Lakshman Kadirgamar did just that. the world did not knowand may never know the wounds he had to suffer in private.He was, may be, too proud to exhibit them but, I think healso readily forgave.

In spite of all odds he pursued unwaveringly every nobleand pristine goal he set for himself and the country at large.He battled against the odds, triumphed and went onconquering every obstacle on the way. Talking of his self -confidence and self - possession one is reminded of theprefectlly modulated intonation in Mr. Kadirgamarsspeeches. Never did he allow a single loose word or phraseescape his lips. He never let himself get carried away byany wave of passion when he spoke. It was delightful tohear him addressing Parliament. Whenever Mr. Kadirgamarspoke there was a flutter I think in every camp, theyknew he meant business. He did not have the habit oftalking tall. He only said as much as he meant and as hecould possibly do. His speech was charming invigorating.In short he was the epitome of brilliance.

He has now paid the supreme price with his precious life inthe cause of the nation, in the cause of peace and in the causeof uplifting humanity and he must have anyway fulfilled thegreat mission which God entrusted to him. To me the loss isprofound and beyond words. On behalf of the National UnityAlliance I wish to associate myself and my Party with theVote of Condolence on Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar.

Mr. Presiding Member, may I also take this opportunity ofrequesting you in forwarding the sympathies of this augustAssembly to associate my own deep sympathies to Mrs.Sugandi Kadirgamar to his two children and to the othermembers of his family on the sorrow they have sustained.

As we pay homage to this intellectual colossus of our times,may I pray eternal bliss for him. Let the Nation have thestrength and courage to take forward Hon. LakshmanKadirgamars unfinished mission.

Thank you.

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)

Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is with profound sadness I risetoday to join in the Vote of Condolence of the lateMr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, Presidents Counsel, formerMinister of Foreign Affairs.

I had the unique privilege of knowing the late Mr. LakshmanKadirgamar as a lawyer initially. When I entered the legalprofession in 1976 he was one of the most admired seniors atthe Bar. We watched him as a lawyer who was composed andarticulate, who represented the client at the highest level interms of quality of representation that surpassed most at theBar. He had the recognition of his colleagues and that of theBench at whatever level he appeared, in whatever court heappeared.

He entered the international arena in the field of IntellectualProperty Law where he had the distinction of serving in oneof the most valued and august organizations in the world. Hewas attached to the United Nations as a career internationalcivil servant. And back at home, when he entered Parliamentin 1994 under Her Excellency the President, ChandrikaKumaratungas administration he had the distinction of being

195196

[ ]the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka. He made a lastingimpression as the Foreign Minister because he believed inwhat was right for Sri Lanka. He positioned Sri Lanka in theworld map as a country that has the distinction of servingmankind in the best way a democracy can afford and theinternational community can respect. Above all, heunderstood and handled confrontational issues in a mannerthat could result in a greater degree of dialogue andunderatanding amongst all people of our country. It is thatprocess that earned him the respect of all democratic partiesof this country, of all Members of Parliament who representpolitical segments and parties of this country and above all,the people of Sri Lanka.

He died in August 2005 having been subjected to one ofthe most brutal attacks an individual could receive in thehands of an assassin led by a terrorist group. It is on accountof his demise that we are gathered here once again to reflectupon the times and era of Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, ourvalued Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka.

During his period as Foreign Minister - Sri Lankas recordat times blemished due to the past events - he made everyeffort to restore Sri Lanka as a country that can be lookedupon favourably in relation to human rights through hispursuance of peace.

He served the Cabinet in a very composed manner withgreat depth and understanding. When I joined the Cabinet in2004, I had the privilege of seeing his contribution at ourCabinet Meetings. As a Cabinet Colleague I always lookedupon him for advice. I recall how the entire Cabinet wouldsometimes seek his advice on matters that confronted us. Henever was short of advice. He never rushed to give advice. Hewas not a verbose Speaker. He was always collected andcomposed. It was with a great degree of reflection that hespoke on issues. At the Cabinet when we sought his advice,he would always take time to reflect upon issues and comeout with the best advice that can be given to a Government,to a President of the country and to his Cabinet Colleagues.These are valued qualities of great people. That is why Irespect the late Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, our Colleague.

I have seen him in action both in the Government and inthe Opposition. When I came into Parliament in the year2000, I was in the Opposition and he was in the Government.

I recall some of the observations he made on the SecondReading of the Budget Debate, 2001. When we were speakingfrom the Government he was speaking from the Opposition,but he showed a great degree of understanding in dealingwith the issues that were confronting the government. Wevalued that contribution.

On the Budget that was presented in March 2001, just afterthe General Election of 2000, he spoke for the Governmentand I spoke for the Opposition. At that time, I recall when I

was contributing to the Debate on the Votes of the ForeignMinistry, he had the quality and the understanding to reflecton matters that we were trying to advocate. He respondedwell and he appreciated the contribution of the Opposition.He went on to commend and compliment the Members of theOpposition for their contributions. He was never short ofpraise and recognition that had to be extended to whateverlot, on whatever side of the House because he believed inwhat was right for the country. He did not gain anything forhimself. In fact, he adorned the office he held. The office ofthe Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka shone because Mr.Kadirgamar was the Foreign Minister. It is in that context,that he was recognized the world over.

I remember the time when I was the Minister of Industriesin January 2004, I had the privilege of representing theGovernment at the Republic Day of India celebrations inDelhi. The late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar came oninvitation from the Indian Government and we were seatedon the same receiving same row at the said parade. I canremember, the Deputy Prime Minister of the BJP Governmentof India at that time, Hon. Advani walking up to the late Hon.Lakshman Kadirgamar passing all the other VIPs anddignitaries from all other countries who were there, reachinghim and receiving him with such high esteem. At the time hewas only a Member of the Opposition, a Member ofParliament. But, he commanded respect at the highest levelirrespective of the position he held. That was reflectedthroughout his career. Having been an Oxbridge, he carriedhimself the world over with his past colleagues at OxfordUniversity in the UK shoulder to shoulder mixing well withthe highest of any land and with everybody as his equal. Henever, as I said earlier, thought he was superior to others. Hewas humble because he was full of understanding,compassion, wisdom and above all, a human being of thehighest standard. It is with sincerity of purpose that he lookedat the peace process of this country. It was confronting becausehe came from the Tamil Community of this country. He soughtto solve the issues confronting all communities andconfronting one another to live in this country as peace-loving people of Sri Lanka. It is his sincerity to the cause thatcarried the message for Sri Lanka right across all seas, alloceans and to all lands of the world. It is towards that end thathe contributed to the peace process seriously, because hebelieved that the quality of seriousness matters to retain theintegrity and the purpose and gives value to the purposesupported by all other elements which he carried throughwell. It is because of that he did not shift even in the face ofthreat. He believed peace for all people matters and that allSri Lankas must benefit from that process. It is with thatunderstanding he carried it through. That is why he earnedthe respect of the Opposition, of the Government and of twoPresidents; that of our former President, Mrs. ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga and our present President, HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.

2006 11197198

He was delighted to hear of the nomination of our Presidentas the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Alliance. Hereflected on that. He supported that. Today we miss him inthe administration of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Two days prior to the cruel death of the former Minister ofForeign Affairs we including the late Hon. LakshmanKadirgamar were all at Temple Trees at the preparatory stageof the Presidential Election. I could reflect and I could pictureeven now how he, casually mingled with all other Colleaguesand supporters gathered at Temple Trees at 8 oclock thatevening. And two days later at 11.30 in the night we werewoken up with the news of his demise in the hands of aterrorist assassin. We did our best to nail down the ones whowere responsible.

As part of the negotiating teams task, in the first roundof talks in February this year in Geneva, we placed thekilling of Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar, Foreign Minister ofSri Lanka at the negotiating table and pointed the fingerat the LTTE. We had to do that because we believed that itwas right and if we did not do that it would be hypocritical.That hypocrisy must stop and that is a lesson the late Mr.Lakshman Kadirgamar, Presidents Counsel, Foreign Ministerof Sri Lanka and our beloved colleague has taught us - Saywhat you believe in ; do what is right for the country as awhole ; never accommodate and compromise the interestsof the country. Countries have to go on. Kadirgamar paidthe price with his life for Sri Lanka to go forward. It is thatmessage as Members of Mahinda Rajapaksa administration,as his colleagues and as members of the Cabinet and thatof the Government we are taking forward.

His capabilities, as I said, his wisdom, his knowledgeon international affairs, on the legal systems, on intellectualproperty, were all surpassed by his sincerity to the causeand how he looked at matters and how he pursued his goals.He pursued the goals in the most collected and in the mostcomposed manner that is full in every respect.

I have the privilege of knowing Mrs. SugandhiKadirgamar who was a batch - mate of mine during my lawstudies.

I take this opportunity to convey my condolences alongwith Mrs. Bogollagama to Mrs. Kadirgamar, the son andthe daughter of late Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar and to theirfamilies.

Once again, I would like to say that we would alwaysremember our Friend, Colleague and the respected SriLankan, Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar for what he believed inand for all what he has done for Sri Lanka.

Thank you.
