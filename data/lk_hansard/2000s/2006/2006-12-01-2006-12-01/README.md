Aviod a power cut in those years.

The development and the installation of the power generation haveto be supported by the expansion and the development of the nationaltransmission grid. Accordingly several projects for the developmentof the transmission grid and the grid substations have been plannedand implemented. A brief summary of all projects underimplementation is as follows :

Power Sector Development Project : PART C : Transmmission

This project is packaged in to two lots. The Lot A scope of workconsists of construction of 63MVA 132/33kV Grid Substations atAmbalangoda, Pannala, Aniyakanda and complete augmentation ofDeniyaya Grid Substation to 63 MVA. Lot B consists of constructionof 44km of 132kV transmission lines and reconductoring of oneearth wire of 104km with OPGW. Project Cost is LKR 2970 Millionwhich is funded by ADB and CEB. Lot B tenders is already awardedand Lot A tender is expected to award in year future.

As per the projection of the CEB, the electricity demand in thecountry projects a growth between 7 to 8 per cent in the next decade.Due to rapid growth in some sectors of industry and the acceleratedefforts in a longer period of time.

The power demand and the load growth forecast for the comingdecade is shown below.

Source : Long Term Generation Expansion Plan

In order to meet the increase in the demand for electricity theCEB undertakes a regular planning cycle for optimizing theinvestments in the network, reducing the operation cost and minimizingthe tariff. The CEB prepares annually, the generation forecast forcoming 15 years, taking into consideration the development envisagedin the economy by the Government. This process results in a leastcost long term generation plan, a long term transmission developmentplan, and distribution plans which fit into the system as a whole.

LEARN FROM OTHER COUNTRIESi.Germany has imposed feed in law tariff so that the utility shouldbuy power from renewables at the cost assigned by thegovernment, and the top up tariff is paid by the government.Solar power should be paid a tariff as high as 40 US cents.Germany has a vision to have 40 per cent of its energy fromrenewable energy, predominantly from Wind power.

ii.Canada, Japan and US are doing research in an aggrasive mannerfor next generation electricity source, which is fuel celltechnology, so that each home can have a fuel cell as if they usegas cylinders. Further, Japan is the world leader in OTEC plantsand doing research on low cost and economical plants.

iii.Japan has also imposed compulsory purchase of electricity fromhouse hold solar systems, and government gives tax rebate forthose who have installed solar systems at home. It is a verycommon practice that newly built houses in Japan has a solarhome roof instead of tile or asbestose roofing which saves roofcost and qualify for government grants and soft loans. HenceJapan is the world leader in solar home systems and haveexceeded 400 MW of solar home installed capacity.

iv.China is the world leader in small hydro power and account for40,000 MW of small hydro power. Each county of china shouldpromote small hydro power on the county and should go forPPP (Public Private Partnership). Hence this policy has madeChina to achieve almost 98 per cent of electrification even ifChina has world largest population.

v.India has liberalized the electricity sector by restructuring in2003 to make a efficient management system. Since India is thebiggest democratic country, the implementation of projects andplans is much more difficult than Sri Lanka. In spite of that,India has recently launched an ambitious plan of having 100,000units of hydro power in non-electrified villages entirely fromGovernment grant, so that they operate as isolated mini gridswith its own electricity.

. . . , . 1987 . , 19 . . , , , . . . , . . , . We get a lot of unsolicited proposals. Then we go intoit, study them and then look for many different parties toerect our power stations or do whatever the job is.

But here what we have done is, we have been waitingwhile there were so many proposals. This should have beendone in a different manner. What we normally do is; wecall for tenders, international tenders and we get hold ofsomeone. This was done earlier, this could have been donemuch earlier and there would have been better companies.The Japanese were prepared to help us in building the powerstation. At that time we rejected this, that is our Government

and now we have come to a point of no return where wehave to accept something and we have accepted it. Now Iunderstand that the Electricity Board did not totally agreewith the specifications and the other different things thatyou have to agree before you sign an MoU. We have nowsigned the MoU. I do not think the Hon. Minister has signedthe contract with the Chinese party or may be you aresigning soon.

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

As far as the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is concernedthe MoU was signed between the Chinese EXIM Bank andthe GM, CEB. So the CEB cannot say that CEB is not awareor did not approve it. I should say that this MoU was signedby the GM on behalf of the Government.

. ( )(The Hon. P. Dayaratna)

Anyway what has happened is, accepting unsolicitedoffers have become the order of the day. This is what isreally happening. I was there for eight years and I do notthink a single contract or a single development programmewas accepted that way with proposal coming from all overthe world. But we always called for tenders and gave it tothe best party who could do the job.

. . . ( )( [ - , )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne - Minister of Power and Energy)Hon. Member, may I explain this to you? In order toprovide electricity to Jaffna we are paying Rs. 22 a unit,whereas we are only paying Rs. 10 a unit to provideelectricity to the south. We are paying Rs.22 a unit in orderto provide electricity to you. Your allegation is that we arenot providing you sufficient facilities in the power sector,but I would say that it has become necessary for us toconstruct a transmission line from Kilinochchi to Jaffna. Butwe are unable to do it because the area is mined.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)No, no it is not mined. Actually if that -

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)We cannot do it at the risk of the lives of our officers.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Okay, Sir. If the Government stops -

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)I just want to tell you as to who is responsible for the lapsesin the power sector in Jaffna.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Sir, during the time the Ceasefire Agreement was inoperation, ask them how much work they have done in Jaffna.Now the war has started -

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)How can we do it? The Transmission lines cannot beconstructed because the area is mined. So the officers and theworkers cannot go there.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)No, do not say that the area is mined. Actually now there isno ceaefire and the Government is going ahead with the waragenda. That is the main reason why you could not do it.Your officers are also saying the same thing. From Vavuniyato Kilinochchi you can do it. From Kilinochchi to Jaffna isthe problem. You started from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi, butyou could not do it. You have the money. Japan has givenyou the money. But you could not start the work because -[Interruption.] Please, do not distrub me.

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)To transmit power from Kilinochchi to Jaffna, there shouldbe transmission lines.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Sir, forget that. Why can you not give electricity for 24hours of the day to jaffna?

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)We are making all efforts to give you electricity for 24hours of the day.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Why can you not give it for 24 hours of the day?

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)The only way of giving electricity for 24 hours of the dayto Jaffna is to transmit the electricity from Vavuniya orAnuradhapura. But we are unable to do it because we cannotconstruct the transmission lines as the area is mined.

2006 0123672368

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)No, no please, listen to me. During the time the CeasefireAgreement was in operation we were given electricity for 24hours of the day. Now you are sending the fuel by ship, notby road. That is your main problem. You do not want to openthe road. If you open the road you can send 20 to 30 tankersper day and you can give electricity for 24 hours of the day.But you do not want to open the road. That is the mainproblem Not only that but all the development work in Jaffnahas been stopped. From the DCB we have given money tostart some work and even that has been stopped. Everythinghas been stopped. But if we ask the Government, they willsay, Look, we are sending enough food to Jaffna, and thatis it. They will say Enough food to Jaffna but the Food sentbeing not enough is a different matter. But what can we doabout the electricity? You, as a responsible Minister, pleasetell your President that this is not the way to operate. If youopen the road only, you can sent the fuel.

( )(The Chairman)Hon. Member, your time is over.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)One moment, Sir, I will wind up.

( )(The Chairman)Your Colleague has only five minutes left.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Sir, the Hon. Minister interrupted me for about four minutes.

( )(The Chairman)It is including that. It is a clarification.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)So, I am requesting the Hon. Minister, please open theroad. So that it will be easy for you to send fuel and you cangive electricity. Otherwise however much money you have,you are unanle to do anything. , , + -9 , , , +

+ ++ + + +

( )(The Chairman)Thank you. .

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)You are not concerned about our people, Sir. There is noelectricity at all. You are not concerned about the Tamils.-[Interruption.]

( )(The Chairman)Hon. Suresh Premachandran, you have completed yourspeech. Will you take your seat? -[Interruption.] .

. . . ( [ )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)Hon. Member, there is nothing like that in the areas withinthe Northen province. I should say that there is a projectcalled CAARP which is operating in the area.I believe, your electricity needs are being fulfilled by thatand beside that I should say that in order to enhance thequality of the electricity that is being provided, it hasbecome necessary for us to set up certain transmission lines,one from Talaimannar to Anuradhapura and one fromKilinochchi to Jaffna. But, we are not being able to do it

2006 0123792380

because these areas are said to be mined and our officersare unable go and work there because of the danger that isprevalent there. That is the reason as to why we have notbeen able to uplift the quality of the electricity in the area.

Dear Dr. Senaratne,

Thank you for addressing the World Federation for MedicalEducation (WFME) regarding the standard document developed bythe Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition.

We found your information very interesting and it will be aprivilege to assist you in this important endeavour.

We understand that these standards will be used only forrecognition of foreign medical schools and we are curious to knowhow they differ from standards to be used in evaluation of Sri Lankanmedical schools.

, . , . , . , Dr. Hans Karle .

.

We indirectly understand that you want our comments regardingconsistency of these standards with the WFME Global Standard inBasic Medical Education. A quick overview shows that in generalthere are many similarities, but also areas where your requirementsexceed what many medical schools would be able to fulfill.

We would be happy to do the evaluation more thoroughly. Thisraises two questions. what would be the deadline for our detailedresponse, and do you have any budget for a detailed consultatoryprocess?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

I further quote:

Dear Mr. Senaratne,

Thank you for your mail describing in more detail thebackground for setting up standards for recognition of foreignmedical qualifications.

As already mentioned in my previous letter, we are certainlyready to assist you. I have now asked one of my advisers to lookover the draft standard document, and I expect that we can designa concrete plan within a week from now. We will probably needabout a month to finalise a report benchmarking your draft set ofstandards with WFME International standards.

We consider this service as a WFME activity within our Projecton Promotion of Accreditation. You can find more information aboutthis project on our website (www.wfme.org). In accordance withthe working conditions of WFME, we expect that we will need tocharge you a small honorarium for our service.

We do not know why this has happened.So, I am asking the Hon. Minister to give us at least somejustifiable reason for that. It is impossible to find anotherdonor at this stage, two years after the tsunami, to carry outall these activities. They are functioning in rented buildings.That also has to be considered. This is very unusual,unjustifiable and unreasonable two and a half years after thetsunami destruction in that area. We understand that theUNFPA initially signed an MoU for four MOH offices and forproviding equipment also. Agencies undertake projects andwithdraw at a later stage, resulting in a loss of donors for theprojects, no reconstruction work being carried out andsuffering for the public. These are the end results or theconsequences of all these actions.

Another point which I wish to raise is, one officer is co-ordinating all the activities of the hospitals of the AmparaDistrict. That person is the one who decides on where to sendthe equipment, where to give health facilities and whatfacilities have to be provided to the hospitals. That officer isdiscriminating against the people. Some hospitals are givenfacilities; some hospitals are not. So, I really want to requestthe Hon. Minister to appoint another co-ordinator, may be aMuslim or a Sinhala person, to give all the equipmentnecessary for the hospitals in the area. Because of lack ofequipment and other facilities, these hospitals are not reallyup to the standard to provide health facilites to the people.So, most of the people go to the Batticaloa Hospital and theyface difficulties on their way because almost everyday thereare porblems in that area.

One other matter is, we heard that there are somediscrepancies in the appointment of minor employees to thehospitals in that area. There were volunteers. They have morethan ten years experience in that field. They were allvolunteers in various hospitals, but those people wereoverlooked and some other people have been appointed.They have never gone to hospitals or worked as volunteers.This is happening because of some corrupt officials. Theyare taking money from the people, giving appointments. Hon.Minister, they are really an insult to the Department of Health.

Hon. Member, your time is over. You have to wind upnow.

. ( )(The Hon. S. Nijamudeen)

Give me one more minute, please. I will wind up. So, Hon.Minister, please, look into all these matters and help thepeople in that area. After the destruction by the tsunami, thepeople are really suffering health-wise. So, people help us tobuild all the hospitals which were destroyed by the tsunamiin that area.

Thank you very much.

Further to the submissions made by both our Friends, theHon. Members of Parliament, it was pointed out that 4 percent is deducted for administration. An amount of Rs. 200,000is already deducted. A further amount of Rs. 690,000 I donot know whether our Hon. Members of Parliament are awareof it is deducted for VAT. Fifty per cent is deducted for VATeverywhere. Out Members of Parliament do not realize that ifthey allocate Rs. 100,000 for a cultural programme, Rs. 15,000is deducted at the DS level. According to the circular that wereceived finally, the maximum amount granted is only Rs.250,000 and out of that, if you allocate Rs. 100,000 for someschool development there is a deduction of Rs. 15,000. So atth end of the day, you are loosing Rs. 690,000 from the totalamount of Rs. 4,800,000 because already Rs. 200,000 isdeducted for administrative purposes, as our Hon. Memberspecified.

I regret that none of the Ministers involved in this are here.There are two Ministers involved in this. The first one is, theHon. Keheliya Rambukwella, Minister of Policy Developmentand Implementation, the other one is the Hon. JagathPushpakumara, Minister of Rural Livelihood andDevelopment. One Ministry gives the guidelines and theother Ministry approves it and the finances come from there.When the Hon. S. B. Navinna was there, I pointed out to himabout the VAT problem. Then, he instructed not to deductVAT in my district, the Ampara District. But I hear that they

are going to practise this again. For what purpose? VAT ispaid by registered organizations. Either a businessorganization, contractors or anybody who has a registeredorganization has to pay VAT, so that under their project, theycan show 15 per cent and deduct. But of course for even Rs.50,000 or even Rs. 25,000 allocated for some purposes theydeduct Rs. 15,000 and we do not know what they do withthis money.

Therefore, I draw the attention of the Deputy Minister ofFinance to take this into consideration and take necessaryaction to avoid this.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Thank you. Hon. Member. We have to invite the DeputyMinister of Finance and Plannig to reply.
