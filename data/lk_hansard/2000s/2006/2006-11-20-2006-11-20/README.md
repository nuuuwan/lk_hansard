- 9 : - 9 [ : TRANSPORT OF ESSENTIAL GOODS TO JAFFNATHROUGH A - 9 ROAD : STATEMENT BY MINISTEROF HEALTHCARE AND NUTRITION AND LEADER OFTHE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT

( , )( - "" )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Healthcare,Nutrition and Leader of the House of Parliament)Hon. Speaker, His Excellency the President has directedrelevant government authorities spearheaded by theCommissioner General of Essential Services to take allpossible steps to ensure adequate supplies of food andother goods for the use of civilians in the Jaffna peninsula.Since A - 9 could not be used for transport of goods toJaffna due to the prevailing security situation, theGovernment has been using sea transport for transport ofessential food items as well as fuel. The Government hasmaintained a steady supply of goods of Jaffna, despiteinclement weather, threats to private traders to close shopsand attacks on ships carrying humanitarian goods andpeople. All these have led to scarcities of certaincommodities available to the people of Jaffna.

Having reviewed the situation, and having consideredrepresentations made by religious community andpeoples representatives and as inclement weather is likelyto continue in the next few weeks, His Excellency thePresident has directed government authorities to makearrangements for the transport of essential goods to Jaffnaby road using the A - 9, as a one time measure. Soon, alarge convoy of lorries will take essential commodities toJaffna. The Government will request independentorganizations to facilitate the movement of the convoy of

543544

[ ]lorries through the checkpoints at Omanthai andMuhamalai. Lorries transporting goods to Jaffna will besealed and once the lorries reach Jaffna, seals will beopened in the presence of representatives of civilian andreligious organizations and Government authorities, Allrelevant partries will be requested to ensure safe passageof these lorries carrying humanitarian goods. Distributionof these transported goods will also be observed bypeoples organizations.

In order to ensure that a satisfactory buffer stock ofgoods and other essential commodities is maintained inJaffna under the supervision of the Government Agent/District Secretary of Jaffna, a large fleet of lorries willhave to transport adequate supplies to Jaffna. These lorrieswill have to be made available to the CGES as early aspossible. Therefore, a public appeal is hereby made to allthose who could provide lorries for this purpose to makethem available to the office of the CGES through telephoneoffers.

International humznitarian organizations too arerequested to offer their assistance to the supply ofhumanitarian goods to the Jaffna Peninsula so thatsufficient buffer stocks of all items necessary for peopleof Jaffna could be ensured. Whilst this will help meet theneeds of the people it will also build confidence amongthe people.

, . inquiries . What I have to say on behalfof the Government is, it is not appropriate at this stage tomake a statement in Parliament with regard to the ipendinginvestigations of the killing of the Hon. Member ofParliament because it might jeopardize the pendinginquiries. The moment we get a breakthrough and whenthe Government considers it appropriate as soon aspossible, we will divulge the results of the investigations.

Thank You, Mr. Speaker.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Sir, may I be given an opportunity to make a fewcomments on the statements made by the Hon. Leader ofthe House ?

Firstly Sir, in regard to the opening of the A-9 highwayfor the limited purpose of sending some goods once througha special convoy that will be organized for the purpose,I think, I must point out that the Government is announcingthis decision on the eve of the Co-Chairs meeting inWashington which is due to take place today. But, the factof the matter is that the people in the Jaffna Peninsula havebeen starving for the past several weeks and have beenundergoing immense human suffering. That the Governmenthas got to make this announcement only on the eve of theCo-Chairs meeting in Washington, I consider to be veryvery disappointing. I would have expected the Governmentto have made such arrangements much earlier.I want further state that sending just one supply of goodsto Jaffna is not going to solve the problems of the people

2006 20545546

of Jaffna. There must be a regular supply of goods to Jaffnaparticularly food items, medicines and other essentials toenable the people of Jaffna to live with self-respect andwith dignity devoid of unnecessary human suffering.

In regard to the assassination of the Hon. Raviraj, I heardthe Hon. Minister say that when there is a breakthroughthey will make an announcement. I did not want the Hon.Minister to make a statement in this House in regard toevery aspect of the investigation pertaining to Hon. Ravirajskilling. That was not my purpose. Our experience has beenthat there has been never any breakthrough in regard toany case ever since this Government came into power,whether it be Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham orMr. Sivamaharajah in Jaffna and several other persons whohave been killed thereafter, journalists, politicians, humanrights activists, priests and members of the clergy. We havethe gravest doubt as to whether there will be a breakthroughin regard to Hon. Ravirajs killing. That is why, Sir, I raisedthe matter in the House and expected the Government to atleast make a statement not disclosing the details of theinvestigations but at least to keep this House informed, thecountry informed and the family of Mr. Raviraj, his youngwidow and his young children informed that the Governmentis serious in pursuing the investigations properly in regardto that terrible assassination because it is now appearingthat certain political sources close to the Government hada hand in that murder and therefore, we cannot let thingsbe swept under the carpet and we are not too sure at allthat there will be any breakthrough.

I would like the Hon. Minister to please remember that,to please convey that to His Excellency the President andto the Government and we would like a statement made inthis House at least the broad outlines, not the details of theinvestigations, but the broad outlines of the investigationto convince us that the Government is seriously pursuingan investigation into this terrible awful killing.

The other matter is, Sir, that despite the assurances madeby Government on the Floor of the House on Saturday thateight lorries of food had left the Batticaloa Kachcheri andwere on their way to Vakarai and Kadiraveli, once again atthe Mankerny checkpoint those lorries were sent back bythe armed forces and I have given notice of an AdjournmentMotion in that regard. In fact I have just sent an urgent letterto His Excellency the President and I request that theAdjournment Motion be taken up today. If it cannot betaken up today for some reason, I would request that it betaken up for debate in the House at least tomorrow.

Thank you, Sir.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

Sir, with regard to the issues raised by the Hon.Sampanthan, the Adjournment Motion could be debatedtomorrow because then the Government will also haveadequate time to find the veracity of the facts stated therein.

With regard to the breakthroughs, I must say that evenwith regard to Hon. Kadirgamars killing there had not beena sufficient breakthrough. So, it is a common factor here.Therefore, the Government is in contact with the ScotlandYard and we are taking all necessary measures to ensurethat there is a breakthrough. We too need to investigate intothe killers of Mr. Raviraj. The Government will not try tosweep it under the carpet. I can assure you Hon. Member ofParliament that the Government will take every endeavourto ensure that the investigations are properly done andwhoever who has done this will be brought tobook, Sir.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I am thankful to the Hon. Minister, Sir. I do not want toget into a confrontation with him. But, I would respectfullysay that we would like a demonstration of your trueintentions not merely by word, but by deed. That is whatI expect.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)Hon. Speaker, I have spoken to the defence authorities,the Secretary, Ministry of Defence and we will be, inconsultation with you, sending a team of Parliamentariansto Jaffna to see about the unloading of these foodstuff,how it is being distributed and the various obstacles facedby the armed forces and other people. So, we will be sendinga group of Parliamentarians to monitor that activity. Wehave nothing to hide in this matter.

The other thing is with regard to the opening of the A-9.At least, let us start with one opening, one convoy. Let itgo. Thereafter, we will see how the people co-operate. Wehave always said that the A-9 closure is only a temporaryclosure. If the security situation gets better and if the partiesbehave well, we can keep the A-9 continuously open . But,the parties should behave well; the LTTE should behavewell. That has been the criteria which we have setthroughout.

Thank you.

I appreciate the sentiments expressed by you, Sir. ButI would only like to earnestly request you and the Houseto remember that the people we represent in this House aresuffering and suffering immensely and they are sufferingonly for the reason that they are Taimls. That is the onlyreason why they are suffering and that is not something thatwe can accept, not under any circumstances.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Mr. Speaker, we actually understand your unhappiness overwhat happened on Saturday. But at the same time, Sir, on thesame day, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopullae, a responsibleMinister of the Government promised us that they will besending eight lorries to Vakarai and that they will be reaching

[ . ]Vakarai on the same day. They were trying to convince usagain and again and asked us to stop the protest. Why weprotested was because there was starvation in Vakarai. Formore than three weeks not a single lorry has been sent toVakarai. That is why we, the Tamil representatives,portested here.

Sir, that was on Saturday, yesterday was Sunday and todaywe are on Monday. Till today not a single lorry has been sentto Vakarai. So how can we, Sir, trust these responsible Ministerswhen they say on the Floor of the House to the representativesof the Tamil people, Look, we are sending it today. And,you asked us to stop the protest but nothing has happened.So how can we believe the Government Ministersd or thepresident or whoever it may be? They can simply blame theLTTE. They may say that the LTTE is shelling. But actuallythat is not the fact, Sir, because the ICRC accompanied thelorries and you can get the information from the ICRC. TheAdditional GA and the Divisional Secretaries alsoaccompanied the lorries. You can find out from them whathappened over there. Actually these are the problems. TheGovernment is playing with the people who are starving Thechildren are starving. The women are starving. They do nothave food to eat. So you have to understand the gravity ofthe situation. Because of that, we were in panic and protested.

The proportion of popula-tion below the national poverty line in 1990 was 26 per cent,in 2002, 22per cent and in 2015, the target is 13 per cent. .Then under Poverty by Province Rural Poverty, it states,I quote:

2006 20565566

The Western and Southern Provinces are the most urbanisedand have the lowest poverty levels. Conversely, the Uva and NorthWestern Provinces are the least urbanised but have the highest povertylevel.

, . :It is seen.....that poverty has declined sharply in the Colombodistrict, increased in Monaragala, Badulla, Ratnapura and Kegalledistricts and has remained the same level in the Hambantota district.

......increased sharply in Puttalam district disparitics in the NorthWestern Province.

This further states, I quote:

These sectoral district data conceal intra-distrities, as in the caseof Colombo district with its low income shanty neighbourhood inthe city of Colombo.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . .

( () )(The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa)Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to speakon the Budget 2007, presented by His Excellency thePresident and Minister of Finance and Planning on the 16thof this month.

At the outset, I wish to congratulate His Excellency thePresident and the Government as the Budget is formulatedon policies based on the Mahinda Chintana which focusesspecial attention on agricultural and rural development,infrastructure, social welfare and economic growth. It is apeoples Budget which seeks to spur economic developmentand achieve the Millennium Development Goals asenvisioned in A Ten Year Horizon Development Framework2006-2-16. It is a blueprint for economic and social changeand proposes to eradicate poverty through economicempowerment.

Unlike in the past decades, a novel approach had beenmade in the preparation of this Budget: in that, peoplesparticipation had been ensured. The Government had giventhe opportunity to the people, the trade unions, politicalparties, the trade chambers and others to forward suitableproposals. The Presidents gesture in accommodating over700 of these proposals is an indication that the Governmenthad deviated from the previous practices and had adopteda participatory approach in the preparation of the BudgetProposals.

The Budget Proposals, while reflecting the economicpolicies based on the Mahinda Chintana , aspires to bringsocial justice and economic progress to all sections of societyby bringing into play sound macroeconomic policies. The Mahinda Chintana is a vision towards a new Sri Lankaand is a home - grown concept which seeks to empowerourselves through our own initiatives built on our ownstrength.

Development is a process and cannot be achievedovernight. Hence, the Budget has been prepared with aforward vision for ten years taking into account variousfactors, especially the increase in population, which isexpected to be around 22 million by 2015 and the labourforce which will be about 10.9 million. This is a step inthe right direction.

The economic policies of the Governments of the pasttwo and a half decades had contributed only to an averagegrowth rate of about 5 per cent annual GDP. But the benefitsof the growth had not filtered to many segments of thepopulation. There had been only limited entrepreneurship

development. But the present Budget has been preparedaddressing the issues, challenges, limitations and weaknessesof the previous polices, which will enhance growth rateswith equitable development in the country and with specialextensions to the regions lagging. Hitherto developmenthad been concentrated and limited mainly to the WesternProvince. This Budget seeks to develop the entire country.

Before dwelling on the Budget Proposals for 2007,I presume that a glimpse of our past performances wouldreveal how relevant the present Budget is to steer us towardsa development era.

Sri Lanka had to face several challenges internally andexternally, which had big impacts on our economic growth.The continued unstable political situation in the North andthe East the oil shocks and the adjustments towards globalcompetition, sepecially in the area of the apparel industryin the post - Multi Fiber Agreement transition were someof the major constraints Sri Lanka faced.

However, the Government was able to reduce the priceof petrol and diesel by Rs 7 and Rs. 9 per litre subsequentlydue to downward trends in international oil prices. But inspite of these limitations, a 7 per cent economic growth hadbeen achieved thie year, demonstrating quick resilience.This is creditable as it has been achieved after a period of28 years from 1978. The growth had been mainly in thespheres of agriculture, livestock, fisheries, manufacturing,construction and a host of service activities.

The manufacturing sector too has generated a 6 per centgrowth. Our exports are around US $ Dollars 5,000 milliona year. Our main exports are still tea and garments. TheGovernment is giving incentives and creating foreignplatforms for our exporters to market their products. theexports have increased by 9 per cent. The total exports thisyear are expected to reach US Dollars 6.9 billion. Theservices sector too had grown over 6 per cent.

An analysis of the Budget Proposals reveal that theGovernment had laid heavy emphasis on infrastructuredevelopment, without which economic resurgence wouldnot be feasible. In this respect, the Governments megainfrastructure initiative called Randora has been accordedpriority. This programme seeks to implement the Puttalamcoal power plant, the Trincomalee coal power plant, theKerawelapitya power plant and related infrastructure totransform all fuel- based plants to generate LNG - basedpower. Other major projects lined up under this special effortare the early completion of the four - lane SouthernExpressway, the expansion of the Colombo Ports capacity,the construction of a new port, the second internationalairport at Weerawila and an international convention centre.The Government has also committed itself to building aNorthern expressway and several other main roads andbridges in districts in the North and the East. Consequently,Trincomalee will emerge as an important and strategic

2006 20601602

investment and tourism zone. The Government is alsoactively pursuing the reconstruction of the Tsunami -affected coastal highway from Katukurunda to Pottuvil andseveral highways to connect major townships. All theseactivities would create additional employmentopportunities, raise the income levels of the people in therespective areas and create business opportunities in severalsectors. The development of a second international airportin the south will solve many problems. The South is famousas a tourist attraction. The second international airport willattract tourists in large numbers to the South. It will alsofunction as an alternate airport in Sri Lanka as there is onlyone international airport at present. This clearly demonstratesthat the Governments policies are not short-term, but gearedto develop the entire country over a period of ten years,which is necessary if we are to face a competitive world.

It is to be noted at this juncture that the MahindaChintana, which was placed before the people at thePresidential Election, 2005, spelt out the policies andprogrammes of the UPFA Government to wards building adisciplined society, an affectionate family, to provideemployment both local and foreign and also to strengthenthe Samurdhi programme to enhance the empowerment ofthe people for effective eradication of poverty. Consequently,the proposals in the vision are being implemented by theconcerned Government Ministries and Departmentsprogressively.

In this respect, top priority has been given by theGovernment for rural infrastructure developmentprogrammes such as Maga Neguma , Dahasak MahaWew, new irrigation schemes and electrificationprogrammes. So far, the Government has spent Rs. 12,000million, which is the highest ever for rural infrastructure.The Governments biggest contribution by way ofexpenditure so far benefiting mainly the farmers and therural folk engaged in livelihood, agricultural productionhad been the fertilizer subsidy of Rs. 11,000 million andpaddy purchases of Rs. 2,900 million. Besides this, theGovernment has also given a subsidy of Rs. 8,000 millionto pharmaceuticals and assistance to school children worthRs. 3,600 million. These programmes directly help thefarmers and the average citizen of the country, which hadbeen a long felt need to stimulate production and reducepoverty and unemployment.

Poverty in Sri Lanka is a multidimensional phenomenon.The poverty ratio at national level stands at 23 per cent interms of the poverty headcount. This means that about threeto five million people are affected.

The post-tsunami construction activities had beenpursued with 62,000 houses having been completed andabout 43,000 still under construction. The total expenditurefor post-tsunami activities accounted to Rs. 9,200 million.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the economicpolicies adopted by the Government for the last three yearshave begun to bear beneficial results. The agricultural sector

has brought encouraging results. The local rice productionhas begun to exceed the domestic demand. Export of ricewill be a possibility soon if only we could improve itsquality and make the cost of production competitive.

The unemployment rate has come down to an alltimelow of 6.5 per cent. No government has achieved this rateso far. This is due to the fact that the Government hasprovided employment in the public sector and has promotedthe private sector which controls 90 per cent of the jobmarket. More than 3,000 graduates have been foundemployment in the public sector. Another 8,000 vacantpositions have been identified and the Governmentproposes to give area specified appointments in 2007.

The Government has also taken steps to train skilledpersonnel for foreign employment, which means that SriLankans will get better salaries in the foreign job marketin the range of Rs. 50,000 -that is, US Dollars 500 withinthe next three years. As a preliminary step, the minimumstipulated salary for employment abroad next year will befixed at Rs. 25,000 that is, US Dollars 250. The Governmentalso had to take a series of other measures.

Foreign investment is essential for development of thiscountry. Several measures have been undertaken by the BOIto attract foreign investment. Sri Lanka missions are beingrestructured and strengthened to promote investment, trade,foreign employment and other economic activities.Consequently, foreign investment is likely to exceed USDollars 600 million this year. Our tourist potentials areimmense. The tourism industry is being developed givingadequate opportunities to the regions and with peoplesparticipation. Tourism earnings are expected to exceed USDollars 400 million.

The Budget contains a series of proposals which wouldultimately benefit all sections of society. One of the mostimportant proposals is the Krushi Navodaya programmewhich will empower the small farmers by providing accessto agricultural inputs at an affordable cost. About 50,000farmer families per year are targeted to benefit. Small farmerswill be entitled to loan amounts ranging from Rs. 10,000to Rs. 100,000.

Exemptions have been made from VAT on heavy fuel oil,furnace oil and electricity to regain competitiveness, whichis lost fast due to high tariff.

Duty and VAT are exempted on replacement of buses byoperators who already have a route permit. This will enablean improved bus service to the public. VAT and the Customsduty will be exempted on machinery imported formodernization of tea, rubber and coconut processingfactories.

The VAT rate on the supply of jewellery is proposed tobe reduced to 5 per cent. The VAT on high -tech medicalequipment has been reduced to 5 per cent. The VAT on the

603604

[ ]supply of prawns will be exempted to benefit the largenumber of small farmers engaged in prawn farming. The VATand the duty on importation of cattle, buffaloes, goats andother animals will be exempted to boost livestock farming.The Government has proposed to encourage the Small andMedium Enterprises sector which could be described as thebackbone of out industrial production. Rs. 13,295 millionis to be allocated at a concessionary rate of interest for ahost of Small and Medium Enterprises.

The Government has also proposed to reduce theEconomic Service charges in respect of all textiles, apparelmanufacturers and trading houses to 0.1 per cent in orderto boost Sri Lankas apparel industry and exports would reachUS Dollars 5 billion by 2010.

The VAT and the Import Duty will be exempted on allmaterial imported for processing and related industries toenable the leather industry to enter the global market. TheGovernment has also proposed to revive 30 to 40 closedfactories and provide about 10,000 job opportunities.

Another important facilitation to benefit the averagecitizen is that the Government has purposed to reduce thenormal passport fee to Rs. 2,500 which will be a big boonto rural youth seeking foreign employment.

Special attention has been made in the Budget for estatecommunity welfare. Rice flour is to be distributed to theestate community at a subsidized rate which is a long-feltneed for the plantation workers, due to the rise in the priceof wheat flour. All health centres in the estate sector willbe upgraded and roads and housing will be improved andexpanded in 2007.

The Budget for 2007 which is designed on MahindaChintana with a vision for ten years is well-timed. TheMahinda Chintana is an alternative development strategymainly formulated due to the failures of certain policiesfollowed during the last 30 years. It is a development -oriented Budget and will sustain an 8 per cent annual growthover the next ten years and raise the income of our peopleto around US Dollars 3,000 per capita level.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, before I concludeit is appropriate and necessary to reiterate that peace prevailsin Sri Lanka. It is a pre-requisite for economic growth anddevelopment. The Government has pursued all steps to bringabout a negotiated settlement for lasting peace, bystrengthening the Cease-fire Agreement and building ofconsensus among all parties involved.

The Government continued efforts through the All PartyConference and Geneva Talks II are commendable. Anothermajor recent political development of great historicalimportance was the attempt to build in the South aconsensus with the United National Party which concluded

with the signing of an MoU. This move has been acclaimedas a step in the right direction both locally and by theinternational community. This attempt is a new politicalculture to produce a national agenda on the major issuesof the day.

At this juncture I hope that the people and the politicalparties in the country will strengthen the hand of HisExcellency the President and the Government to solve thelong-drawn out North-East conflict and usher in aprosperous era.

Thank you.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thank the Almighty for theopportunity given to me to speak on the second Budget ofHis Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. We arediscussing today a genuine Mahinda Darshana Budget ofthe Mahinda Rajapaksa Government. The Budget presentedin 2005, was immediately after his election as the fifthPresident of Sri Lanka having taken his oath on 19th

November, 2005. The framework for the last Budget hadalready been set and its contents decided when the Presidentwas elected. The revolutionary Mahinda Chintana, onwhich the masses of the country voted for PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa could not be fully incorporated in the2005 Budget, though some features were included therein.This is why I say that the Budget presented today is thefirst Budget of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government. Itincorporates fully the ideas of Mahinda Chintana andexplains how the relevant programmes will be funded.

In this Budget, the expenditure for the fiscal year 2007is projected at Rs. 835 billion. A break-up of this expenditureshows that recurrent expenses are Rs. 596 billion and afurther Rs. 200 billion will be spent on salaries and wagesof Public sector employees. These two components alonecome to Rs.796 billion of the public expenditure of Rs. 835

billion. As against this expenditure, the total tax revenueis projected at Rs. 541 billion, in which the Goods andServices Tax alone is Rs. 368 billion. That is almost 70per cent of our revenue which is derived from goods andservices which are directly consumed by the people. Sinceabout 30 per cent of our people are living below the povertyline, these poor people are the greatest contributors to ournational revenue. Despite this, there is a Rs. 300 billionshortfall to meet our expenditure budget of Rs. 835 billion.This is almost 30 per cent of our expenditure.

There are a number of ways of filling this gap and all ofthem were fully explained in the Budget. The first is toreduce expenditure and thereby lessen this Budget deficit.Procurement in the food, pharmaceutical and fertilizersectors alone come to Rs.300 billion. A 10 per centreduction in cost is quite possible. It will give a reductionin cost by Rs. 30 billion. This step is proposed in theBudget. As I have already mentioned, the allocation onthe Public sector is almost Rs. 800 million of the recurrentexpenditure of the Budget. Productivity increase is onepromising way of covering the Budget deficit.

Sri Lankas Public sector productivity is one of the lowestin South Asia and is lower than even Bangladesh.A concentrated productivity drive of 10 per cent wouldeasily get a Rs. 80 billion benefit. We have a nationalproductivity centre assisted by Japan. The proposal toincrease productivity has been made in the Budget. It issuggested that the skills of the Public sector productivitydrive be successfully initiated. Reduction in procurementcosts and increases in Public sector productivity would cometo a total of Rs. 110 billion. It will significantly reducethe revenue gap of Rs.300 billion by one-third. This willbe done by the proposed Presidential Task Force on NationalProductivity Improvement.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, economic activity in a country isa very complex process and many variables interact oftenin an unexpected manner. The Budget makes an effort toprovide a summary of these complicated economicinteractions. In this Budget, Mahinda Chintana has beenused as the framework within which those variables aremanaged, controlled and directed in desirable directionsfulfilling the aspirations of the people.

The Mahinda Chintana has seven programmes:development of a caring society, a communityempowerment initiative, national infrastructuredevelopment initiative, decentralized decision-making,partnership development, a strong domestic economy andstability. These seven programmes are illustrated in theBudget that has been presented.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Minister, we are running out of time. If you wantyou can table the rest of the speech.

Yes, Sir, I will table* it. I will speak a few words inTamil now.

* : : Rest of the speech tabled:

A Budget is only a one-year operational plan. It is a skeleton forimmediate action, but there should be a long-term perspective. We areall thankful to the President for providing a long-term perspective. Amedium-term budgetary perspective is provided covering the years2006-2009. At the end of this period, the per capita income of USDollars 1187 in 2006 will be increased to US Dollars 1920, a sizableleap indeed. This medium-term perspective does not concentrate onlyon increasing income which can benefit only the richer sections of oursociety. It is in line with the expectations of the Mahinda Chintanaand each of the themes laid out in the Budget. By increasing the growthrate up to levels seen in India and China poverty can be eased

* . Produced at end of speech.

Special attention has to be given to the fisheries sector which is veryimportant in my area. Fishermen will be given credit, housing andinfrastructure facilities. At the end of the programme, poverty wouldbe significantaly reduced and employment would be created in therural sector. We should try to achieve each of the United NationsMillennium goals.

As appropriate to a country where 70 per cent of the population livein rural areas, the Mahinda Chintana has emphasized the revitalizationof the rural sector. Five main themes have been selected. They are,roads, electricity, irrigation, water and housing and livelihooddevelopment. All these five will form the overall national infrastructureprogramme. As a Member of Parliament from the rural and poorlydeveloped district of Trincomalee, I would say the national infrastructuredevelopment programme is of deep interest. These projects areimplemented under Maga Neguma, Jathika Saviya, rural electrification,livestock development, community water supply, the 1000 irrigationscheme, womens development, North and East housing, tsunamihousing, decentralized budget, village upliftment, provincial specificgrants and criteria based grants.

The framework has been set, the different programmes have beenindicated, the projects within these programmes have been laid down,and the funds have been provided. It is now the responsibility of themachinery of the Government to implement them. Nothing lies in theway since there is political commitment. His Excellency the President isaware of it and has taken meaningful steps to strengthen publicadministration in order to implement the plans successfully. This Budgetwill surely fulfil the hopes and aspirations of our people.

In order to achieve the objectives of this important Budget, goodgovernance is needed. Developing a good political culture and anadministrative culture is essential. Mahinda Chintana has providedthe basis for those two things. We must create a modern Sri Lanka in theadvanced global economy.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Sir, I am pleased to take part in the Second ReadingDebate on the Budget presented by His Excellency MahindaRajapaksa. As far as this Budget is concerned, the UnitedNational Party being the Opposition, is not going to opposeit. But in the meantime we are duty bound to expressour views.

The MoU that was signed between the Government andthe United National Party is historic, as this is the firstinstance where an Opposition has extended its fullest supporton a Budget presented by a Government. In the past,whether it be a good Budget or a bad Budget that waspresented, the Opposition had the tradition of finding faultwith it and opposing it.

Sir, we have now come to a situation where the countryis facing a crucial war. On the one hand the Governmentspeaks of its achievements in the last Budget; that it hasachieved a 7 per cent growth in GDP, export earnings havebeen increased, it has got foreign investment, so on and soforth, but on the other hand we must see the presentsituation. Right at the moment there is an undeclared war.

2006 20649650

Though we like it or not, an undeclared war is going on inthe country. An ordinary citizen cannot move withouttaking precautions. People like to be confined to theirhouses as the situation is not normal. Life is not certain.

In the North-East the situation is completely different.Over 650,000 people of the North are confined to thepeninsula. They are suffering without food. They havebeen refugees for over a period of 20 years. They had hopewhen the CFA was signed. Now the climate is such thatthe war would continue for another longer period.

t is the same in the East. After Sampur, Mavil-Aru issue,the people of Mutur and Sampur have been suffering fromshortage of food. Now the people of Verugal area are inthe same plight. The Government is giving reasons sayingthat they are sending food lorries but the Tigers are notallowing them to go in. Killings are taking placeeverywhere. Even the lives of politicians, Parliamentariansand media personnel are not guaranteed. Many people havelost their lives due to explosions. Kebithigollewa massacre,Mutur massacre, Potuvil massacre and then Habarana bombblast, where so many navy personnel were killed, are someexamples. The Budget has been presented by His Excellencythe President as the Minister of Finance in such a situationand he speaks about the achievements of the last Budget.How were these achievements made available? How wasit possible?

Could you recollect the situation prevailed before 2000,just before the UNF Government took over theadministration? After the Katunayake Airport was attacked,the tourist industry collapsed. All the hotels were closeddown. There were no tourists. The economic growth camedown to minus 1.4. The Government had borrowed moneyfrom the State banks and all the reserves of the Governmentwere utilized for Government expenditure. Then, the UNFGovernment took over power. If you say that you achievedeconomic growth in 2005, it was because the UNFGovernment was in power. It was due to their financialmanagement. We, the UNF Members of Parliament sufferedheavily. Our supporters were not benefited. But, for thewell-being of the Government and of the country, our leaderHon. Ranil Wickremasinghe signed the historical CFA- theCeasefire Agreement. Now only we are enjoying thedividends of that Ceasefire Agreement. It may be in theagricultural sector or in the tourist sector, or in the industrialsector or in the foreign investment sector or in exportearnings. After the UNF Government came into power theclimate was conducive. The agricultural sector expandedbecause the idling agricultural lands in the North and Eastbefore 2001 were cultivated. There were areas where farmerscould not go. But after the MoU, many thousands of acresof paddy fields were cultivated. It is so in the fisheriessector too. The fishing community in the North-East werenot allowed to go out to sea. They were not allowed to dotheir fishing, but after the CFA, they were allowed.

Then how about foreign investments? Foreign investorswant to come and invest all the time. But this war situationis preventing them from coming and investing here. Theydo not want to take a risk. Even the Colombo city is notsafe. They are unable to travel across the investment zonesthat have been demarcated by the Government.

The reason, if at all, for the achievements expressed bythe Government Members of Parliament is the CFA that wassigned between the UNF Government and the LTTE. Butnow the situation is changing.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is my point. this Budgetspeaks about a ten year plan, expects an eight per centgrowth, a sustainable growth and also wants to increase theper capita income to US Dollars 3000. Then you are alsoexpecting the same economic development in theagriculture field, in the fishing industry, in themanufacturing sector, in the tourist industry and so on andso forth. My question is, if the war escalates, if a situationsimilar to just before the year 2000 arises, can you achievethese targets? Can you predict that these indices that arebeing stated in your speech will be achieved? No! Theywould not. This is where we have to think. This is whyboth the Government and the UNP signed a MoU. Peoplethink that the United National Party is a part of theGovernment. We explained it yesterday at the 51st NationalConvention of the United National Party. The UnitedNational Party is not a part of the Government. TheGovernment came into power with the help of two smallparties signing two separate agreements which prevents HisExcellency the President to move forward with his peaceplans as it is. This is where he seeks the assistance of theUnited National Party. The country and the internationalcommunity know the position of the United National Partyas to what they have proposed and on what basis they wantto solve this problem. But now, His Excellency the Presidenthas fallen in line with it. His economic plans and even theBudget proposals, many of them are copied from theRegaining Sri Lanka.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Member, your time is up. You can wind up.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

I think, I have a few more minutes. I will conclude. So,it is very clear. Our JVP brothers, themselves say that it isnot Mahinda Chintana. They say that MahindaChintana is not the Chintana of His Excellency thePresident Mahinda Rajapaksa. They say that it is acombination of proposals of different coalition parties.So, this Budget, at its inception says, it is according to theMahinda Chintana but the coalition parties which wereassociated in winning the election, say, It is not. But

651652

[ . . . ]when we read it, it is all there. All these major proposals,whether it be the Weerawila Airport, the Harbour,infrastructure development or any other expressways arementioned in the Regaining Sri Lanka . So His Excellencythe President has fallen in line with the United NationalPartys programme. One of the main two issues in solvingthe ethnic problem is the CFA. But the JVP and the JathikaHela Urumaya wanted to destroy it. They wanted to tear itoff. Now, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle is here. Yesterdayhe confirmed on the Floor of this House to a question raisedby the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake that they are accepting itand going on that basis.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)On what basis?

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

On the basis of the CFA signed between the UNPGovernment and the LTTE. Are you rejecting it? No? YourMinister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva who went toGeneva said on the first time that it is unconstitutional .But the recent determination of the Supreme Court, I think,justified the CFA agreement.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Member, you have to bring your speech to aconclusion.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Okay. I will just take one more minute . On the onehand, His Excellency the President wants to go on parallellines to the UNP proposals. That is the only way to bringthis country out of danger. You cannot do anything onyour own. The world is moving on the globalized theme.As certain Members of Parliament or certain groups say,You cannot live alone, you cannot do anything alone.Therefore, it is a welcome move that the UNP and theGovernment have taken by signing the MoU. They haveto go ahead with constructive proposals and activities.

Thank you very much.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Thank you. Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, please. Order,please! Before that the Deputy Chairman of Committeeswill now take the Chair.

, . , , Whereuon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair and MR. DEPUTYCHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

[. . 4.33]

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)Thank you, Sir. When his Excellency the Presidentpresented the Budget a couple of days ago, he startedhis Budget Speech by saying to this House and throughthis House to the people of this country that this Budgetwas based on the Mahinda Chintana.

Now, Sir, apart from the various focuses that you havein the Mahinda Chintana catering to the various segmentsof our society and the various points of view that we havein our society, the way I understand the MahindaChintana is, as a total philosophy, as a position enunciatedby the Head of State to the people of this country, all thepeople of this country not just one segment of ourpopulation, but the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims,the Malays, the Burghers, who live in this country aswell. The message that he has sent in a very comprehensivemanner, when you analyze the Mahinda Chintana is thathe is advocating a policy of ensuring a balanced growth, abalanced development in this country whether it is in theprovinces, the districts, or in the Divisional Secretariatareas. He is advocating through the Mahinda Chintanathat every human being, every citizen of this countryliving in either of those areas, whether it is a DivisionalSecretariat area, whether in a District, or a Province areentitled to the same services given to all the citizens ofthis country. This is the way that I understand theMahinda Chintana in its total context - a balanced growthof the Provinces, a balanced growth in the Districts, abalanced growth in the Divisional Secretariat areasaffecting the lives of every citizen of this country and thatis the beauty of this philosophy. If we can have equaldevelopment, equal growth, equal distribution of servicesto all corners of this country, then through that you wouldhave that confidence building measure which every citizenof this country would feel that they are indeed benefitingfrom the Government at the centre, the Government at theProvinces and indeed the local authorities that we haveset in place in the various parts of the country. At themoment, Sir, unfortunately that is not happening. Thereis an imbalanced growth in this country. If you take at theprovincial level, the eight provinces that we have in thiscountry, you will see that the Western Province is by farthe most developed. If you look at the services that areprovided in the Western Province and compare it with thepeople who live in the other provinces, you will see thatthe services enjoyed by the people in the Western Provinceare at certain times far greater and of superior standardthan those enjoyed by the other provinces. If you look atthe per capita income levels, the income generating activity

2006 20653654

amongst these provinces you will once again see this hugedisparity. The Western Province is by far the largest andby far the most prosperous. So you have a significantdisparity in economic development, standard of living,infrastructure facilities which have been put in place andthe services which have been provided first at a provinciallevel. This has to be eradicated. Then when you go tothe district level even within a province, you can seedisparities. If you take the Western Province, you will seethat Colombo District is by far the most developed. Thenyou have Gampaha district as number two. The KalutaraDistrict that I represent is by far the least developed whenit comes to the provincial development standards of thesethree districts. That of course trickles down to the standardof living enjoyed by the people. Then if you go beyondthe Western Province and take any other province and lookat the district development situation, the standard of livingenjoyed by the people, the income generating activity ofthe people, the infrastructure situation and the servicesenjoyed by the people once again between districts andeven within provinces you have huge disparities. Then,Sir, if you analyze it even further and if you come down tothe level of the divisional secretariat areas you will seeonce again within a certain district huge disparities betweendivisional secretariat areas. Some of these divisionalsecretariat areas that have been fortunate to have beenrepresented by powerful Ministers or powerful Membersof the Government may have more development in thoseareas as a result of the patronage that those particularpersonalites enjoyed over the years.

If you see the D C B allocations of the Members ofParliament you will see that some Members of Parliamentdisregarding the need to have equal development activityeverywhere, equal development in all divisional secretariesin all villages in that district they tend to prefer allocatingthe bulk of their funds to certain areas, may be the areasthat they represent. So, as a result certain other areas areneglected and then it is reflected in the development statusof those particular areas.

If you look at village level, if you break it right downto the village level you will see some more significantdisparities. So this is what the Mahinda Chintana islooking towards eradicating and that is the beauty of thisparticular philosophy. Of course, this goes to play not onlyin the South of the country but it will also be playedout in the North and the East. And for it to be played outin the North and the East you need an end to the conflict.This is what my Friend, the Hon. Myown Musthaffa wastaking great pains to iron out. This is why the Presidentand this Government are committed to a negotiated politicalsolution to the conflict in the North and the East which isacceptable to all the people living in this country. Not onlyto the people of the North and the East but it must standthe test of time and be acceptable as a result of that as anecessity for the people of the rest of the country.

Sir, I think it is important that when we search for thispolitical solution, we must distinguish between the problemof terrorism and the problem of the genuine naturallegitimate grievances faced by the people who live in thoseareas. The problem of terrorism is something which mustbe faced by any legitimate government in the way that itmust be faced. If there is a movement which is threateningthe territorial integrity and sovereignty of a nation thenno self-respecting country will cow down or bow down tothat and say, Okay, take over. That will never be done.Of course, whilst you meet that threat of terrorism in theway that it should be met with a strong arm you must alsohave a strategy of addressing the root causes of terrorism.You must analyze the problem. Sometimes terrorists arenot interested in entering the political mainstream becausethey feel insecure. They do not want to put down theirweapons, surrender their weapons or go in fordecommissioning. We saw what happened in the NorthernIreland. It took many many years for that agreement totake shape and finally for it to be implemented. Even yetthere is some question as to whether it has been completedfully. But you have to take those steps towards that end.But as far as the genuine, legitimate grievances of thecitizens of this country are concerned, it is incumbent onany Government, which is in power enjoying the mandateand confidence of the people and enjoying the authority,to address them as a matter of urgency. These are politicalproblems. If you look at the North and the East, you willsee problems of youth unemployment, infrastructuredevelopment and huge problems in terms of the servicesthat we have been able to provide for the people who livein those areas, whether it be education, health or otherservices. There are cultural issues which need to beaddressed. There are linguistic issues which need to beaddressed. Today, in this country we have two officiallanguages. Since 1987 the Tamil language has become anofficial language in this country. But is it beingimplemented? No, it is not being implemented properly. Ido not mind coming into the open and informing this Housethat we need to fix that problem as a matter of urgency. Ithas created a huge crisis of confidence in the minds of animportant section of our people who are proud of theirlinguistic heritage. Successive Governments are to beblamed for that. The President has given instructions tomy Ministry and the Ministry of Constitutional Affairs andNational Integration to address this issue. I am taking stepsvery shortly with the support of the European Union to placeTamil language proficient people in all police stations inthis country to start with. There are a lot of police stationsin this country where there is not a single person who canwork in both official languages. Say at least one officiallanguage; Let us take Tamils. There are people who livein the South who should have the right to go to a policestation and lodge their complaints in Tamil because that isthe language of their choice, their first language. How manypeople are there in these police stations capable of takingdown a statement in Tamil, who understand Tamil? So whatis the confidence that these people have? We have in the

655656

[ ]Constitution that Tamil is the official language along withSinhala. But we should be ashamed actually. All of usshould be ashamed that we have not been able to implementthis official language properly and effectively.

There are cultural issues and religious issues. These areall political problems and to find a solution to a politicalproblem, you need a political solution. You cannot addresspolitical problems in another way. A problem of terrorismshould be addressed in a different way. That is a differentmatter and the President articulated yesterday at Weerawilahow he intends doing that. But as far as the ordinary citizensof this country who live in the North and the East areconcerned, they have huge problems in these multitude ofareas that I have just outlined. These need to be addressedthrough political negotiations and through a political willby putting in place a political solution addressing theseproblems. This is what this Government is committed todo. Let there be no misunderstanding of the commitmentof this Government in doing that, Sir.

Once again I go back to the subject of disparity, becauseI want to make disparity in development my theme, mycontribution today. If you look at the development fundsthat this country has received specially after the tsunami,there was a lot of money which came to this country; therewere bilateral donors, multilateral donors, INGOs and NGOswho came with lots of funds which they had mobilized. Noone actually knows how much money was mobilized. Butwe know that there was a lot of money which was mobilizedand some of it indeed came to Sri Lanka. I have got somefigures from the Ministry of Finance. As of 31st of October,2006 there was approximately US Dollars 1300 millionwhich was earmarked for both post-tsunami and post-conflictor conflict rehabilitation, reconstruction and recoveryprogrammes;US Dollars 1300 million. Approximately, halfof that was for post-tsunami reconstruction development andhalf of it was for conflict related economic activity.

Tomorrow, Sir, I am chairing a meeting at the Ministryof Finance on the request of His Excellency the President.We are bringing together the donor community who havecome up with projects in the North and the East; projectswhich have either started and have had to be stopped halfway or projects which have not been able to be started as aresult of the conflict in those areas and the problems whichhave occurred as a result of the conflict.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

To add to what you say Sir, in the North and the East, asyou know, World Bank loans and Asian Development Bankloans are being used in an ad hoc basis by those authorities.

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)Hon. Member, you are eating into my time.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Is there any

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)Sorry, but I get the gist of what you are saying. Can Ianswer that? I will give you specific figures. The WorldBank has agreed to provide approximately US Dollars 265million for reconstruction of houses, irrigation schemes,health and water sector, infrastructure in the North and theEast. Then, the World Bank as you just mentioned, hasongoing five major projects totaling US Dollars 351.5million. What I am saying is this.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

The Government does not know anything. They justcome before the DCC meeting only for approval.

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)No. That is not the issue here. The main issue is, that alot of these projects have got stuck. There are bottleneckswhich have been created. There are blockades which havebeen created as a result of the ongoing conflict in thoseareas. There are problems of access of building materialinto those areas. There are problems of getting propercontractors to stay on and finish those projects because ofsecurity fears. There are all kinds of problems as a resultof the on going conflict.

Now, what I am trying to say Sir, through you to thisHouse is that, we have recognized this problem. We arenot trying to sort it out. We have identified this problemand tomorrow, I will be chairing a meeting at the Ministryof Finance with all of the development partners, with theSecretary to the Treasury and with the Director General ofExternal Resources, to free up these bottlenecks. Unlesswe do that, we will not be doing what I told you earlier,that we should be doing in terms of addressing the politicalproblems the people in those areas are facing. There arethousands of people who have been affected by the tsunami.[Interruption] Wait! Hon. Member. There are housing issuesthat you are talking about. There are water and sanitationissues.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

All those loans -

2006 20657658

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)I have only five more minutes.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Loans are to be paid by the government. But who arethe people implementing it? It is not the government. Itis just being wasted and sometimes -

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)So, Hon. Member, we will address all those issues and ifyou like, after the meeting tomorrow please contact me. Iwill tell you, but I am merely articulating a position hereon behalf of the Government that we have recognized thisproblem and we are in the process of hopefullyrectifying it.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Thank you.

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)Now, Sir, the other issue, that I want to, of course, raisehere, which I have always said, in the context of seekingthis political solution is that we have to accept the fact thatthis country is a multicultural, multireligious, multilingualand a multiethnic society. Unless we recognize this andunless we work towards, protecting and nurturing thatdiversity, we will never be able to get the unity and throughthat unity the Sri Lankan identity that we hope to createwhich would be enjoyed by everyone in this country.

Finally Sir, we have to come to a state where every SriLankan in this country would get up and first say, that Iam a Sri Lankan. I am not saying that we should tramplethe cultural peculiarities, the linguistic peculiarities and thereligious peculiarities that all of us enjoy. That must benurtured and protected. It is only through the protectionof this diversity and the promotion of this diversity thatwe will be able to get that unity which will translate into atruly Sri Lankan identity.

Sir, whilst we address this very important issue, there arealso as a matter of course, human rights issues which needto be addressed. Hon. Sampanthan is here listening patiently.I am sure he has his point of view to express which he hasalready expressed and which he will continue to express.That freedom of expression is also a right which everyonemust enjoy and that can never be suppressed.

Today Sir, in this country there are nearly 200,000 IDPs,new IDPs in the North and the East. They are Sri Lankancitizens. They have become IDPs as a result of the conflictin this country. We, as the Government, are trying to solvethis problem whilst battling terrorism on the one hand andon the other hand battling an issue where terrorists use theseinnocent IDPs as human shields and endanger their lives.These unfortunate people, citizens of this country who haveno correlation whatsoever to this conflict have had to paywith their lives as a result of this very dangerous situation.We need to address this problem. We need to address itwith short term measures where we get the food suppliesout to them, ensuring that they get their entitlementstogether with their shelter and sanitation needs. We aretrying to do this as much as possible. The Government hastaken the bulk of the responsibility. We have alsocoordinated with the different UN agencies and ICRC tocome in with supplies, shelter equipment to assist thesepeople. But at the same time we must have in thebackground the commitment towards confidence buildingmeasures and stabilization measures which will allow thesepeople to go back to their homes.

The position of this Government is that no one shouldlive in temporary houses or temporary shelters, a conduciveenvironment must be put in place for them to go back andenjoy the benefits that other citizens of this country enjoyby living in the village of their choice or the home of theirchoice. This is the position of the Government and we arecommitted to that whilst we are looking at all areas.

. We are not looking at only the Jaffnapeninsula. There are indeed 650,000 odd citizens of thiscountry who need to be looked after in the Jaffna peninsula.We are trying to do the best that we can. Under hugechallenges and huge duress the Government has been takingthe food supplies to those people. But at the same time weare not diverting ourselves from our responsibility of takingthe supplies into the Vanni as well as to areas like Vakaraiand other places in the Batticaloa District. We are committedto that. There may be bottlenecks. There are shortcomings.But we are in the process of overcoming them and I canassure this House that my Ministry is indeed looking at thismatter and I have told the Leader of the House this morningwhen we met with His Excellency the President that we arein the process of putting together a visit to Jaffna so thatwe can really go in there and assess the ground situation.

Finally, I just want to say one more thing and finish.I have taken a policy decision that when we celebrate thesecond year of the Tsunami, on the 26th of December we

[ ]will go into a critical analysis of what has taken place inthe last two years; look at the multilateral donors, look atthe bilateral donors, look at the INGOs, NGOs, how theyhave functioned, how they have behaved and then learnfrom those mistakes and ensure that we have a verycomprehensive, effective strategy in place to avoid theshortcomings that we have experienced in the past.

Thank you very much, Sir.
