Hon. Speaker, may I be heard in regard to this matter as aLeader of one of the minority parties and in fact as the Leaderof the minority party which has 22 Members of Parliament, anumber in excess of the membership of all the other minorityparties put together.

The minority parties in Parliament are: the Illankai TamilArasu Kadchi, the Jathika Hela Urumaya, the Sri LankaMuslim Congress, the EPDP and the Up country PeoplesFront. These are the only minority parties.

Sir, with the consent of two other parties, the Sri LankaMuslim Congress and the Upcountry Peoples Front, wesubmitted two names to be considered for nomination onbehalf of the minority parties on the 30th of May, 2005. Ihave got a copy of the letter I wrote to the Hon. Prime Ministerand the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in regard to this matter.That was on the 30th of May 2005. We suggested that anyoneof those two names can be considered for appointment andthey may be appointed. I do not mind even mentioning thenames, but that may not be proper.

Subsequently Sir, on the 10th of March, 2006 we repeatedour position, and re-submitted those two names and veryclearly stated that not merely the Members of the IllankaiTamil Arasu Kadchi but also the Members of the Sri LankaMuslim Congress and the Upcountry Peoples Front were intotal agreement in regard to the nomination of any one ofthose two persons, but that has not been done.

Thereby I want to make it perfectly clear that any delay inregard to the constitution of the Constitutional Council hasnot been due to any default on the part of either the TNA orthe majority of the minority parties. This is the typical gamethat is being played in this country in regard to every matter.In terms of the Constitution the appointment should havebeen made according to our recommendation.

We ask even now I now repeat on the Floor of this House,that in terms of my letter of 10th March, 2006 to the Hon.Prime Minister and to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition theappointment of the member to the Constitutional Councilon behalf of the minority parties be made and that this matterbe finalized.

Sri Lanka Montoring Mission SLMM Sri Lanka MonitoringMission Naval Monitoring Team Jaffna

Rear Admiral Upali RanaweeraDate: 12 May 2006COMNORTHDear Sir,

I wish to thank SLN in general and Lt. Walgampaya, OIC P 421, andhis crew in particular for the fact that I am still here.

It is my sincere opinion, that Lt. Walgampaya yesterday before,during and after the Sea Tiger attack behaved exemplary. I can notdescribe in words how thankful I am to him. His calm and collectedbefaviour during this operation is a cerdit to ELN. I mean that from thebottom of my heart. He never wavered never lost his coolness, andnever lost his professionalism. Not one single second during the attackdid I have any doubts about his abilities.

His crew carrled out his orders and were never in doubt. They tooare a credit to SLN.

I am proud to be able to say that I was on P 421 during this terribleepisode.I would be very grateful if you could personally pass on my com-ments on to him and his menOnce again I would like to state that they are real credit to yourorganisation. With people like that serving for you. You can rest as-sured that SLN is in a very good state.

I would also like to pass on my sympathy to the families of thevictims of P418. I was lucky enough to be onboard with Lt. Edirisingheand his crew only two days earlier.

Yours sincerely.

Lars Bleymann,Deputy Head of Naval Monitoring Team, Jaffna.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)No,

No, do not interrupt me. I have got only a few minutes. Youcan reply later.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sambanthan)

He wants to ask you a relevant question. He wants aclarification on it.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)Right. You ask the question.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)As far as I can understand, the gist of your argument is thefact that basically the LTTE is not sincere about talks andwants this process to fail because their ultimate goal is aseparate state. That is your argument.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)They have not yet given it up.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)Right.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)That is the conclusion I draw ; that is the inference I draw.I have a right to draw my own inference.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)Can I have an explanation for this ?

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)Yes.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)After Geneva Talks I, which were held on the 22nd and 23rd of February, I am telling you with responsibility, till 77thof April, there was not one incident that could be attributedto the LTTE or those forces that are aligned to the LTTE. But,till the 7th of April, that is when the first attack that could beattributed to the LTTE took place, nonstop since the firstround of talks in Geneva, the LTTE as well as Tamil civilianshave been targeted. How can you explain to me, for that oneand a half month period, the LTTEs position of not takingany action if they are not sincere ?

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)I think, only the LTTE can answer that question.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sambanthan)

How can the LTTE answer that question ?

2006 25565566

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)But, since you - [Interruption.]

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)For the absence of conflict, only they can answer. How canI answer ?

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)But, you have a theory.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)No, no, I am not giving way. They must be having theirown strategy. They are behaving according to their strategy.That is the reason.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)But, you are giving them a strategy ; you are making out astrategy. The entire gist of your argument today

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)No, no, my argument is

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)The entire gist of your argument today is that you areattributing a strategy to the LTTE. Now I am asking you totry and explain to me

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)Are you speaking on behalf of the LTTE ?

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)What is it that, for that one and a half months, when therewas not one incident

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)Why are you getting provoked ?

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)What is the strategy behind that ? Since you can attributea strategy to the violent part of it, I am asking you whetherthere is a strategy for the non-violent part of it ?

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)Do you say that the LTTE is not a party to this violence ?Can you answer that question ? - [Interruption.] Violencestarted from 3rd of December 2005 after the new Presidenttook over. When the new President has categorically said,I am even prepared to go and talk to Prabhakaran, in spiteof all that, you started the war.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)Do not disturb me, for heavens sake. I have got only a fewminutes, please.

At the beginning, speaking on behalf of the LSSP and as aMinister in the Government, I would like to express mydeepest sorrow to those who lost their lives during thisparticular attack on the ship which is under discussion heretoday, the attack on the Dvora boat and the deaths that occurredas a result and to those who sustained injuries. So I wouldlike to express our sympathies to all those who have beenaffected.

2006 25581582

Secondly, we acknowledge the fact that the lives ofunarmed soldiers were saved as a result of the heroism ofthose who participated in this and we would like to recordour appreciation of what was done and hope that there willbe in the future no recurrence of similar events. I would liketo state here that the action of the LTTE has cleared whateverdoubts that we as a party, the LSSP which has been defendingthe rights of the Tamil people throughout our history, had.We were hoping that the LTTE was genuinely interested inachieving a negotiated peace. But by this action, we are nowconvinced that the LTTE is set on achieving a separate stateof Tamil Eelam through an armed struggle and that they haveno serious intention of engaging in a meaningful dialogue atthe Geneva talks that have been just initiated. The previousattack on the Army Commander in Colombo was again an actwhich led us to change our estimate of what was happeningand the attack on the ship subsequently has confirmed thatand we deplore this development and really express oursincere hope that this course of action will not be persisted.By the deaths of 74 armed forces personnel that occurredbefore the first round of peace talks in Geneva and the numberof deaths that has occurred after that, it is evident that therewas a deliberate attempt by the LTTE to attack the armedforces of the Government and to try to provoke a reaction,which would being in the nature of a guerrilla strugglenaturally would be directed against the civilian population.This would help them to justify their position that the civilianpopulation cannot live in safety in a united Sri Lanka. Coupledwith this there have been moves to get Sinhala, Tamil clashesand also a racist backlash on the lines of what happened in1983. This course of action is going to be disastrous and theexpectations of the international community and the Tamilpeople will thereby be, as it were led into a position ofsupporting the LTTE and its political stand, I think, doomed.So, unfortunately the outcome will be that the situation ofthe Tamil people will get worse and we are extremely sorryabout this.

The other events that have been occurring there, I havebeen reading with interest the statements that have been putout by the University Teachers for Human Rights have beenwell thought out and filled with a lot of useful information,but I think they in their whole analysis are forgetting oneimportant fact. That is, that Sri Lanka is not by itself. We arepart of a global scene, a global scene in which there arepredatory imperialist powers who are interested in furtheringtheir own economic and political interests. We know thattoday in the sea around Sri Lanka, oil and gas have beenfound. The best way to be able to get hold of this at thepresent juncture would be to have a divided Sri Lanka andthere are forces which would like to see such a divided SriLanka. We know that the whole train of events that occurredin Iraq was not about weapons of mass destruction but reallyabout the 18 per cent of the worlds oil resources that is presentin Iraq. In the same way we have to keep in mind that thereare international forces who are interested in getting at thisresource.

At the same time we have to remember that if you look atthe industries in the world, the one with the highest rate ofprofit and the one which supports the economies of most ofthe developed countries is the armament industry and in thiscontext we know that wars have been provoked deliberately.If you look at the history of both world wars as well as internalwars, that have occurred within countries and betweencountries, you would see that many of them have beenprovoked by those who were interested in selling weapons,in other words warmongers. So we have to keep in mind thefact that such forces may be operating in Sri Lanka. There areboth foreign armament dealers and others who have a stakein a war in Sri Lanka. There are people within the countrywho have a similar stake. These people would like toprecipitate a clash between the Government and the LTTEand between the Tamil and Sinhala people. We have to bevery well aware of this danger.

The fact that the deaths of certain leaders which are difficultto explain, should not be attributed in an arbitrary fashion. Iam deeply saddened by the death of former MP, the Hon.Joseph Pararajasingham and subsequently of other leaders inTrincomalee and in Vavuniya. We have to be very careful inmaking an assessment of these. If you look at what happenedto the late Hon. Pararajasingham; that event has beenattributed by the LTTE to the Karuna faction and that therewas some Government force behind it. But we have to thinkthat a death like that did not in anyway benefit theGovernment. It only created problems for the Government.In that context the whole incident was designed to evokemaximum horror among all sections of civilized society andin particular the Christian sections, it being the ChristmasDay and within a church. This was done deliberately toprovoke a particular situation. So I would like to -

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Can I interrupt you? Are you insinuating that the LTTEmurdered Mr. Joseph pararajasingham?

( () )(The Hon. (Pro. Tissa Vitharana)

No, I am not.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

You are not. I would earnestly request as a Colleague ofMr. Joseph Pararajasingham that he should not be insulted inthat way. The poor man is dead. I think, when we metthe President and discussed this matter with him, thePresident told us, We have some information in regard towho the killers are. But those killers have still not beenidentified.

583584

( () )(The Hon. (Pro.) Tissa Vitarana)Please do not attribute

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I do not know why investigations were not proceeded withon the basis of the information which the President claimedhe had.

( () )(The Hon. (Pro.) Tissa Vitarana)Please do not attribute to me for positions which I do nothold. I would like to say very clearly that there are otherforces operating and these forces are making use of the racistattitudes that are present in both societies, Sinhala and Tamil,to their advantage and this is being done to provoke anaggravation of feelings between the people of this country,the Sinhala and the Tamil people. So we must be aware ofthis. The killings that have been committed, the Vigneswarankilling in Trincomalee as well as the Senthilnathan killing,do not benefit the Government or any person who is interestedin protecting the Government or safeguarding is interests.

So, I am not trying to attribute these to the LTTE but, whatI am trying to say is that we have to take cognizance of thefact that there are people operating within this country whohave benefited from war, who make money out of war andwho are acting in the interests of warmongers. [Interruption.]We have to [Interruption.] No. Please withdraw thosestatements because those are not founded on any facts. Pleasetry to have a reasonable debate without descending to thoselevels. We are here trying to find out what is happening. Thisis an extremely serious matter. The future of our countrydepends on it and we cannot play around with this. But thepoint that I am trying to make is do not make a wrongevaluation, a wrong assessment of the events that areunfolding in this country. Violence begets violence and wedeplore violence from both sides. From the point of view ofthe LSSP we call upon all those who are perpetrating violenceto stop that and get back to the discussion table. Every effortmust be made by everybody to achieve that. Do not blameeach other for the events that are occurring without consideringthe possibility that there are forces that may be interested inpromoting clashes and that they are doing this deliberately. Ithink we have to take that into reckoning and that is thepoint I am trying to bring into the argument that is takingplace today. We have to understand that if we are to try towork out a solution to this problem there are internationalforces, there are national forces which are interested inprecipitating a war situation. Those who think that byviolence and by increasing that violence, the process can bestopped, they are really playing into the hands of these

warmongers. We have to be extremely careful about that. Isay this in all seriousness because what is happening is thatthere is an increasing hatred and an increasing fear generated.

As the LSSP, we look at this problem from the point ofview of the Tamil people, the Sinhala people, the Muslimpeople and all others who are Sri Lankans. We have to try tobuild up unity among all the Sri Lankan people. We have tobreak down the various barriers that are being developed andall these are aggravated by the increasing violence.

So, we have to move in a direction which minimizes that.Coupling this with racism, racist attitudes and racist attacksonly aggravates the situation. So, if we are to work towards asolution to this problem which can lead to the resumption oftalks in Geneva we have to try to create an environment thatwill permit that. I for one, as a Member of the LSSP, wish tostate that we feel that the Members of the TNA who are hereand the other Members of Parliament owe a duty to the Tamilpeople, to try to prevail on the LTTE to diminish these attacks.Whatever the reasons that are given are going to aggravatethe situation. On our part we will try our very best as part ofthe Government, as well as a party working in the politicalfield, to minimize the reactions that are being precipitatedthrough the events that are occurring, thereby leading tomore deaths. We have to try to minimize those. I state herethat we cannot have any type of vigilante actions. That typeof action also is counter productive and that again will leadto an aggravation of the whole situation. We recognize thatthere are racist forces at various levels, in various positionsthroughout the country. But we as people who are not racistsand who are looking in terms of a united Sri Lanka have to doeverything in our power to defuse the situation, to reduce theconfrontations, antagonisms and to reduce violence. I thinkthat from Parliament itself we ourselves have to set the tone,the standard where we put the interests of the people first andto see whether it be the LTTE, or any other movement likethat which is acting in a way that is going against the realinterests of the people, against the real interests of buildingup a united Sri Lanka, that it is prevented as much as possible.We have to try to rebuild an environment in which there willbe a basis for the resumption of peace talks.

From the point of view of the representatives of the Tamilpeople who are here, I request them earnestly to try to prevailon the LTTE to rethink their strategy, to try to understandthat we cannot ultimately pave the way for the division ofour country and as it were the return of imperialist rule in ourcountry. They are trying, just as much as Iraq has now beenmade into a colony, because we have oil and gas. They willtry to resume that. That is the path of neo liberal politicsworld over. So we have to be aware of these internationalforces that are in operation in working out a solution to ourproblems.

Finally, I would like to mention here that I welcome verymuch the visit by a group of clergy, Buddhist, Christian andothers who met Tamilselvan. I also was instrumental in

2006 25585586

arranging for them a meeting with the President before thatvisit and I hope that this type of direct dialogue between theGovernment and the LTTE can be developed. This is aproblem that really the people of Sri Lanka must solve andthe move by the clergy, I welcome and support. I think thismust be extended to other layers of society, to even thepolitical parties. We must do everything possible to try totake this process forward.

The All Party Conference that His Excellency the Presidenthas been successfully having has brought most of the partiesin the democratic stream to the conference table where thereis a mutual exchange of views, where the views of everybodyis respected and where a common statement has also beensigned, and I think it is time that the TNA also became a partof this process. They also must come into this politicaldialogue and exchange views with everbody else and therebyshow that the political parties, just like the clergy have movedin the right direction now. We ourselves, are capable to solvethis terrible problem that is confroting our nation. We haveto get together and i hope that the move towards that willtake place soon so that there can be a return to talks in Genevaand based on those we can work towards substantive talkswhich will ultimately result in a lasting peace in our country.

Thank you.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)You have three minutes. This is a Ruling by the Chair.

140406 , It is a dire need of the hour to come to our rescue. Weare virtually being wiped out from this earth 1983 19 , , I know what in the issue hauntingyou. The issue that is haunting you is the inroads made intoyou territory and you have become a rootless society in yourcountry. That is why for the first time in the history of IndiaI have made a statement that there is genocide taking place , , , + - credibility + , , 1983 ,

+ ? 06102005 You observe a studied silence when it comesto State terrorism but you jump to conclusions to ban theLTTE which is a meaningless move. , + + , + + + - +, ? Federalism is neither divisionnor disintegration. It is a device to distribute power at grassrootlevel preserving the essential unity of the country andallowing a free play for the different ethnic groups to preservetheir ethnic and linguistic identity. If you are not prepared toaccept federalism, if there is mistrust and hatred between theSinhalese and the Tamils, what alternative do we have ? Thatis why we have said that we have no alternative than topronounce Eelam as the final alternative. It is not apronouncement by Prabhakaran who is in his fifties. It was apronouncement of Mr. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam. On the 19th ofNovember in 1976, in this very Parliament he said that unless

we get out of the clutches of the Sinhala masses we are doomedas a race. We have given up federalism. Separation is the onlyalternative for us. That was uttered by him at the age of 79 inthe year 1976. Now, Prabhakaran is in his fifties and speaksthe same language of Chelvanayakam.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Thank you for your co-operation, Hon. Member.

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)I will come to the conclusion. Chelvanayakam spoke ofnon-violence. Prabhakaran speaks of violence because hesaid that J. R. Jayewardene never adhered to his BuddhistPhilosophy in the true sense. Thank you, Sir.
