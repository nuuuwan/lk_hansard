( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Yes.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)We know that this was an agreement reached at the PartyLeaders Meeting. That is about increasing the salary of thePrime Minister. But I see from some reports in the newspapersthat this is not going to be applied prospectively, butretrospectively.

2006 23217218

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)No, no.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)That is wrong because by resolution -

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)We did not talk anything about that. We did not talkanything about the retrospective effect of increasing thesalaries.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)But the ness papers have reported that.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)We talked about the anomaly. We discussed about theanomaly.

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise a matter of breach ofprivilege arising from a news item in the Virakesarinewspaper published on the 20th of May, 2006 stating thatthere is an arrest warrant issued against me by the Magistrateof Colombo and the name of the Magistrate too had beengiven as Mr. Ajith Anaviratne. I have made a complaint to theCinnamon Garden Police in this connection that this newsitem that has been directed at me is totally false and incorrect.There is no such arrest warrant issued against me.

Therefore, Sir, I request you to take necessary steps inrelation to the investigation that has now been warranted onaccount of this false publication and also to direct thepublisher, the editer and the reporter to bring to light the factthat this is a fabricated falsehood that has been givenunnecessary coverage directed at my personal reputation.Thank you, Sir.

(( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake )

, I thank you for giving methis opportunity to follow the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagma,who presented an Order under Sri Lanka Export DevelopmentAct, No. 40 of 1979.

Firstly, what I have got to mention is that the Hon. Minister,while on his feet, was explaining an import substitutionprocess rather than an export development process. He alsoconfirmed that one of the reasons for this is the additionalcost that has got to be brone as a result of the fuel hike in thiscountry and that is the basis for discouraging imports. Thenext matter is, while doing so, scant respect has been paid to

[ ]the very basis of the export field - the free trade agreements.While you are utilizing the right you have under this Act andsaying that you are going to increase the Cess, in short youare also going to impose a para-tariff on items that are goingto come in through free trade agreements. So, in short, it islike, just because your face is ugly, you are trying to cut offyour nose to spite your face. I guess that matter has to belooked at. So, if you are looking at this as a revenue gainingexercise, I think it is better, that you mention it rather thantrying to discourage people who are trading with this country.Today, if you mention that you are going to substitute tradefor aid, I guess you would have to ensure that you get yourmessage across better.

I know the Government is placed in a predicament, with alot of problems, but, I guess, it should not in any way disturbthe economy of this country. This is the most important thingthat we have been harping on over the last 22 months whilebeing in the Opposition trying to ensure that this country isput on a proper footing. Furthermore, the situation tomorrowonce again going to be one of a imposition para-tariff.Suddenly the Minister of Commerce and Industry of Indiamight call you, like the Foreign Secretary of England calledon the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and asked about thebombings in Trincomalee and asked you what is the meaningof this? you are bombing our traders here. You are imposingpara - tariffs when you are signing agreements with India andPakistan and also fostering agreements with other SAARCcountries. You are going to sign an agreement with Bangkok.You are having a more liberalized trade system in south Asia.So, also I basically say is that when you are doing this, pleaseensure that these matters are looked at from top to bottom.Just because the Hon. Minister of Finance or the revenueofficers of the Minister of Finance send this along, you, asMinister of Enterprise Development and InvestmentPromotion and the Hon. Minister of Trade, Commerce,Consumer Affairs and Marketing Development, who is justwalking in, must not implement it before ensuring that tradeis not disturbed. If this is due to a national crisis, then introducea security levy. Like the airlines are charging a fuel surchargeowing to the fact that oil prices are going up, do somthing sothat you will have an escape mechanism to show when yougo overseas and meet them.

That was just a part of what I wanted to mention. The mostimportant thing is that today we are speaking, Ven. PresidingMember, after gaining a magnificent victory for the ColomboMunicipal Council. The entire country was looking forwardto the election of the Colombo Municipal Council, thinkingthat the United National Party would get dented and therewould be problems and some were waiting to come forwardand say, Here is the mandate of the People. Today, we havebeen able to turn the tide. We said that we had problems.There were certain people who had created problems in ourParty, but finally the elephant donned the specs and we cameforward and own magnificently. Look at the JVP. It exposedits nudity. They had four Members of Parliament and nowthey have only two. Look at Gampaha, Ven. Sir, the bastion

2006 23301302

of the Peoples Alliance. They lost. Even in Wattegama theJVP got only 96 votes. That means, even the families of theMMC candidates who contested did not vote for them. Thisis basically the irony of it.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Your percentage of votes in Colombo has come down from57 to 40.

(( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake )For the first time - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)No, no, our number of votes has increased by 30,000[Interruption.] why not? what are you talking?

(( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake )Hon. Minister, I am on my feet.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Yes, you are on your feet, but do not -

(( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake )I am not giving way. They can take their own time. Theycan use Rupavahini and ITN to do their own marketing. I saythat for the first time -

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Your percentage of votes in Colombo has reduced from 57to 40. persent Ours has increased from 16 to 27. [Interruption.]

. Under Section 14(1)of the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979.[ ] . ; , , . , .

. , Export Development Authority _We are basically talking of the Cess increases. Now, Vener-able Sir, certain items which are directly affected are listed inpage 10A of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1418/12 of 08thNovember, 2005. The Cess on textiles that are being broughtinto this country is also increased. Now, it is again a com-plete distortion in the areas of export substitution. You arebasically saying that you are going to increase the exports ofthis country. On the other hand, the Hon. Minister presentedthis saying that these were import substitutions. So pleaseensure that we get our act together properly. I guess every-body has accepted the fact that, either we export or perish.That is the most important single factor. You cannot have anisland of prosperity in an ocean of poverty. That is what weare saying. Today we are talking of pockets of prosperity thatis there. But overall, it is the ocean of poverty that we aretalking of. Where is the redress ? Today, the best topic is thattrade should substitute aid. Today, aid is becoming dearer bythe day. So on this basis, we must ensure that we increasetrade. But are these the remedies, are these the panaceas forthe ills that are there in the country as of today ?

Venerable Sir, one of the famous Economists, Adam Smithhas said that, No society can surely be flourishing and happy,of which the far greater part of the members are poor andmiserable. I am speaking on behalf of those poor and themiserable. Day by day the country is being sinking into thisparticular segment. The poor and the miserable are increasing,and that is through twelve years of haphazard governing thathas been going on. The Executive has been there for twelveyears. There is no doubt about it, and that is still going on.Where is the benefit that is coming ? The Government musthave a conscious, coherent policy. That is the most importantthing. Rhetoric is no substitute for policy. Where is the policyof this Government ? That is what we are basically lookinginto.

Venerable Sir, when you look at the exports, the increase isabsolutely negligible. The rupee depreciation is basicallytaking advantage of the revenue growth that is being shown.At the end of the day the quantum volume is reducing whilein revenue terms it is increasing. The Hon. Minister of Tradeis here, and I guess the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama has goneout of the Chamber at this moment, I guess they understandthe situation and would take remedial measures. Today, weare only talking and it is not being heard by anybody becausethey do not feel the gravity of this, until the economy cracksup and that is the time when everybody would say, What isgoing on in this country? Look at the economic outlookVenerable Sir, look at the economic activities. The growthrates are there and you are talking of inflation rates. Then weare looking at the fiscal policy. Is there a proper fiscal policyout there ? You are talking of macroeconomic policies, youare talking of the government finances. Today thegovernment finances are completely out of proportion. Therevenue is going up the stairs and the expenditure is goingup the escalator. That is the pace at which it is going up.We have got to ensure that there is a proper policy in place. If5 PL 001176 (2006/05)

307308

you look at the monetary policy, today the U. S. Dollar ispledged to a certain level. Is that a proper justification in theexports and imports that are there ? Today it is Rs. 103 to aUS Dollar. The exchange policy, the balance of payment, allthese have intricacies. Each has a ramification on the other.The Government has to understand the gravity of it. Economyis not something that we can fit into a place and get it movingfrom there onwards. It is something which is absolutely critical.The ramifications will be felt not today, tomorrow, but in theyears to come and we are pawning tomorrow, today itself.That is the fear that we are having.

The other factor is external debt which is going up day byday. The Rupee is depreciating and the interest rates are goingup. The total debt factor is going up. We are pawning ourfuture. There were parties here saying that the per capita debtratio has increased from Rs. 53,000 to Rs. 93,000 during theperiod 2000 to 2001. They tried to say that it went up furtherduring the period December 2001 to 2004 when the UNP wasadministrating. The next year it dramatically came downbecause borrowings reduced. That is the reality.

So, Sir in order to ensure that we have proper exportdevelopment, we must ensure that the ground conditions arethere. We must increase the foreign direct investments thatare coming into this country. We must ensure that aid is usedfor capital consumption rather than for revenue consumption.That is what is happening at present. It must be ensured thatlocal investment - whether it be private or government - isused on capital assets rather than on recurrent expenditure.This is the major problem that is there. Investors come intothis country asking Where have we got to go ? Is it to theBOI, is it to the EDB, is it to the relevant Minister or is it tothe Presidents Office? This is what we have to decide on.The Government must make this decision. The UPFAGovernment is constituted of the JVP and the Jathika HelaUrumaya. Then there must be a government policy. It cannotbe determined by the Supreme Court. Now there are manydeterminations coming from the Supreme Court. TheGovernment is there, but you have the Supreme Courtimposing on certain matters.I read in the newspapers three or four days ago where sandexcavation has been stopped by the Supreme Court. TheMinister has said Yes but the Supreme Court says no. Ifthe Government has taken a considered view and they wantto do that, the Supreme Court can only say whether it is legalor illegal. They cannot say that the Ministers actions arewrong. They can only guide them. This is where we have gotto ask, Is it the Government running the country or is it theSupreme Court running the country or is it the Presidentrunning the country or is it still Chandrika BandaranaikeKumaratunga who is running this country? This is the irony.So, show the Governments majority. The JVP cannot besaying that they are today with the Government. They writeto the Secretary-General of Parliament and to the Speakerthat they want to sit in the Opposition and say We are in theOpposition. Where is this heading to ? Hon. Lal Kanthahas been quite aptly saying that. . , ,

. . . ? , . . . . , , . . ? I ambasically saying that as a Government you have got to take afirm decision. You cannot be vacillating. You have got tohave one policy on this. We are not running a local council,Reverend Sir. We are not running a provincial council. Thisis a Government. The Government means that you must knowwhere your destiny is. You must say that this is the way thatwe are going to increase exports. This is our policy comewhat may. You have got to take decisions that are not right.Right or wrong the decision on the Norochcholai power plantwas taken to move forward. That is what the Governmentmust do. There can be different opinions in the Opposition orthe Government. But, that is a decision to take forward, tomove forward. Will that be done? No. You are going on onthat basis. I do not need to speak of any thing on theGovernment. I am only going to highlight matters that werespoken to by the MPs in the Government. All we have got tois when we ask the questions that their own MPs are askingfrom them; I am only re-surfacing them in order to show thatis the dichotomy of this Government. For exports to grow theGovernment must be united. I have been telling thisrepeatedly. You do not paly around with the economy of thiscountry. You can play about with any thing, be it politicalparties or anything but not with the economy of the countrybecause, if we lose that economic war we have lost all wars.You can see that we are moving from peace to war again. So,if we lose the economic war how are we going to finance thewar that we are going to fight. So, basically, you have got tolook at it on this basis. The Minister of Urban Development andWater Supply is saying, . Now, this has been basically brought by theGovernment. I am only mentioning this to the Minister. Then, in theSunday Observer of 14th of May, the Government says , . , 14 .available for sale , Maya Avenue commercial building . . . . . ? . . , Mahapola increase is only an electionpledge . . , , . , .

These are all investments that are flowing and I willshow you the statistics when the time comes hon. Memberthat we will realize our targets.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake )Hon. Minister, I basically did not say that, That is why Iused the term infrastructure. Now, hon. JeyarajFernandopulle, I am bringing US Dollars 300 million. Letus take the Katunayake Expressay, it was brought in 2000when you were with us. We opposed it when US Dollars 3.7billion was going to be the cost for 25.8 kilometres. Then, in2001 the former President Chandrika Kumaratunga wantedthis to be given in a different way. , .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ? , . ? . . . ? [ ] . We were talking of the target to achieve USDollars one billion in foreign direct investments. It is welland good if you can achieve it. but, get it in foreign directinvestment. Infrastructure is completely a different one. Itis well and good if you could target. I am happy that there isa Minister who can work. You have got the UNp flavour and

315316

that is still there. You are still maintaining those ties saying. Iam UNP because you get that oxygen. You have got Mr.Lakshman Watawala who is another good worker. He hasproved that. We do not say, no. BOI Chairman is a goodworker. At least he knows what his business is, unlike theother people who are there. so, what I am basically saying isto ensure that you look at the investors. Do not talk of theunwanted politicians who do not know what they want. Theyare basically talking of personal agenda. We are not likethat. Even though people try to tarnish our images we areable to withstand those pressures. All what we are saying iswe feel for this country. Today before you bring investment,bring peace to this country. That is the biggest task you havebecause the country is in pieces. You are talking about theExport Development Board and you are bringing in importsubstitution regulations here. This is not exportdevelopment. so, what I am basically saying is bring in thoserelevant things. I am only quoting you. The Financial Times,of the Daily Mirror of 20th March, 2006 states, I quote$ lb FDI target: No action, Talk only That is being givenby one saying that only 23 per cent success is there. Thesame Daily Mirror of 23rd December, 2005 states, I quote2005 worst FDI year for Sri Lanka Only U.S Dollars 110million came in to our country. You are very adventurous.All the best! I mean, at the end of the day investment will becoming into Sri Lanka. It is not coming to RohithaBogollagama Private Limited or Jeyaraj FernanadopullePrivate Limited. When you all fail we are going to take onthis country. But, we do not want to take on a debt riddencountry. I am talking as a businessman, as a former Ministerof Trade, as a responsible Opposition Member assisting theGovernment. Ensure that you stop your rhetoric. Policiestake a country forward - [Interruption.] obviously. You askthe Members in your own government whether the JanathaVimukthi Peramuna is saying what I am saying. What I amsaying is that privatization must take place. Will they saythat? I am saying as a Member of the Opposition thatprivatization has to take place in this country. Will the JVPsay that? Will the , say that?No. We have the courage of conviction to say so. You standand say, this is the way to support. Yes, we say that . We say,do not colourize this economy. That is what we are saying.Look at the Sunday Times of 14th, May. It states I quote,Sri Lanka gets dubious failed state honours. We basicallyensure that we out of this rot. We ensured that we came outof this and today we are back again in the same mess that wewere in. I am only talking of that. That is one thing in thisnews paper, Sri Lanka gets dubious failed state honours.Look at the Financial Times of The Sanday Times. of7th May. It states I quote, Fitch revises SLTs outlook.

consensus and coherency, there is a policy and there is afuture vision to this. The relevant people must know whetherwe are moving forward, Venerable Sir. If we are going on thatbasis, there will be peace.

Today with the most disturbing atmosphere, I would liketo mention that Lloyds Insurance Company has put Sri Lankaback on a war footing; Yemen and Sri Lanka only. I am surethe Hon. Minister may not even know that. Yesterday LloydsInsurance Company has said Lloyds flags risks to ships inSri Lankan and Yemeni waters and as a result insurance costhas increased by100 per cent.

, ? 15,000 . . , ? . . . .

The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, this will be a seriousconsequence for us, because any investor coming in willwonder what the hell is going on. I know that yesterday youwere heading a very important meeting with Marks andSpencers. You were speaking the day before to certain othertextile importers who are bringing their regional hub here.Why are they looking at Sri Lanka? That is because we wentand ensured that Marks and Spencers was brought into SriLanka. It started when you were the Chairman of the BOI.You managed to bring Marks and Spencers. We fortified itfurther. We got labour GSP coming from the European Unionwhich helps us to export duty free to Europe. When youcame in, the European Union labour charge has been takenoff. You must fight and ensure that it is restored. Yesterdaywhen you met Marks and Spencers how honoured you wouldhave been. They wanted to bring stuff form Bangladesh; theywanted to bring stuff from Indonesia: they wanted to bringstuff from India and to make Sri Lanka the hub. Is that notsomething for you all to be proud of? Who did that? I did 70per cent of marketing for you. I, as an Opposition Memberdid not say, No, no, do not bring, this is Mahinda Rajapaksastime. You ignore the Sterling investments in London.Theywant to go to Malaysia. Please ensure that you get it. As theformer Minister of Trade, I would love if this comes into SriLanka. That is the way we market Sri Lanka. We do not makenoises in the news papers.

Today there is Transmile Airlines coming from Malaysia.Who marketed it? We did. I am from the United NationalParty. I have not said, This is His Excellency MahindaRajapaksas Government, the Hon. Jeyaraj FernandopullesGovernment or the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagamas Government.I said, We have got to ensure that the economy is developed.This is what we do from the Opposition. Has one of your MPsin the JVP been able to bring one investment? They havechased investors away. Brandix has gone to India. Why?That is because they cannot take the labour strain that ishere. They cannot get employees because they are more

involved in getting into unions in the Free Trade Zone. Ihave been having a discussion with the Hon. K. D.Lalkantha. . . []

( )( () - , )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of PublicAdministration and Home Affairs)

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am very happy to follow my goodFriend Hon. Anura Dissanayaka who, I must say, made a verygood contribution as former Minister of Agriculture. Whateverdifferences of opinion we may have, we have to accept thefact that in the period when he was the Minister of Agriculturethere was a rapid growth in domestic agriculture in thiscountry. In his speech he made some very good observationsregarding how we can improve in that field. But today, we arediscussing a much broader area of action that is the totaleconomy. The Hon. Bogogallama has presented an orderunder the Sri Lanka Export Development Act No.40 of 1979with the idea of providing an opportunity for local productsto establish themselves so that they will be able to, in duecourse, compete with the imported product. So, we are tryingto give these nascent or the growing industries in our countrya chance to compete and grow and eventually take on othercompetitors in the region. I want to say that though my goodFriend devoted his speech almost exclusively to theagricultural sector, if you analyze the total economy of thecountry, the agricultural sector is not even the leading sectorof our modern economy. I am referring to, Sir the latest reportof the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the year 2005, and thefollowing is the composition of the Gross National Productof Sri Lanka. It states, I quote :

The agricultural sector accounts for 17.2 per cent. The industrialsector accounts for 27 per cent and the services sector accounts for 55.8per cent.8 PL 001176 (2006/05)

363364

[ ]

Our economic growth, our economic base is now shiftingvery fast from the agricultural sector to the services sector.Now, within this reality, I am sure, my good Friend Hon.Anura Dissanayaka will agree that there is huge transformationof our economy and of our society. My Friend said that thisseems to be a wrong policy. That is a matter we have to debateat another forum but what I am saying here is that as far as theobjective conditions are concerned, today only 17.2 per centof our economy is contributed through the agricultural sector.Twenty seven per cent is contributed through the industrialsector and 55.8per cent is through the services sector. It iseven more important when you look at the growth figuresfrom the year -

( )(The Hon. Anura Dissanayaka) , 17 . 39 . 39 17 . .

( () )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama), . , . . . , . . . Between the years 2004 to 2005 there has been agrowth in each of these sectors and I must pay a tribute toHon. Anura Dissanayake because you can see in the year2004 at the beginning we had a negative growth in agriculture,largely due to climatic conditions, organizational problemsand such. The Government in which he was the Minister wasable to raise it to a 4.4 per cent growth. On that all of us can bevery proud and I am also very happy, Sir, Hon. Member willagree that when he launched that programme of DahasakWew I myself and the Ministry of Finance worked veryclosely with him. We backed you to the full. In fact, I am veryhappy to say that Hon. Member and I went and addressedeven the Chamber of commerce. He made such a good speechthat the Chamber itself agreed to build several of thosereservoirs and tanks.

I am not trying to be petty nor try to blame anybody. Indeedwe have had very impressive agricultural growth. Minus1.2per cent to 4.4per cent of the Gross National Productpertains to agriculture. It may create a lot of problems. I willcome to that. But if you compare that with industrial growth,it has gone from 25.4 per cent to 36.3 per cent. But thespectacular growth is in the services sector. It has gone rightup to 59.3per cent. So we are now talking of a different typeof economy. We have to develop our agriculture. There is nodoubt about it. This 4.4 per cent growth of which all of us canbe proud has led to lot of problems which we should haveanticipated. But agriculture is not the whole story.

Even in agriculture what are we going to do with thefertilizer issue? How are we going to collect the extra paddy?How are we going to store it? How are we going to distributeit? These are big problems. Hon. Member will remember, inthe Treasury we discussed with him and we were trying toforesee the type of problems that will arise.

I went to the Food and Agricultural Organization in Romeand asked them to advise us on how we can improve ourstorage and milling capacity. Hon. Member will agree thatwe took many decisions. Even your fellow MP fromPolonnaruwa will agree with us. We made several decisionsregarding small millers. We wrote off their loans. We gavethem new loans. We reduced taxes on small mills. We set upthe SME Bank. So many activities were undertaken. I fullyagree with you that all this may not be sufficient because wehave had unprecedented growth. We had very good climaticconditions then and very good organization. We had theDahasak Wew Programme. We gave the fertilizer subsidyand all this has led to a growth of production in theagricultural sector. Actually it is only when you havedevelopment that you will have problems. In the cemeterythere are no problems. . . But only when there is growth,when there is an actual increase in production that problemsarise. That is normal. I agree with you and I want to supportyou in saying that we have to look more into the problemsthat have arisen. They are not simple problems. I think, Mr.Deputy Speaker, there is no reason why we should allow thepolitical divide to prevent us from coming to a commonplatform regarding agriculture. On that we are agreed.

But the question we are now addressing is regarding theindustrial sector and the services sector. I must say, Sir, thattoday the global economy is growing as never before.Developing countries are getting a chance which will nevercome again. Today spurred by India and China the globaleconomy is growing at an unprecedented rate of 5 per centper year. Problems may arise. Some economists are sayingthat there may be difficulties in the future. But as of todaythere is a very strong and powerful growth in the globaleconomy fuelled largely by development of the Chinese andthe Indian economies. The Chinese economy for over 15years has been growing at an annual rate of over 10 per cent.The Indian economy, which is now almost catching up withthe Chinese economy, is going on to 9 per cent and 10 percent growth. Only two weeks ago sir, I was in Hyderabad withthe Prime Minister of India who is an economist and with theMinister of Finance of India, Mr. Chidambaram. They arevery confident. They are very optimistic about the rapidgrowth of the Indian economy. I am going to give my Friend,the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka a copy of the speech made byPrime Minister Manmohan singh about how they are gettingabout developing the Indian economy.

The whole of Asia is developing. There is huge growth inChina, India, even in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Pakistan isalso now coming to the 10 per cent growth trajectory or growth

2006 23365366

pattern. So we have to look at their policies which have ledto success. I must very respectfully disagree with my goodFriend of the JVP about his policy perceptions. We mustthink again. We must not think in the same old way. Whatdoes the rapid expansion of the global economy mean? Itmeans that consumption in the rich countries, consumptionin America, consumption in the European Union,consumption in India and China is growing at anunprecedented rate.

Hon. Member, do you know that in India within two yearsthe middle class has increased from 250 million to 450million? The middle class of India has grown almost doublein a matter of only two years. They are world leaders today ininformation technology. They are world leaders in science.They are world leaders in modern manufacturing methods.So opportunities are being opened up for countries like SriLanka because consumption is growing and expanding inthe developed world. So we have to go into our manufacturingand services sector with the idea of developing not in the oldslow way. We must go for very quick growth. Then we can tapinto the developments that are taking place in the westernworld as well as in our region.

Today global growth is Asia led. Global growth is led byChina and India and, as the closest neighbour, Sri Lanka hasa once in a life time opportunity of making use of thosechanges. It is a miracle. Those days we talked of Korea, wetalked of Indonesia, we talked of Thailand, and we talked ofSingapore and Malaysia. But today everybody is talkingabout China and India because they are the real growth centreswhich are pulling the global economy forward. Now withthese two growth centres so close to us, where transportationis a key, we must emphasize our role as a regional hub.

Now if you look at, for example, our foreign assistancepattern, our good Friends Hon. MPs of the JVP were criticalof the World Bank, critical of the IMF and critical of assistancefrom some of the western countries. But look at the aid patternfor Sri Lanka today. China is giving us almost US Dollars onebillion worth of assistance. The old pattern has changedcompletely. Those days our foreign exchange budget in totalwas less than US Dollars one billion. Today one country,China is giving us that. They are doing the Katunayake -Colombo Expressway and the Norachcholai Power Plant.Then we are thinking of a ring road. Various otheropportunities are opening up because of Chinese assistance.India is also giving us huge assistance. They are going tobuild a coal power plant in Trincomalee. We are discussingabout an express train from Colombo to Galle, Matara andHambantota. So the whole pattern of assistance is changing.We do not have to go hat in hand to the World Bank anymore. We have to go for some assistance may be but in thefuture it will be Asian countries that will be assisting poorerAsian countries. We are going, Hon. Member, for a bond issue.We are not going to borrow from a country or an institution.We will go direct to investors by offering a Sri Lanka patriot

bond. Many people can subscribe to that and over a period oftime the Government of Sri Lanka will be responsible forrepaying that money.

In that situation, I want to draw my Friends attention to aparticular matter because I know he has also been thinkingabout this. We have had a chance of discussing this. In theindustrial sector, look at our mining and quarrying sector. Weare one country, I am very sorry to say we are not trying todevelop our natural resources. We bring all sorts of rules andregulations which prevent us from developing our naturalresources. Look at every aspect of our natural resources. Wecan have hydroelectricity. We can have thousands of smallhydroelectricity plants. If you go to China you will find thatevery town and village has its own mini hydroelectric scheme.These are private mini hydro schemes. In Sri Lanka why canwe not have thousands and thousands of small hydroelectricschemes like in China? . . . . . ; .

Then look at what is underground. Are we using that? I amnot saying that this should be given to the private sector butwe should have strategic alliances. Government and theprivate sector can get together and develop the large mineralresources that we have, including oil. We have to have amore modern approach so that our manufacturing sector willincrease. It has to play a much bigger role and our restrictedpublic sector thinking would not allow us to free our economyand let develop rapidly like in China and India.

Look at the fisheries sector. Still we are not able to produceadequate fish for consumption in this country. As regards thefish canning plant, I must thank the Hon. ChandrasenaWijesinghe. When he was the Minister of Fisheries wediscussed this matter. Even his hands were tied because earlier,the previous Minister had got into various binding contracts.You must know all these things from the UNP regime. Wecould not build our own fish canning plant because of theUNP.

We have so many products that we can export. Sri Lankaneed not be a poor country. We have the resources to makeSri Lanka a rich country. If India can get 10 per cent growth ayear, if China where every year in the past under the oldcapitalist, imperialist system, millions would die for lack offood, another million would die for lack of health facilitiesand sanitation today has been able to become one of theleading economic growth centres of the world, why shouldonly Sri Lanka be poor? No Government in Sri Lanka fromthe time we got independence has been able to really developour natural resources as an export base.

367368

For example, for fertilizer manufacture we do not use ournatural deposits. For sulphuric acid, for which there is a hugedemand in the world, we are not able to use our naturaldeposits. Only a small Sanstawa is trying to developEppawala phosphate facilities. I am not saying that you mustgive it to a foreign company. But we have to think big and tryto use our resources. The Hon. Member knows very well thatif we can get our phosphate and if we can manufacture ureawe can reduce the cost of fertilizer to the farmer. As long as wedo not produce some of the fertilizer in Sri Lanka, which wehave the potential of developing, then for ever we will haveto depend on the world market prices for fertilizer. The Hon.Anura Dissanayakea and I tried so many ways of reducingfertilizer prices. That also was obstructed sometimes. But wetried. We have the potential. I am convinced that Sri Lankacan be a rich country if we have correct economic policies.

So in the manufacturing sector, I must tell my Friend, theHon. Minister that it is not only a matter of having the cess.That should be only a small part of our strategy. We must takea much more realistic and progressive look regardingexploiting our mineral resources.

When Mao Tse-Tung became the leader of China in 1949what was the first thing he did in Beijing? He initiated ageological survey of China. He said that after all these yearswe do not know what resources we have. Today even our owngeological survey is not complete. Has our Parliament everdebated the report of the Geological Commissioner? Havewe given all the facilities necessary to speed up a geologicalsurvey? The Eppawala graphite deposit was found by ourgeological survey. Eppawala phosphate was found I thinkonly 20 or 30 years ago by our geological experts. There ismuch more I can tell you. During the last two three yearsthough it was done silently and you criticized us, we havebeen able to find some of the worlds best oil and gas depositsoff the shores of Sri Lanka. When we mentioned that at thattime nobody believed that. They said we were in dreamland.But the Hon. Minister and I know that because we have seenthe reports which clearly say that we have oil. And we havesodium deposits too. But we have to agree on a policy; I amnot saying that we must give it only to the private sector. Wecan discuss that. But how can we exploit those resources?The money that we can earn as a country by our mineralresources is far in excess of what we can get by this Cess. Ithink the Hon. Minister will agree with me. We have toseriously look at the manufacturing sector. We have thepotential. But we are not exploiting that due to out of dateideologies.

Hon. Member, do you know that when we have the coalpower plants, we will have to go to Bangladesh, India, NewZealand or to Australia to buy coal. These are their mineralresources which are exploited by their private sectors. Butwe have no such progressive policies. We are not using ourwaterways to generate electricity which is the cheapest andthe most environmental friendly way of generating power.

[ ]We have to have a more flexible approach. That is the realnationalist or patriotic approach. I do not think that it iscorrect to take up the position that anybody on the other sideof the Parliamentary divide is not patriotic or is a traitorbecause he has a different economic strategy. That is not theway to go about development. We have to discuss and find acommon practical policy.

I want to devote the rest of the speech, Mr. Deputy Speaker,to the question of our service industries. There is a tremendousexpansion in our service sector. The whole of Asia is seeing ahuge expansion in the services sector.

Now look at financial services. Look at thetelecommunication services. IT services is a hugely expandingsector throughout the world. This country has made a hugeinvestment in education. Even before independence, fromthe time of the State Council days, a large part of the SriLankan budget has been invested in education. But are wegetting the best use of that investment? Are we creatingeducated people who can walk into jobs like they do in Indiatoday? If you go to Hyderabad, they have notices saying, Ifyou have IT degrees please come and work in our enterprise.

In China today there is unlimited demand for people withIT knowledge. If you have good IT qualifications you can goto the Japanese Embassy today and get a visa to go and walkin their industries. You do not have to go after any Member ofParliament for a visa. So, that is the reality. Do you know thatin the American Embassy in New Delhi there is a whole sectionissuing visas for Indian nationals with IT backgrounds. Sixor seven IITs were set-up in India in Hyderabad, Ahmadabad,Mumbai et cetera and all those trainees are now finding jobseasily in America. In fact they are linked to the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, where your leader Hon. RanilWickremasinghe spent his holiday a few weeks ago. TheIndian Institute of Technology is linked with theMassachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. The Hon.Minister knows that very well.

So, we have to go for technology. We have to link ourServices Sector with our Education Sector. It is no use ofsaying okay, Minister of Industries or Minister of Investment,you go ahead and get investors if you do not give him thebasic support services by creating a cadre of people who cando modern technological jobs. The Hon. Minister knows verywell for example, in the HSBC how many people are employedin the call-centers. 2400 boys and girls are getting, I think, asalary much more than all of us here. Everybody iscomplaining that Members of Parliament are getting highersalaries. But today, 2400 people can just walk in and get ajob in the HSBC. We have applications by Virtusa and variousother IT companies to employ as much as we can provide.But are we, through our education system producing the typeof young person who can get employed? We are creatingunemployable people and shouting in platforms that there isan employment problem in this country. For that all partiesmust take the blame. I do not think it is fair to blame only

2006 23369370

this Government or that government. Our education systemmust be completely restructured. There are enough of jobs inAsia and in the world today. Only thing is our outdatededucation system is not ready for it.

I must also commend the Hon. Minister. He has tried tocreate new areas, new opportunities for export. I am referringparticularly, to the gem sector. After a long time the Gems andJewellery sector has got a new life. Very often our friends inthe UNP blame us saying that we are not encouraging localindustries. What did you do when you had all that power?What is the assistance you gave the Gem Industry? Look atall the sweeping reforms that we have been able to make.Today, the Gem and Jewellery industry can freely bring gemsand jewellery and freely export such material. We have theSME Bank from which they can borrow funds.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Rs. 400 million worth of net exports out of Gem andJewellery now.

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Rs. 400 million worth of net exports. What were you alldoing? You are supposed to be the Capitalist party. You couldnot even look after the capitalists. That is your problem.

. ( )(The Hon. T. Maheshwaran)

Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama is from the UNP.

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Now he is with us. Anyway, you all could not do it. Thefact of the matter is that nothing could be done. All right,now forget about that. What about IT? I was the Secretary incharge of tourism during the best period of tourism. Everyyear we were increasing by 100 per cent. I get the same feelingtoday about IT. Today, our software industry has earned overUS Dollars 100 million a year.

. ( )(The Hon. T. Maheshwaran)

Film industry ?

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

.

. ( )(The Hon. T. Maheshwaran). .

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

So, I think we can expand the IT industry as much as wewant. We do not have adequate human resources in that field.That is the problem. If you look at the Indian IT industry, ifyou look at Bangalore, if you look at Hyderabad they aresaying that costs are going up We would like to give part ofour work to Sri Lanka. Please start your IT parks, pleasestart your IT malls, we can fly direct from Bangalore andfrom Hyderabad. We will start IT in a big way in Sri Lanka. Imust honestly say that we also have problems. For example,our investors were not getting a quick response. They couldnot get land. Land alienation was a problem. You cannothave an IT park on five acres of land. You have to think big.We have to frankly admit that we have to speed up ; offerbetter services. These have nothing to do with this Cabinetor that Cabinet or anything like that. We are trying to developthis country. At least when we die, let us be in a position tosay, We did something for this country before we closed oureyes.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Minister -

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

I will take only five minutes, Sir. we have to develop the ITsector, the gem sector and the tourism sector. These are allforward looking sectors.

Look at the hotel industry. Today, do you know that for thewhole of India, China as well as the West, Sri Lanka is one ofthe best destinations where you get value for money? If youspend US Dollars 100, you can get a room in any hotel inColombo. But anywhere in the world today, if you go toChina or Singapore, you have to pay at least US Dollars 250.If you go to Maldives today, a room is US Dollar 450. Youcan get the best value for money destination in Sri Lanka.But we have to develop all these things and for that I mustsay honestly, Sir, that we must also have peace. All of us musttogether try to create an environment in this country whereinvestors can come in, where the Government is alsoresponsive and gives them the facilities. Today the tourismindustry which is one of the most progressive and privatesector led growth areas is being hindered at every turn by theTourist Board. Due to petty personal rivalries a success storyis being turned into a disaster.

371372

So, I would like to conclude on a positive note. Sri Lankahas tremendous potential. Our region is the growth centre ofthe world. The world economy is growing and this is a timewhen we must make good use of the opportunities that theworld economy is offering to us. In such a situation ratherthan bickering and scoring debating points, we all should tryto arrive at a consensus which can take this country forwardas a rich country in the 21st Century.

Thank you, Sir.
