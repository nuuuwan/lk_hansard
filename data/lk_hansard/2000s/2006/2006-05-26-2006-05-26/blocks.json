I happened tobe out of the country on that day, Sir, but watched on BBCthe interview given by the Government Spokesman onDefence Affairs, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, on behalfof the Government. He was asked by the BBC announcerwhether the Government had carried out aerial attacks inTrincomalee. His answer was No, I am not aware of anyaerial attack the Government has carried out. That was theanswer. He said, There were some attacks carried out by theLTTE on the Navy. As far as we are aware, Sir, after theattempted assassination of the Army Commander on the 25thof April, the LTTE has not carried out any attacks against theNavy. But we all know and now the Government accepts - itis a matter of public knowledge - that aerial attacks werecarried out by the armed forces against so - called identifiedLTTE targets.",

That is what the Oslo Declaration said. TheLTTE talked about setting up of an Interim Self-GoverningAuthority. The Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris - I do not know whetherhe is present here or not, he is not present here who was theChief Government Negotiator at that time, talked to the LTTEand persuaded the LTTE that rather than setting up an InterimSelf-Governing Authority which might run into someconsitutional obstacles, they must find some other mechanismand they agreed to set up the SIRHN - Sub Committee ofImmediate Rehabilitation and Humanitarian Needs. SIRHNnever got off the ground. There were some public servantswho saw to it that it never got off the ground. SIRHN collpsed.Nothing was happening. Talks preparatory to the Tokyo Talkstook place in Washington on 14th of April 2003. The LTTEwas not invited to those talks because the LTTE is a bannedorganization in the USA and they could not go ther. SIRHNhad collapsed. Normalcy had not been resorted in the lives ofTamil people. They were still languishing in refugee campsand welfare centres. It was not possible to resettle the Tamilpeople. They raised obstacles in the way. Armed forces werenot happy about Tamil people being resettled andrehabilitated. LTTE pulled out of the talks.",

As you are aware, the issue of interim administration was takenup for discussion at the inaugural session of the peace talks in Sattahip,Thailand. Responding to the proposal of the LTTE delegation, Prof.Peiris explained the legal and constitutional constraints involved in theformation of such an administrative body outside the parameters of theSri Lanka Constitution. To avoid political controversy in the earlystages of the talks the negotiating parties decided to replace the idea ofan administrative structure with the establishment of a Joint TaskForce for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Activities for the Northeast.At the second session of peace talks, the negotinating teams agreed totransform the Joint Task Force into a Sub-committee on ImmediateHumanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs (SIRHN). The role of this Sub-Committee was to identify humanitarian and reconstruction needs ofthe North - East population and priorities implementation of activitiesto meet these needs. The Committee would give primacy to activitiesaimed at rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and tohumanitarian mine action programmes and other activities supportingthe return of IDPs to their original homes such as reconstruction ofroads, production infrastructure, health facilities, schools and similarissues.",

Particularly when we came to the P-TOMSarrangement the Muslim Community too protested againstthe document and in this regard the former President HerExcellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had adiscussion with the SLMC much later after all thearrangements were finalized. Despite the fact we haddemanded that we be consulted early before the draft wasfinalized, the Government though it fit to brief us after allnegotiations were conducted exclusively with the LTTE. Itbecame impossible for the Muslim Community to acceptor accede to such a document.

During that period Imyself was part of the negotiating team. There were instanceswhere certain sections were lobbying when diffuculties arosein persuading the LTTE to return to the negotiating table.There were certain sections both within the Government andoutside which pressurized the then administration to lobbythe EU for a ban on the LTTE. The then administration feltthat it was sufficient to maintain the ban as far as the USand other countries were concerned but to delay this aspectof it and not to ask for this ban, as we all know.",

They are trying to set up what you call- contact groups in order to exert a different type of pressureon the LTTE in a situation such as this. We are all hopefulthat on the 30th when the co-chairs meet in Tokyo, thatthey would still find it suitable to adopt some method whichmight encourage the parties to observe the ceasefire, butthen it is also sometimes found to be futile to get the co -chairs to continue to issue statements and for thosestatements to be observed in the breach.

The Tamil diaspora is now requiredto register with the LTTE and, even as we speak the expatriatecommunities in Europe are being formally registered andtheir income levels recorded. In fact, we have got hold ofthose forms which the LTTE is distributing amongst the Tamildiaspora in the European countries and those are beinginvestigaged.
