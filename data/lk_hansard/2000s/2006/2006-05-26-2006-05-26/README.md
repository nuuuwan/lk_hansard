: 2006.04.11 : 11042006 PRIVILEGE : ATTACK ON HON. NADARAJAH RAVIRAJ,MEMBVER OF PARLIAMENT IN TRINCOMALEE ON11.04.2006

( )(The Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj)Hon. Speaker, I thank your very much for the opportunitygiven to raise in this august Assembly a matter of concern toall of us in this House. It is a question of breach of privilegeof mine, a Member of Parliament elected by the people. It hashappened to me and it could happen to any other Member inthe future unless it is stopped by appropriate action by yourhonour. In my view it is not only a question of privilege butalso involves security and a threat to my life. This is anincident that happened on 11.04.2006 at about 5.30 pm. atAbeyapura, Trincomalee. There is a necessity to expiain toyour honour and to the honourable Members of Parliamentabout that attack on me by thugs and hooligans on that date.

On 7.4.2006 Mr. Vigneswaran was killed in the high securityzone of Trincomalee town. He should have been here with ustoday if not for the killing. As you are aware he was nominatedby the TNA, for the vacancy in the National List that arosefollowing the assassinations Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham.

On 11.04.2006 in the morning I went to Trincomalee topay my last respects to the late Mr. Vickneswaran and I wasreturning to Colombo on the same day with my two policesecurity guards in my car bearing registration No. WPKE9218. It was at about 5.30 p. m, my car was stopped by thugsat Abeyapura near the Trincomalee city. There was tightsecurity arrangements due to the said funeral and there were

navy personnell with arms on both sides of this road. At thepoint where my car was stopped I saw two navy men witharms on duty among 30 or 40 thugs. Riot control police toohad a road barrier just 50 meters from this point. When thethugs stopped my car, the two police personnel on my guardtold the thugs in Sinhala that they are from the Police. In themeantime, I heard someone shouting loud that Raviraj isinside the car. This was followed by the thugs, who were withbatons and iron bars, attacking my vehicle and throwingstones.

When the thugs were trying to pull me out of the vehicle,knowing what the consequences whould have been if theyhave succeeded in their attempt, I called the navy personnelin Sinhala, who were near my vehicle watching this, to cometo my rescue. To my disappointment, they never intervened,but were standing holding on to their guns, which I am surewould have encouraged the thugs. Mr. Speaker is this theconduct we expect from our security forces for whom we votemoney? Are we to condone this ? It was due to the timely andquick action of my police guards, Thilakaratne and Luxman,who were in the front seat, that I am here with you all. Theyquickly drove the vehicle towards the police barrier andbrought to their notice that the mob were attacking a Memberof Parliament. Simultaneously, the mob came running chasingmy car. Then the police fired in to the air, used tear gas,bullets and chased away the mob. Thus, I escaped death by ahairs breadth. The news regarding this incident was flashedover the television and the radio that evening itself. ManySinahala civilians, Members of Parliament and religiousleaders contacted me and inquired about my well-being.

However, Mr. Speaker, I would say it is a matter of regretthat neither your nor anyone from your staff, the Secretary-General of Parliament or any others from her office have shownany concern to this threat on my life. Except for my goodFriend the Hon. Minister Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi no otherMinisters had expressed their concern. What is hurting isthat neither the Inspector-General of Police nor the navalcommanding officers, who were in charge of the navypersonnel who stood with the mobs, have inquired from meregarding the incident; nor have they shown any concernregarding my safety.

Mr. Speaker, what is more humiliating is that theHonourable Minister Keheliya Rambukwela had in a mediabriefing said that the attack on me is untrue and I amattempting to make political capital over the incident. Withall my respect for the Minister. I say that the Minister wouldbe reallly nonourable and more honourable had he checkedwith me before he went to the media briefing. When I am avictim of assault, it is most inhuman on the part of any humanbeing to say I am lying. If this is the plight of mine, a personwho has been elected by the people, what would be the plightof the innocent Tamil civilians?

The President as Minister of Defence, has the primaryresponsibility to assure security and safety of every citizenof this country. I was assaulted in the presence of security

2006 26665666

forces, whose duty is to protect the citizens of the country.Mr. Speaker, I know pretty well that nothing is going to comeout of this Statement made in this Assemblly. But as aRepresentative of the People, I think I have a duty to makethe public as well as the House aware of the respect we getfrom the security forces.

Hon. Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity tobring this to your attention.

Thank you.

( )(Mr. Speaker) . .

- - THE CURRENT SITUATION FACED BY TAMILCIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE NORTH-EAST

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, we have moved theAdjournment Motion in the House to debate the currentsituation prevalent in the North-East. I think, Sir, we arediscussing a matter of very grave public importance andwhen we are discussing a matter of such grave publicimportance pertaining to the plight of the Tamil civilianpopulation in the North-East, I find it very disappointingand in fact very frustrating to observe that there is not anHon. Minister present in the Front Benches of theGovernment side except the Hon. Ferial Ashraff who alsocomes from the Nort-East and who therefore must be havingsome concern for the plight of the people of the North-East. Of course, I know that my good Friends, the Hon

667668

Dew Gunasekara, Minister of Constitutional Affairs andNational Integration and the Hon. Tissa Karalliyadde, Hon.Minister of Indigenous Medicine who also comes fromthe North-Central Province, very close to the North-Eastare present here. But nevertheless, if the Government wasreally interested in ascertaining the plight of the peoplein the North-East through what is said on the Folor of thisHouse, in the course of this Adjournment Debate, I wouldhave expected any responsible government to berepresented on the front row by at least one Minister ifnot more. Therefore, Sir, before I commence I mustexpresses my very deep disappointment, not merely ofmine but that of my Party and of the people of the North-East in regard to this attitude on the part of theGovernment.

The Hon. Raviraj, Member of Parliament of JaffnaDistrict, just a few minutes ago outlined to you whathappened to him; a Member of Parliament travelling withsecurity in some part of the Nort-East. A couple of daysago you heard Hon. Kajendran, a Member of Parliamentfrom the Northern Province narrating to this House whathappened to him. How his office was smashed up and howvaluable property had been destroyed. It appears to meSir, that these incidents that happened to civilian peoplein the North-East are not making any impact on theGovernment, that the Government is totally unconcernedwith this situation.

I propose, Sir, in the course of my submission thismorning, to deal primarily with the plight of the Tamilcivilian population in the North-East. In order tosubstantiate my case and place my views on a stablefoundation, I would like to refer to some incidents ofsignificance that have taken place in the North-East inrecent times which in my view have triggered off thetension and the present state of affairs that prevails in theNorth-East.

I would like to start Sir, by referring to the rape and themurder of a young girl by the name of IliathambyTharshini at Pungudutivu on the 16th of December 2005.The Tamil civilian population in Pungudutivu who wentin search of this girl and who found the body of the deadgirl inside a well in Pungudutivu close to the Naval Campin Pungudutivu,. found boot marks on the soil,surrounding the well.

We took up this matter in Parliament on the 20th ofDecember. We discussed this mater with His Excellencythe the President. We gave him a copy of the Motion thatwe had tabled in Parliament and gave him a letter. Heassured us hat this incident which happened on the 16thof December would be inquired into. But as far as weknow, nothing has happened. Nobody has been taken intocustody sustody and we do not know whether anyinvesigation have been conducted.

The Tamil civilian population in the North, in Jaffna inparticular, were highly agitated by this incident. The nextday students and members of the Jaffna University staffincluding the Vice-Chancellor who wanted to proceed tothe office of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission to lodge acomplaint and present a petition in regard to this matter,were manhandled by members security forces. Not merelystudents and the academic staff of the university, but evenother persons have been manhandled. That too wasbrought to the notice of His Excellency the President.But as far as we are aware, no action has been taken inregard to either matter.

My Colleague, late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham whocame with us to meet the President in December, wasmurdered inside the Roman Catholic Church in Batticaloawhen he went to attend the Christmas Mass on Christmaseve. He was gunned down. This was an area under totalGovernment security. All information reveal that therewere police personnel within the church premises andthere were army personnel outside the church premiseson the road, but the assailants were able to commit thecrime and get away. We met the president in regard to thismatter. As a responsible political Party we have taken upthese issues with the government at the highest level. Iam sorry to state on the Floor of this House that theassurances given to us have not been kept and Mr. JosephPararajasinghams murder will before long become one ofthose things that are forgotten about. Violence continuedSir, in the month of December 2005. In order to save timeI will not refer to all the acts of violence that happened.

The other matter of some importance and significancewas the murder of five students in Trincomalee on the02nd of January, 2006. Immediately after the killing ofthese five students there was an effort on the part of theGovernment to make out that these students had died inthe course of a self-inflicted explosion. That story, Sir,would have gained currency and the government wouldhave stuck to that story. Unfortunately, for the Governmentthe postmortem examination conducted by the JMOrevealed the next day that the students had been killed asa result of gun shot injuries. Some of them being throughthe head and the others being shot through the ear. We metthe President in regard to this matter too. We raised the matterin Parliament. The President was frank enough to reveal to uswho the assailants were. He told us that these boys had beenmurdered by the Special Task Force. He told us that theSpecial Task Force had been sent to Trincomalee without hispermission and that he was not aware of the Special TaskForce being sent to Trincomalee. He told us that he hadreprimanded his Defence Secretary for what has happened.He assured us that an independent investigation would beconducted and the offenders brought to book.

Bullets were recovered from the bodies of the deadstudents. If the guns had been recovered it could have beenestablished through ballistic evidence from which gun those

[ . ]

2006 26669670

bullets were fired and scientifically the culprits could havebeen traced but nothing has happened. Everything has beenswept under the carpet and though the President assured usthat there would be an independent investigation and thatthe law would bring the offenders to book nothing hashappened in regard to the murder of these five students. Igave the President the photographs of these five boys whowere engaged in higher education. Some of them were inUniversity. Others had completed the GCE Advanced LevelExamination and were awaiting admission to the University.The President in my presence handed over those pictures tohis Secretary and told him, Look at these boys who havebeen killed in Trincomalee. But nothing has happened.Nothing whatever has happened. Violence has continued,Sir, thereafter. As I said before, I will not be dealing withevery incident of violence.

Thereafter, Sir, there was a meeting between the Sri LankanGovernment and the LTTE in Geneva on the 22nd and 23rdof February, 2006. In this atmosphere of violence, Sir, that Ihave referred to briefly, the parties agreed with the efforts ofthe Norwegians that this situation must not continue andthat the parties must agree to meet and take some decisionsin regard to how the continuing violence could be de-escalated and how at least some measure of normalcy couldbe restored in the North-East. The parties, the Sri LankanGovernment and the LTTE, met Sir, in Geneva and I might forthe purpose of record, and in order to state what happenedafter this meeting in Geneva make reference to some of themost significant paragraphs of the statement read out by theNorwegian facilitator Erik Solheim at the conclusion of thetalks. I quote:

The GoSL and the LTTE are committed to respecting andupholding the Ceasefire Agreement, and reconfirmed theircommitment to fully co-operate with and respect the rulings of the SriLanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM).

The GoSL and the LTTE are committed to taking all necessarymeasures to ensure that there will be no intimidation, acts of violence,abductions or killings.

The LTTE is committed to taking all necessary measures to ensurethat there will be no acts of violence against the security forces andpolice. The GoSL is committed to taking all necessary measures inaccordance with the Ceasefire Agreement to ensure that no armedgroup or person other than Government security forces will carry armsor conduct armed operations.

The parties agreed to meet again in Geneva on the 19thand 21st of April, 2006, a meeting which did not take placeand I will, Sir, briefly refer to why that meeting did not takeplace.

Sir, what I state now is a matter that can be ascertained.This is not merely my knowledge but my colleagues assureme that after this Agreement arrived at in Geneva on the 22ndand 23rd of February the LTTE did not engage in any vio-lence whatever against any member of the armed forces orthe police force in the whole of the rest of February, in thewhole of March and in the first week of April. There was noviolent act on the part of the LTTE against any member of the

armed forces or the police. If anyone contradicts me in regardto this matter I would like that person to give me specificinformation in regard to any act of violence committed bythe LTTE in the balance of the month of February, in themonth of March and in the first week of the month of April.

On the other hand, Sir, the Sri Lankan armed forces and theparamilitary groups in the course of this period continued toattack Tamil civilians and continue to attack pro-LTTEpersons or LTTE cadres and there were several acts ofviolence that were committed in breach of this Agreementthat the Government arrived at in Geneva on the 22nd 23rdof February, 2006. Following those acts of violence, Sir, com-mitted by the members of the security forces or members ofthe paramilitary groups working along with the securityforces there was the murder of Mr. V. Vigneswaran, the head ofTrincomalee District Tamil Peoples Forum on the 8th of April,2006. Mr. Vigneswaran, Sir, was an employee of the Bank ofCeylon and he was shot within the premises of the Bank ofCeylon. On either side of the Bank of Ceylon there are twocheckpoints. One, before the Bank as you go along InnerHarbour Road, and the other, beyond the Bank along InnerHarbour Road. The entrance to the naval dockyard is just afew yards away. One can see the dockyard from the Bank ofCeylon and Inner Harbour Road. Vigneswaran was gunneddown in the morning on the 8th within the premises of theBank of Ceylon and according to eye witnesses the assailanthad run towards the naval dockyard, in the direction of thenaval dockyard.

Before he escaped he would have had to pass thecheckpoint beyond the bank before the naval dockyard gate.In order to arrive at the place where he committed the crime,he has have to pass a check point on either one of thesetwo sides. The man escaped. The man was not arrested.Nothing happened to him. It was thereafter that there wasany violence committed by the LTTE. The LTTE havingsat back with folded arms in accordance with thecommitment made in Geneva in the balance of the monthof February, in the month of March and up to the 8th ofApril, it was thereafter that there was any act of violenceon the part of the LTTE. I want to ask the Government onthe Floor of this House, how can you justify acts of violencebeing committed by your armed forces or by members ofthe Paramilitary groups working with you in the context ofyour commitment made in Geneva in February 2006,throughout the period of February after the agreement,throughout March and during the first week of April?

Then, Sir, a bomb exploded in Trincomalee on the 12thof April. One does not know who exploded that bomb butthere are people who seriously take the view that this bombwas exploded by an agent provocateur in order to createviolence in Trincomalee. We all know that there are severalspoilers, persons who want to disturb and spoil the peaceprocess and persons who are wanting to create trouble inorder to be able to succeed in their efforts to spoil the peaceprocess. Subsequent to the bomb explosion, Sir, there were

671672

killings and there were acts of arson. A number of Tamilpersons were killed, after the bomb explosion, by unrulymobs, by hooligans. A number of shops belonging to Tamilpeople were burnt after the bomb explosion. Much damagewas caused. I want to place before this House, I want toread to this House the report that had been made by a factfinding mission of civil society members who went fromcolombo to Trincomalee for this purpose and the civilsociety members, Sir, were all members of the Sinhalesecommunity, not one of them was non - Sinhalese. They wereSunila Abeysekara and Udaya Kalupathirana from theINFORM, Ramani Muttetuwegama from the Law andSociety Trust, the daughter of our much respected departedColleague Sarath Muttetuwegama, Leader of the CommunistParty, Bhavani Fonseka of the Centre for Policy Alternatives,Buddhika Weerasinghe, a freelance journalist and P.D.Gunatilaka of the Devasarana Development Centre. Theywere all Sinhalese members of civil society in Colombo andrespected people who travelled to Trincomalee on the 16thand 17th of April and met with the civilian population inTrincomalee and tried to ascertain what has happened. Now,I will read to the House, sir, a certain paragraph from thatreport which has been sent to me. This is what they state,Sir. I quote:

Most of the people we spoke to in the town, who were mostlyTamil or non sinhala felt that the speed with which the violence eruptedafter the explosion indicated it was a pre-planned attack.

That finding would reveal that it was a pre-planned attackwhich meant that the explosion itself could have been apart of that plan. It further states, I quote :

Two of them referred to the situation as being reminiscent ofthe anti-Tamil riots of July 1983 Some of the Shops that had beenset on fire were the only ones in a row of several that had been thusattacked. People pointed out that the shops that had been burnt stoodnext to ones owned by Sinhalese traders which were left unharmed.This was a very visual indicator of the ethnically selective nature ofthe attacks. Most people confirmed an official figure of a total of 30shops burnt, of which the majority belonged to Tamils. 2 Muslimshops were also burnt in the violence

There are hon. Members in this House who talk very loudabout the Sinhalese in Trincomalee being attacked.Yesterday even Reverend Rathana Thero, the Leader of theJHU said this. I am not saying that the Sinhalese peoplehave not been attacked. We do not support that. I for onestand against any form of violence against any persons inTrincomalee irrespective of whether he is Tamil, Sinhaleseor Muslim. But, this is what a Sinhalese fact finding missionsays. In a row of shops a number of shops have been burnt.All the shops burnt belong to the Tamil people and therewas not one Sinhalese shop burnt in that row of shops. Theygo further, Sir. I will read to you certain further paragraphsfrom that report. It stacks, I quote :

All observers pointed out that while the rioting lasted for betweentwo and three hours during the day, the armed forces and the Policedid almost nothing to prevent the violence from taking place.

Armed forces and police did nothing to prevent theviolence from taking place. Who is saying this? It is not I.This is said by members from the respected Sinhala civilsociety who went to Trincomalee. If further says;

Subsequent to the attack, it was evident that there was a highmilitary and police presence in the area.

I go on, Sir, to read some further paragraphs of that report.It states, I quote :

There are several very credible eye-witness account about themanner in which the security forces stood by and allowed the arsonand killing to take place. A vehicle carrying four members of theNonviolent Peace Force (NPF) was attacked by a gang of about thirtypeople. Its windscreen and back window were badly damaged andone NPF team member was slapped and hit on his head by personswho lunged in through an open window. All this took place veryclose to a check point. Moments before this incident, the NPF teamwas advised by the same check point that it was safe for them toproceed. When the NPF team was attacked and drove back to thecheck point, the security forces there simply observed the entireincident and did nothing to prevent the violence.

In another incident, when the crowd tried to break into the cashvending machine outside the Hatton National Bank, the banks securityguard tried to prevent them from doing so. The security guard waswarned off by the security forces against doing anything to the mob,which resulted in the crowd damaging the cash vending machine andassaulting the security guard.

In the bank, a Sinhala mob wants to break that cashvending machine. The security guard tries to prevent that.The security forces warned the security guard not to interfereand the mob goes and breaks the cash vending machine andthey assault the security guard. Is this the type of security Mr.Speaker, that this Government wants the Tamil people toplace their reliance on? I want an answer to this question. NoMr. Speaker, that can never happen.

I must read to you at this stage, having read this report ofthis independent Fact-Finding Mission comprising ofleading members of the civil society in Colombo, excerpts ofa letter I wrote to the late President, Jayewardene in August1983 after the violence in Trincomalee in June, July 1983.

I quote from my own letter which completely supports andsubstantiates the position taken by the civil societymembers and clearly indicates that in the past, 1983 to 2006,and even now 24 years later the position remains the same.I quote from the letter written by me, it states:

Houses in various parts of Trincomalee town and its suburbs wereattacked and burnt. Areas in which Tamils were distinctly in a majoritywere attacked. Such attacks could never have taken place without theactive support of the security forces and without the fullestconsciousness on the part of the Sinhala people, that the security forceswould protect them against any retaliation or resistance by the Tamilpeople.

The Tamil people were undoubtedly in a pitiable state. They werenot given any protection whatsoever by the security forces, the Sinhalaoffenders and attackers were in no way prevented from attacking theTamil people by the security forces, and the Tamil peoples right to

[ . ]

2006 26673674

defend themselves, in the exercise of their right of private defence ofperson and property was taken away by the direct intervention of thesecurity forces. The Tamil people were intimidated into the belief bythe States Security Forces who are largely Sinhala that if any harmbefell a Sinhala man even in the exercise of the right of private defenceby a Tamil, the retaliation by the security forces would be harsh andsevere.

One further significant feature in respect of the acts of arson was thatwhen a Tamil house or shop had been set on fire, and if other Tamils inthe neighbourhood tried to rush and attempt to extinguish the fire,Service personnel on duty would point their guns at such Tamil peopleand drive them back. The Arsonists had freedom of movement, thesecurity forces would grant them that freedom, but innocent Tamilswho wanted to extinguish the fire of a neighbours property wouldhave no such freedom. Can anything else be more dastardly, anddemonstrate fully the hostility of Service personnel to Tamil people.

This is what I said in 1983 in my letter to the late PresidentJayewardene after the riots in June, July 1983. It was anisland wide phenomenon and this has been confirmed 23years later by the members of the civil society who went fromColombo consequent to the violence in Trincomalee.

Then, of course, Sir, we had this unfortunate attemptedassassination of the Army Commander, Lieutenant GeneralSarath Fonseka, whom I know quite well and who was at onepoint of time the Area Commander in Trincomalee also and Ihave been very much in touch with him at that point of time.I have known and met him later in Jaffna when he was theArea Commander in Jaffna. Consequent to that attemptedassassination, Sir, the Government claimed that it wascarrying out certain deterrent strikes against identified LTTEtargets. That was the Governments position. I happened tobe out of the country on that day, Sir, but watched on BBCthe interview given by the Government Spokesman onDefence Affairs, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, on behalfof the Government. He was asked by the BBC announcerwhether the Government had carried out aerial attacks inTrincomalee. His answer was No, I am not aware of anyaerial attack the Government has carried out. That was theanswer. He said, There were some attacks carried out by theLTTE on the Navy. As far as we are aware, Sir, after theattempted assassination of the Army Commander on the 25thof April, the LTTE has not carried out any attacks against theNavy. But we all know and now the Government accepts - itis a matter of public knowledge - that aerial attacks werecarried out by the armed forces against so - called identifiedLTTE targets.

Now, Sir, who were the persons killed in these attacks, inthe aerial bombardment? There were bombings from the air;there were shelling from the sea and there were shelling fromland towards so - called LTTE tatgets where the Tamilpopulation substantially lived.

Now I want to read to you, Sir, the names of the pesonswho were killed. They were attacking identified LTTEtargets. Mrs. S. Bagawathipillai, 67 years of age. I leaveout the other names. Meiyan Krishanthan, a boy, four yearsof age ; Navaratnam, 58years of age; T. RanjithamalarNavarathnam, 56 yeras of age ; Mrs. Nagamma Paththiniyan,

65 years of age ; Thuraiappa Satheesh, ten years of age. Apartfrom the ten persons who were killed in Trincomalee, Tamilpersons, some of whose names and ages I mentioned, thereare also some other people who were killed. Elderly peopleand young children were amongst those killed. Forty sevenpeople were injured, all civilians. One building of theSenaiyoor Central Collage was destroyed. One building ofthe Sampoor Sri Murugan Vidyalayam was destroyed.Several houses were damaged ; sixty livestock were killed.

Not being content with bombing on the 25th of April,they carried out the bombing the next morning, on the 26thof April and what happened? This time, the bombing tookplace in a village called Thakwanagar inhabited by Muslimpeople. Moulavi Jenudeen, 37 years, was killed. AkramMudliyar, 25 years and the wife of Jenudean, were killed.Muneera, an 18 year old girl and the sister of Mrs. Jenudean,was killed. Nine Muslim persons were injured. They wereadmitted to hospital. I got their names here. Ismail Ehiya,Abu Bakr Fazees, Munas, Akram, Rameeze Muniram,Silmiya, Mubarak, Abdul Gaffoor Ibrahim, Illiyas, allMuslims. Were these all Tigers? You say that you carriedout deterrent strikes against identified LTTE targets. Isanybody saying these people were Tigers? The elderly Tamilpeople, the young Tamil children and all these MuslimPeople, were they Tigers? Several houses were damaged.

I want to point out, Sir, with a deep sense ofdisappointment that there is not one Sinhalese man amongstthe killed people or injured people. I want to ask theGovernment, would you have ever carried out such attacksagainst a Sinhalese village or if Sinhalese people were livingin the locality which was bombed from the air? Would youhave carried out any such attack and exposed the sinhalesepeople to any such danger? You do not care about whathappens to the Tamils and the Muslims. You are preparedto bomb them and kill them. But would you have dared toattack any village if sinhalese people were living there?The JVP carried on an armed struggle for a long period oftime. They were in hiding in various places. Did you attackany single Sinhalese village from the air? Did you bombany single Sinhalese village from the air?

I want to state, Sir, that this aerial bombing and thekilling of innocent civilians in this way is againstinternational law, against international covenants. It is abreach of the Geneva covenant ; it is a crime aginsthumanity. You have no right to carry out any such aerialbombing from the air and kill innocent Tamil civilians andMuslim civilians. We shall raise this matter in theappropriate fora.

This is what, Sir, Article 6(1) of the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights states. I quote :

Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shallbe protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.

675676

[ . ]

Have not these poor innocent Tamil civilians and Muslimcivilians been arbitrarily deprived of their lives? Article 4(1) Sir, of the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights states, I quote :

In time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nationand the existence of which is officially proclaimed, the States Partiesto the present Covenant may take measures derogating from theirobligations under the present Covenant to the extent strictly requiredby the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures arenot inconsistent with their other obligations under international lawand do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race, colour,sex, language, religion or social origin.

Here you have bombed from the air Tamil - speakingareas, areas in which the Tamil people and the Tamil -speaking Muslim people live. You have done thatindiscriminately and arbitrarily only for the reason that theSinhalese were not living there. If the Sinhalese were livingthere you would never have done that.

Now, Sir, I want to move on and refer to one or two othermatters, a few other matters before I conclude. TheUthayan newspaper office in Jaffna was attacked on the2nd of May, and two persons were killed.

The Government, I am sorry to state has been indulgingin a great deal of misinformation in ragard to many of thesematters. When the attack took place on the Uthayannewspaper office and those persons were killed, theGovernment arrested some innocent students somewhereclose by and tried to make out that they were the personswho had attacked the Uthayan newspaper office andkilled those people. Adeliberate, diabolical falsehood! Theynot merely commit the crime. but spread misinformation inorder to mislead not merely the people in this country butalso the internationl community.

Journalists like Sivaram, Nadesan and Nimalarajan havebeen killed. Suhirtharajan in Trincomalee had been killed.we have raised these matters on the Floor of the House. Wehave been assured and told by the Government, by theDefence Minister, by the Prime Minister and Minister ofInternal Administration, We are investigating. We will bringthe offenders to book and we will place all the facts beforethe House. Has anything happened Mr. Speaker? You havebeen presiding at all these Sessions. Have you ever heardthe Government coming out with any statement in regardto any one of these killings? Everything is being whitewashed. Everything is being swept under the carpet. Whatmoral right do you have to complain about killings whenthis is happening under your own Government? No, Mr.Speaker, this cannot continue. This state of affairs connotcontinue. The international community must takecognizance of the fact that Tamil-speaking civilians arebeing indiscriminately and arbitrarily killed by theGovernment and by security forces.

This situation, Sir, cannot continue.

Then, Sir, I refer to the killing of 15 civilians in a village inKayts called Allaipiddi Sinnathurai Sivanesan, 46 years old,was killed. Yadusan, a four month old baby was killed.Dhanushkantha, a four year old child was killed. JosephAnthonymuthu, 64 years, was killed. T. Sellathurai, 61 years,injured. Murugesu Shanmugalingam, 72 years, was killed.Parameshwari, wife of Murugesu Shanmuglingam, 65 years,was killed. Were they Tigers ? Who killed them ? Were 65years, 60 years, four years and four months old people Tigers? Are you not ashamed of yourselves ?

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)They think all the Tamils are Tigers.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Are you not ashamed of yourselves? Can you permit thistype of killing, slaughter and massacre of Tamil civiliansliving peacefully in their villages ? Today, Sir, everyone ofthese people has left this village. The village has beenabandoned by all these people, because the people livingthere feared that if they cantinue to live there, they would bemassacred.

NGO establishments have been attacked. In Trincomalee,Sir, just a couple of days ago, three NGO establishments wereattacked INTERSOS, ZOA and Non violent Peace force.Why have they been attacked ? You do not give relief to ourpeople.You do not look after our people. When our peopleflee their homes, when they are destitute, when they arestarving, you do not adequately look after them. It is theseNGOs that look after them. Do you want these people to dieof starvation ? Do you want these people to die of malnutrition? Do you want these people to flee the country ? Thousandsof people have been displaced, Sir, within their own district.They have gone to safer areas. Thousands of people havegone to other districts. Over a thousand people, I think todayalmost 1,500 people have fled acrosss the seas to India.

Some boats have capsized and some people have died.Some people have gone missing. Recently when a boat wasabout to capsize, some Sinhalese fishermen-at least they havea kind heart - saved those people and brought them to theshore. The police arrested them and got them remanded. Ispoke to the IGP. When I phoned the IGP, he talked of humansmuggling. I asked him, Can you not see that these werepeople who in order to save their lives and live a little longerin this world were running away across the see ? This is whatis happening to our people, Sir. We are inclined to the view,Sir, that there is some sinister objective in all this being doneto the Tamil people. You want to subjugate the Tamil people.You want to terrorize them. You want to practice Stateterrorism on them and you think you can subjugate them bydoing so. I would like to state on the Floor of this House, Sir,that the Tamil people are far too resilient to be able to ever

2006 26677678

subordinate themselves or submit themselves in that way.They will not. Sir, why is all this happening ? There is nopurpose, Sir, in our talking about all these things, unless wecan also say why it is happening.

I would like to place the history, Sir, very briefly of how wecame to this situation. There was a cesefire agreement inFebruary 2002. There were several rounds of talks. There wasthe Oslo Declaration which stated that the Sir LankaGovernment and the LTTE agree to explore a federal solutionbased upon the right of internal self-determination in theareas of histrical habitation of the Tamil-speaking peoplewhich in terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, is theNorthern and Eastern Provinces within the framework of aunited country. That is what the Oslo Declaration said. TheLTTE talked about setting up of an Interim Self-GoverningAuthority. The Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris - I do not know whetherhe is present here or not, he is not present here who was theChief Government Negotiator at that time, talked to the LTTEand persuaded the LTTE that rather than setting up an InterimSelf-Governing Authority which might run into someconsitutional obstacles, they must find some other mechanismand they agreed to set up the SIRHN - Sub Committee ofImmediate Rehabilitation and Humanitarian Needs. SIRHNnever got off the ground. There were some public servantswho saw to it that it never got off the ground. SIRHN collpsed.Nothing was happening. Talks preparatory to the Tokyo Talkstook place in Washington on 14th of April 2003. The LTTEwas not invited to those talks because the LTTE is a bannedorganization in the USA and they could not go ther. SIRHNhad collapsed. Normalcy had not been resorted in the lives ofTamil people. They were still languishing in refugee campsand welfare centres. It was not possible to resettle the Tamilpeople. They raised obstacles in the way. Armed forces werenot happy about Tamil people being resettled andrehabilitated. LTTE pulled out of the talks.

I would like to place on record Sir, two letters sent by theLTTE. One was to the then Prime Minister, the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe and the other was to Mr. Vidar Helgessen,the Deputy Foreign Minister of Norway who was the chiefparticipant on behalf of the Norwegian Government in thenegotiating process at that point of time. Mr. Balasingham ina letter to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe said this, I quote ;

In spite of our goodwill and trust, your government has opted tomarginlize our organisation in approaching the international communityfor economic assistance. ........

We refer to the exclusion of the LTTE from the crucial InternationalDonor Conference held in Washington on 14 April 2003, in prepara-tion for the major donor conference to be held in Japan in June. Weview the exclusion of the LTTE, the principal partner to peace and theauthentic representatives of the Tamil people from discussions on criti-cal matters affecting the economic and social welfare of the Tamilnation, as a grave breach of good faith.

He went on to say Sir, that your Government was aware ofthe fact that they were banned in USA and that they couldnot therefore go to the USA and this Conference could havewell been held elsewhere that they could have themselves

participated and then come to the Tokyo Conference. Yournot doing that amounted to breach of faith and they mustpoint that out.

He goes on to say Sir, I quote;

As you are aware, considerable optimism and hopes were raisedamong the people when your government, shortly after assumingpower, entered into a ceasefire agreement with our oganisation,bringing to an end twenty years of savage and bloody conflict.......

Expectations were further raised when both sides began direct ne-gotiations with Narwegian facilitation. In particular, there was a justifi-able expectation that the peace process would address the urgent andimmediate existential problems facing the people of the north and east.Particularly the million people........

At the point of time a million people have been displaced.

Who are internally displaced by the conflict and are languishing inwelfare centres and refugee camps.

As such, the Ceasefire Agreement included crucial conditions ofrestoring normalcy which required the vacation, by occupying SriLankan troops, of Tamil homes, schools, places of worship and publicbuildings.

Which was not done or only partly done under the RanilWickremasinghe Government. Not done fully or only partlydone!

We have repeatedly raised the issue of continuing suffering of ourpeople at every round of talks with your government. Yournegotiators repeated assurances that the resettlement of the displacedpeople would be expedited have proven futile. The negotiations havebeen successful

This is important Sir. I want to place this on record. This isvery important.

....... in so far as significant progress has been made in key areas,such as the agreement to expiore federalism on the basis of the right toself-determination of our people. But this progress has not been matchedby any improvement in the continuing hardships being faced by ourpeople as a result of your Governments refusal to implement thenormalisation aspects of the Ceasefire Agreement and subsequentagreement.

Mr. Balasingham points out in his letter Sir, that thoughthey have come to an agreement in regard to the contours ofa political solution there has not been any progress made inregard to humanitarian questions. He further goes on to state;

Under these circumstances the LTTE leadership has decided tosuspend its participation in the negotiations for the time being. We willnot be attending the donor conference in Japan in June.

While we regret that we were compelled to make this painfuldecision, we wish to reiterate our commitment to seek a negotiatedpolitical solution to the ethnic question.

We also urge the Government of Sri Lanka to restore confidence inthe peace process amongst the Tamil people by fully implementing,without further delay, the normalisation aspects of the CeasefireAgreement and permit the immediate resettlement of the internallydisplaced people of the north-east.

679680

[ . ]That was the position, Sir. That was why the LTTE pulled outof the talks.

Mr. Balasingham said Sir, in his letter to the NorwegianDeputy Foreign Minister at the same time and I quote, becausethat is important:

Originally the idea of an interim administrative structure for theNorth East was mooted by the LTTE months before the last generalelections. The UNP leadership endorsed the proposal and the PrimeMinister Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe openly campaigned in support ofan interim administrative structure with the active participation of theLTTE. As you are aware, the issue of interim administration was takenup for discussion at the inaugural session of the peace talks in Sattahip,Thailand. Responding to the proposal of the LTTE delegation, Prof.Peiris explained the legal and constitutional constraints involved in theformation of such an administrative body outside the parameters of theSri Lanka Constitution. To avoid political controversy in the earlystages of the talks the negotiating parties decided to replace the idea ofan administrative structure with the establishment of a Joint TaskForce for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Activities for the Northeast.At the second session of peace talks, the negotinating teams agreed totransform the Joint Task Force into a Sub-committee on ImmediateHumanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs (SIRHN). The role of this Sub-Committee was to identify humanitarian and reconstruction needs ofthe North - East population and priorities implementation of activitiesto meet these needs. The Committee would give primacy to activitiesaimed at rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and tohumanitarian mine action programmes and other activities supportingthe return of IDPs to their original homes such as reconstruction ofroads, production infrastructure, health facilities, schools and similarissues.

This is what they wanted which was not done.Mr. Balasingham went on Sir, I again quote:

Unfortunately SIRHN failed to function effectively and no progresshas been made towards alleviating the hardships and suffering of thedisplaced population. Despite the good will and the fullest co-operationof the LTTE. SIRHN has not been able to deliver on the expectations ofthe people. This lack of performance and the failure to produce tangibleresults on urgent humanitarian issues has eroded all confidence of theTamil people in SIRHN, the only single institution that was createdthrough lengthy sessions of dialogue.

That was the position Sir, of the LTTE. When they pulled out of thetalks in April 2003, they said, We were kept out of Washington. Thatshould have been avoided. SIRHN did not succeed. On the persuasionof your Minister Professor G.L. Peiris that constitutional controversiesshould not be created we were prepared to even work with a mechanismlike SIRHN. We now know that some public servants deliberatelyobstructed the performance of SIRHN and the implementation ofdecisions made at SIRHN, which collapsed. But LTTE did not keepquiet. LTTE interacted with the Norwegian Government. They preparedproposals for an Interim Self-Governing Authority which were sentto the Ranil Wickeremasingh Government through the Norwegianfacilitator on the 31st of October 2003. Everybody knows whathappened after that. Four days after the proposals were sent on the31st of October 2003, on the 4th of November 2003, the then Presidentstruck, taking away some important portfolios directly linked to thepeace process. Subsequently Parliament was dissolved and there wereelections and there were changes in the Government.

BY those steps, Sir, any talks on the proposals in regard tothe ISGA were not initiated. The LTTE was quite prepared todiscuss its proposals. Its proposals may be tall in order. But

they were prepared to discuss them; they were prepared tocome to an agreement with the Government. That was thedire need of the Tamil people in the North-East at that pointof time. But such discussions were not permitted becauseimportant portfolios were taken away. The Government wasdestabilized and subsequently even the Norwegianssuspended their facilitation for a period of time. Andsubsequently the government changed. President ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga told the delegates of the TNA atJanadhipathi Mandiraya on the 10th of June, 2004, at ameeting that went on till past midnight that she was going tostart discussions with the LTTE on the ISGA proposals thoughshe did not agree with some of them and though originallyshe wanted those discussions to be linked with discussionsin regard to a final solution, she was now prepared to startdiscussions on the ISGA. But such discussions nevercommenced.

If tsunami had not taken place in December, 2004, we mayalready be in a situation of war. Fortunately tsunami did notallow the war to start. Sir, the P-TOMS structure was anagreement to merely facilitate relief being provided to peopleaffected by the tsunami. These were people, Sir, who wereaffected by the war have been displaced or dislocated andbecome refugees. They, once again were affected by thetsunami and the P-TOMS structure was merely meant for theGovernment and the LTTE to work together in those districtsin the North-East for the people who have been affected bythe tsunami. What happened to P-TOMS? A purelyadministrative structure was abrogated. It was aborted. TheP-TOMS? Could not take off. My Friends on my right withbeards and Friends on my left reverends with yellow robescould not stand the sight of the P-TOMS Agreement and theP-TOMS Agreement was abrogated though PresidentChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, to make up for hermistakes, her lapses in regard to the ISGA, thought at leastthe P-TOMS would be a way to take the peace process forward.

Sir, we have interacted with LTTE cadres in our respectivedistnots and met LTTE leaders at that point of time. After theCeasefire Agreement, Sir, they were absolutely keen onstarting reconstruction work and development activity inthe North-East. They wanted to resettle our people. Theywanted to rehabilitate our people. They wanted to give themvarious facilities. They wanted to work on development. Butan armed group which had fought a savage war, which hadrun through your army camps in several places, though theywere prepared to come into the peace process and take part indevelopment activity you failed to enthuse them. You failedto encourage them. You failed to grasp that opportunity. Youfailed to embrace them. And today we are in this position andwho are the people who suffer most, Sir, as au result of this?That is not big people not people in Government, it is poorpeople, the poor Tamil speaking people, particularly theTamil people and also our Muslim brethren who live with ussuffer as a result of this situation.

People, Sir, are tired of talk There are Ministers who comehere and talk of Amirthalingam and talk of NeelamTiruchelvam. Amirthalingam and Neelam Tiruchelvam were

2006 26681682

very dear people. I also was with them. I was also with themin all the negotiations that had been held with successivegovernments. I was there. What happened? Nothinghappened? I was with Amirthalingam. I was with NeelamTiruchelvam. I worked with everyone. What did we achieve?Today, you come and say what happened to Amirthalingam ?It you all had dealt with Amirthalingam honouably, if youall had dealt with Chelvanayakam honourably, we wouldnot be in this position today and you have got the guts, thegumption to come here and talk about Amirthalingam andNeelam Tiruchelvam as if, if they had lived everything wouldhave been resolved. They lived long enough. They talked toyou long enough, negotiated very sensibly, very rationally.What happened? Nothing happened. Nothing, Sweet nothing.

Therefore, Sir, we do not want to listen to his speeches andwe do not want to listen to these pious statements made bythe President saying, I am interested in dialogue. I want totalk to the LTTE. I want to talk to Prabhakaran. we are notgoing to be any longer taken for a ride by these gimmicks.We want action. Our people want something concrete. Lookat the recent history, Sir? Why do you go very far away? weagreed in Ganeva that we will not attack the army and thepolice. The LTTE agreed. The whole of February, whole ofMarch, first week of April, nothing nothing happened. Youkeep on attacking the Tamil civilians and the LTTE cadresand then Vigneswaran gets killed on the 8th of April 2006and the whole thing breaks out. Who is responsible? Whobrought about that situation? Who failed to observe thecommitment that was made in Geneva? The Government.The Government troops and the paramilitary groups workingwith the Government troops. That cannot be denied. That isthe truth.

Therefore, Sir we have one million people displaced duringthe last stages of the war. A substantial number of them stillcontinue to be displaced. More and more people are beingdisplaced now. You failed to bring about a situation ofnormalcy with the co-operation of the LTTE when that waspossible during several years to resettle and rehabilitate theTamil people, to re-build Tamil areas, to reconstruct themand thereby give both the Tamil people, the LTTE and all ofus hope that we could place our reliance in the peace process.Probaly, Sir, there are certain political forces or spoilers. Youknow who they are. I do not have to mention their names.There are armed forces amongest the armed forces segmentswho do not want the peace process to succeed. They havetheir vested interests in the peace process. May be thepolitical forces have got vested political interests and maybe that some of the armed forces have vested economicinterests in the continuance of the war. Tamils are onec againbeing driven out, Sir, Armed forces were never happy withthe resettlement of the Tamils. They were never happy. Weknow that. We know that resettling the Tamil people in theirdislocated villages was an enormous task, a stupendous task,almost an insurmountable task because the armed forceswere never happy with the settlement of the Tamil people intheir villages. Why, Sir, Why is that? They think that if war

breaks out the Tamils will be with the LTTE. That is thesimple answer. Therefore, they do not want the Tamils tocome. I told General Sarath Fonseka once, General, you arethinking of how to fight a war when the war breaks out. I amthinking of how to prevent the war breaking out I think, if theTamil people are resettled, Tamil people are rehabilitated,Tamil people are happy, they have got their rights, thennobody can go back to war. Therefore, if we can prevent thewar breaking out you do not have to think about how to fighta war when the war starts. These political forces, Sir, who areagainst the peace procese for their vested political interests,who are spoilers, are working hand in glove with sections ofthe armed forces. The Government, I must state very frankly,is not able to either control these political forces or controlthe armed forces. That is the truth. The Government, Sir, cansay, We are prepared to talk. We are prepared to nogotiate.We want to settle But they cannot control these spoilers.They cannot control these political forces. They cannotcontrol the armed forces either. What is the inference that wecan draw? Is it that the Government lacks sincerity or theGovernment is not in control?

My good Friends from the left, Sir, for whom we have a lotof respect, the Hon. Dew Gunasekera, the Hon. Tissa Vitharana,come here and say, Come, come we must talk. How longhave we talked? I remember, those days, sir, during the AllParty Conference in 1984, we used to go the the house of Dr.Colvin R. de Silva. We used to meet Mr. Pieter Keunemanand talk to them for hours on it. The Government, Sir, mustdemonstrate its sincerity. The Government must begin tohave a feeling for the poor Tamil people in the Nother-East.The Government must ensure the security of the Tamilpeople. The Government must ensure that the Tamil peopleare looked after, that their needs are attended to. That is notbeing done today. That is what is required, Sir.

I am told, Sir, and I do not know how far that is correct,that there is a military officer who is going to be appointedas Government Agent in Trincomalee. This is something Iheard late last night that the Government which alreadyhas a retired military ofiicer as the Governor of the North-East Province wants to appoint as Government Agent inTrincomalee, a military officer. I do not know who he is. Ido not know why they want to militarize the wholesituation in Trincomalee in particular and the North-Eastgenerally. Why only the military? Is the Government sayingthe there is no public servant in this country in publicservice today who is fit enough to perform civilianfunctions in Trincomalee as the Government Agent?Trincomalee, Sir, is substantially a Tamil speaking District.Almost 75 per cent of the people in Trincomalee speakTamil. Tamil people are the single larget community inTrincomalee. Out of the four hon. Members of Parliament,two hon. Members of Parliament, myself and the Hon.Thurairetnasingam belong to the Tamil National Alliance.There is one Muslim Member of Parliament and there isone Sinhalese Member of Parliament. We have never hada Tamil Government Agent in Trincomalee. We always had

683684

[ . ]a Sinhalese Government Agent. We knew how to keep himin control. Now, we are going to have a Sinhalese armyofficer as the Government Agent in charge of civilian dutiesin Trincomalee. Are you saying that your entire publicservice is so bereft of talent to perform civilian functionsthat you cannot find a person, a civilian to be posted toTrincomalee as Government Agent? Tell me, I will giveyou an excellent Tamil person to be appointed asGovernment Agent Trincomalee who will do an excellentjob. This is Sir, sad. I am not threatening anybody. I amnot intimidating anybody. Please do not misunderstand me.

I belong to Trincomalee. My roots go very deep into thatsoil. That is the land they brought Koneswaram.

Sir, Paul Peiris in his historical works has said that therewas an Eeswaram of Lord Siva, Koneswaram in Trincomaleefacing the great bay of Kottiyar before Vijaya came to SriLanka. That is said not by a Tamil but by an emintentSinhala historian, Sir Paul Peiris. Please remember that.Trincomalee is the soil of Bathrakali Ambal. Trincomaleeis the soil of villundi Murugan, the Katragama Deviyo.The temple is in front of my house, at which I worship,from the time I was an infant and which I go to regulary.Please do not meddle with that soil.

When Charan Singh, Prime Minister of India came to SriLanka for a function connected with the Mahawelidevelopment he came to Trincomalee. It was in the late1970s or early 1980s. President Jayewardene requested meto be present at the temple and ensure that the PrimeMinister was received well. I received the Prime MinisterSri Charan Singh at the Koneswaram Temple inTrincomalee. When he got off the car he said, I have cometo Dhakshina Kailas. That is Koneswaram. That is ThiruKoneswaram. Thiru Konamalai comes from ThiruKoneswaram. That is Dhakshina Kailas. In North India youhave Uththara Kailas.

Please do not meddle with Trincomalee. We are smallpeople. You are big people. You are in Govenment. Youwield power. We do not wield power. We have no power atall. I could have been Minister in every one of yourGovenments. We never wanted that. We wanted the rightsof our people. We have no power. We are small people.You are big people. You have plenty of power. But pleasedo not evoke the ire of our deities; Lord Koneswaram,Bathrakali Ambal, Villundi Murugan. Please do not evoketheir ire by being unjust and by committing any justice. Ifyou commit injustice you will no longer be big people.Please remember that. I humbly request you to rememberthat.

I will conclude Sir, because I have taken a fair amountof time. But I appeal to the Government to stop thisharassment of Tamil people.

Sir, I got a fax last evening from a village in Trincomaleesaying that the armed forces are harassing them, that theyare being harassed by Sinhala home guards, that theycannot live there and that they want to flee. They areseekign my advice. This is what is happening in everysingle village in the North-East. Please stop this. Pleaseallow our people to live. Please implement thecommitments you made in Geneva in February, 2006. Wewant the talks to start in a meaningful way wherecommitments made are implemented. We want a peacefulresolution of the conflict. We do not want the war tocommence once again beacause if the war commences ourpeople will suffer the most. Please be honest. Please besincere. Please be straightforward. If you work in that wayI am sure we can find an honourable solution.

I thank you.

On 2.05.06 the most frightening and devastating violenceexperienced so far was the storming of the Uthayan office andpress in Jaffna by 7 masked hoodlums brandishing lethal weapons.These hoodlums are said to belong to paramilitary grop whoseleadership continues to hold high office within successivegovernments. The brutal attack in the ensuing madness and terrorlasting at least 20 minues could only be described as a blood durdling massacre which resulted in the moving down of twoemployees, one of them our marketing Manager and injuries tomany. The bullets sprayed also caused immense damage to propertyparticularly computers, scanners, printers, data and furniture.Complaints made to the police and other authorities have not yieldedthe desired result in spite of giving a detailed statement to the CID.

But so far no action has been taken on these matters andno protection has been given to the new extablishmentwhich publishes the newspapers. Madam, Chairperson, Itable* this letter sent to the Amnesty International on 19thMay, 2006 by the New Uthayan Publication (Pvt) Ltd.,and request you that it be inculded in HANSARD. I thankyou.

Amnesty International,The Human Rights Action Centre,17 - 25 New Inn Yard,UK.

Dear Sir,

TARGETED VIOLENCE ON UTHAYAN &SUDAR OLI NEWSPAPERS

Having had no recourse to law or response from the authorities. Ihave decided or bring this matter up to you as I fear for the life of myfamily and myself, Editor of the paper and of the staff who are attached

* . Produced at end of speech.

to our institution. We are just a media house publishing two Dailies one in the North called Uthayan and one printed in Colombo calledSudar Oli for Islandwide distribution.

What prompted me to write directly to you is that two weeks backour offices in the North were brutally attacked and employees massacred.Leaving two mutilated bodies and others in serious condition. Quiteapart from significant damage to property and equipment.

The Free Media Movement and all the major Electronic and PrintMedia organizations demonstrated and strongly opposed this attack asthis was widely acknowledged to be an attack on the media freedomand the muzzling of an independent news media. We as a responsiblemedia are duty bound to inform the public. Especially in the contextwhere influential sections of the media both State and Private do notobjectively reflect the ground realities pertaining to the conflictparticularly in regard to the grievances and aspirations of the Tamils.

I attach herewith a chronology of events from which you will see thetype of harassment we have had to undergo over the years and earnestlyrequest you to pressurize the powers that be to provide us protectionfrom the threats to my life. The livers of my family. The Editor Mr. N.Vithiyatharan and employees.

Request for SecurityIt will be appreciated that it is my responsibility as their employer toallay the deep fears and insecurity fell by my staff. In the absence ofthis. It will be most difficult to carry out our normal business associatedwith the publication of the two newspapers concerned. The reality isthat most of the employees numbering 200 in both publications arereluctant to report to work. Without an assurance of this security, evenif some of the staff report for work, they will do so in an environmentof fear which is not conducive for productive work. As their employertasked with their welfare. I am conscious of the constant danger theyare exposed to and their resultant fear. Another facet to this, is thesecurity to the buildings, machinery, equipment and data.

Under the circumstances, I kindly request that you exert the necessarypressure through the International Community on the Government ofSri Lanka to genuinely create the environment for Media freedomwhich will include (i) reining in those directly/indirectly responsiblefor the violence and intimidation and (ii) providing adequate securityon a 24 hour basis as follows:

(d) An armed Security person to travel in the vehiele of the ManagingDirector.

(e) An armed Security person to travel in the vehicle of the Editor.

(f) The Managing Director and Editors to have tinted glassesapproval for vehicles.

The Security should be provided on a continuous basis until theclimate of fear and intimidation ceases to exist. Only this will help inenabling my staff and myself to work in an environment free oftension and panic.

TARGETED VIOLENCE ON UTHAYAN & SUDAR OLI DAILYNEWS PAPERS

The Uthayan and Sudar oli Tamil language newspapers publishedfrom jaffna and Colombo respectively boldly publish in an unbiasedmanner the realities of the long drawn out ethnic conflict. The Uthayancommenced publication in 1986 and is the leading and most influentialnewspaper in the North with a strong presence in the East as well. TheSudar Oli which commenced publication more recently has a growingreadership in the rest of the country. It is well known that opinionleaders and the international community involved in the peacefulresolution of the conflict obtain translations to get the true Tamilperspective.

Objectives

The major objective of the two publications is to create an environmentconducive to the realistic and just negotiated resolution of the conflict.We seek to achieve the same through an informant public, especially inthe context where influential sections of the media both state and privatedo not objectively reflect the ground realities pertaining to the conflictparticularly in regard to the grievances and aspirations of the Tamils.The Uthayan and Sudar Oli newspapers have incurred the wrath ofvested interests who are agitated by the powerful presentation of theTamil perspective in all its dimensions. This is especially so in terms ofthe terrible violence, discrimination and harassment unleashed on Tamilcivilians largely by state agencies and paramititaries identified with thestate on one hand and the realities of the military engagement on theother. For example. It was only our publications that revealed thephotographs of the 5 youths killed on the beach in Trincomalee thatcontradicted the claim that they were killed due to the accidentalexplosion of a grenade carried by them. The writer of the report hassince been killed and the photographer is currently in hiding!

Targeted Violence

It is a fact that almost from inception the Uthayan and Sudar Olinewspapers have been at the receiving end of targeted violence andintimidation. They include:

1. Sep. 1987Violence and intimidation during the periodof the IPKF - Indian Peace Keeping Forcesoperations. During this period, thepublication of the Uthayan was suspendedfor two weeks.

2. 27th Sep. 1990Government air raids targeted at the Editor.Uthayan September 27th 1990 althoughmissing their direct target, did cause immensedamage to adjoining houses. It resulted in thedeath of---------

4. Sep. 2000An attempts made on the life of the Editor,Uthayan by cadres said to belong to aparamilitary group whose leadership continuesto hold high office in successive governmentsstormed the playground of jaffna HinduCollege during a cricket match and was thethwarted by the protection given by someof the players and spectators. Complaints madeto the police yielded no action.

5. May. 2001Our Manager, Mr. Nandakumar was crushedto death by an army vehicle whiee returninghome from office. Complaints made to thepolice yielded no action.

6. 23rd June. 2001 Then Uthayan Chief Editor, Mr.Kanamylnathan was knocked down by a vanon the same spot as Mr. Nandakumar on adifferent date said to belong to a paramilitarygroup whose leadership continues to hold highoffice in successive governments. Due to theseriousness of his injuries, he had to betransferred to a hospital in Colombo.Complaints me to the police yielded no action.

7. Aug. 2005The uthayan advertising Office situated inWellawatte in Colombo was targeted forbombing. Although the bomb hurled did notexplode and no injury to persons or damagesto the building were sustained, we werecompelled to discontinue operations at ouradvertising office in Wellawatte due to fearfor the employees lives and the landlordreceiving death threats.

8. 29th Aug. 2005Within a week, the Sudar Oli press situatedin Grandpass was bombed resulting in theloss of life of one caretaker. Several parkedvehicles were damaged beyond repair andthere were also several injuries. Complaintsmade to the police have not yielded the desiredresults.

9.Subsequent to the complaint to the Grandpasspolice. The police demanded the contactdetails of all our staff. It later transpired thatthose who had given their contact details weresubject to intimidation on the basis that theSudar Oli office could be subject to furtherattacks. Under the circumstances. It is hardlysurprising that many employees did not reportfor work.

10. 25th Jan. 2006The reporter who wrote of the 5 youths killedon the beach in Trincomalce early this yearhas since been killed while the photographeris currently in hiding. It was our photographsand report that contradicted the claim thatthey were killed due to the accidentalexplosion of a grenade carried by them.

11. 27th April 2006Three of my employees at the Sudar Oliwere arrested at the entrance to the office andonly released the following day. They wereinformed at the time of their release that theirarrest could have been avoided if only theyhad submitted their contact details. I fail tounderstand as to why they were in custodyfor the whole night since the police couldhave quite easily obtained all the informationthey required and after verifying the samewith our office could have immediatelyreleased them. This is yet another incident ofharassment.

13. 02nd May 2006 However, the most frightening anddevastating violence experienced so far wasthe storming of the Uthayan offices and pressin Jaffna by 7 masked hoodlums brandishinglethal weapons. These hoodlums are said tobelong to a paramilitary group whoseleadership continues to hold high office withinsuccessive governments. The brutal attack inthe ensuing madness and terror lasting at least20 minutes could only be described as a blood-curdling massacre which resulted in themowing down of two employees. One ofthem our Marketing Manager and injuries tomany. The bullets sprayed also cause immensedamage to property-particularly computers,scanners, printers, data and furniture.Complaints made to the police and otherauthorities have not yielded the desired resultin spite of giving a detailed statement to theCID.

14. 16th May 2006On several occasions there have beensuspicious movements of armed men in theVicinaty of my residence Colombo. I havemade a complaint to the police on 16.05.2006.

2006 26689690

On one occasion the police themselvesidentified one of them as belonging in to oneparamilitary group PLOTE. It is commonlybelieved that the paramilitary groups operatingunder the ages of the EPDP who are in factpart of the Government alliance and whoseleader holds Ministerial portfolio are alongwith certain sections of the armed forces,responsible for these brutal killings and attacks.

You will appreciate that the above examples of targeted violence andintimidation are an assault on media freedom and the fundamentalrights of citizens to information. It is also inimical to the peacefulresolution of the Ethnic conflict.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)Sir, I do not want to interrupt my good Friend; I have muchrespect for him. But he must remember that the first communalriots in this country started in 1956, in 1958, in the 60s, inthe 70s and in the 80s over several anti-Tamil pogroms.Tamils were killed in all parts of the country including theNorth-East. My Friend should not forget that. The LTTE wasa phenomenon that came into existence in the mid 80s. Butlong before the LTTE came into existence there were anti-Tamil pogroms against the Tamil people in this countrycommencing from 1956. That was the starting date. Thatwas the starting year.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to say a few wordsin English particularly referring to the speech made by Mr.Sampanthan. He referred to the efforts of the successivegovernments in bringing about a settlement to the ethnicconflict and in that process reference was made to the Ceasefire Agreement and its implementation and variousinstitutional arrangemens that were set up and the way inwhich the Tamil Community felt that they were beingdeprived of the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of thoseinstitutional arrangements. Then he referred to the creationof SIRHAN, the proposals pertaining to the ISGA andthereafter proposals promulgated to set up the P-TOMS toexpedite tsunami recovery.

While he specifically referred to the JVP and the JHUand their attitude towards these institutional arrangemnts,we must also bear in mind that the Muslim Community toofelt that sufficient arrangements to accommodate ouraspirations were not included in any of those documents.And therefore, we too felt that we should take objection tosuch institutions being implemented without sufficientarrangements being incorporated to address our owngrievances. Particularly when we came to the P-TOMSarrangement the Muslim Community too protested againstthe document and in this regard the former President HerExcellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had adiscussion with the SLMC much later after all thearrangements were finalized. Despite the fact we haddemanded that we be consulted early before the draft wasfinalized, the Government though it fit to brief us after allnegotiations were conducted exclusively with the LTTE. Itbecame impossible for the Muslim Community to acceptor accede to such a document. So, therefore, it is not simplythe JVP and the JHU of course, they opposed it in a differentcontext though we do not subscribe to that point of view.

It must be borne in mind that we too had our own grievancesand these issues must be addressed if at all in the future, ifwe are to create any institutional arrangement to addreesthe aspirations of respective communities. The MulimCommunity should be an equal partner in deciding on theformulation of whatever document that would set up thoseinstitutional arrangements.

With those comments Mr. Presiding Member, I would liketo say a few words with regard to the famous EuropeanUnion ban on the LTTE since -

(+ )(The Presiding Member) , .

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)I will conclude in two minutes, Mr. Presiding Member.Since the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is here, I mustmention that the option of pressing for the ban on the LTTEby the European Union was available even during theUnited National Front Administration. During that period Imyself was part of the negotiating team. There were instanceswhere certain sections were lobbying when diffuculties arosein persuading the LTTE to return to the negotiating table.There were certain sections both within the Government andoutside which pressurized the then administration to lobbythe EU for a ban on the LTTE. The then administration feltthat it was sufficient to maintain the ban as far as the USand other countries were concerned but to delay this aspectof it and not to ask for this ban, as we all know.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Order please! .

, ." , Whereupon THE HON. ACHALA JAGODAGE, left the Chair andMR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am just winding up. I was on thefinal point relating to the European Union ban. We have tolearn lessons from the past where the LTTE resorted toaggressive counter action when a similar attitude was takenby the International community at different points of time.In this regard it was felt that the EU ban had been askedfor other politically expedient reasons at a time such as this.In our opinion, it may have been better to resist from

2006 26745746

insisting on the EU ban and to continue to resort to applypressure by other means than to ask for this ban. We the SriLanka Muslim Congress feel, that the LTTE should beapproached with different tactics. In fact when we met Mr.Hanssen Beuer yesterday, we mentioned to him and wewanted to find out more details about the different networksthat some of those countries which have banned the LTTEare trying to adopt. They are trying to set up what you call- contact groups in order to exert a different type of pressureon the LTTE in a situation such as this. We are all hopefulthat on the 30th when the co-chairs meet in Tokyo, thatthey would still find it suitable to adopt some method whichmight encourage the parties to observe the ceasefire, butthen it is also sometimes found to be futile to get the co -chairs to continue to issue statements and for thosestatements to be observed in the breach. With thosecomments, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I conclude my speech.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It has been now nearlythree months since the Government of Sri Lanka and theLTTE met in Geneva to discuss the ceasefire. In the face ofLTTEs refusal to return to the negotiating table and theindefinite postponement of Geneva Talks II, the optimismand the expectations generated by Geneva Talks I, when thepeace talks resumed after nearly three years, appear to beslowly waning.

In fact, if I may quote from the Joint Resolution taken upin the European Parliament on the 17th of May, 2006, item Gstates,

Whereas after the first round held in Geneva in February, the peacetalks have been suspended indefinitely after the LTTE pulled out againof a second round in April, jeopardizing the opportunity for politicalprogress,

In fact Since that time the security situation on the groundhas been deteriorating fast and we have seen an unfortunateescalation of violence. This is a matter of great concern forthe Government. Let me take this opportunity to assure you,as far as the Government is concerned war is not imminent.The Government of Sri Lanka will take all efforts to preventa return to war despite daily provocations by the LTTE. Infact, I would like to say as far as the Government isconcerned, our priority number one is talks that will lead to anegotiated settlement; our priority number two is talks thatwill lead to a negotiated settlement and our priority numberthree is talks that will lead to a negotiated settlement. As theysay, Sir, jaw-jaw and not war-war is our policy.

Despite severe provocations, the Government, as I said,remains committed to a negotiated settlement. In fact, we aregrateful to the international community who has beenunanimous in their appreciation of the patience and restraintshown by the President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa

751752

[ ]in the face of these challenges. In fact our negotiators areready to start discussing not only matters related to CFA butalso substantial issues relating to normalization anddevelopment of the North and the East which affect theday-to-day living of the ordinary people there. Also it isimportant that the international community has also realizedthat the intransigence of the LTTE has been the biggestobstacle to carry the peace process forward.

In fact, again going back to the Joint Resolution of theEuropean Parliament, item 2 says, I quote:

Urgently calls on the LTTE to resume peace negotiations with theGovernment of Sri Lanka without delay, to be prepared to decommis-sion its weapons and to set the stage for a final political settlement of theconflict;

The Government has shown more flexibility even thanthis Resolution, because our call to the LTTE has been forunconditional talks. Even though we would like to see thedecommissioning of arms one day, we had not made that acondition to resume talks. But true to form unfortunately theLTTE is resorting to flimsy delaying tactics to avoidreturning to Geneva. Less than a month prior to thescheduled second round of talks, the LTTE expressed itsdesire to have a meeting with its Eastern military leaders inKilinochchi and requested for transport in an Air Forcehelicopter which the Government refused for obviousreasons. In fact many of you could ask why did we refuse.You have to realize that the armed forces of this country alsoconsist of human beings. This request was made at a timewhen daily a score or more soldiers were being killed inClaymore mines and we felt that to insist on the army toescort the very people who are responsible for these killingswill not be fair on either side of the - [Interruption.] If I may- [Interruption.] I do not have time Hon. Premachandran, - Iwish I had time, I would answer all your questions -

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

The Hon. Minister is not giving way, Hon. Premachandran.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

- because I have a lot to go through. I was promised 35 to40 minutes. You have taken enough time. So, please do nottake any of my time.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

He is not giving way, Mr. Premachandran. [Interruption.]

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)In fact, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Government proposedseveral viable alternatives which were all rejected by theLTTE [Interruption.] with reference to the latest proposal,Sir, I myself on the request of His Excellency the President, asthe Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Ports andAviation with great difficulty, managed to persuade ourpartners in Dubai who are the management team of Sri LankanAirlines to give the two sea planes for this purpose. In fact themanagement refused but, on my insistence they have agreedto give the sea planes for this purpose. We have two seaplanes. They were offered nearly six weeks ago. We have yetto receive an answer. In fact, this norning, after discussionswith Mr. Erik Solheim and Mr. Hanssen Bauer we havecommunicated that the offer still stands and I believetomorrow Mr. Hanssen Bauer, when he goes to Kilinochchi,will convey this message again. So, let us see. We have doneeverything possible to get them back to the talks.

The LTTE has also taken the view that the Government ofSri Lanka must take responsibility for creating a conduciveenvironment for the resumption of talks between the LTTEand us. This is baffling giving a series of very grave ceasefireviolations committed by LTTE since Geneva Talks 1. Usingthe cover of the Ceasefire Agreement the LTTE has continuedto target security personnel in a sustained campaign of highintensive attacks. I am not going into detail. You know theattempt to assassinate the Army Commander, the attack onPearl Cruise II which was carrying 704 unarmed soldierscoming back home for holidays, are two examples. Another-

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Is Vigneswaran not your worry?

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)I cannot understand you. Excuse me. Another excuse givenby the LTTE for not returning to the negotiating table is thatthe Government of Sri Lanka is continuing to support theKaruna Group. Mr. Deputy Speaker, as far as we are concernedKaruna Group is one of the LTTE dissident groups. As far asthe Government is concerned the Karuna Group is also aterrorist group which is a breakaway faction. In fact, this isexactly what the LTTE said. I am quoting from the [Interruption.] Karunas revolt is a temporary aberration.Who says this? Mr. Balasingham. In fact, when Karuna Groupbroke away you insisted that it was an internal matter andyou asked [Interruption.] Hon. Premachandran, please be agentleman. Let me finish my speech because I do not havetime to be [Interruption] The LTTE themselves said; Mr.Balasingham said; Mr. Tamilselvan said; many others said inMarch 2004 when this happened [Interruption] Please donot interferethat this is an internal problem and we standby it.

2006 26753754

As you are aware, the joint statement issued at theconclusion of the Geneva Talks included, Hon.Premachandran, a commitment by the Government to takeall necessary measures to ensure that no armed group orpersons other than the Government security forces will carryarms or conduct armed operations. In keeping with thiscommitment His Excellency the President instructed themilitary commanders that the security forces must not haveany contact whatsoever at any level with any armed group.Further to this meeting, the Secretary of Defence alsodispatched instructions conveying this message to membersof the security forces.

Also, as you know, the Government has increased thepresence of police, security personnel and the number ofmobile patrols, especially in the Eastern Province.Unfortunately, the LTTE continues to misinform theinternational community about the Governmentscompliance with the Joint Statement by alleging that theGovernment of Sri Lanka is supporting armed groups. TheGovernment, I categorically state on the Floor of this House,has no association or collaboration with any armed elementsoperating within Sri Lanka. The Government has not armedor given support to any group during and subsequent tothe Geneva Talks. The LTTE accused the Government ofsupporting paramilitary groups and the Government hasresponded to these allegations by conducting investigationsand taking prompt action wherever possible. But, you alsohave to realize that the very nature of the conflict makesinvestigation rather difficult from time to time. That is notan excuse for not investigating. You have to realize thatthe ground logistics make it a little difficult. In fact, as youknow, the investigation into the killing of our own formerMinister of Foreign Affairs, the late Mr. LakshmanKadirgamar, has not yet concluded. So, these are theproblems we are facing in looking into some of theseallegations.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, in the allegation made against theGovernment, the LTTE has characterized the Karuna groupas a paramilitary group which should be disarmed by theGOSL in terms of Article 1.8 of the CFA. However, in March2004, as I mentioned earlier, when the Karuna factionrevolted and more than 6,000 cadres from the East brokeaway, the LTTE claimed that it was an internal conflict andlaunched a mini-war in an attempt to annihilate the dissidentgroup. In fact, at that time they said, keep away becausemost probably the LTTE thought, in their usual style andin their usual way, which they have been following for thelast 30 years, that they would be able to liquidate Karunaand his group. But after they found that Karuna was a forceto reckon with, they are now trying to put the burden ofneutralizing Karuna on the Government. That is very unfair.We are not there to interfere with the inner workings of theLTTE. Tomorrow, if Mr. Tamilselvan breaks away and formsa faction, again does it mean that the Government has tocome in and try to disarm them? In one of the newspaperstoday we read that Sousai also may be forming a faction of

his own. If that happens, do you again expect theGovernment to come in and disarm them? No. As far as weare concerned, these are parts of the same group and theGovernment will not interfere, but, of course, as wecommitted ourselves in Geneva Talks I, if any armed groupsare actually active in cleared areas, the Government willtake firm action against them.

As pointed out in the Editorial of a recent The Hindunewspaper, it all boils down to a single issue, Mr. DeputySpeaker, which has nothing to do with the rights of the Tamilpeople, which has nothing to do with the Karuna group andwhich has nothing to do with the so-called civilian killings,but it is all about the survival of the LTTE. If the LTTE isseriously committed to finding a peaceful solution, it shouldunderstand that the dissenting points of view are an integralpart of the democratic process. In fact, many of the locationsthe LTTE alleged as armed camps, in a document given tothe Government of Sri Lanka, turned out to be politicaloffices of registered political parties such as the EPDP, thePLOTE and the EPRLF. With reference to the allegedKarunas group based in Thivuchenai area, the Governmentsecurity forces have taken action to prevent any militantgroup establishing bases in outlined Tamil villages incleared areas in the North-East including Thivuchenai. Inorder to strengthen the security in these areas, the securityforces have established additional bases in Karapola,Mutugala, Hatuwanwila, Sadunpitiya, Senapura andKaduruwela.

Furthermore, in response to the concerns expressedregarding Thivuchenai, a high-level board of senior officialswas appointed to investigate the matter. Their investigationsindicate that there were no Karuna bases in the area andthe bunker that had appeared in the photographs providedby the LTTE was in fact, an abandoned bunker which hadbeen constructed during the IPKF period.

Finding trivial excuses to leave the negotiating table isan old habit of the LTTE. Since the Thimpu Talks in 1985up to Geneva Talks II, there has been a recurring patternwhere the LTTE has walked out of negotitions on theflimsiest excuse. Of course, there has been mistakes on thepart of the Sri Lankan Governments, Hon. Sampanthan. Wedo not deny it. But the same time, you must also admit that,if you actually look at the history of negotiations with theLTTE, it also shows that the LTTE itself has not been toohonest in dealing with us. If you start from Thimpu Talks,what happened? - [Interruption] Please, Hon. Member.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)The Sri Lankan Government has never enthused orencouraged the LTTE to remain in the peace-process. Youabrogated the P-TOMS, you would not discuss the ISGA.That is what happened.

755756

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Hon. Deputy Speaker they walked out from the ThimpuTalks. They walked out from Premadasa Talks. Not only didthey walk out, but they actually killed PresidentR. Premadasa [Interruption.] After President J. R.Jayewardenes attempt to bring peace. They killed Mr. RajivGandhi. They killed Mr. Gamini Dissanayake, one of thechief architects of the Indo-Lanka Accord. PresidentKumaratunga initiated the Jaffna Talks, but they walked out.Then what happened ? She presented a Constitution, Hon.Sampanthan, which you yourself at that time said was one ofthe best constitutional drafts which have been presented: theDraft of the Union of Regions. - [Interruption.] After 76attempts, the LTTE rejected that. The LTTE rejected that,attempted to kill President Kumaratunga and they killed Dr.Neelan Tiruchelvam, one of your own comrades who alsoone of the chief architects of that Constitution. They hadpeace talks with Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe and suddenlywalked away and said, you are not serious and it is a wasteof time.

So, looking back, it is obvious that the LTTE, as TheHindu Editorial said, is only looking after their own survival.They are not fighting for the justifiable grievances of th Tamilpeople. Our Government agrees that there are Grievances ofthe Tamil people, but the LTTE is certainly not the championof those rights. It is very obvious from the past.

Finally, Sir, I have a lot more to go through, I would alsotake this opportunity to clarify the Governmentss positionon the impending European Unions ban of the LTTE. It is theGovernments belief that te listing of the LTTE as a terroristgroup under the EUs common list will force it to return to thenegotiating table. In fact, we see this impending ban not asan end in itself, but as a way of getting them back to thenegotiating table. We see it as a positive incentive for themto come back -[Interruption]. Hon. Member, I would love toanswer, but I have only a few minutes - [Interruption.]

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Eelaventhan, would, you take your seat, please andlet the Hon. Minister continue with his speech? -[Interruption.] Hon. Senathirajah, [Interruption.] Hon.Member,

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)The European Union ban will address several internationalissues that helped fuel the conflict, mainly illegal fund raising by the LTTE. [Interrupton.] In fact, one of the mainlifelines of the LTTE, Sir, is their illegal fund raising inmany parts of the world. [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Sepakerone of the main lifelines of the LTTE, by which they carry

out terrorism and their activities, is their illegal fund raising.It is not only I who is saying this, sir. If you actually takeVolume 18, No. 1(c) of the Human Rights Watch, which Iwould like to table* - it is a very lengthy document, but itmight be useful, Sir if you could include it in Hansard as it isa vital document- it shows how the LTTE is actuallyintimidating their own brothers and sisters living in Europeto extort money from them so that they could carry out theirterrorist activities. - [Interruption.] You must learn that thepower of argument is much more lethar thamthe power ofviolence. [Interruption.] Please, let me be distinct.

As I was saying Hon. Deputy Speaker, as long as the cashflow from the Tamil diaspora continues, it will continue toprevent the LTTE from becoming a political and democraticorganization. Withe increased funding, increased capacitybuilding will follow. The fund-raising operations of the LTTEhold many insights as to how terror groups use ethnicpopulation in host countries to generate and channel fundingfor terrorism. How may minutes more do I have, Hon. DeputySpeaker?

( )(The Deputy Speaker)You have about four minutes.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Then, in that case -

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)We can go on for a little more time. Sir. We will have togive the Hon. Minister sometime.

. ( )(The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah)We will give him some more time.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Is that okay, Hon. Deputy Speaker ?

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Does the House agree to go beyond 4.30 p. m.

( )(Hon. Members)Aye!

* .{ Place in the Library .

2006 26757758

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera )Thank you. Hon. Deputy Speaker, let me just very brieflyread a small section from the Report of the Human RightsWatch, which was released in March, titled Funding theFinal War. LTTE Intimidation and Extortion in the TamilDiaspora. What does it say? I quote:

As Sri Lankan Tamils established themselves in Canada, the UnitedKingodom (U.K.) and other Western countries, the Tamil communitybecame a significant source of financial and political support for theLTTE in its struggle to establish an independent state, Tamil Eelam,for the Tamil minority in Sri Lankas North and East While manymembers of the Tamil diaspora willingly and actively support the LTTE,others have been subject to intimidation, extortion, and physical violenceas the LTTE seeks to suppress criticism of its human rights abuses andto ensure a steady flow of income.

Actually the violence of the LTTE has now started tooverflow into other countries. There have been killings bythe LTTE in Canada; there have been killings by the LTTE inParis. In fact, very recently there was a killing by the LTTE ofa person suspected to be of the Karuna group even in Doha,Qatar and this is just a few of the examples. So, that is why wefeel that if we can actually curb the fund raising, it will bean added incentive for the LTTE to come back to talks. Infact, we do not see the European Unions ban as an end initself. It should be used in order to get the LTTE on to thedemocratic mainstream. We want the LTTE, not by proxylike you have done, to come on to the democratic mainstream;we want them to actually accept the right of dissent in thoseareas; we want them to respect the human rights in thoseareas. We want to make sure that there is pluralism in thoseareas and we want to ensure, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that alongwith Mr. Sampanthan and all the others, even people like Mr.Anandasanagari, the Hon. Douglas Devananda or any onewho has any political ambition, be allowed to go into thoseareas and campaign freely.

At the initial stages, Mr. Deputy Speaker, funds weremainly donated by the Tamil diaspora and humanitarian frontorganizations. Coercion and extortion were used to maintainabsolute control over the community as this Report says.The LTTE has now progressed to a more advanced stage offund raising where ad hoc collections from the diaspora isreplaced with a fixed income position. They are verysophisticated, I must say. The Tamil diaspora is now requiredto register with the LTTE and, even as we speak the expatriatecommunities in Europe are being formally registered andtheir income levels recorded. In fact, we have got hold ofthose forms which the LTTE is distributing amongst the Tamildiaspora in the European countries and those are beinginvestigaged. The LTTE expects to generate a mandatorymonthly extortion target based on each Tamils income levelwhich should provide them a more stable and predictablecash flow. The LTTE also has legitimate commercial activitiessuch as retailing overseas telecom services through preferredcalling cards. And the EU ban, Hon. Members, certainly willnot affect the existing operational modalities supporting the

peace process. The SLMM, consistent with its mandate underthe CFA, shall continue to function without inhibitions orcontradiction in its role as the ceasefire monitor in support ofthe ongoing peace process. This is consistent with theprinciples applicable even within the United Nations, whereindividual staff members do not represent their home countriesin the duties they perform, but rather function under a singlebanner of the organization, in achieving the goals andobjectives of the mission. The European Union will alsocontinue to play an active role as a member of the Co-ChairGroup supporting the peace process in Sri Lanka. This willbe similar to the European Unions role as a member of TheQuarted which includes the US, the Russian Federation, theUnited Nations and the European Union in supporting thepeace process between Israel and Palestine. The EU functionsactively as a member of the The Quartet in an environmentin which several groups namely Hamas Fatah, Al - AqsaMartyrs Brigade, Al Aqsa EV, Palestine Liberation Front,Palestine Islamic Jihad, Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine- General Command are listed under the EUs common list.All those are listed but the European Union continuesinteraction with them at different levels.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Minister, you can include the rest of your speech inHansard.

( + (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera )Fine, Sir, I am almost finishing.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Okay, then you can conclude your speech.

( + (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera )Sir, if there is anything else, I will request that it be includedin Hansard.

Finally, having said all that, Hon. Members, I would alsolike to quote from one of my own speeches made in Brusselsto the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the EuropeanParliament on the 20th of March this year.

Sir, I quote :

.......... I would like to state that despite the dilemma of having tonegotiate with a group who has yet to renounce terrorism and violence,Sri Lanka remains fully committed to a negotiated political solution toachieve durable peace in Sri Lanka. We still believe the LTTE are a partof the Sri Lankan polity. Even for a moment, ladies and gentlemen, wecannot forget that those underage combatants, with cyanide capsuleshanging around their necks, are also children of our land. They have

759760

had their childhood and innocence snathched away at an impossiblyyoung age, fighting for a cause most probably they do not evencomprehend. The innocent Tamils who are trapped in the North, whocan neither afford an air ticket overseas nor have the freedom to moveelsewhere in Sri Lanka are our citizens too.

They are our citizens of Sri Lanka. They are our brothers,sisters, sons and daughters - [Interruption]

Sir, I quote further :

They also must have the opportunity to live in peace and reap thebenefits of democracy and freedom that the rest of the country enjoys.

In fact they must have the same freedom as you enjoy byshouting at us. You have the freedom. But does the averageman and woman in jaffna have the freedom to do so? We arefighting for that freedom and that is why we hope, Mr. DeputySpeaker, that in the not too distant future the day will comewhen the LTTE will renounce separatism and violence and

[ ]embrace the rule of law and democratic pluralism. This willbe the day, Hon. Members, when all peace - loving Sri Lankanswill roll out the red carpet with you all and welcome theLTTE into the multiethnic, multicultural family, that is SriLanka.

Thank you.
