Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

. I am pleased to speak onthe Immigrants and Emigrants (Amendment) Bill. As far asthis Bill is concerned, it is an amendment to the Immigrantsand Emigrants Act. It would have been better had the Hon.Minister discussed this Bill at the relevant ConsultativeCommittee or with the Opposition in order to bring in somemore amendments, which, we feel, are necessary today.

Today, the Hon. Members who spoke, referred to SriLankans who are working overseas and their difficulties. Thisparticular amendment refers to the People who, when seekingemployment in western countries have been taken for a rideby some organized groups and caught by the police andimprisoned. For them to appeal for bail, this piece oflegislation provides a way. As I said, I feel that a number ofamendments are needed today.

I would say as a person who has long years of experiencein this field, that this is not a problem only for Sri Lanka. Theyouth of every developing country are willing to go out oftheir own countries for many reasons. The main reason is thelucrative salary. In western countries, there are manythousands or even a few lakhs of such people. Have all thosepeople gone through the proper channels? Have they gonethrough and recognized bodies or agencies or the Bureau ofForeign Employment? Were they recruited by any of theembassies? No. These people, on their own, found a way toreach there. Of course, some are on refugee status. Did allthose people who are on refugee status get their visas fromthe respective embassies? No. It is through those organizedgroups that they have reached there.

So, we have to address this main problem. The mainproblem of our country is the unemployment problem. Theyouth here too are frustrated like in other countries. It iscommon in Asian countries. Pepole from Pakistan, India, thePhilippines, Thailand, Nepal, Bangladesh, all want to go towestern countries, not to the Middle Eastern countris, becauseof the lucrative salary package they receive. That is wherethey make a couple of lakhs of rupees each month. In theMiddle Eastern countries, of course, those who go as skilledand highly skilled workers and professionals can earn a highersalary. But, housemaids and labour categories are being paidvery poor salaries.

Has the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foerign Employment takenany initiative to solve this problem? Although there arethousands and thousands of vacancies, in the Middle Easterncountries, we are not in a position to supply. What is theaction the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment hastaken? I have met ministers of different governments. I havebeen taking up this matter with them. There are a number oftechnical fields for which we can develop the skills of ourpeople. We can even stop the labour categories from goingabroad; we can even stop housemaids from going abroad.Therefore, we should take necessary action to stop thesepeople from going abroad illegally.

This legislation paves the way for the organizers. who arepromoting these illegal acts among the youth, to be punished.Some people get caught while on their journey in boats orships. But, many get through; they reach their destination;they get employment and remit foreign exchange. That is thenumber one foreign exchange earner today for Sri Lanka.

We should always think in a positive way. We mustmultiply our foreign exchange earnings. This legislation,while punishing the culprits - we appreciate that; we are notagainst it - should not discourage people from going abroad.Especially after the civil war in the North-East, thousands ofTamils and Muslims from the North and the East and alsoSinhala youth from the South went to Italy. Did theGovernment send them all to Italy? There was an attemptduring the previous Government to send people to Italy. But,the terms and conditions were not lucrative. They do not

2006 22519520

allow our people to go abroad officially. I do not preach orteach here to practise illegal ways to reach those countries.But, what I point out here is that rather than immediatelystopping these people from going abroad illegally, we mustfind an indirect way of inducing them not to resort to it.Otherwise, there will be more and more unemployment inthis country; there will be more and more revolutions in thiscountry and there will be more and more criminal activitiesin this country. If the housemaids do not go to MiddleEastern countries, if the youth do not go to Middle Easterncountries and western countries, they all would be ourburden, a burden on our country, whatever the Governmentmay be.

Today, as you know, the youth cannot find properemployment. They are not getting enough to meet theirexpenses. The income is not enough to look after theirday-to-day needs. Even if you take students, how manythousands of Atudents are going abroad? What is the purpose?Only a small faction of the number that go abroad for highereducation wants to pursue higher studies. They make use ofstudent visas to enter those countries. If you go to westerncountries, you would not see even 10 per cent of themstudying. Ninety per cent of them are employed; they aremaking money. Our education system is such, we do nothave enough facilities in the universities. Just because theylack two or three marks, they cannot enter into a university.On the other hand, in this country, private universities arenot allowed to be established. Even the one private medicalfaculty that was operating had been closed down. But, canyou stop these students from going abroad? In Malaysia,there are 8,000 Sri Lankan students. All our foreign exchangeis flowing into those countreis. Go to India. How manythousands of Sri Lankan students are there? Likewise, takethe western countries. Everyday you see advertisements inthe newspapers with educational opportunities in the UK,Australia, Canada, China, Russia, Malaysia and even inBangladesh, because there are private universities. Thosewho want to go abroad and study, can follow their higherstudies there. But, many of the students who go to westerncountries make use of student visas to enter those countriesand then make money by being employed.

So, are we going to stop this? There are agencies, there areorganizations and there are individuals who get hold ofsomebody. May be in the embassies, they get hold of the visaofficer or somebody who can help them. Or they even findsomeone who can take them by boat. How many boats haveescaped detection and reached Italy, Australia and otherplaces? Do you not think that they are successful there? Doyou not think that they are employed there? Do you notthink that they are sending foreign exchange into thiscountry? So, we have to be very careful. While trying to stopone particular problem, do not create more and moreproblems.

We welcome this punishment. The culprits, the cheaters,the people who take the youth for granted purely on the basisof cheating, we can punish. But, there are other organizations.

I am asking you - there are lakhs and lakhs of Tamil peoplewho are in western countries - how did they go there? Did wegive them visas? Did the embassies officially give them visas?No. They found some way of reaching there. So, is theGovernment going to stop all these? Are we going to stopthese? Are we going to stop students from going abroad onstudent visas? Are we going to stop people from going toJapan for employment? Somehow, they get the visas, reachthere and get employed. So, we have to address on only theculprits, the real culprits who do not do anything, but takethe money and cheat people. On the other hand, Sir, the scopeof the amendments should have been a little wider. Nowduring the UNF Government, we decided that people fromSAARC countries could land at the airport and obtain on-arrival visas. I am very happy that it was my proposal to theGovernment at that time. Since the Hon. Foreign Minister isalso here I am asking, Why can you not open this facility forthe other countries also? We are not losing, Sir. Look atSingapore, Malaysia and the UAE. Of course in the UAE andMalaysia there are formalities to go through to obtain a visa.You have to go to the Embassy and get it. But in Singaporeyou can get a visa on arrival at the airport. Now we have thesefacilities for the SAARC countries. People from SAARCcountries are landing here. Why can we not expand it to theother countries also, Sir? what are the problems confrontingus? Of course we have to be very careful of the people whocommit crimes in their countries and enter our country. Thathas to be streamlined at the airport, Sir. I see that them is acertain amount of misuse of those facilities also. We see anumber of Indian people working here. Some are overstayinghere. This is a very dangerous situation. Especially ascraftsmen in the field of jewellary - making and in the hotelindustry and the computer industry, there are a number ofIndian workers here. They have made use of these facility.They are working and are even overstaying here. So we haveto be very careful about this. But of course we want peopleto visit this country. People should fly more frequently intothis country. Our hotel industry should be expanded. Thenthe hotels would be full up. Transport facilities should beimproved. So, more buses, more drivers and more conductorswill be needed. When businessmen come here, there isbusiness. This is what is happening in Singapore, this iswhat is happening in Malaysia and this is what is happeningin the UAE. So, since we have already opened the gates tothe SAARC countries, my appeal to the Hon. Ministers is -the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Foreign Affairsis present here - why not consider opening it to the othercountries also so that we can expect more and more tourists,more and more businessmen, more and more investors inthis country and more and more families too can come here.

As you know, western countries are not conducive toMiddle Eastern families. I was in Malaysia two weeks back.Sir, when you go to the Genting Highlands, the CamaronHighlands and to Langkawi, those places are full of MiddleEastern families. We have a good opportunity to attract theseMiddle Eastern families to spend their holidays here. Sowhy can we not exploit this situation?

521522

[ . . . ]There are Middle Eastern students studying in Malaysia.We have already lost this opportunity. This country shouldhave been the educational hub with private universities sothat the Middle Eastern students who are facing problems inwestern countries at present could have been attracted. Orlike the free trade zone, we can establish educational zonesonly for foreign students. why can we not think about it?Establishment of private universities have been opposed byradicals of both the UNP and the SLFP. We know in the pastthey were willing to establish private universities but theradicals have been opposing it. If there are private universitiesat least for foreign students, there will be a lot of foreignexchange flowing in.

We are so sorry that our students are going abroad. We arethirsty for foreign exchange. We are cticizing privateuniversities being established here. What is the alternativefor our students? On the one hand, we do not have enoughfacilities in our local universities. On the other, we areobjecting to private universities being established here. Asa result, thousands and thousands of our students are goingabroad taking our valuable foreign exchange earned by theSri Lankan housemaids, the Sri Lankan workers who are inthe Middle Eastern countries especially.

Why do we not think in the right way? Why do we nottake correct action, Sir? In this august Assembly we are sodivided. Each party wants to do something but when theycome to power they are unable to execute it because it isblocked by the coalition parties. There is some oppositionfrom your own coalition parties. This is not the way for thecountry to prosper. As a person travelling and as abusinessman, I travel across the world and when I see othercountries, I feel very sorry for our country. We do not have aproper stretch of road, not even a 20 - metre wide road in thiscountry. If you go to Malaysia, Thailand or Australia, theroads are very wide. Wide roads have been built in foreigncountries. They collect the toll may be only for 25 or 30years. Why can we not build such roads here? We do nothave a highway to Colombo from the Airport. There is noproper road to Kandy from Colombo. We are struggling. Weare only talking. We are blaming each other. We are notaddressing the problems in the right manner.

The speakers who spoke before me referred to the Lebanesehousemaids who are returning to the country.

( + )(The Presiding Member) .

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Will wind up in a minute, Venerable Sir.

It was argued as to how the Kuwaiti returnees were treatedand how the Government is treating the Lebanese workerswho are returning. Blaming each other is something that wehave seen in the past also.

In Lebanon, we personally know that there are ten to fifteenthousand workers who cannot come back to Sri Lanka unlessthey pay a huge amount of money because they have beenoverstaying there. Then, there are a number of illegitimatechildren born to Sri Lankan mothers there. How does thisimmigrants and Emigrants Act apply to them? We do notknow who the fathers of those children are. They may befrom Bangladesh, from African countries or from Pakistan.How does this Immigrants and Emigrants Act apply tothese children? A number of illegitimate children are there.Probably some of them, among the 6000 returnees, mayhave come to Sri Lanka. How does the Act apply to thosechildren? Why do we not address this issue?

Thank you very much for the opportunity given to meto speak.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are debating a Billwhich seeks to make difficult many illicit activities thatpertain to particularly emigration, people who leave thecountry. Sir, it is sad that we have got to think in terms ofstrengthening the law of the country to prevent suchemigration. That is because a large number of people in thiscountry irrespective of their ethnicity, irrespective of whetherthey are Tamil, Muslim or Sinhala, want to leave thiscountry. That is a rather sad situation, Sir, because when thiscountry attained independence in 1948, I do not think manypeople who lived in this country wanted to leave thiscountry. On the contrary, I think people felt that this was avery lovely country with a very prosperous future and peoplewould have preferred to remain in the country.

Now let us take some of the other Asian countries whichattained independence at or about the same time as Sri Lanka.Let us look at Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia.The people in those countries do not want to flee thosecountries. On the contrary they want to remain in thosecountries. Nobody from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia orSingapore wants to come to Sri Lanka. But a lot of peoplefrom Sri Lanka want to go to those countries. Why? Why arewe in this pathetic situation? Does it not show, Sir, thatsomething very wrong has happened in this country after thecountry attained independece?

2006 22527528

Sir, there was a time when a number of people from India,particularly from South India wanted to come to this countryillicitly. They were called kallathonies. Today there are nokallathonies from India who want to come here. But there arekallathonies from Sri Lanka who want to go to India. That isthe reality. I remember there was an organization, I believe itwas called Taffi where the armed forces were deployed toprevent Indians coming to Sri Lanka illicitly. Today armedforces are deployed for a different purpose, not for thatpurpose because no Indian wants to come to this countryillicitly. On the contrary people in Sri Lanka want to flee toIndia illicitly.

Sir, I want to narrate an anecdote that was narrated to us bythe late Mr. Shri G. Parthasarathy, a very famous diplomat inIndia. When there were India Tamils to be repatriated fromSri Lanka to India apparently the Central Government sent avery renowned diplomat, Mr. Gundevia who was the HighCommissioner in Sri Lanka too to meet with Mr. Kamaraj, thethen Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and explained to him thecircumstances in which those Indian people living in SriLanka were being repatriated to India because they had notgot citizenship in Sri Lanka. Under your citizenship lawsthose people were being repatriated to India and Mr. Gundeviawas sent by the Central Government to explain thecircumstances to Mr. Kamaraj. Mr. Kamaraj is supposed tohave told Mr. Gundevia, Well you can bring them in a bigship. But they will go back in small boats. That was theposition then. But today nobody from India wants to comehere. We are fleeing. Why is this happening? Not merely theTamils even the Sinhala people are fleeing. They are tryingto illicitly go across to some country - to some Europeancountry or some Asian country. They are being arrested in theseas in the South. They are being arrested in the seas in theWest. They are being arrested in the seas in the North. Why isthis happening? Are you not ashamed of yourselves that yourpeople are trying to flee this country because they have nofuture in this country. That is a question I want to pose toyou. Look at those poor people coming back from Lebanon.You see on television the way those people come sobbing,sad, being aware that there is no future in this country. Theirfuture is so bleak. They come because they are not safe inLebanon but they are sad to come back to their own countrybecause they know that they have no future in this country.This is a very sad situation, Sir. I do not think many peoplewho have the opportunity of being in Government are veryconcerned about this. But, this is the reality. I think you mustput things right in this country.

Passage of laws of this nature are merely, purely transient.They will not bring you the desired results. You cannotenforce these things by legislature. You must enforce thesethings by making this country a place in which people willdesire to live of their own free will, where they will feelcomfortable, where they will feel safe, where they will feelthey have a future.

Now, look at these poor Tamil people from the North-Eastern part of the country and a lot of people from my owndistrict, Trincomalee who have been fleeing across to India.

What are they doing? They are selling whatever they have,their household furniture, their household items at rock-bottom prices. A thing worth Rs. 10,000 is sold for Rs. 2,000;to raise some money and then fleeing in some boat to SouthIndia because they feel that their lives are not safe in thiscountry. They do not want to keep their children in thiscountry. They do not know when they will be killed. They donot know when the children will be killed. They are fleeingthis country. That is a sad position. Everyday you see ontelevision, whole families, hundreds of people fleeing fromSri Lanka from the North, from the East and landing on theshores of India. And that great country is prepared to givethose people accommodation, is prepared to look after them,is prepared to give them relief. But, what is happening here?If by some chance these poor people are arrested they aretaken to police station. They are sometimes remanded. Cananything, Sri, be more wicked? These are people fleeing tosave their lives. Quite frequently they succeed. Quite fre-quently, I am told they look after even those personnel whowere supposed to prevent them from fleeing and they areable to go. But, once in a while when they are arrested andbrought to a police station, I was told that sometimes they areeven remanded. Sir, this is callous. You are unable to createa situation in this country where the citizens of this countrycan live securely, can live happily and when those poorpeople want to flee, you arrest them and you harass them.They are subjected to utmost harassment. I want to make anappeal to the Hon. Minister and to the Government. As usualmany of the seats of the Front Benches are empty. I am happythat the Hon. Leader of the House is here. When you arrestthese people, please be kind to them. Please show them someconsideration. Please try to understand why these peopleare fleeing the country.

When they go across to the shores in India, they are notbeing arrested and remanded. They are being received bythat country. They are being received by the officials of thatcountry. They are being taken to refugee camps. They arebeing looked after.That is what is happening in India, Sir.Therefore, I want to appeal to the Government kindly, whenthese people flee, do not treat them in a wicked way, treadthem kindly. Please understand their very pathetic positionand try to alleviate their suffering. I want to say Sir, broadlythat laws of this nature will not prevent people fleeing thiscountry. It is only when there is peace in this country basedupon justice that the people in this country will desire tolive in this country. If there is no peace in this country basedupon justice, the Sinhala, the Tamil, the Muslim, membersof all communities will want to flee this country. That willbe inevitable.

Thank you. Sir.

Nationalism is essentially altruistic - it is a peoples recognitionof its own special function and its place in the civilized world ;internationalism is the recognition of the rights of others to their selfdevelopment and of the incompleteness of the civilized world if theirspecial culture - contribution is missing.

If you try to oppress and suppress tha Tamil communityyou are virtually aiming at political suicide of the Sinhalarace. We love the Sinhalese. What has got into your mindsto think of all issues on merely pure Sinhala - Buddhistthinking? why do you suffer, though a majority, from aminority complex as professor K.M. de Sliva as said it inthe 1960s and not recently. So I plead to my Sinhalabrethren, Please rethink, reshape and reorientate yourforeign policy or your internal policy or domestic policyfor the well being of all.

Killing is not Buddhism. I have been gifted a book on theDhammapada I will quote from the concluding para of theDhammapada. This is not anything that I am saying. This iswhat it says, I quote:

Knowing the truth is what we need. We are living in aworld of our own and imaging that we are speaking in truth.We are the victims of our own follies. We should get out ofthese clutches and rethink and reshape. If nobody else isgoing to guide you, at least the Gautama Buddha shouldguide you. The Gautama Buddha renounced his royalty, hiskingship to find a solution to the crisis humanity if facing,whereas our Buddhist priests have renounced theirpriesthood and entered polities. Now we see their robes arebeing pulled out. I feel so bad to see the Buddhists priestsrobes being pulled out. Why should that happen to them?Why do they not confine themselves to the temples and theviharas and preach spiritual messages? As I have told you, Ihave a great love for Gautama Buddha. Many people loveGautama Buddha. In 1956, I wrote an article to a Sri LankanGovernment magazine. - TheNew Path shown by Gautama Buddha.

I appeal to my Sinhala friends. It is not too late. Before thedamage is done please allow us to live and let live. If you donot allow us to live then we cannot guarantee that you canlive, Sir. We want a solution within a federal set up which isan ideal solution. Federalism is not division, it is notdisintegration, it is only a device to distribute powerspreserving the essential unity in the country and allowingfree-play for the different groups and preserve the essentialunity in the country. But if you will not allow us to survivebase on a federal structure, with all my love for HisExcellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa - he remainsmy eternal Friend - who says the solution to the problem is aUnitary Constitution. Unitary Constitution will neverrecognize the concept of a homeland for the Tamils.

533534

It does not recognize that we are an entity. It does notaccept the right to self-determination. Sir, with all love tohim, 56 years, 57 years of bitter experience makes us wonderwhy His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, whom I love a lot,because he had been so close to me - When he was the PrimeMinister he often used to call me to share his thoughts -cannot have a rethinking and reshaping of his thinking. Hiscalling, I am prepared to talk to Prabhakaran will not takeus far. Prabhakaran will not waste his time to discuss on aunitary constitution with petty consolations. Think of ameaningful federalism. Then there is the possibility of theLTTE coming to talks with the Government to find apeaceful solution. Otherwise peace will go into pieces. Weall want peace. There is no division of opinion but thedreadful peace that prevails in a graveyard is not of ourliking, not of the liking of any person with any sense ofhonour, sense of dignity. I appeal to you, let there be acomplete rethinking and reshaping of our thinking if youwant to live in this country in unity. The word I used is,unity, please remember, it is not unitary. Unity can bepreserved in a federal set up. If federalism is not going to beconceded, Sir, what is the alternative that we can think of?.By making love to somebody and if that somebody does notreciprocate what does it mean? If a husband and wife do notpull along for whatever reasons, can they sleep in the samebed mistrusting each other? Then what happens? In Tamil,we call it Mananeekam, in Sanskrit terminology we call it,Vivaharaththu, in English we call it, Judicial separation.It is unpalatable but unavoidable. But still after getting ourEelam, I am telling my Sinhala friends, you have yourSinhala Rata and we will have a Tamil Eelam, but if youso desire we can think of a confederation structure. We areprepared for it. But again we want a rethinking on all issues.Give up your prejudices. I worked in the Central Bank withthe cream of the intellectuals. Dr. Rasaputhram, Dr.Rajapathirana, Dr. A.H.N.S. Karunatilleke, Dr. Tennakoon,all were nice to me personally but whenever I was explainingthings not on Eelam but on federalism at their luncheons anddinners what did they tell me? Eelaventhan, what is youracademic background? I said, My background is nil butmy thinking is clear. You all are from Oxford, Cambridge,London School of Economics and Leningrad. Why do youhave an inborn prejudice. Why do you have pre-conceivednotions. Then what did they say, All what we have learnt isan intellectual exercise, an academic interest. We think weare first Sinhalese. Sir, what can we do with these people? Ihad intersting discussions with Professor K.M.P.D. Silva atthe Harvard University and at the Maryland University in1986. He said, Please Eelaventhan, do not quote what I say.The Sinhalese though a majority, suffer from a minoritycomplex. Though they believe in numerical superiority theycannot think of democracy or Sinhala culture separated fromBuddhism. I said it in my 60 years. I have changed myopinion. I said, People change their opinion for the good,not for the worse. So these are all levels of discussions wehad. I feel so sorry whether Sinhalese people die or the Tamilpeople die. Life is so sacred, Sir. None can replace it.

[ . . ]I can hold the floor. I know the Chairman is so generous tome today because the line of approach is something different.He is the son of the late Philip Gunawardena, the Father ofRevolution in this country. All his revolutionary, noble ideasare imbibed from Philip Gunawardena whatever the laterthinking of his may be. His aunty is married to Anthonypillaifrom Nallur, Jaffna, a great trade union leader. The old lady isstill living. I like to go and have a blessing because I haveknown that family, Sir. To that extent we are all thinking asone but when we think of unity, it is not dull. monotonousuniformity. Unity in diversity is a plan of nature, I thank youSir. I can hold the floor, but I do not want to abuse thegenerosoty and the magnanimity the Chair has showered onme.

I thank you, Sir.

Shirani A. Bandaranayake, J.

This is an appeal from the judgments of the Court of Appeal dated18.06.2004. By those Judgments, the Court of Appeal enlarged thepetitioner-respondent (hereinafter) referred to as the respondent) onbail. The respondents appellants (hereinafter referred to as the appellants)appealed therefrom primarily on the basis that there are serious errorsof law in the Judgments of the Court of Appeal, which have now givenrise to far reaching implications in the administration of criminal Justice.

557558

Leamed Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the appellants do notwant a reversal of the status quo in relation to the respondent and therespondent who was enlarged on bail could remain so, as there are noviolations of the conditions of bail, whatever be the outcome of thisappeal. In view of this submission, learned Presidents Counsel for therespondent submitted that he had no objection to leave being grantedon questions of law raised by the appellants. Accordingly special leaveto appeal was granted on 11 questions based on the Judgment ofSripavan, J with whom the President of the Court of Appeal Somawansa,J. agreed (hereinafter referred to as the judgment of Sripavan, J.) andon 7 questions based on the judgment of Abeyratne, J. in whichAbeyratne, J. had agreed with the decision of Sripavan, J. but gaveseparate reasons (hereinafter referred to as the judgment ofAbeyratne, J.).

At the hearing both leamed Counsel agreed that although there areeighteen questions on which special leave to appeal was granted, theissues that have arisen for determination by this Court would be asfollows :

(a) whether Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,vests only appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in the Court ofAppeal or whether the Court of Appeal is also vested with originaljurisdiction?,

(b) whether Section 47(1) of the Immigrants and Emigrants Actserves as a prohibition on the Court of Appeal to considergranting bail to a person accused of an offence under Section 45of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act?;

(c) the applicability of Section 3(1) of the Bail Act.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent, however submittedthat neither the appellants nor the respondent had raised the questionon the applicability of Section 3(1) of the Bail Act before the DivisionalBench of the Court of Appeal and therefore although the appellants hadmade submissions briefly on the subject, the respondent would not dealwith the aspect of the applicability of Section 3(1) of the Bail Act.

Considering this submission of the learned Presidents counsel for therespondent, it was agreed upon at the hearing that the law relating toSection 3(1) of the Bail Act would be considered in detail in S. C.(Appeal) No. 28/2005, which case was heard by the Same bench andwill not be considered in this appeal.

The facts of this appeal, as submitted by the learned Deputy SolicitorGeneral for the appellants, albeit brief, are as follows:

Pursuant to criminal investigations conducted by the CriminalInvestigation Department (hereinafter referred to as the CID) on04.12.2003, criminal proceedings were initiated against the respondentand another, in the Magistrates Court of Colombo. These proceedingswere initiated following the filing of a Report under the Code of CriminalProcedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Code ofCriminal Procedure Act), wherein it was alleged that the respondenthad abetied one Dammika Amarasinghe to use an irregular passportissued under the name of Buddhika Priyashantha Godage. At that time,whilst the respondent was not under arrest by the police, the saidDammika Amarasinghe was in remand custody consequent to a remandorder made in another case.

According to the appellants, since 04122003, officers of the CIDunsuccessfully attempted to arrest the respondent for having committedthe aforementioned offence. However, it had not been possible toarrest him as he was not found in any of the locations where it wasreasonable to assume that he would be found. However, as stated bythe appellants, on 08.12.2003 (which) was a public holiday, due to thatday being Poya Day), the respondent had surrendered to Magistrate A.S. Gamath Arachchi, who was on roster duty to function as the Magistrateon behalf of all the other Magistrate of Hulftsdorp, Colombo. At theconclusion of that days proceedings, the said Magistrate made order ofconditional release, thereby according to the appellants, terminatingthe proceedings against the respondent.

Thereafter on 10.12.2003, the 4th appellant instituted criminalproceedings against the respondent and Dammika Amarasinghe in theChief Magistrates Court, Colombo by filing a complaint under Section136(1)b of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act since the respondentand Dammika Amarasinghe became accused for having committedoffences under Section 45 of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act, theappellants moved the Magistrates Court for the issue of a warrant ofarrest of the respondent. The learned Magistrate made order refusing toissue a warrant of arrest, but issued summons on the respondent.

Consequent to the institution of criminal proceedings, theaforementioned Dammika Amarasinghe was murdered when he wasarranged in the Magistrates Court regarding another case.

On 19.01.2004, the prosecution in case No. 55305/3/1 submitted to thelearned Magistrate a change sheet far consideration of Court and onthat day the respondent, who had avoided appearing before theMagistrates Court until then, appeared before the Magistrates and wasplaced in remand custody. On 30.01.2004, the appellants had movedto amend the charge framed against the respondent, which was allowedand the respondent had pleaded not guilty and he was charged forhaving committed an offence under Section 45(1) a of the Immigrantsand Emigrants Act, which is punishable in terms of Section 45(2) of thesaid Immigrants and Emigrants Act.

According to the appellants, the trial against the respondent commencedin the Chief Magistates Court and was proceeding and no applicationwas made seeking his enlargement on bail. Therefore the appellantscontended that there does not exist an order by the learned Magistratemade upon a consideration of such application refusing to enlarge theprtitioner on bail.

On 27.01.2004, the respondent filed an application in the Court ofAppeal seeking an order from the Court of Appeal granting bail to therespondent (P5). On a consideration of circumstances pertaining to thehearing of this matter and of certain questions of fundamental importancearising for determination in the case, the President of the Court ofAppeal made order constituting a Divisional Bench (P9), which heardthe respondents application.

On 18.06.2004, the Court of Appeal made order enlarging the respondenton ball in a sum of Rs. 250,000/- in cash with three sureties acceptableto the Magistrate, who should be government servants drawing amonthly salary not less than Rs. 20,000/-. The Court also ordered thatthe passport of the respondent be impounded and to be kept in thecustody of the Registar of the Court. The Court also directed that therespondent should report to the 3rd appellant, namely the Director ofthe Criminal Investigation Department, once a fortright (P10).

Having set down the facts of this appeal, as set out by the appellants, letme now turn to consider the main questions of law taken up at thehearing of this appeal.

At the commencement of the hearing, learned Presidents Counsel forthe respondent took up a preliminary objection that the appellants hadnot tendered their written submissions in terms of the Supreme CourtRules of 1990. The appellants by way of a motion dated 18.03.2005,prior to the Commencement of the hearing as well as at the stage ofargument, explained the reasons for the delay in filing their writtensubmissions. However, at the stage of hearing as well as in their writtensubmissions filed subsequent to the conclusion of the hearing, learnedPresidents Counsel for the respondent had submitted that having regardto the importance of the issue relating to the question of the nature ofthe jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and also having regard to theconditional nature of the special leave to appeal granted to the Statewhere the respondent to be on bail irrespective of the outcome of theappeal, the respondent does not wish to pursue the pretiminary objection.Since the respondent is not pursuing the pratiminary objection regardingthe filing of the written submissions in terms of Supreme Court Rules,this Court will not go into the matter and would consider only the mainappeal to which I would now turn to on the basis of the two questionsreferred to earlier.

2006 22559560

(A) Whether Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,vests only appellate and revisionary juriadiction in the Courtof Appeal or whether the Court of Appeal is also vested withoriginal jurisdiction?

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the appellants strenuouslycontended that Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,confers only an appellate/revisionary jurisdiction in the Court of Appealand the said Jurisdiction is restricted to situations which fall underSections 402 and 403 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Therespondent on the other hand submitted that the position with regard tothe aforementioned question is extremely clear and that Section 404 ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure Act, confers original jurisdiction onthe Court of Appeal to entertain applications for bail from any personin custody. The Court of Appeal in Sripavan, J.s judgement referring tothe decision in Benwell V The Attorney General ([1988] 1 Sri L. R. 1)where it was stated that,

the Court of Appeal is empowered in the exercise of itsappellate jurisdiction to admit any person in custody to bailin the cases referred to in Sections 402 and 403.

had considered the matter in question on the basis that the Magistratehad refused to grant bai to the appellant and therefore the existance ofan order of an original Court was in force at the time the appellant madehis application to the Court of Appeal to exercise its jurisdiction.

Abeyratne, J on the other hand. in his judgment, after consideringthe decisions in Rev, Singerayer (Sri Skanthca L.R II 154) in reGanapathipillai (1920) 21 N. L. R. 481) has clearly Stated that, theCourt of Appeal has original jurisdiction.

Accordingly it is necessary to examine Section 404 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure Act, it is now well-settled law that the legislativehistory of statute is the most fruitful source of instruction as to itsproper interpretation (Flora v United States 362 U. S. 145, MannaligeGowda v State of Mvsore A. L. R. 1964 Mysore 84, Benok KrishnavState of West Bengal A. L. R. 1968 Cel 429), Discussing the importancein considering the legislative history of statute in interpretation, Bindrais of the view that interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition p9, 863).

It is also well-settled that interpreting and enactment, theCourt should have regard not merely to the literal meaning ofthe words used, but also take into consideration the anlacadanthistory of legislation, the purpose and the mischief it seeks tosuppress.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned, Bindra had further stated (Suprapg. 876) that,

When, the statute has undergone changes by way ofamendments of otherwise, it is not only permissible, but ofgreat essistence on the matter of interpretation to examine thelegislative history of the provisions.

Therefore as referred to by Maxwell (Interpretation os Statute, 7theEdition, pg. 65) as to how the Act at present in force should beinterpreted, it would be of usa to examine the corresponding section ofthe previous enactments.

Section 396 of the Crimimal Procedure Code, No. 15 of 1898 was thecorresponding section to, Section 404 of the present Code of CriminalProcedure Act, Section 396 was as follows:

The amount of every bond executed under this Chaptorshall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the caseand shall not be excessive and, the Supreme Court may in anycase direi, that any persion be admitted to bail, or that the balrequired by a Police Magistrate be reduced or increased.

Section 396 of the Criminal Procedure Code, No. 15 of 1893 wasconsidered in the case of in re Ganepathipillai (Supra) where the thenSupreme Courte interpreted the words in any case to mean that theJurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Section 396 to be revisionaryand/or appellate as there is a condition pre-requisits for the exercise ofsuch jurisdiction. The application in Genapathipillai (Supra) was foran order on the grant of bail. De Sampayo, J. in Gnapathipillai (Supra)

stated that the court was bound by the views expressed in the case ofThe King v. Lokunone (1908) 11 N. L. R. 120), which had examinedSection 396 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 Leamed PresidentsCounsel for the respondent egreed that the interpretation given inGanapathipillai (Supra) had restricied the jurisdictiion of the SuprameCourt under Section 396 of the Criminal procedure Code of 1989 to berevisionary and/or appellate and further submitted tha the law as it thenstood as interpreted in the case of Ganapathipillat (Supra) was therefore followed in the subsequent cases of Kamusamy v. Minister ofDefence and External Affairs (1961) 63 N. L. R. 214) and Ksnanathxv. Jayasinghe (1964) 66 N. L. R. 549), where Section 396 of thecriminal procedure Code of 1898 was given careful consideration.

Learn Presidents Counsel for the respondent also contended that, theCriminal Procedure Code of 1898 was repeated by Section 3(1) a of theAdministration of justice Law, No. 44 of 1973 (hereinafter referred toas the AJL) and although the new enactment basically adopted theprovisions of the old Code, it had introduced new words with anattempt to expand the meaning of the relevent section, with a view toovercome the restrictive interpretation given to the words in any casein Genapathipillois (Supra) case, Section 103(4) of the AJL reads asfollows:

Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, theSupreme Court may in, any case direct that any person beadmitted to bail or that the amount of the bond fixed by anyoriginal Court be reduced or increased.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the respondant referring to the newlyintroduced words in Scetion 103(4) of the AJL, which reads asnotwithstanding anything contained in this Section, submitted that itwas intended to give a wider interpretation to the section in order toprovide an opportunity for persons in custody to seek relief by way ofan application for bail.

It is however to be borne in mind that Section 103(4) of the AJL hadnot been interpreted by this Court as it was replaced within 6 years of itsintroduction by the present Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Accordinglyit would not be of any assistance to this Court to examine the aforesaidprovision of the AJL, having in mind the questions that are before thisCourt. However, it is of interest to note the observations made by Prof.G. L. Peiris (Criminal Procedure in Sri Lanka, 2nd Edition 1998, pp.152-152) in regard to the powers of the Supreme Court in respect ofbail under the provisions of AJL, where he had stated that,

Unlike the English Courts which have jurisdiction underthe common law to make orders for bail in all cases, theSupreme Court of Sri Lanka has no comparable power. Itspower and jurisdiction in this regard are conferred and regulatedby statute - previously by the Courts Ordinance and the CriminalProcedure Code and today by the Administration of JusticeLaw.

Consequently what is relevant and more important would be to considerthe provisions stipulated in Section 404 of the Code of CriminalProcedure Act, which repealed and replaced the AJL in 1979. Section404 of the present Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows :

The amount of every bond executed under this Chaptershall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the caseand shall not be excessive ; and notwithstanding anything tothe contrary in this Code or any other law the Court of Appealmay in any case direct that any person in custody be admittedto bail or that the bail fixed by the High Court or Magistrate bereduced or increased or that any person enlarged on bail by aJudge of the High Court or Magistrate to be remanded tocustody

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the appellants contended thatSection 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and Section 396 ofthe Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 were similar. His contention wasthat the Court of Appeal in Rev. Singarayer v Attorney General (Supra),Nithvanandan and others v Attorney General ([1983] 2 Sri LR. 251)

561562

and the Supreme Court in Benwell v The Attorney General and another(supra) had correctly stated the judicial interpretation and view of thenature of the jurisdiction that has been vested in the Court of Appeal bySection 404, that it does not vest original jurisdiction in the Court ofAppeal.

However, learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent took a contraryview on the submissions made by the learned Deputy Solicitor Generalfor the appeliants and submitted that the words notwithstanding anythingto the contrary in this Code or any other Law, which were absent inSection 396, but are found in Section 404 and their significance wasoverlooked by Court in coming to their conclusion in all theaborementioned decisions. Learned Presidents Counsel for therespondent further contended that the cases of Rev. Singarayer (supra)and Benwell (Supra) are clear examples of judgments given by thefailure to point out a significant change brought about in the law by theamendment of a section, perhaps due to an oversight or Inadvertenceand therefore the judge not having addressed his mind to the meaningthat should be attributed to the said amendment. Therefore the learnedPresidents Counsel for the respondent submitted that Rev. Singarayer(supra) and Benwell (Supra) clearly are decisions per incuriam

Although the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for therespondent is that in the decisions of Rev. Singarayers (supra) andBenwells (Supra), the Court had not given its mind to the wordsnotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code or any otherlaw which were absent in Section 396, but are found in Section 404, acareful examination of these decisions clearly indicate that this is notso, as there is reference to the added words in Section 404 of the Codeof Criminal Procedure Act. For instance in Benwell v The AttorneyGeneral (Supra) Sharvananda, C. J., was conscious about the additionof the words in Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,when he stated that the Court of Appeal is empowered to exercise onlyappellate jurisdiction, as his Lordship had stated that,

Counsel made reference to Section 404 of the Code of CriminalProcedure Act, No 15 to 1979 which inter alia, provides thatnotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code or anyother law the Court of Appeal may in any case direct that anyperson in custody be admitted to bail. It was urged that in anyevent, the Court of Appeal, had powers under this section toadmit the appellant to bail. In my view, this section does notsupport Counsels submissions. The expression in any casecan only refer to the cases referred to in the two previousSections, viz., 402 and 403 of the code, and is not of generalapplication. The Court of Appeal is empowered in the exerciseof its appellate jurisdiction to admit any person in custady tobail in the cases referred to in Sections 402 and 403.

Thus although Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Prccedure Act, wasnot considered in detail, if would not be correct to say that they havenot considered the contents of the new section as the decisions in Rev.Singarayer (Supra), Nithvanandan (Supra) and Benwell (Supra)correctly eflects the nature of jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appealby Section 404, which is limited to applate and revisionary jurisdiction.

Considering the submission made by the learned Presidents Counselfor the respondent, it is not possible to accept that by the introductionof the term notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this code orany other law legislature had vested original jurisdiction in the Courtof Appeal in considering the grant of bail.

The decisions which had considered the vesting of vesting of iurisdictionpertaining to bill since Ganapathipilai (Supra) had been unanimous inits out come and the only difference in Section 404 is the inclusion ofthe non-obstante clause, which was not in the previous sections. It issettled law that the non-obstante clause will have to be read in thecontext of what the legislature conveys in the enacting part of theprovision. (Ivotiben Ramval v State of Gujarat (1996) 1 Guj L K 385,Aswini Kumar v Arvinde Bose A. L. R. 1952 S. C. 389, Union of Indiav Shrinbai A.L.R 1954 S.C. 596). Considering the effects of non-obstante clauses, Bindra states that,

The proper way to construe a non-obstants clause is first to ascertainthe Meaning of the enacting part on a fair construction of its words.The Meaning of the enacting part which is so ascartained is then to betaken as overniding anything inconsistent to that meaning in theprovisions mantioned in the non-obstante clause.... it dose not, however,necessarity mean that there must be repugancy between the twoprovisions in all such cases. The principle underiying non-obstanteclause may be Invoked only in the case of irreconcilable conflict(Emphasis added).

As stated by Sharvananda.- C. J. in Benwell (Supra) the expression inSection 404 could only be referred to Sections 402 and 403 of theCode of Criminal Procedure Act. Section 404 of the Code is containedin Chapter XXXIV, which deals with bail and consists of 7 sectionsfrom Sections 402 - 408 It is to be noted that Section 403 was amendedby Code of Criminal Procadure (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 1993,Section 402 and the amended Section 403 (1) read as follows.

402 - When any person other than a person accused of a non-bailableoffence appears or is brought before a Court and is prepared at anytime at any stage of the proceedings before such Court to give bail suchperson shell be released on bail.

Provided that the Court if it thinks fit may instead of taking bail fromsuch person discharge him on his executing a bond without sureties forhis appearance as herein after provided.

403 (i) - A Megistrate or a Judge of the High Court, at nay stage of anyinquiry or trial, as the case may be, may in his discretion release on bailany person accused of any non-bailable offence.

Provided that a person alleged to have committed or been concerned incommiting or suspected to have committed or to have been concernedin commiting, an offence punishable under section 114, 191 and 296of the Panal Code shall not be released, at any stage of any inquiry ortrial, except by a judge of the High Court.

Considering the aforementioned Sections, along with Section 404 ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure Act, it is apparent that for the Court ofAppeal to consider making a directon under Section 404 there shouldbe an order from the Judge of the High Court or a Magistrate.

Accordingly when one considers all these provisions together havingin mind the non-obstante clause in Section 404, there is nothing toimply that the Court of Appeal has original jurisdiction, with regard togranting of bail. In fact atthough not speciffcally stated, it appears that,Sripavan, J,. in his judgmant where the President of the Court ofAppeal had agreed, had proceeded on the premise that Section 404vests only appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal.Moreover, although not specifically stated, it also appears that Sripavan,J in his Judgment had referred to the decisions in Rev. Singarayer(Supra) and Benwell (Supra), In the light that the Court of Appeal couldexercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in terms of Section 404of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Thus in his judgment, SripavanJ., after making reference to Rev. Singaravers case (Supra) and Benwellscase (Supra) had quoted from the judgment of Sharvananda, C. J. inBenwells (Supra) case. Thereafter he had stated that.

As averred in paragraph 27 of the petition, the Magistratehas refused to grant bail to the petitioner. Hence, theexistence of an order of an original court was in forceat the time the petitioner made this application, for thiscourt to exercise its junsdiction (emphesis added).

Paragraph 27 of the petition dated 26.01.2004 to the Court ofAppeal stated thus.

However, the learned Magistrate disallowed the objectionsraised on behalf of the petitioner stating that there wasno need to file a fresh or amended report by the Policedespite the death of the 1st accused and fixed the matterfor the 30th January 2004 to determine whether chargeswould be framed against the petitioner as required bySection 182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.Further the learned Megistrate whilst stating that heappreciated the presence of the petitioner in Court despitehis present condition, but that he was unable to grant bail

2006 22563564

in view of Section 47 of the immigration and EmigrationAct, remanded the petitioner to fiscal custody until 30thJanuary 2004. A true copy of the said order is annexedhereto marked P15 (emphasis added).

Accordingly it is apparent that Sripavan, J. had considered therepondents application having identified a bail refusal order bythe learned Magistrate on 19.01.2004 and thereafter had consideredthe matter on the premise that Section 404 vests only appellate andrevisionary jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that there were twodiscrepancies between the Sinhala and the English versions ofSection 404 and that the Sinhala version gives Section 404 arestrictive interpretation. These discrepancies were that, in theSinhala text the words is given whereas in theEnglish text this is stated as in any case and the word , which is given in the Sinhala text, appears as anyperson in the English text whilst agreeing with the submission ofthe learned Deputy Solicitor General that there exist these twodiscrepancies, it is to be become in mind that there are also othersuch discrepancies when the Sinhala and English texts of Section404 are compared.

However, the applicable text in terms of Article 23(3) is quite clearin this regard, as it provides that the law published in Sinhala shallas from the date of such publication be deemed to be the law andsupersade the corresponding law in English. Further, in terms ofArticle 23(1) of the Constitution in the event of any inconsistencybetween any two texts, the text in the Official Language shouldprevail. In such circumstances although there are differencesbetween the English and Sinhala texts, it would not be necessaryfor the purpose of this appeal to venture into a detailed examinationof the differences between the aforementioned two versions.

Accordingly it is apparent that in terms of the Section 404 of theCode of Criminal Procedure Act, the Court of Appeal has only theappeliate and revisionary jurisdiction.

Having considered the effect of Section 404 of the Code of CriminalProcedure Act, let me now turn to examine the applicability ofSection 47(1) of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act.

B.Whether Section 47(1) of the Immirants and EmigrantsAct serves as a prohibition on the Court of Appeal toconsider granting bail to a person accused of an offenceunder Section 45 of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act?

Learned Deputy Solicitor General took up the position that in termsof Section 47(1) of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act, bail wasdenied to persons accused of offences contained in that section. Thecontention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General is that the termshall carries with it a mandatory obligation on all courts and theparliamentary proceedings also reveal that the intention of thelegislature was clearly to ensure that by the use of the term non-bailable persons accused of offences contained in that section bedenied bail in the literal sense of the English word non-bailable.He also took up the position that Section 47(1) of the Act asamended, overrides the provisions of Section 404 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure Act, since the former belongs to specific lawand the later falls within the category of general law.

Section 47(1) of the immigrants and Emigrants Act, No. 20 of 1948, asamended states as follows:

Notwithstanding anything in any other law

(a) every offence under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of Section45:(b) every offence under sub-section (2) of Section 45 in so far asit relates to paragraph (a) of Sub-section (1) of that Section.(c) .........................(d) .........................(e) .........................shall be non-bailable and no person accused of such an offenceshall in any circumstances be admitted to bail.

Section 45 of the Act was amended by Act, No. 42 of 1998 to includethe offence in respect of which the respondent was charged and Section47 was also amended to include the eforementioned new, offences,which were brought in under Section 45 and these were listed under thecategory or non - bailable offences in terms of Section 47 of the Act.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent contended that therecannot be any conflict between Section 47(1) of the immigrants andemigrants Act (as amended) and Section 404 of the Code of CriminalProcedure Act, for the reason that the immigrants and Emigrants Actcomes within the purview of the Magistrates Court, whereas Section404 refers to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, as Section 404 ofthe Code has conferred original jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal.However, as examined earlier, the Court of Appeal has no originaljurdiction regarding Section 404 of the Code of Criminal ProcedureAct as it has only appellate and revisionary Jurisdiction.

Be that as it may, it would be necessary and relevant to consider themanner in which this appeal had come before the Court of Appeal. Asstated earlier, the Magistrate made order on 19.01.2004 remanding therespondent, acting in terms of Section 403(1) of the Code of CriminalProcedure Act and Section 47(1) of the immigrants and Emigrants Act.Thereafter an application was made to the Court of Appeal in terms ofSection 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. It is to be bome inm ind that at the time the application for fail was made to the Court ofAppeal, as staled by Sripavan, J., there was an order made by thelearned Magistrate acting in terms of Section 403(1) of the Code ofCriminal Procadure Act. However, there was no application made bythe respondent to the leamed Magistrate seeking bail and there is nosuch refusal order made by the learned Magistrate. The Magistrateacting in terms of Section 47(1) of the lmmigrants and Emigrants Act,made order remanding the respondent. Accordingly, there was no suchorder before the Court of Appeal, for them to consider in order toexercise appellate or revisionary jursdiction for the purpose of affirmingor setting aside the order refusing bail by the learned Magistrate.

Moreover there is a further matter that has to be referred to in thisregard. The Court of Appeal, even whilst exercising appellate orrevisionary jurdiction could not have overlooked the provisionsstipulated in Section 47(1) of the immigrants and Emigrants Act. Section47(1), as referred to earlier takes away the jurisdiction on all Courts togrant bail to accused persons. Accordingly although the Court of Appealcould have exercised appetite or revisionary jurisdiction in terms ofSection 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, it could not havebeen lawful for the Court of Appeal to grant bail in forms of Section47(1) of the lmmigrants and Emigrant Act. Sripavan, J in his judgmenthas correctly referred to Bindra (Interpretation of Statutus 8th Editionpg. 151) as well as to the ratio or Kushi Ram v The State (1959) A.I.R.Allahabed 778) that when special provision is made in a special stature,that special provision excludes the general provision in the general lawand therefore by Section 47, the legislature intended that a personaccused of an offence under Section 45 of the Immigrants and EmigrantsAct shall not in any circumstances be admitted to, bail.

Having said that the Court of Appeal had considered the granting ofbail to the respondent and Sripavan, J. had referred to the provisions inArticles 13(2) and 13(5) of the Constitution and had come to theconclusion that any strict interpretation of Section 47(1) of theimmigrants and Emigrants Act would be unconstitutional and reasonableand there fore an interpretation must be made in a manner respectingpetitioners liberty taking into account the provisions relating to thefundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. The Court of Appealhad on that premise enlarged the respondent on bail.

When bail has to be refused in terms of Section 47(1) of the immigrantsand Emigrants Act, It would necessarity infringe on the right to personalliberty. Therefore as stated in Babu Sing V State of Uttar Pradesh (A. I.R. 1978 S. C. 527) reasonableness postulates an intelligent care thatdeprivation of freedom by refusal of bail is not for punitive purpose,but for bi-focal justice to the individual involved and the society affected.Moreover, it is an accepted rule that the mere fact that the literal meaningof the words used leads to an injustice is no ground for disregarding themeaning. Referring to injustice which would occur by the process ofinterpretation, Bindra (Supra at pg 261) states that,

565566

it is to be taken as a fundamental principle standing as itwere on the threshold of the whole subject of interpretation,that the plain intention of the legislature as expressed by thelanguage employed is invariably to be accepted and carriedinto affect, whatever may be the opinion of the judicialinterpreter of its wisdom or justice if the language admits ofno doubt or secondary meaning, it is to be obeyed (emphasisadded).

Referring to Martin B. in Ornamental Pyrographic Woodwork Co. V.Brown Bindra further states that (Supra),

The question depends entirely on the Act of Parliament thatthe true mode of deal with Acts of Parliament is to give themtheir ordinary meaning, and to carry out what the legislaturein words enact.

Even if the result of such a construction is attended withinjustice still the true mode is to carry it out, instead ofendeavouring to tampar with it and to give it what it supposedto be a construction more consonant with justice (emphasisadded)

In such circumstances even in a sutuation where there could be aviolation of the basic fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution,it would be an obligation for this Court to give effect to the intention ofthe legislature. Moreover, In terms of Articke 80(3) of the Constitution,

Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of thePresident or the Speaker, as the case may be, being endorsedthereon. no court or tribunal shall inquire into pronounceupon or in any manner call in question, the validity of suchAct on any ground whatsover.

therefore it is apparent that the Court of Appeal could not have inquiredinto the validity or the constitutionality of Section 47(1) of the immigrantsand emigrants. Act at that stage. As stated by Viscount Sumonds inMagor and St. Mellons RDC v Newport Corporation ([1952] A. C.189), a judge cannot under a thin guise of interpretation usurp thefunction of the legislature to achive a result that the judge think isdeslirable in the interests of justice. Therefore the role of the Judge is togive effect to the expressed intention of Parliament as it is the boundenduty of any court and the function of every Judge to do justice withinthe stipulated parameters. Referring to the function of a Judge, JusticeDr. Amerasinghe, was of the view that (Judcial Conduct, Ethics andResponsibilities, pg. 284).

The function of a judge is to give affect ot the expressedintention of Parliament. If legislation needs amendment,because it results in injustice the democratic process must beused to bring about the change. This has been theunchallenged view expressed by the Supreme Court of SriLanka for almost a hundred years. in Government Agentsuperintendent of Police v Suddhana et al ([1905] VTambyahs Reports, 39) Chief Justice Layard said, at thetime when the Privy Council was the countrys apextribunel :

If we wrongly construe the law the remedy is by appealto His Majesty in Council. If on the other hand we rightlyconstrue the law and the law is unpalatable to any sectionof the community, the remedy of that section of thecommunity is to endeavours, if possible to have the lawamended such endeavours however, should beconstitutional.

Considering the provisions in terms of Section 47(1) of the immigrantsand Emigrants Act, it is clearly evident that although Section404 vestsappellate and revisionary jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal to grantbail, Section 47(1) has taken away that jurisdiction from all Courts asoffences under Section 45 of the immigrants and Emigrants Act shallbe non-bailable and no person accused of such an offence shall beadmitted to bail.

It is thus clearly evident that the effect of Section 47(1) of the immigrantsand Emigrants Act is that no person accused of such an offence shall beadmitted to bail. The restricton thus devolves on an accused, whowould have to be incarcerated without a remedy until the conclusion ofthe trial. Compared with the provisions of the fundamentall rightsenshrined in our constitution. It is an arguable point that this positionleads to an injustice as even a suspect would be deprived of his libertyirrespective of the fact that interms of the provisions contained in theChapter on fundamental rights of the constitution, the basic rights ofthe individual must be safeguarded.

However, It is to be noted that although the liberty and freedom of anindividual is thus restricted in terms of the provisions of Section 47(1)of the immigrants and Emigrnats Act, that injustice cannot be cured bythis Court as it is for the legislature, viz, the Parliament to make necessaryamendments if there is a conflict between the specific provisions andindividual liberty. Considering unjust and unfair action in terms oflegislative provisions, Henry Cecil (The Englist Judge, Hamlyn Lectures,1970, pg. 125),was of the view that,

the object of every court must be to do justice within thelaw admittedly the law sometimes forces and unjust decision.If there is no way about it, it is for Parliament to alter the lawif the injustice merits and alteration (emphasis added).

Therefore although it may force an unjust decision, it is quite clear thatSection 47(1) of the immigrants and Emigrants Act serves as aprohibition on the Court of appeal to consider granting bail to a personaccused of an offence under Section 45 of the immigrant and EmigrantsAct.

For the aforementioned reasons, I answer questions A and B as follows:

(A) Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of 1979vests only appeliate and revisionary jurisdiction in the Courtof Appeal; and

(B) Section 47(1) of the immigrants and Emigrants Act serves as aprohibition on the Court of Appeal to consider granting bail toa person accused of an offence under Section 45 of theimmigrants and Emigrants Act.

This appeal is accodingly allowed and both judgements of the Court ofAppeal dated 18.06.2004 are set aside. Although grant of bail for therespondent was unlawful for the forgoing reasons, as agreed by thelearned Deputy Solicitor General there would not be any reversal of thestatus quo of the respondent. In all the circumstances of this case therewill be no costs.

. . . ( )( - , )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Railways andTransport and Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum ResourcesDevelopment)Hon. Deputy Speaker, my good Friend, BandulaGunawardane, Member of Parliament for ColomboDistrict, has moved a very important Adjournment Motionwith regard to the tax that is imposed on petrol.

His point is that while LP Gas, kerosene and diesel arecompletely exempted from VAT, it is not justifiable tocontinue to levy a VAT on pettol. Therefore, his suggestionis to provide relief to the consumer through a taxadjustment without increasing the price of petrol.

I wish to state the following facts because he was oncethe Deputy Minister of Finance and it was during his timein 2002, that VAT and the Exercise Duty were introduced.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie )As the international crude oil prices were increased fromUS Dollars 35 to 40 per barrel in 2003 and 2004 to USDollars 65 to 70 per barrel in 2005. Domestic cost of diesil,petrol, kerosene and other petroleum were increasedsubstantially. Therefore, in order to provide relief toordinary commuters, goods and passenger transportprovides, for example, buses, lorries, trucks et cetera, VATon diesel and kerosene was removed by our Government.

VAT on LP Gas wasalso removed on 5th August, 2005 to ease the burden of thecost of living. However, VAT on petrol was not removed asapproximately 70 per cent of the people who are using petrolare private passengers. They are rich people. . 200 . . . [ ] . . . . . . 87 . .

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)

Can I get a clarification from you?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Yes, certainly.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)

You said this fuel subsidy is given to the three-wheelersand to other people. Instead of the fuel subsidy - [Interruption]

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

No. no, we give it only to the three-wheeler operators.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)You have introduced a new oil or some sort of lubricant ora petrol instead of the subsidy. But do you know that in yourBudget speech, 2006 part I, if you refer to page 34, section 72the Finance Minister has stated, I quote;

The prevailing oil subsidy will be directed towards service provideressuch as three wheeler and omnibus operators, fishing boat owners, andconsumers relying on kerosene due to non-availability of electricity.Such a re-direction of resources will also have the advantage of beingpro-poor

So where is that subsidy? This is what we are asking.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)That is with regard to kerosene oil. You are talking aboutkerosene oil.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)No, no. This is to the three-wheeler operators, bus operators,fishing boat owners -

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)To the three-wheeler operators we have given a subsidy ofRs. 300.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)You may have introduced a new petrol. But, what we areasking is, where is the subsidy?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)From July to December last year we have been paying asubsidy of Rs. 300.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)Sir, we are asking you, where is that subsidy that waspromised in the 2006 Budget -

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)That has been paid by the Ministry of Finance.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)No.

597598

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)It has been paid by the Ministry of Finance.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)Nothing has been paid. This is what we are asking.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)I know that it has been paid.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)Sir, somebody has misled you.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Up to December 2005, the subsidy was paid for peoplewho had bank accounts. Despite the removal of the VAT ondiesel and the subsidy on kerosene oil, it is still high. I do notsay, no. It is very high. A litre of kerosene is sold at Rs. 45whereas the cost of production is Rs. 70. Still we lose Rs. 25per litre.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) +

Accordingly the loss on the sale of kerosene oil will be inthe region of Rs. 7,500 million in 2006. . 1,750 . The revenue on VAT onpetrol is expected to be in the region of Rs. 6,000 million.That is all what we get. For Rs. 6,000 million we are losingagain Rs. 7,500 million.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Even if the VAT on petrol is removed the price of diesel orkerosene which affects the cost of living well as the cost ofproduction and transport of goods will not decline. If theVAT on petrol is removed the price of petrol will decline andthis benefit will go only to the rich. We are trying to discouragethat. , . . , . . . . , . .

About 30 per cent of petrol is being consumed by three-wheelers and motorcycles. We are going to introduce a lowprice fuel for three-wheelers and motorcycles in the future toreduce their fuel cost. The majority of others are luxuryvehicles and company-owned and maintained vehicles towhom a fuel quota is given or the total fuel cost is borne bythe companies. They do not bother about the rising fuel pricesas the companies are bearing the cost.

I will give you a good example. Now we are selling a litreof petrol at Rs. 96 whereas the LIOC is selling at litre at Rs.98. People are going and buying petrol from LIOC fillingstations. They can afford it. They are paying two rupees moreand buying petrol. So, what is the problem now ? [ ] 96 98 ? .

2006 22599600

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)In that case, what you are trying to say is a third player iscoming in. Do you agree with that ?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)I am not talking about a third player. We are trying toamalgamate the CPSTL and the CPC [Interruption]

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)May I just ask you a question, Sir ?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Yes, please.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)Are you agreeable to a third player coming in ?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)No. That is why I have submitted a Cabinet Paper toamalgamate both [Interruption.]

If you remove the taxes on petrol, the consumption willdefinitely increase and the Government will have to incur alot of foreign exchange. I do not think, as the Hon. BandulaGunawardene said the price of a litre of petrol will go upRs. 105. This is what is being worked out by the LIOC, butwe are not going up to that price. We have still not decided toincrease. We have to increase because we are losing Rs. 1,750million per month. You will understand because you are aperson who knows the exact losses and how to overcome it. Ihad a discussion with you. In fact, I will consider whateverproposals you have made now and see whether we can bringdown the price.

Thank you.
