:, FUNCTIONS OF THE ALL PARTY REPRESENTATIVECOMMITTEE : STATMENT BY THE HON. MINISTER OFSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

( )( () - " )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana - Minister of Science andTechnology) , , . . , .

The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa stated on 22nd November,2006 in Parliament that the JVP did not agree to devolutionat the All Party Representative Committee but agreed only todiscuss about it. I wish to correct this.

Dr. Vasantha Bandara, the JVP representative at the AllParty Representative Committee, stated that he supporteddevolution provided it was done properly to benefit thepeople. When I, as Chairman of the APRC, at the 17th meetingof the APRC summarized the views of the partyrepresentatives as being support for devolution as the meansof solving the national question , neither Dr. Bandara noranyone else objected. I thanked everyone for reaching aconsensus and Mr. Thavarajah of the EPDP expressed hiscongratulations for achieving a consensus. This is on record.I regret that the statement made by the Hon. WimalWeerawansa does not accord with the facts.

( )( - , )(The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Plan andPlan Implementation)

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportunityto speak a few words on the Votes of the Ministry of PlanImplementation, which is headed by His Excellency thePresident.

Before I proceed to speak in respect of my Ministry, I mustrefer to the Hon. Joseph Michael Pereras speech. Hementioned of the power of the President to nominate orappoint the Prime Minister. While appreciating his right tosay what he wishes, I think it would be much better if, in thefirst place, the political parties are given the power to choosetheir own leader like they did in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.When the majority of members wanted a new leader appointed,they elected His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa as thePresident of their party. Unfortunately, that does not seem tobe so in other parties which are now saying that there shouldbe more democracy. These so-called democratic rights havebeen taken away by the Constitution that had been preparedby the United National Party. Even the power to dissolveParliament after one year had been given to the President bythe Constitution that was promulgated by the United NationalParty. So, I do not think that they have any right today to talkabout the Executive powers that had been conferred on thePresident by that Constitution.

Also there was a mention about the Supreme Courtjudgments. We in this country hold the Supreme Court inthe highest esteem and we have conferred powers on it throughthe Constitution. We are not bound by whatever certainNGOs or international organizations talk about our judgments.I feel that they have absolutely no right to discuss thejudgments given by the highest court in our land.

The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera also mentioned about thedelay of the report of the Committee on Public Accounts onthe Auditor-Generals findings. I think he seems to haveforgotten the fact that the Chairmanship of the Committeeon Public Accounts has been given to the Opposition and atthe moment, it is headed by an Hon. Member of theOpposition.

He also mentioned about the Judicial Service Commission.Who is most competent to decide on the transfers of thejudiciary? Is it politicians like us or the Judicial ServiceCommission, which consists of members of the highestjudiciary, to whom we look up to and headed by that greatmember of the judiciary, Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva.

Mr. Chairman, moving on to my Ministry, today, for theinformation of the Hon. Members, we have distributed ourperformance report which highlights the work done by theMinistry so far. The subjects and functions assigned to the

Ministry are indeed onerous and we are conscious of the factthat an effective discharge of these functions will contributegreatly to the development of our country. The Ministry hasaccepted responsibility with the seriousness it deserves andis committed to give its best to achieve useful results. In thisendeavour, I am fortunate to have had at the beginning of theyear the services of Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal as the Secretaryand from mid-year, upon his moving to the very responsibleposition as Governor of the Central Bank, we have got onceagain an equally efficient officer, Mrs. Dhara Wijeyatilake,as the Secretary of our Ministry.

The Ministry of Plan Implementation, which has beenestablished as an independent Cabinet level Ministry onlyat the end of last year, has been working on ways and meansto carry out its functions. We have focused-

( )(The Chairman)Order, please! .

( )(The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

5 .

We have focused this year on monitoring the developmentprogrammes and projects of the Government and looked atnew ways of ensuring better implementation of those. Weare conscious that while sound policies are essential to buildand develop a nation, so is effective implementation of suchpolicies.

We have placed particular emphasis on the major foreign-funded projects and the effective implementation of theMahinda Chintana. We all are aware that political leadersgive various pledges and promises during election time.But thereafter, after being elected to office, those are allforgotten. But it is not so in the case of His ExcellencyMahinda Rajapaksa. It is here that the Mahinda Chintana,the Manifesto of His Excellency the President , makes a verybig difference in the country. The task of implementing whatis set out in this document has been especially assigned byHis Excellency the President to this Ministry as a specificsubject and he retains control of this Ministry as the Minister.The Plan of Action, which has been drawn up on the basis ofthe Mahinda Chintana, has received Cabinet approvaland is now part of the implementation policy of thisGovernment.

In the implementation of several foreign-funded projectsand local programmes including each and every programmeunder the Mahinda Chintana, this Ministry has developedsystems to capture information and to evaluate the progress.This has been done through a web-based system as well asthrough field visits undertaken by officers of our Ministry

10671068

[ ]as well as the Department of Foreign Aid and BudgetMonitoring, which comes under us. We have pursued follow-up action to ensure that any unsatisfactory factors areeliminated and the future programmes are improved basedon these findings.

During the course of next year, we will also focus on thenew projects that will be implemented at village level. TheGama Neguma programme highlights a much neededintervention which is designed to develop the countrythrough the development of a hitherto marginalized sectorof society. Through these programmes, the villagers will beempowered in a meaningful way, thereby contributingtowards the elimination of poverty in our country. Specialmonitoring and evaluation mechanisms have been put inplace and the Ministry is geared to review the progress so asto ensure these programmes are implemented effectively.

The Consultative Committee on the Ministry has beenmeeting very regularly every month and we have provideda forum to discuss issues that the Hon. Members of Parliamentwish to raise. I am grateful to all the Hon. Members ofParliament who have co-operated with us in the discharge ofour duties and functions and wish to ensure that we willcontinue to work with commitment in the next year as well.

I must also thank the two Additional Secretaries of myMinistry, Mr. Upali Dahanayake and Mr. M. I. M. Rafeek, forall the efforts they have made together with the Director-General of the Foreign Aid and Budget Monitoring Divisionand for the dedication and commitment they have shown inthe discharge of their functions. A special word of thanksmust go to the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance andPlanning, whose co-operation with our Ministry has madeour work much easier.

Thank you very much.

( )(The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera)You should have a fixed medium and long-term policy andplan. Hon. Prime Minister, I am making a request. Get all theparties, and form a national forum as you are trying to solvethe national problem also. For the development of theeconomy, work out a plan. That is why I am making a request.Work out a plan so that whichever party comes to power willimplement it. And the officers will have to stick to that planand they should not change that according to the tunes ofthe politicians. Professionals are professionals. This is thesaddest thing in this country. That is what I am telling you.Hon. Prime Minister, I am sorry to tell you that we have becomejokers in this country and in the world. The World Bank -[Interruption.]

I have to tell you in this House that I do not want to bea part of that. Remember, I have resigned twice from thisHouse. I am telling you a fact. Do not leave room for thepeople in this country to curse you. You will die one day.Make this an honourable place in the country.

, . I am asking youwhat is the link between the Ministry of Policy Develop-ment and Implementation of the Central Government and theProvincial Councils? Give me an answer. What is the linkin regard to the national development? Are you trying toteach me? When I was at the Provincial Council at that timeI got Rs.4,400 million for a project. I planned and imple-mented with my officers . What is the link you have now?There is no link. A former Chief Minister, my Colleague,the Hon. Nawinne, is here. There is no link here. You haveto accept this as a fact. [Interruption.] I do not want tolisten to you. You are a joker. You see, I am telling you thatthere is no link and plan. So, what we are recommending toyou, Hon. Prime Minister, is to link these two institutionstogether because, as you know, 80 per cent of the devel-opment work is done by the provincial council administra-tion which was brought about by the Thirteenth Amend-ment to the Constitution.

I mean, peace is not a commodity. You cannot buy it. It isthe same way with regard to the rest of the things. Even themedia is not a commodity. It is a means of getting theinformation we need. The people should feel that they getthe correct information. That is the most important thing.That is what the Hon. Minister has to ensure.

, + I must tell theHon. Minister and I ask him to rectify this problem we face. Ifwe look at the Rupavahini Corporation which operates theChannel Eye, the ITN and the Sri Lanka BroadcastingCorporation, for the last three or four years, you have recruitedso many people into those institutions. I just want to ask theHon. Minister, how many of them are Tamils? I am not talkingabout the Tamil-speaking people. I am not against any othersfor that matter. But how many of them are Tamils?

In addition to that, I want to ask the Hon. Minister, howmany of them are from the plantation areas or persons ofrecent Indian-origin? Because, you know, we also shouldget our due share. If we do not get our due share, then wehave a grudge. Then that grudge escalates and that is thereason why we have all kinds of conflicts in this country.Right now, we do not have that problem. We do not wantthat problem to come up in our area. So, our due share alsoshould be considered, Hon. Minister. This is a request. I think

this is a very serious request we are making, because if thatis not done now, that will never be done. Hon. Minister, Ithink you are a very reasonable person. I have known youpersonally for the last so many years. I make this requestso that, I think, you would go into this issue very seriously., + +

At the same time, I also want to make another requestwith regard to the Kandyan Tamil Service or the MalayagaSevai, which is broadcast from Kandy. Most of the peoplein our area listen to this because there are some wonderfulprogrammes. From time to time, those people come andtell us that the authorities are going to stop this broadcast-ing service due to the financial crisis there. This is the in-formation we get. If that is not so, I accept it.- [Interrup-tion.] You do not have that difficulty. Is it?

( )(The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa)

No. We will not close it down.

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. I want this broad-casting service to continue.

+ MTV , they simply say, Wereport, you decide. It is good. They report and we de-cide. But, you know, several people can decide on the samenews in different ways.

What is true journalism? I am not going to explain whattrue journalism is? But true journalism is not simply re-porting. Reporting is not journalism. Reporting is report-ing. That is different and journalism is altogether somethingelse. I am not going to go into the definitions of the twowords for want of time. , + + + + + + - , , + + +

Sir, I have to say something about the regional radiostation. I must thank the Sri Lanka BroadcastingCorporation for having given us a Tamil FM channel, aregional services for the Ampara District where most ofthe Tamil people are now in a position to listen to the Tamilprogrammes. Under the name Pirai FM, we were able toestablish a regional radio station a year ago. I mustsincerely thank Mr. Panawennage, the Chief Engineer, whowas very helpful to me at that time when we started it. Imust also thank the Hon. Minister, the Hon. AnuraPriyadharshana Yapa, for having given all sorts of co-operation and Mr. Ganegala and Mr. Sunil Sarath Perera formaking that a success. But, I am very sorry to say thatthis has not been gazetted so far. The Pirai FM is theonly regional radio station that is earning a profit, as far asI understand. Therefore, this has to be gazetted and I amsorry to say that permanent employees have not beenappointed to this radio station. I hope and pray that theHon. Minister would take note of this matter I am referringto.

Also, for the Tamil Section of the Sri Lanka BroadcastingCorporation, a Director (National Service) has not beenappointed so far. When I spoke to the Chairman of the SriLanka Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Sunil Sarath Perera,

he told me that they have already held an interview andare awaiting the Hon. Ministers approval. They haveselected a person and we have not interfered with that. Butthe work of this National Service is suffering because thereis no Director appointed so far. So, I am requesting Mr.Ganegala also, who is here, to look into this matter andappoint a Director for the Tamil National Service of theSLBC so that they can air the programmes in a moresystematic and regular way.

I have to point out that Iregret very much to see that in our Ministrys handoutnothing has been mentioned about allocating money forthe construction of a building for Pirai FM. We are nowoperating from a rented house and the landlord is askingfor that place.

I remember that in 2005 they allocated some money, butfinally, I do not know, something happened to that andthey were not able to do that. This time also, it is a verygrave omission, that it has not been included in theseproposals, but we should be able to do that with moneyallocated through a Supplementary Estimate in time to come.So, I wish to bring this to the notice of the Hon. Minister,the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, to have Pirai FMgazetted and get us some funds for the construction of abuilding for Pirai FM to be aired in the Tamil-speakingareas.

I sincerely thank the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa,who has been very co-operative and congratulateMr. Ganegala who has held a number of workshops topromote the knowledge and activities of the journalists.The last one, we had in Ampara, a Tamil-speaking area. Weare trying to have a workshop in Batticaloa also.

( + )(The Presiding Member) .

. . ( )(The Hon. M. H. Cegu Issadeen)

The Hon. Suresh Vadivel has asked that a workshop beheld in one of the districts in the hill country . He hadcome and asked the Hon. Minister, the Hon. AnuraPriyadharshana Yapa, that a workshop be held in the NuwaraEliya District. I hope Mr. Ganegala would make a note ofthis and have a workshop in Nuwara Eliya.

I see the Hon. Minister Athaulla here, who hasvolunteered to give us some funds for the construction of abuilding for Pirai FM. I thank him for attending itsfunctions: he participated in the first year anniversary. Hewas prepared to give us all sorts of help. I thank him verymuch.

I thank the Hon. Members of the Opposition for thecomments made and I am in agreement with most of whatthey said. I am also in agreement with what was said aboutthe suffering undergone by the Tamil people in Jaffna andI hope and pray that the President and the others wouldmake way for the opening of the A-9 so that the peoplewho are suffering in the Jaffna District, in the NorthernProvince, can have better lives.

I sincerely thank everybody.

. . . ( )( - , )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Railways andTransport and Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum ResourcesDevelopment)Hon. Deputy Chairman of committees, I am very happy toparticipate in this Debate on the Adjournment Motion thisafternoon. The matter that has been raised by the Hon.Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena is very crucial. I must tell himthat he should undestand that during the 17-year period ofthe UNP Government, the entire Ceylon Transport Boardwas destroyed and the bus operations islandwide camevirtually to a grinding halt.The only policy of the thenGovernment was to sell the CTB against the wishers ofeveryone and ruin the public bus transport sector.

However, in 1994, when the PA Government took office,rapid changes and long lasting measures were introduced torectify the deteriorated state of the Sri Lanka Transport Board.during my time, all the dues such as the EPF, gratuitypayments et cetera, which had accumulated during the UNPregime, were paid to the employees at the time of theirretirement. That was when I was the Minister of Transportand Highways in 1997. However, during the very short periodthe UNP government took charge of governing this country,none of the payments in respect of gratuity and EPF due tothe employees was settled. Therefore, the present long-standing dues to the employees are those that had not beenpaid during the UNP regime. So , it was not our responsibility.Now it is ours because the Government will pay those. Butthese payments accumulated because the UNP regime didnot settle those.

Now, I wish to categorically stated the correct position. Itis not 14,000 employees. There are 3,900 employees of theformere cluster bus companies of the Sri Lanka TransportBoard who had retired and have not been paid their gratuityfor the period from 2002 to 2005. These payments shouldhave been made long time ago by those responsible to do so.But, it had not been done. These employees had served thecluster bus companies for a long period of time and weremade helpless at the time of their retirement when theirgratuity payments were not made by the employer.

The non-payment of gratuity to these employees has createdenormous problems for them. They are not in a position toeducate their children, to see their children settle in marriage,receive urgent medical care and settle other matters ofimportance in the domestic front. Therefore, after assumingoffice as the Minister of Railways and Transport, I tookimmediate steps to find ways and means of sorting out thishumane problem of the employees. As a matter of urgency,I submitted a Cabinet Paper regarding this matter and obtainedapproval of the Cabinet of Minister to make these payments.

12171218

After having discussed this matter with the Secretary to theMinistry of finance and Planning, Parliament was presentedwith a Supplementary Estimate because no money wasprovided in the budget. Rs. 433.5 million was needed for thepayment of gratuity to employees of the former cluster buscompanies. The Supplementary Estimate was passed onlylast month and gratuity payments will be made very soon tothose affected employees. Even during the last few daysI was talking to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance andPlanning. Dr. P. B. Jaeyasundera, asking for this money andhe promised to release it as quickly as possible. When I spoketo him today, he said that they had been busy with thepreparation of the Budget and they would release the moneywithin the course of next week or before the end of December.

It is our duty to see that these poor workers, who had retiredafter serving the country and the institution for a long time,are paid for the service they had rendered. These paymentsneed to be made very early since the affected employees aresuffering a lot and many had brought their grievances to mepersonallly and I am making every effort to pay them quickly.

The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena made a statement,which I do not wish to challenge, but I will check it up. Wehave been paying in small installments of Rs. 10,000 andthis money which was handed over to the -

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana)Actually, I spoke about the Akuressa Deport -

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Yes, I will check it up.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana)That is why I said it.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)If there is any truth in that, I will see that action is takenagaist the DS or the Accountant, who without paying thismoney to the employees, had used it for some other purpose,which is very very wrong. I will take it up. But, wheneverthey come to us, we try to help them by paying in smallamounts, assuring them that the whole amount will be paidvery soon.

I have also taken steps to ensure that such a situationwhould not arisen in the future because, as my Deputy Ministertold you, we have now programmed out work. We have asystem whereby money will be provided for EPF and ETFevery month by the deports. It is true that there is a difficultyin paying salaries because the income we receive is notenough. And the Government has to meet the balance. We

must make sure that the money comes to the Sri Lankatransport Board without going into the pockets of theconductors.

It is true that today the management is very bad. . DS . DI . . . , . . . , .
