In the years prior to the conclusion of the Second World War,development efforts in the countries of South and South-East Asiashowed little or no concern for the fisheries sector.

. I quote:

In Sri Lanka, for instance, so little attention was paid to this sectorthat till 1941 matters concerning fisheries remained a part-time func-tion of the Director of the Colombo Museum.

1940 . 1940 . :

With agriculture and industry engaging the attention of developmentplanners and policy-makers in south and South-East Asia, thetraditional fisheries sector continued to remain neglected for morethan a decade after the conclusion of the war. The communities engagedin traditional fisheries were so impoverished that they are said to haveconstituted the poorest segments of the rural sector.

. :

It was in the second half of the nineteen fifties that policy-makersand development planners in Sri Lanka began to concern themselveswith the development of the small-scale fishery and the improvementof the economic conditions of traditional fishermen. A separateMinistry of Fisheries was set up in 1956. The Ceylon FisheriesCorporation was established in 1968 and the Fishery HarboursCorporation in 1972.

. :

Throughout the nineteen sixties and well into the nineteen seventies,Sri Lankan development planners-like their counterparts in the othercountries of the region-perceived the fishery as an extractiveindustry....

Department of Immigration and Emigration

Department of Immigration and Emigration plays a criticallyimportant role with regard to confirmation of identity of Sri Lankancitizens and foreigners.

Department of Immigration and Emigration issues about 400,000passports annually. Of this, 88% of applications are received by thehead office of the Immigration and Emigration Department inColombo. The remaining applications are received by overseasmissions and Divisional Secretariats. However, for this task all passportsare printed and issued at the Colombo head office.

This centralized practice was changed for the first time during thisyear with the establishment of regional offices of the Department ofImmigration and Emigration.

Falling in line with Mahinda Chintana Programme, activities ofthe Department were decentralized for the purpose of taking publicservice to the doorstep of the rural masses. Under this programme,regional offices were established in Matara, Anuradhapura and Kandyand they are providing a speedy and an efficient service to the peoplein the respective areas. Three regional offices, namely, Matara, Kandyand Anuradhapura were open on 21st September 2006, 9th October2006 and 16th October 2006, respectively.

Let me now highlight the number of passports issued by theregional offices in 2006 (statistics are Upto 1st October 2006)

Under the decentralized structure :

*Authority was delegated with regard to attesting applicationsfor passport and photograph to public officers at villagelevel. i.e. Grama Niladari, Samurdhi Niladhari, Post master,School Principal and Social Service Officer.

*The facilitating network was extended for travel documentsto be made available at religious places and post offices.The facility was provided to download application formsthrough the website of the Department at Nenasalacentres.

*The validity period of a passport was increased from fiveto ten years.

*Steps were taken to update the Immigration Act and itsrelated regulations and amendments.

*Public awareness programmes were conducted to educatethe general public on the activities of the Department.

*Speedy investigation system was introduced to identifyunauthorized foreign employees in the country.

Department of Registration of Persons

The registration of Persons Department was mandated by theRegistration of Persons Act No. 32 of 1968 and was established in1971. Since then the Department has registered and issued NationalIdentity cards for more than 20 million Sri Lankans.

All citizens of the country who are above 16 years of age areeligible for the National Identity Card.

All processing and record keeping with respect to registration ofpersons and issuing of NIC cards are still carried out manually.

The manual operation of the entire applications process has resultedin delays and backlogs pertaining to issuance of National IdentityCards from time to time.

The Department receives about 5000 applications for NationalIdentity Cards each day but the Department was capable of onlyissuing around 2500 National Identity Cards per day by the end ofthe 2005.

In order to deal with this situation and expedite and streamlinethe issuance of national Identity Cards, a crash programme wasintroduced with effect from 02nd May 2006. This has resulted in anotable increase in the number of applications processed.

During the first nine months of this year, there was a remarkableimprovement on the number of National Identity Cards issued bythe Department. A total of 673,406 Identity cards have been issuedduring the period January - October 2006 compared to 564,872 cardsissued in the whole of 2005.

Mobile Services

The Department has also commenced conducting a series of mobileprogrammes island-wide to ensure issuing of Identity cards to allthose who have still not obtained national Identity Cards.

The Programme commenced in July this year and by mid Novembermobile offices were conducted in 12 Districts covering 164 DivisionalSecretary divisions and 7811 Grama Niladari divisions. The numberof applications collected from the mobile offices held in these 12districts were 83791

The details with regard to the mobile programmes held uptoNovember 2006 are as follows.

The Department has planned to conduct mobile services in all Districtsof the Island before the end of the year. This will enable the Departmentof Registration of Persons to issue a certificate to the Commissioner ofElections confirming that all administrative arrangements have beenmade to issue National Identity Cards to all eligible voters. This is infact a statutory requirement under the Elections (Special Provisions)Act No. 14 of 2004.

In addition, the Department participated in 79 mobile servicesarranged by various Government and Non Governmental Organizationsin various parts of the country. The Department was able to collect40,267 applications through these mobile services and National IdentityCards in respect of 26,444 applications have already been issued.

Computerization initilatives at the Department

Initiatives have been taken to computerize the activities of theDepartment. The programme to convert the data in paper based indexcards into a computerized database was launched and this process wasaccelerated during this year. Officers were recruited to operatecomputers on contract basis.

The conversions of data contaied in 1,294,664 index cards to thecomputer data base have been completed as at end October 2006.

Electronic National Identity Card (e-NIC) Project

Arrangements have been made to implement this project for issuanceof a new electronic National Identity Card (e-NIC).

The main problems associated with the current issuance process ofnational identity card are (a) the entire application processing is carriedout manually; (b) the security features employed in the current NationalIdentity Cards are relatively low; (c) it is difficult to locate the relevantrecords in speedy manner when those records are required for variouspurposes; (d) due to the absence of an effective mechanism to verifyinformation related to National Identity Cards, it has become a tediousand time consuming activity. (e) centralized National Identity Cardsissuance process imposes the citizens to come to Colombo for obtainingthe National Identity Cards.

The objective of the e-NIC Project is to automate and decentralizethe National Identity Cards issuance. This process will expeditiouslydeliver reliable, easily authenticable National Identity Cards to theCitizens of Sri Lanka. The new initiative will replace the existing NationalIdentity Cards and meet the future National Identity Cards requirement.

Initial steps have been taken with regard to issuance of an electronicIdentity card with improved security features during the year 2006.

It is proposed to reduce the age limit for issuing of National IdentityCards from 16 to 15 years and also to limit the validity of NationalIdentity Cards for a period of only 10 years. Once this project comesinto operation, an Identity card could be issued within a week.

The Information and communication Technology Agency (ICTA) isfunctioning as the technical consultant and facilitator to this Project andMOU was Signed between the Ministry and the Department ofRegistration of Persons and Information and CommunicationTechnology Agency (ICTA) on 22nd June 2006 for the implementationof this project.

The activities under this project are to be carried out on turnkey basisby a vendor selected through tender procedure. Initial activities such asundertaking Business Process Reengineering studies for redesigning ofactivities in the Department have been completed by consultants. Tendersfrom prospective vendors will be invited during the next few months.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, at the very outset, I wish to placeon record my deep gratitude for the opportunity that isafforded to me to intervene in this Discussion at this pointof time.

Sir, having listened to the speeches made from theGovernment side as well as from the Opposition, I think Iwould come straight to the crux of the matter that has beenat the very core of the speeches made this afternoon on theFloor of this august Assembly. There has been much talkabout terrorism. Well, terrorism is, in fact, a term that isbeing very widely used nowadays in the political arena andwe all know, in general parlance or rather in common parlance,as to what is really meant by terrorism. There has been muchtalk about the acts of violence attributed to the LiberationTigers of Tamil Eelam. I am not the spokesman for the LTTE

[ ]here. I would like to make that point very clear at the veryoutset. I do not propose, Mr. Deputy Chairman, to hold abrief for the LTTE because I know very well that thatorganization is quite capable of defending itself in regard tothe allegations that are being made against it. Thatorganization has very many able spokesmen and there isno need for anybody, including myself, to lend a helpinghand to the LTTE in that regard.

Having said that, I have a point to make in relation to thevarious instances cited by some of the Hon. Members ofthis House, who made specific references to certain acts ofviolence alleged to have been or, according to them, havebeen perpetrated by the LTTE.

Sir, but is it the complete picture that was sought to bepresented by the Hon. Members who spoke much about ter-rorism today? I say, no; I firmly say, no. When we speak ofterrorism, there is a solemn duty cast on everyone of us togive a complete and comprehensive picture about the current

2006 0525972598

situation in this country. When attempts are being made tospeak about certain acts of violence, those acts, I cannot helpsaying, remind me of an actress who plays a seductive role ina film, revealing a part of her physical attraction while hidingthe rest. It may be okay for the role she plays in a film of thatsort, but for us, the responsible Members of this House, Ithink duty demands that we give a complete picture.

We have been reminded about the late Mr. Amirthalingam.I must make a point in relation to the late Mr. Amirthalingam,due to whose charismatic personality, as far back as 1960,at the tender age of ten I got inducted into his election cam-paign, making my entry into active politics.

We do not need to be reminded of as to who did committhe murder of the late Amirthalingam or for that matter, themurder of the late Sri Sabaratnam, the leader of the party towhich I belong, namely the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organi-zation, a constituent member of the Tamil National Alliance.We do not need to be reminded of as to who really wasresponsible for the assassination of Pathmanaba, a goodfriend of mine. But, when people seek to present a piouspicture with so much of adherence to principles of democ-racy, I have to remind them, Look, you have got to speakthe truth about other atrocities too. I want to pose thequestion, Sir, as to who did kill the former Member of Parlia-ment belonging to the Tamil National Alliance, namelyAriyanayagam Chandranehru, representing the DigamadullaDistrict in the last Parliament? Who did commit the assas-sination of Kaushalyan, a frontline leader of the LTTE whogot killed together with Chandranehru on that fateful daywhen both of them, together with certain other members ofthe LTTE, were entering the Batticaloa District from thePolonnaruwa District when they were ambushed by a Gov-ernment-sponsored murder brigade? I have got to pose thequestion as to who in fact, was responsible for the cold-blooded, calculated and cowardly assassination of lateMr. Pararajasingham, a Parliamentarian to the core, on thatfateful Christmas Day last year? I have to pose the ques-tion, Sir, as to who in fact, was responsible for the cold-blooded murder of late Mr. Vigneswaran, the then Memberof Parliament elect of the Tamil National Alliance, to fill upthe vacancy created by the assassination of late Mr.Pararajasingham? Also I wish to pose the question, Mr. Pre-siding Member, as to who in fact, was responsible for theassassination of my good Friend, the late Mr. S.Sivamaharajah, a former Member of Parliament, a couple ofmonths ago on the fateful night at his residence in Tellippallaiwithin the High Security Zone? I am also compelled, Sir, topose another question as to who were responsible for thekilling of five students who were on the beach of Trincomaleewhen they were ambushed and killed by cowardly assas-sins? A story was floated around that one of the studentshurled a hand-grenade at some navy personnel who werethere and there was shooting that led to their death. Therewas a journalist by the name of Suhirtharajah who was knownto me very well. He had the courage of his convictions, thecommitment to his profession, in that he went to the extent

of revealing the findings in the postmortem report togetherwith the photographs taken at close-range, which clearlyindicated, without any doubt whatsoever, that the studentswere shot at point-blank range, contrary to the theory floatedby certain sections of the Government.

( )( - , ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Policy Devel-opment Implementation)Were you there?

. ( )(The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

That is the position. We need not be witnesses to that inorder to speak the truth on the Floor of this Assembly. Ifthat is the precondition, I do not think any one of us wouldbe able to speak about any incident to which we were noteyewitnesses. Let us remember that.

I am also reminded of the assassination of my good friendNadesan, a well-known journalist who was ambushed andkilled in broad daylight in the Town of Batticaloa. Whocommitted all these crimes? Who were responsible for theseassassinations? Government-sponsored, Government-patron-ized murderous gangs, certain sections of the security ap-paratus, certain elitist forces and special squads of the armedforces operating in conjunction with Tamil mercenariesknown as paramilitary groups. Are these acts not amount-ing to terrorism, I would like to ask this from the conscienceof all of us present in this august Assembly today? Arethese acts not clear cases of terrorism? Therefore, Sir, letus be honest. When we look at a coin, there is no point inlooking at one side of it. We have to look at both sides ofit because there are always two sides to a coin. Therefore,Mr. Presiding Member, when we speak of terrorism, let usbe honest; let us speak the whole truth.

I need not remind the Hon. Members of the JanathaVimukthi Peramuna of this, for whose debating skills and ora-torical talents I have a high regard. They are the best people,like some of us belonging to the former Tamil militant groups,who have entered the democratic mainstream of this coun-try, to know what it really means when it comes State terror-ism. We all know what happened in 1971; we all know whathappened between the period 1988 to 1989. After a meetingof the All Party Conference convened towards the end of1989, which continued for a couple of years, we, the mem-bers of my party including myself, had to escort late Mr.Ariya Bulegoda out of the Presidential Secretariat up to acertain point of his own choice in the Colombo City toensure his personal security because he feared imminentdanger at the hands of the Government-aided, Government-sponsored murder brigades. This has been the politicalculture of our country; this has been the history of recent

25992600

[ . ]times. I would say or rather I am compelled to say thatcommencing from the early 1970s, growing from strength tostrength right from 1977 and culminating in a crisis in 1983,it is still not only drawing blood, blowing up bones and flesh,but also taking the precious lives across the ethnic divide,whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or of any otherethnicity. Therefore, it is my appeal in all seriousness thatwhen we deal with the question of terrorism, let us not for-get the truth, the whole truth about the present vicious at-mosphere prevalent in this country.

The Hon. Maheswaran, during his intervention, spokerather vividly about the prevailing situation in the North-East and more particularly, in the Jaffna Peninsula. Mr. Pre-siding Member, the Jaffna Electoral District, which I havethe privilege of representing for the second time in the au-gust Assembly, or the Jaffna Peninsula in particular, becauseearlier the Jaffna District included Kilinochchi also, whichis in the hands of the LTTE - I had a brief stint in 1994 tillthe then President D. B. Wijetunga, for some reason or other,thought it fit to dissolve the Parliament prematurely. Prob-ably, he might have thought that I should be kicked out, Ido not know - is an open prison as mentioned by the Hon.Maheswaran and certain other speakers from my party, theTNA. What is happening there today? I wish the Hon.Wimal Weerawansa would listen to my speech even if hegoes out of the Chamber from some convenient place out-side. The Jaffna Peninsula today is an open prison wherethe common man, the ordinary man, woman and the youths,irrespective of their sex, reel under the iron boot of a mili-tary rule. There is a reign of terror. There are abductions;there have been abductions; there have been disappearances.There have been hundreds and hundreds of murders andthese acts of violence go unabated even now.

Take any Tamil daily other than a mouthpiece of the LakeHouse. I do not speak about the Lake House because theLake House has a long history as the Hon. Minister, Com-rade Athauda Seneviratne, would be in a position to testify.We all know the history of the Lake House. I do not pro-pose to dwell at length on it. Leave aside the Tamil dailyThinakaran of the Lake House. You take any other Tamildaily. On the front page you would definitely find a newsitem to the effect that there has been this murder at someplace or that murder at another place in Jaffna. Headlessbodies have been found very frequently at important junc-tions in the Jaffna Town and its suburbs. Those bodies havebeen displayed for the public day in and day out. There havebeen abductions including young girls and nothing has beenheard of them since then. I know a case where a young girlwas abducted in Velanai in the Kayts Electorate and noth-ing has been heard of her till now or since then. Youthswho have been suspected to have had some sympathiestowards the LTTE or some links with the LTTE have beenabducted during the curfew by murder brigades consistingof members of Tamil mercenaries, paramilitary groups oper-ating shoulder to shoulder with certain sections of the armed

forces in the Jaffna Peninsula. It is a critical situation. Thefundamental rights of our people guaranteed under the Con-stitution have been violated day in and day out in letter andin spirit. There can be no doubt about that. The violationsthat have taken place in Jaffna commencing with the murderof two youths in Neervely - I was there in Jaffna at that pointof time - in November, last year and culminating to such amagnitude where people feared to open their mouths some-where in May or June this year, have led to the deaths ofhundreds of youths in the prime of their lives. Who is go-ing to answer these heinous crimes? One day there has tobe an answer. Let us not forget that. Therefore, I appeal tothe hon. Members of this august Assembly that this ques-tion of terrorism - when we speak of terrorism as an issue -it has to be viewed logically, rationally and not emotionally.That is the point I seek to make, Mr. Presiding Member.

I should tell those Hon. Members who sought to remindus about the late Amirthalingam, late Mr. Neelan Tiruchelvam,late Mr. Sri Sabaratnam and others that our memories arefresh. There is no need to remind us of those incidents.But we cannot be living in the past. We have buried thepast in the interest of our own people and also in the inter-est of all the people of this beautiful Island of Sri Lanka.Let there be no mistake about it. That is exactly why, Sir,when there are repeated calls for the re-imposition of theban on the LTTE - I think we are rather sad about that -there seems to be an attempt to change the course. It wouldhave drastic consequences.

The Hon. Prime Minister is present here. If I could add apersonal note, he is the one and only politician in this countrywho was successful in his maiden attempt to enter Parlia-ment from the Horana Electorate and who has the rarestdistinction of having been described as an independent so-cialist. To my memory, I do not think any Member of Parlia-ment has ever been described as an independent socialistexcept the Hon. Prime Minister. I have the highest regardfor him. But in all earnestness, as the Minister in charge ofthe subjects that are being discussed today and as theMinister who is going to reply to the hon. Members whohave participated in this Discussion today, I seek a clear replyfrom the Hon. Prime Minister in regard to what the Govern-ment seeks to do in respect of the continuous violations ofhuman rights in the North-East, in areas under the controlof the Sri Lankan Government in the North-East. That isthe question I wish to pose.

Under the Emergency Regulations in force there is a dutycast upon any member of the armed forces or for that matterthe police, to issue a receipt to the next of kin of the personwho is arrested in regard to the arrest that is effected. Butto my knowledge in Jaffna, commencing from the latter partof 2005, last year, there had not been one single case wherea receipt had been given in proof of the fact that a citizenhas been taken into custody. Even this preliminary require-ment, a fundamental requirement, a very simple requirement,continues to be flouted impunity. That is the state of affairs

2006 0526012602

in this country. Therefore, representing the people of JaffnaDistrict who are under a reign of terror, I am rather amusedto see that there is so much of talk, so much of oppositionin aggressive tones in relation to the acts of violence al-leged to have been committed by the LTTE.

Now, it is my humble submission, Sir, that let us not forgetthe fact that we are at a crossroads. The re-imposition ofthe ban on the LTTE, we have no doubt - we the Membersof the TNA, Tamil National Alliance, have no doubt what-soever - would banish the LTTE from the ongoing politicalprocess. If this country wants to have war, if this countryis committed to war as the only solution for the resolutionof the ethnic question, please ban the LTTE. We cannotdo anything in that regard. We are helpless. Whether toban or not is a decision to be taken by the Government inconsultation with the main Opposition, the United NationalParty, since there is a Memorandum of Understandingsigned between these two major parties. But if LTTE isbanished from the peace process, what next? What next?Is the Government going to talk to the TNA? We are notready to talk, except discussing matters of day-to-day rel-evance, except discussing matters of the grievances andsufferings that are being experienced by our people intheir day-to-day affairs. We are not ready to talk to theGovernment in regard to the question of the resolution ofthe ethnic conflict. The reason is this. We have got a clearmandate at the last General Elections that we would leavethe task of representing the Tamil people of this country -particularly the Tamil people inhabiting the North-East ofthis country - to the LTTE and the LTTE alone at the nego-tiating table in order to find a political resolution of theethnic conflict.

Therefore, if the LTTE is banished, if the LTTE is banned- we all know that while the ban is on, the LTTE would notbe in a position to talk to the Government - with whom doesthe Government propose to talk? With the Tamil mercenar-ies, with the murderous gangs operating in the North andthe East carving out North for one and East for the other orwith the puppets, or rather the puppet, who is taken all aroundthe globe.

[ ][ ][Expunged on the order of the Chair]to Havana, to India? I want to ask this in all seriousness.Please, cast aside these mercenaries, these traitors, theserabble rousers, these self-seeking individuals who cling onto you - the Government - for the sake of satisfying theirown interests. They are the bane of our race. They are thebetrayers. They have betrayed us. They have betrayed theTamil people. Ultimately they will betray you, the Govern-ment. Do not forget that.

This is what King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe told the En-glish when he was about to be deported to India. Do nottrust these traitors, because they betrayed me. They will be-

tray you when the turn comes. I would like to repeat theterm; repeat the very words, Do not trust them. They havenothing to do with the Tamil people. They do not representthe Tamil people in any manner whatsoever.

Under the Proportional Representation System one is ableto sneak into this august Assembly because there had beenthousands of spoilt votes including the preferential votescast for my Friend, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, and my-self where our own numbers were marked without the sym-bol. People knew very well that those votes were really meantfor him and me and to various others who were successful.The one who has entered this Assembly from the North isnot present here. I wish that he was present here to listento me. I wish that he was present here to intervene andinterrupt me. Looking at the vacant seat, I am making myspeech. Please do not try to do anything with them. Let usresolve this problem once and for all. This can be resolved.If there is a will, there is a way.

There is a Memorandum of Understanding signed betweenthe major Opposition Party and the Government which is alandmark development, unprecedented in the Parliamentaryhistory of our country. My good Friend, the Leader of theOpposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe had the sagac-ity to have extended his hand of friendship to the Govern-ment.

I agree with the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana in rela-tion to the sentiments expressed by him. If our mission ispeace, if our commitment is peace, then I do not think thereis a need for any emotional approach, because when emo-tion reigns, reason flies. We all know that.

Sir, having said that I have to mention one incident whichI think is relevant in the current context. When my youngFriend, my Predecessor, the death of whom led to the vacancyin this august Assembly which had to be filled by me -

( + )(The Presiding Member)Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

. ( )(The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Yes. I will wind up within the next five minutes. Therewas one Sinhalese youth, a police officer who was assignedto his security who also died along with him. I attendedthe funeral of that courageous, young police officer - a Sin-halese by birth. Still I remember the sadness in the eyes ofhis eldest child. He was a father of two minor children; twokids. I still remember the sadness in the eyes of his eldestchild. The younger one was rather a toddler of one-and-a-half years or two years.

26032604

Sir, death is common to all of us. When there is an inci-dent and when there are deaths, let us not forget that hu-man beings are involved. Whether the victims are Tamils,Sinhalese or Muslims, come next. Therefore, if we could bein a position to approach this problem on these lines, I donot think there would be any barrier or there would be anybarricade or there would be any obstacle in our finding ajust and political solution for which you need to have theLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on the other side of thenegotiating table.

Therefore, I would appeal to the Government to be verycareful. Inasmuch as we have our own quota of traitors,bootlickers, self-seeking individuals and paramilitary men,I think, the majority community of this beautiful Island ofSri Lanka has its own quota of men and women who are allout to bring more and more havoc to this country. Let usleave aside these elements who represent the extremist fringeof the polity. Let us leave them aside. Let the elementsrepresenting the extremist fringe of the Sinhala polity be castaside. They do not matter. For the first time, when theGovernment party, the main party of the Government, namelythe Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and the main Opposition, theUnited National Party, have agreed to work together for twoyears for the purpose of achieving a negotiated politicalsettlement to the national question, how can it be helpful tohave the representative, the accredited representatives ofthe Tamil people, namely the LTTE, banned? Could it belogical? Could it be advisable and thereafter could it be prac-tically possible to think of the political process to go on toits logical conclusion?

Mr. Presiding Member, I do not propose to take any moretime. But, let us not forget that there was also one instancewhere Dikkan, the front line leader of the LTTE fromTrincomalee, was ambushed and killed at Chelvanayakapuramin broad daylight by a Government-sponsored gunman. Letus not forget that. Therefore, the picture is complete whenone can have the courage of conviction to look at it irre-spective of whether that side did it or this side did it or anyother side did it, wrong is wrong. Wrong is wrong irrespec-tive of the perpetrators of the act.

Therefore, in such an atmosphere, I believe we would beable to muster the necessary courage and the courage ofconviction to go forward and I do believe that there are saneand sober voices in the Cabinet including the Hon. PrimeMinister, my good Friends the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle,the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Hon. Nimal Siripala deSilva who are in a position along with several others to havea balanced view of the worsening situation. This is a criti-cal juncture. Even one faulty step would lead to a river ofblood in this country. Let us not forget that. I hope that wewould be able to rise to the occasion and achieve peace.

I thank you. Mr. Presiding Member.
