: . . + : DE-MERGER OF NORTHERN AND EASTERN PROVINCE :STATEMENT BY HON. G. G. PONNAMBALAM

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)Mr. Speaker, in terms of the provisions of the StandingOrders, I wish to raise the following matter of urgent publicimportance.

The merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces as oneUnit by President J. R. Jayewardene in 1988 has been held bythe Supreme Court of Sri Lanka to be invalid on the basis ofsome technical reason pertaining to the procedure related tothe merger. No further legal measure is available under SriLankas judicial system to reverse the said finding.

Three Presidents, President R. Premadasa, President D. B.Wijetunga and President Chandrika BandaranaikeKumaratunga, who succeeded President Jayewardene haveduring a period of 18 years, that is from 1988 to 2006,postponed annually the date for the holding of a poll, relatedto the continuance of the merger.

The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987 acknowledged thatthe Northern and Eastern Provinces were the areas ofhistorical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people and themerger was effected on the said factual basis.

Three Tamil-speaking citizens representing the historicalinhabitants of the Eastern Province, who sought to intervenein the three petitions challenging the merger, were deniedthe right to intervene. They were thus prevented from statingtheir case justifying the merger fully and effectively beforethe court.

Consequently, the judgment delivered has the effect ofirretrievably damaging the current peace process unlesscorrective action is immediately taken. This view has beenstated both by India and other members of the internationalcommunity. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) wishes toreiterate that the failure to take immediate steps to validlymerge the Northern and Eastern Provinces as one Unit, willpermanently shut the door on the possibilities of finding asolution within one country. It is with the intention ofbringing out the urgency of the matter that the TNAcommenced protests in the Well of the House on the 17th and18th October 2006.

The TNA calls upon the President and the Government ofSri Lanka to immediately take the necessary action to validlyrestore the status quo ante pertaining to the constitution ofthe North-East as one Unit. The TNA urges the Governmentto respond favourably by the 7th November 2006, the latest.

2006 1925752576

Sir, yesterday the Hon. Chief Government Whip asked fortime till Friday, one days time, to respond. The TNAParliamentary Group met. We felt that the Government mustrespond adequately and therefore, they must be givensufficient time to do so. Accordingly, we have decided thatwe would give the Government time till the 7th of November,the latest. We hope that the Government would come up witha comperehensive response and also suggest ways in whichthe Government would move forward in this matter. Wecertainly hope that the Government would take our appealvery seriously. However, till such time due to the seriousnessof this judgement, the TNA has decided to boycottParliamentary Sessions.

Thank you, Sir.

: + : [ DE-MERGER OF NORTHERN AND EASTERNPROVINCES : STATEMENT BY HON. RAUFF HAKEEM

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Mr. Speaker, while the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalamhas been quite generous in extending the ultimatum to theGovernment, their so called ultimatum, up to the 7thNovember, it is incumbent on me to make a short statement,on the same issue.

Mr. Speaker, we should not lose sight of the fact that whatwas intended by the Indo-Lanka Accord was a temporarymerger. Unfortunately, many such temporary arrangementhave had long gestation periods in our country. We havealso come a long way since 1987 and cannot any more beoblivious to certain flaws in the arrangement sought to beintroduced by the two Heads of State in signing the Indo-Lanka Accord. Of particular significance is the need toaddress the Muslim dimension in a permanently mergedNorthern and Eastern province. It is precisely for that reason,Mr. Speaker, I cautioned my Colleague, the Hon. AnjanUmma of the JVP who after the judgement asked me themundane question: !,which means, Now Muslims could feel happy since theSupreme Court has re-established the status quo as it wasprior to 1987. I was quick to caution her. What I told a

bemused Hon. Anjan Umma was, as a responsible partyleader with a preponderant mandate of the Muslim peopleof the Eastern Province in particular and other from otherparts of the country, I cannot give a simple answer to thisquestion. We cannot be naive so as to ignore the sentimentsof our Tamil brothers. Similary, it certainly would be toonaive to assume that Muslims would be overjoyed knowingfully well the timing and the implications of this Judgement.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer to an important editorialin todays Daily Mirror newspaper.

I quote:

The left parties that welcomed the merger as a prerequisite forbringing about a solution to the national problem opine that the presentjudgment against the merger would further frustrate the Tamil partiesand complicate efforts to bring a peaceful resolution of the conflict.Obviously the political implications of this Judgment....

I emphasize, Mr. Speaker:

-the political implications of this judgment are considerable. It isthe responsibility of the political leadership of the country to studythe court determination and take appropriate action that would servethe contrys larger interests.

Mr. Speaker, I quote further.

If there are any infirmities in the judgement written by the ChiefJustice, with other justices agreeing,it is for the competent personsand parties to examine it and seek remedial measures.

Mr, Speakerk would also quote another news itemappearing in the same newspaper in page four, titled Lankade-merger order worries New Delhi.

Mr. Speaker, it says, I quote:

The ruling has special resonance in India, as the north and easternprovinces were merged a part of implementation of the 1987 India-Sri Lanka peace accord between Rajiv Gandhi and JuniusJayewardene.

It futher says,

The merger as per the 1987 accord was a temporary one, till itwas confirmed by referendum in the two provinces. It was doneusing the extensive discretionary powers of the President. ThoughIdian officials are still studying the judgment, they did term its timingas wrong. The merger, according to the India-Sri Lanka pact, hadbeen done after the two provinces were recognised as the historicalhabitaion of the Tamils.

Here, Mr. Speaker, I would like to add that the issue ofthis area being a historical habitaion of the Tamils wascorrected by none other than Mr. Anton Balasingham whenthe Sri Lankan Goverment began peace talks last year inBangkok. In his opening statement he stated very clearlythat the Northern and Eastern Provinces are not only thehomeland of the Tamils but it is also the homeland of theMuslims and I also say

( )(Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero)

What happened to the Sinhalese?

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

I centainly say that the Sinhala people in the EasternProvince cannot be forgotten. But, I would like to emphasizehere to my Friends of the JVP that it will be too naive toconclude that you can have simple answers to this question.I plead from you.

( )(The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

[. . 10.24]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me theopportunity to speak at a time when my honourablesuccessor, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, has presentedan important piece of legislation to this Parliament.

As we all know the corporate entities play a very pivotalrole in this country and it is absolutely timely that we arebringing modifications and through that amendments tothe Companies Act.

The Hon. Minister mentioned, at the start that this pieceof legislation is being introduced to amend the piece oflegislation brought to Parliament by my late leader,Mr. Lalith Athulathmudali in 1982.

I must say times have changed dramatically. We haveresponded very slowly. In 1993 there was a discussionpaper in order to change the then Companies Act in orderto bring it more in line with the developments in the worldand also the changes that have taken place. However, from1993 to-date the process has been very slow. This is thegeneral malaise in this country. We alway do things toolittle, too late. While we are discussing this Bill todayHon. Minister. I pay tribute to you for presenting this Billto Parliament. In the process, you would know that theUnited National Party during 2001 to 2004 completelymodified this and I guess almost 99.9 per cent of that Billis what is here. So I do not understand your paying aglowing tribute to the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe. I donot understand what the new ones he brought in.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

He is the only MP who took part in the deliberations whenthis matter was taken up at the Consultative Committee.Neither the SLFP/PA MPs nor the UNP MPs took part in thesedeliberations. Only the JVP MPs took part in the discussion.I must thank them. Let us give the devil his due.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)That is the problem. Ninety nine point nine per cent of thispiece of legislation was done by the UNP.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)I was not talking about the drafting of the legislation. I wasnot talking about the making of the legislation. I was talkingabout the Consultative Committee meeting.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)You should have complimented the Former Minister.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I do not need that.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)I will do it in my reply speech [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)They are the very ones who come before the democraticprocess. [Interruption.] Look at their hooliganism ! Thoseare the JVPers. They are the ones who bring democraticreforms to Parliament and they are the very ones who bringthis Parliament into [Interruption.]

25892590

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)I must thank them for taking part in this discussion,especially the Companies Act.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)They are the ones who broke this economy into shreds andnow they come before this august Assembly and givesuggestions. We must name that these are the people. Sir, Imust pay a glowing tribute and recongnize the fact that thereis an excellent team headed by Mr. Kanageswaran asChairman. I know they have been working day in and dayout and have brought something to fruition today. Manyaccountants, many bankers, many lawyers, and the civilsociety, all of them very enthusiastically got together anddrafted this praticular piece of legislation. In the process whatwe are going to do is convert Sri Lanka, which basicallyshould have been done 6, 7, 8, 9 years ago, into somewhat ofa moden world. But still this is not something which is fullyin line with todays world situation.

( )(The Deputy Speaker) . .

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) .

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

.Seconded.

, . , , () Whereuon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair and THE HON.(MRS.) RENUKA HERATH took the Chair.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Madam Chairperson. I thank you very much for chairingthis House at the time I am speaking.

All I wanted to basically mention is that the Bill beforeParliament today is an incorporation of many provisionsfound in the New Zealand Companies Act, in the BritishCompanies Act and in the American system. I was informedthat the best of them have been taken and certain things havebeen kept out because the professionals thought it best that

they should be brought in as separate legislation. I am referringto Clause 11 - The Insolvency or Sick Industries as per theIndian system which I have no doubt the professionals havedone the correct thing.

The present situation is that the Sri Lankan economy needsto be reinvigorated. Today the country is at crossroads. Wedo not know whether we are going forward or we are repidlygoing backward and this is what the Government shouldaddress today. There are nitty-gritties that they are payingattention to, but the main focal points, they are ignoring andthat is what I though we should speakof on this particularBill. We, from the United National Party, wholeheartedlyendorse and give you approval as per your requirement butthat does not mean that passing these Bills in this Parliamentwill result in the economy booming, moving to what wewould like it to br. There are many other factors that need tobe done to get the economy back into proper order. And Iguess they also need to be addressed and I would be doingthat after I address the main points in the Companies Bill,Madam Chairperson.

We should use this piece of legislation to make Sri Lankathe financial centre in the region. We pass this Bill like justanother Bill in Parliament and let it be. No. Hon. Minister,you must be on the ball, ensuring that we make Sri Lanka thefinancial centre in the SAARC region. We must be able toensure that India, Pakistan, Bhutan, the Maldives, all in theSAARC region, to come and register in Sri lanka like whathappens in the overseas markets. Many companies go andregister in Singapore. Many go and register now in Malaysia.Many register themselves in the United Kingdom for thesimple reason that laws are functional there. Just becauseyou bring a Bill before Parliament and we give youwholehearted support and it becomes an Act, that does notnecessarily mean the evils in the system are driven out andone of them is the judicial system. Any company that isregistered in this country and tries to do business throughthat would like to feel confident to do business in this countryand if there is a problem, the recourse is the judicial system.And all of us know justice is non-functional. It is functional,may be from a certain point, certain perspective, but overallit does not work. So these are the areas which need to bestrengthened, to give confidence, Yes.It happens in thiscountry.

If you look at the Bahamas, the Ivory Coast, Monaco, theCayman Island, all of them do not have companies that arefunctional there but they only register them and there is ahuge amount of money that goes through them. There aremany Sri Lankan companies that use Bermuda and countriessuch as these to ensure that it is taxhavens and as a result theypump their monies there and those countries have developedsignificantly for the simple reason that they have used andgiven the potential to make use of their facility and that iswhat I call upon the Hon. Minister to do. The senior MinisterHon. Anura Bandaranaike is here. He has a huge task of sellingtourism in todays environment when you have bombs flyingfrom all corners. So, this is the time, Hon. Minister, when you

2006 1925912592

might have to market not tourism, but business-relatedtourism. You have to ensure that companies are registeredhere. Probably, if you have one company registered, you mayhave ten shareholders coming in. The authorities at our Airportlove to count any person, who even comes as a transitpassenger, as a tourist and the gloat about it, saying that therehas been 25 per cent to 30 per cent growth in tourism. Youyourself have corrected that saying, Do not be complacent.Only the idiots will be happy with that type of environment.So, I appreciate your honesty. But all we, across the Floor,want to do is to emphasize that if we lose the economic war,we will lose all wars. Therefore, it is together that we need toensure the economy is strengthened.

This is a modern piece of legislation that has been broughtin. Please, utilize this to market the country. We do not wantthem to go to Singapore; we do not want them to go to theBahamas or Bermuda. Some of our Sri Lankan companies,which are public in nature, have used Bermuda to registerthemselves and then come and invest in Sri Lanka. That isgood. So, why do you not get some of the Indian and Pakistanicompanies to do the same here . That is what should beencouraged because that will bring in a lot of money andmake a lot of people come to Sri Lanka. Therefore, I callupon the Hon. Minister, if he is proactive and wise enough toensure that this industry is made vibrant; to do that. Ensurethat you have road shows and get things done. Then that willhelp the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, when he goescampaigning for Sri Lanka as a destination for BOI companies,to say, Yes. We have a piece of legislation that enables youto come and register companies within 24 hours. If you havea problem, you can go to court and get a verdict. All theseare non-existent, but I am presenting to you a hypotheticalsituation. Then ensure that Sri Lanka is put on the map. Donot think, when it comes to investment, that Sri Lanka is theonly girl on the beach.

Companies which should be doing business here are nowgoing to India today. Companies like Brandix and MASshould be encouraged to manufacture here. But,unfortunately, they are going overseas because a conduciveclimate is not prevalent here. So, all I say is, use the properingredients. Just because we are from the Opposition, we arenot saying this in a hostile manner. We are only saying thiswith hands-on experience. The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagamaknows that, just because we are from the Opposition, we havenot stalled businesses. We helped you to bring in Marks &Spencer here and today they are operative in Sri Lanka. Thatwas not something which was present. We helped you to getthings done and I must say that it was your initiative,innovativness and promptness which helped to get thebureaucracy out of its slumber and working. Today, they areable to get stuff from India, Pakistan and the Maldives anduse Sri Lanka as a gateway to the UK. I hope it becomes areality because the first shipment is supposed to come on the24th of this month. But I am made to understand that to datethe regulations have not been put in place. Therefore, I wouldappreciate if it is being looked at.

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)

It is being looked at. - [Interruption]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)You should take the credit. All I did was utilize theknowledge and the acquaintances I had and you take thecredit. On that particullar basis, let us use Sri Lanka as agateway. Sri Lanka may have had its problems. But whenthere are problems, there is also cost reduction and we mustmake better use of that cost reduction in this environment.Unfortunately, we are not doing that.

Hon. Minister, you mentioned that in the process you arelooking at introducting an electronic system for registrationof companies. I am sad to say that this is something which isvery slow in progress. This was discussed when I was theMinister as well and we got things moving. Unfortunately,some World Bank funds were supposed to come in, whichwere really unnecessary because without those we could havedone that. I hope you have not got caught up in a system ofbureaucracy that is trying to give ideas or answers to theproblem that was there because it will only lead to furtherproblems. This does not need too much sophisticationbrought in. It only needs practical implementation. So, I hopethat it is on the correct track and I guess the best approach toit is buying without taking loans. Ensure that you have aBOO operation going on. You can get it running in 24 hours.You do not need to have government funds. Todays computertechnology grows so fast that what you have now ends upobsolete. Sometimes, you invest today and tomorrow itbecomes obsolete. So, ensure that you use the technology ofthe namufacturers. They will come on a BOO basis and ensurethat the registration of companies is run without any fundsbeing put in. Therefore, please look into this matter becausethis was something which I was pushing through.Unfortunately, dissolution of Parliament took place then.What happened was that it got postponed and it is not areality today. We were in the process of bringing in thatsophistication so that companies whould be able to comethrough the website and register in 24 hours. Unfortunately,that is still not happening in real terms. Please ensure thatthese are looked at because that is the way you can get foreigncompanies to come in and register in this country.

Hon. Minister, you mentioned about the small companyconcept. It is something which is laudable. I am made tounderstand that you are bringing an amendment in this regard,but I have still not been given the amendment. Some of theexperts - [Interruption] I heard that through the process youare bringing, a single person can operate a company. It wasearlier mentioned that only an entity can operate a one-shareholder company. So, if it is being corrected, well andgood, but I only hope that the ramifications of all that havebeen looked at. - [Interruption] That is not a problem at all.My belief is that if it is a one-man company, you should limit

25932594

[ ]it to a certain amount and I do not think that it should bebeyond a certain point because if it is a company that isgoing to be worth 10, 15 or 20 million rupees, I do not seewhy they cannot find two or three shareholders. I mean, getyour wife, your children or your best friends as shareholders.So, I do not see that you should open it because you areincorporating an entity.

Today, we must make laws in this country for the sinnersand not for the saints because 95 per cent of them will do it inthe correct way. But, you may have some unscrupulous peoplewho come, register a company, make it an entity, go and takeloans and then go off without anybody knowing. So, whileyou have one man doing this correctly, you might have abandit creating an unstable situation in this country. Thatwas a problem we were discussing even then when thecommittees were under me. These were the problems that Iforesaw. But it is certainly -

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

That was a suggestion brought by the JVP.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

That is the problem.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

What is the problem?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Those are dangerous ones. They give a carte blanche -

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)One-man companies.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)These bandits have done enough damage. These are thebandits who ruined the economy.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)You said you are supporting it.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I support on a conditional basis that the amount should beless than Rs. 100,000 just to give it the effect of a smallcompany. If that is the reason - [Interruption] Then why doyou not - [Interruption]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

Today, Rs. 100,000 is nothing.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Surely, can one person not find another person to have atwo-man company? What I am saying is that it is moreexplicit that way. Then you can even have a public companyas a one-man company. But why do you have sevenshareholders in that? You can bring it down to one and say,Have whatever you want. Why you have provided certaincriteria is because it needs to have those criteria. A companywith 50 people is called a public company because it is apeoples company. All of them become the entity. There isno definition after that. Then it becomes an incorporatedentity. So on that basis, all I say is, look at these ramifications.We do not oppose just because somebody brings it, but lookat the ramifications as well as the merits of that.

Madam, I can see that this has become a fairly user-friendlyBill, which is very commendable, but all I could say is thatstill it revolves around too many professional systems gettinginvolved in the process. The other thing is, whether it reducesthe cost is a question, because the cost factors are not known.But all I want is for you to ensure that it is affordable when itcomes to small companies that we are trying to attract with asingle ownership or sole proprietorship. The partnershipsthat are being lured into the system of companies should belooked at. So if that is the case, please ensure that you lookat the cost factors, which are affordable for some of them.

Madam, moving on to some of the Clauses, this is almosta 500-page Bill, all I would do is comment on certain thingsfor lack of time. Under Clause 43, you have brought in certainthings on the golden share concept, as per protection fromthe Governments point of view, which is laudable. Thegolden share concept was brought in during the time ofcommercialization and at that time, there were certain inimicalthings that had been looked at, practical, empirical evidencethat had been obtained and all that has been incorporatedinto this particular Clause.

Then, I am also informed today that the share premiumpaid to an ongoing company would be looked at as part ofthe share capital instead of a seperate reserve that would becreated. The share reserve, which can be only utilized forcertain activities, has now been realized as a necessity. Afterall, it becomes the funds of all the shareholders, which, Ithought, is very practical and any premium that is paid forshare purchasing of an ongoing company is brought into theshare capital. So, that can be utilized as the will of theshareholders. I guess that it is certainly a laudable factor.

Then, Madam, Section 57: Solvency test. I am informedthat certain Members have suggested that unsecured creditorsshould be given priority. That is one of the suggestions. But

2006 1925952596

it is ludicrous. This must be on the point of view that it has tobe credible; it has to be implementable and it should beattainable. There is no point in saying, We will do this if, atthe end of the day, you cannot get the company moving. Ifyou look at it on the basis that the unsecured creditors shouldget priority, if it is a company that is highly geared, whowould lend money to that company? So, there is a necessitythat the secured creditors be given priority. Do not tamperaround with an issue that can affect this. The administratorcan look at thereafter whether there has been a wilful runningdown of a company and at that time, priority could be givento different people. But certainly if secured creditors are takenoff the system, companies may not get the necessary debtfacility from the banks, venture capitalists or even, may be,when it goes public.

I came to know, when you were speaking, Hon. Minister,that Clauses 400 to 426 of the Companies Bill deal with theappointment and functions of an administrator in regard todefaulting companies. I just perused that. I am sure that allthose things have been looked into. That is certainly viableand workable as long as the administrator appointed is acompetent person who works for the good of the entity ratherthan from a perspective of looking after a creditor of acompany that has gone into insolvency.

But, also I think that Chapter 11 of the relevent AmericanAct and the Indian Sick Industrial Companies Act, whichbasically look after the companies if they face problems,should have been looked at in drafting our Companies Bill.I spoke to the professionals today, some of the members inyour own committee who have also worked before, and theysaid that it was not something workable. I salute theirknowledge which is far superior to mine. I think this shouldalso be looked at because in todays circumstances in thecountry and the economic climate, there are more companiesgoing bankrupt and being incorporated. You mentioned thatthere are 20 to 25 companies being registered a day, I amsorry to hear that because there were almost 50 to 60 companiesincorporated per day in the glorious days when we took over.It went from a negative economy to a positive economyduring the period 2002 to 2004. I hope we will get back tothat era before too long, because there is a necessity. You saidthat there are 56,000 companies that are registered and ofthat, 45,000 are active. I guess it is the same figure that wasthere ealier. I still feel that that number is also not correctbecause the actively involved companies may be about25,000 to 30,000. Ensure that you purge the inactivecompanies because the incompetent, inefficient or corruptcompanies are harmful to the private company image in thiscountry.

This is used by certain politicians who are bankrupt andwho want to hit back at the private sector by saying that it isthe malaise in this country. So, I guess the rectification ofthat may be good to give more confidence. That is, to saythat incompetent or corrupt companies would be taken offthe register of companies. I am only saying that because that

instills confidence. In Singapore or Hong Kong, any companythat does not give its annual returns within four months instruck off the list or it is called upon to pay penalties. Yousaid here it is only Rs. 100,000. I guess that should have beenon the sahre capital of the company. Just saying Rs. 100,000for a company with a share value of Rs. 100 million and Rs.100,000 for a company with a share value of Rs. 50,000 doesnot make any sense. These are the problems. There are justblock figures put in. If you say that it is 5 per cent, 2 per centor 1 per cent of the share value with a minimum penalty ofRs. 100,000, then it will certainly give that penal messageacross to people, because there are many registeredcompanies, which have a worldwide reputation, which havebeen registered here and then just let things go on withoutdoing anything. So, if you do not register their annualaccounts, you should be able to make money from thesecompanie that are only trying to carry on predator activities.So, I would basically call upon you to consider the necessityto look at the revision of the penalty for not giving theirannual returns. My feeling is that, as I mentioned, it is onlyRs. 100,000. I may be subject to correction. But, Hon.Minister, please look at whether there should be a percentageimposed on the share capital of the company.

Then, Madam, I would take a classic case such as thePramuka Bank. The Hon. Minister was trying very hard toget this Bill passed tomorrow. But we have decided that itwill be taken up on the 07th of November, after consulting-

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

Can we not get it passed tomorrow?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No, it cannot, because we did mention that there is a certainflaw in that particular Bill. If you pass it in a hurry, it couldhave ramifications, which would end up in court.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

On the 07th we will be taking up the-

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No. We gave permission to take one or two hours from thetime allocated for the Emergency Debate. We did not want adebate. It was certain people on your own side who wanted tomake a political gain. I must say - [Interruption.] Yes, it is.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)No. That is not for a political gain.

25972598

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)We do not need a debate.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)So, we will pass it tomorrow.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No, not tomorrow. We agreed yesterday very clearly thatwe do not need a debate. So, what is the fear ? You want it-

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)You are discussing it today.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)It was done yesterday and they are bringing therectifications on the 7th of November. So we agreed on that.Even the Hon. Ranjith Siyabalapitiya, the Deputy Minister,found the necesity to brung these amemdments. I mean theseare matters that need to be attended to, but that does notmean that it has to be done in a hurry. There are certain inimicalthings that need to be cortrected. If it is a specific piece oflegislation you name it. What you are trying to do is, in theentire banking industry just nail one particular bank, thePramuka Bank.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)But, do not forget that there are 17,000 depositors.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)My dear Minister, Iam so happy that you are concernedabout them now. What about when we did it ? you made allthe lives miserable. Not you, but your people. This was abank that was about to reopen. Now, the people who aretrying to say that they are salvaging are the ones who wentand said.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)It was closed down during the UNP time.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No It was not.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Why not ?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Hon. Minister, Pramuka Bank was closed down during theperiod when Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga was the FinanceMinister. She is the one who gave the licence for registeredbanks. [interruption] Yes. I said that the registration was givenduring the time of Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga.[interruption]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)It started during our time but you only closed it.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)We did not close it. It was done by the Central BanksSuppervisory Division.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Now, we are going to reopen it. You support it.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)We are the ones who gave that benefit to the banker. It wasstopped by you at that time when we had everything there.We are also saying at this particular moment that the bank-[interruption] Why not ? It was opposed. When we broughtit here you said, We are soory. We cannot support thispartucular bank to be reopened. [interruption]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)When we tried to restart it, you opposed.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)We tried to restart it-

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)During the years 2002 to 2004, you all opposed it. You didnot allow it to be reopened.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)The problem is, this is being the distorted. thePramuka shareholde and the depositors will knowwho did what. You just come here and try to makea big noise. Everybody knows that. At the same time you areso concerned about it. At this particular moment the UnitedNational Party comes forward and says that the Governmentmust pay interest to all these depositors who have not gottheir money. Many have died. They have been suffocated todeath because of that. Now you all are so concernedabout it. We say that is is a necessity to ensure that every

2006 1925992600

depositer - there are 15,780 and of that there are 13,900 who have lessthan Rs. 100,000 - is paid at least the inflationary rate because thecountrys inflation has increased during these five years to date. Thiswas also accepted yesterday and we, as the United National Party giveit as a suggestion.

Going on further, Sir Cluse 154 deals with the Appointment ofauditor . I am made to understand that there again you are bringing inan amemdment which is something the chartered acc- ountants havebeen insisting upon. But I think there is also a necessity to look at thepublic companies where where 100 per cent of the auditors should becharttered accounts. I guess that this is needed. This was somethingwhich I was trying to open up. The ACCA which is a reputed accountingbody and the CIMA which is also a management accounting body -but these do not have auditing experience - should be opened up to acertain extent. At least these two entities need to come in. It does notnecessarily mean that it is full of CIMA or ACCA qualified persons.It can be chartered accountants who can co-opt with these people andhave it going.

There is also another thing which is very luadable. You have notmade this a limited gurantee company for professionals. Today manyprofessionals act un professionally. Before too long the COPE wouldbe revealing to this House the names of certain auditors and accountantswho have behaved despicably. There are certain people who have heldvery high office who have led the Government and the entire countryastray. I gues it is not right at this particular moment as a matter ofprivillege to refer to their names. We will wait till the report is tabled inParliament and then take necessry action against every particular personwho has violated the confidence that has arisen out of theprofessionalism of that particular person and the entity that herepresents. But, if the fear of professionals was to prorect their interestthrough a limited gurantee company, they can do the same through aninsurance process. The insurance policy can cover for the lapses thatwould take place owing to their negligence or certain things that arewell beyoned their knowledge can be protected that way. But, grossnegligence can never be covered through any policy. I guess thatshould be kept open. But, why should gross negligence be protectedand limited to a certain level ?

Then, Sir, I will move on to Clause 131 which deals with the Annual return We have given six months time after balance sheetis signed to have the AGM and before the lapse of15 months of theprevious Annual General Meeting. My feeling is that while theseare the levels that should be maintained to the ultimate, weshould try to make it a little quicker for the simple reasonthat there will be confidence instilled in these stakeholders.Today, there is a general feeling that there are certain peoplewho run companies to their own advantage. Any person whowants to get involved gets frightened that this is going to amonsters hand. So I guess move purification, moreattentiveness and a quicker resolution of this will certainlybeing in the confidence that is expected.

Then, Sir, the other matter is about the computerizationthat you did mention. But I gess this is somthing which shouldbe going on because there are instances at the Register ofCompanies today where the updating does not take place. Iam saying this from practical experience. I was a director in acompany in 2001 and prior to my assuming duties as aMinister in the 2001 Governement, I resigned and thiscompany was sold by us. In 2006, a person who had a problem

with that company took it court and then I got a warrantunder my name just two weeks ago for something which hadhappened in the year 2005. Shareholder information thathad been tabled in 2001 had been used. what is thecomputerzation that has been going on at the Register ofCompanies? This is the ludicrousness that is going on andthis is why I say that there is a necessity of updating becausenow there is complete distortion. It may be a political which-hunt. They did not know what was going on. But they hadused the 2001 information of a company which was sold byme. So that is why I say these types of things only give adifferent dimension and if we do not correct them, it onlyadds to the bad situation that is prevalent today. The countryseconomy is absolutely in dire straits. Interests rates zoomingon one side; inflation beyond control; companies closingup; aid being stopped and the US Dollar going up to Rs. 108.Nobody seems to care what the hell is going on in thiscountry-[Interruption.] The number of Members present herefrom the Government and how attentive they are show thatthey do not understand or do not care what the hell goes onin this country. So I guess there is a necessity that we, fromthe opposition at least play the role of the Government andthat is why we are basically concerned. I repeat my self, if welose the economic war, we have lost all wars. We are havingtoo many enemies aganist the system today. Everybodycolourizes the issues from their point. Nobody realizes thegrativity of the situation in this country. Nobody realizesthat the private sector is the engine of growth today andwhen everything is thrown against this engine of growth, atthe end of the day they expect the same persons who arebeing character assassinated to protect the interests of thiscountry.

The other matter as I mentioned before, is the closing ofcompanies that are [Interruption] You are taking to me anddistracting my attention. Hon, Minister, you mentioned thatthere are 56,000 companies that are registered and of that45,000 are active. To my reckoning it is 59,000 companiesand only 35,000 are active. Ensure that all such companiesare closed down. Otherwise make it a revenue-earningconcept. Instead of paying Rs. 500 make it Rs. 25,000, sothat people move away. Otherwise these companies onlycreate inefficiency, corruption, ineptness and unwanted thingsand then you get a tag saying that these private companiesate the barbaric terrorists in this country. So I guess we needto play a pivotal role if we are creating entities. If it is a soleproprietorship or a joint venture which is not an entity, thenthere is no problem because they personally have to take theresponsibility for that. These are only matters which I ambasically adding on to the good job that you are doing todayby presenting this Bill in Parliament.

Then look at the Modes of winding up in Clause 267. Itis by the court; voluntary; or subject to the supervision of thecourt. I guess this has been dealt with before when we werediscussing certain matters under Clause 57. But all I say isthat there is necessity to quickly bring in regulations in thisregard because there are many sick industrial aand even the

26012602

Government is helping to increase the sick industries. Soyou must get out of that concept on the basis of Chapter IIthat is there in the Amercian system. If it is a company thathas been liquidated for reasons beyond their control,- thereare many instances where the Board of Directors has run thecompany down but there are also situations where sometimesit is not the fault of the company or the directors or theirability to see the writing on the wall-in such situations thereis a necessity to correct them through the creditors givingthem the advantage to run for a particular period sometimesin a different perspective. It may be from a banking perspective;it may be from an insurance perspective or it may besometimes from a competitor point of view. So, it help tokeep the body incorporate going on and for that we mustbring the legistlation supporting this Companies Bill as soonas possible.

Then, the other matter which I am informed is that, alllegal matters related to companies which are going to beregistered under the Companies Act of 2006 would be broughtbefore the Commercial High Court. I think that is very goodbecause the knowledge, the experience that has been obtainedthrough the commercial court process will help to speed-upthe court cases and that will bring in further confidence, instilconfidence in the company system. So, there is a necessity inthat case to decentralize, it because to my reckoning there isonly one commercial High Court in Colombo. You mighthave to get this moving on a district basis, If not, you aregoing to have it congested, clogged in Colombo only. Thenthey will say that everything stems from a Colomboperspective. So I guess that there is a necessity to decentralizethis if this is going to be properly implemented because afterall every company will not be operating from theadministration hub of Colombo.

Hon. Minister, once again while paying tribute for whatyou have done, which may be late but better late than never,we will give you unstinting support and ensure that this isbrought into fruition today. But that does not stop there. Letus step out and see what is going on just outside the Parliamenttoday because that is most important. Today, the country isin absolute jeopardy. But, that does not make us happy. Wesaid that this is going to happen and it has happened. Butthat does not mean that we are going to pull out. We are thereto resurrect this country. Today, you would see that you are inpower with your abilities in question. We are in the Oppositionwith full of ability. That is the difference. Talks are going ontoday for the collective good of this country and I hope beforetoo long the fruition of that will take place. From thereonwards, implementation of that will become a question.But, implementation is a matter that we have not lookedinto. It will be looked into before long.

Look at the situation with regard to the appointment of theAuditor-General. The Auditor-General has retired. We paythe highest tribute to Mr. Mayadunne who did an excellentjob. Almost one and a half months have passed after hisretirement but still there is no successor to him. Is this a

Government that is serious in doing business in this country?Is this a Government that is serious in trying to eradicatecorruption in this country? Is this the Government that iscalling upon to get the country moving, to fight the breachof peace that is there in the country? If it is serious, it mustensure that these things are done. In the COPE, are theMembers across the Floor united in trying to see the moniesof the country being utilized properly? Unfortunately, thereis no help, and people are asking, If this is the interest that isdisplayed by the Government, why on earth are we basicallysacrificing ourselves in paying taxes to the Government? Itis being misused. It is being looted. So, we call upon theGovernment to tell us as to when the Auditor-General is goingto be appointed.

Look at the Constitutional Council. It is in a mess. Thereare ligislations which are there in this country and if theCounstitutional Council cannot be put in place, do you expectthe people to have confidence in this august Assembly? Weare saying this without malice. But this is the perceptionthey have of the Parliamentarians. Parliamentarians are theelected representatives of the people and if they think thatthe people elected by the people are basically paying scantrespect to what is expected of them, then how do you in stillconfidence?

Look at the Lanka Indian Oil Company. See what hashappened to that. Look at the Sri Lanka InsuranceCorporation, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the CeylonPetroleum Corporation, the Bank of Ceylon, the PeoplesBank. Yesterday, the Samurdhi Authority came before theCOPE and by the answers that came across - the Hon. HussainAhamed Bhaila who is here is one of the Members who waspresent. The Hon. Dilan Perera was there - we were appalledat what was going on. It is eleven years today, but they do noteven have a corporate plan to indicate where the hell theywant to go. So if this is the type of institution that is there -[Interruption]. Absolutely, Hon. Minister. I support you. Thatis why I say we must ensure that this is collectively handled.

The AG is someone who is absolutely essential. Now youare saying from a companys point of view you must havechartered accountants appointed. But when you look at fromthe Auditor-Generals Departments point of view, are youtrying to bring in some political Johnny from somewhere?Can you accept this? No way. If you cannot find someonewithin the department, at least bring a professional fromoutside. Pay a reasonable salary. You cannot pay peanuts andyou will only get monkeys at the end of the day. So pleaseensure that we get a proper person. Who is the person whowill come to work in teh Auditor-Generals Department forRs. 25,000? We are only insulting their integrity. They arepeople who have slaved. We must ensure that we pay thecorrect salary and get the best.

After all MPs are going overseas, seeing how other countrieswork. I will give a classic example. The Hon. ArjunaRanatunga and myself were in Tanzania participating in a

[ ]

2006 1926032604

particular anti-corruption programme and when theTanzanians asked how much the Members of Parliament inSri Lanka are paid, we said it is roughly in the range of USDollars 350. He paused to question whether it was US Dollars3,500 or US Dollars 35,000, because in Tanzania the MPs getUS Dollars 2,500. So this situation only leads to unnecessaryproblems in future. All we want to do is, let the benefitspermeate down to the officials. There are brilliant officers.But they are being paid paltry salaries and as a result we losethe talent and they go out. I quote the headline of The Islanddated 2nd October. 2006 :

AGs report on State sector corruption gathers dust.

Is the Government not interested in eradicating corruption?There is lovely lip-service being paid. Everyone talks of everyChinthanaya on earth but does not make the correct move.Appoint the Auditor-General. Do not let the image of thecountry, the Government and the Cabinet and the intentionsof the rulers ruined by the lackadaisical manner that thesethings are done in this country.

Then look at the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance. Iread with interest a letter that had been sent by Mr. NihalAmarasekera which had a lot of factual information andquestioning the ability and the lack of timely interventionby the Secretary in matters that have been brought to hisknowledge. And he is the person that seems to be running theeconomy by himself. He is definitely a talented man. But nocountry can be run by one person. Everybody has a certainknowledge which could be used collectively to make thecountry going. - [Interruption]. That is absolutely correct,Sir. As you could see, you cannot have prosperity in an oceanof poverty. So if one person is trying to be an island then Iguess that we need to ensure that type of an island is convertedto an ocean. If one person can run this economy, well andgood. Tinkering around the economy for 11 years politicallysaying, I will give that, I will give this has not helped.People got nothing at the end of the day and collectivelyeverybody pays for the sins of one person. Please, you havegot to galvanize this. If you do not have the confidence orthe guts to take the system on, then there is no point in runninga Government. That is why I say - I say this with no malice -that one person cannot handle the economy. Everybody hasa role to play and if everybody puts his shoulder to the wheel,then only the wheel gets moving.

The PA has been running this country from 2nd April, 2004.Chinthanaya may have been in existence for the last 10months. But the Peoples Alliance with the Janatha VimukthiPeramuna and the Hela Urumaya have been running thecountry for nearly three years. Where is the benefit? Where isthe cost reduction? Where is the eradication of corruption?where is the investor confidence? Where is peace in this country?These are what you gloriously promised the people. . , ., ? ? . .

Look at what is being told today about foreign funding.Sri Lanka Country Director ADB, Mr. Pio just before he leftthae country, what did he say? He said, foreign funding willdepend on peace progress. I am not in anyway trying toadvocate the peacde process.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . The Sunday Times of 15th October carried a newsitem, Germany puts pressure on Lanka aid frozen.

Thers is no aid coming from Germany. The ADB says thatthere is a problem for funding. The World Bank says thatthere is a problem and the Centrel Bank warns speculatorsthat the Dollar has gone up to Rs. 107.90 today. What is themeaning of this? When we handed over the Government, theDollar was at Rs. 93. From Rs. 93 to Rs. 108 is a fifteen rupeedevaluation. The devaluation has taken place owing to theinefficiency or mismanagement of the economy. That is all itcan be reflected to. If not, what is the collective basis? Today,

26132614

the inflation is 18 per cent. You have the investments flyingout of the country. Therefore you must bring peace to thiscountry. That is left for you all. We as the Opposition, areonly supporting whatever you do. Remember! That is thesupport we have given. So do not turn round and say that wehave obstructed you. It may be our plan.It may be ourinefficiency. But we have given that benefit to you. Beforetoo long people will judge. At the same time there arehistorical events that are taking place and I hope that for thecollective good of this country His Excellency the Presidentand the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Leader of theOpposition will do the right thing. The Leader of theOpposition from our side has gone public saying that thereis an MoU being signed with the President for the collectivegood and that necessarily means that there should be agenuine agreement in order to implement a genuine powersharing. Remember there is no short cut method of goingthrough. The basis should be; if you want genuine help,ensure that a genuine response is given. There is no basis oftrying to take this and that and create friction within ourparty. We are united. They tried to show that the Committeewas divided. No! It was united. They are trying to show thatour party is divided. No! We are stronger than ever. Butremember your Government is divided. You have aheterogeneous alliance which has difficulties in gettingtogether. So first, before you point the finger at the Oppositiontry to get the heterogeneous grouping together. If they donot give the answer to you, do not turn to the opposition toovercome your problems.

All I wish to say is, today fuel prices have come down inthe world they say and it is a fact. If that is the case, why isthe price of petrol not reduced? If that is the case, why is thecost of electricity not reduced? If that is the case, why hasthe price of cement gone up to Rs. 615? If that is the case,why are food prices going up day by day? You are trying toextort. You are trying to show that the Government issubsidizing petrol. Absolute nonsense! It is a preposterouslie. All you do is, you are making almost 40 per cent ofrevenue through taxation. So if that is your basis then go up-front and tell the people that we are collecting funds becausewe are bankrupt. Nobody will oppose that. On that score allI want to say is that the economy is in the hands of theGovernment and the Government is under your control. Donot blame the opposition for your failures, infficiency orincompetency.

Today, we are supporting to pass this Bill unconditionallyfor the simple reason that we believe that the right thing is toget the right support. On that basis we tell His ExcellencyMahinda Rajapaksa, who is the President,-

I take it Madam Chairperson that today is a very histroicaloccasion in this House. After nearly 24 years we havepresented an important piece of legislation to the Parliamentthat would stimulate and add development to the commercialsector of our country. Last time we saw a similar legislationbeing presented, which was the Companies Act, No. 17 of1982. That was presented by the late Minister, LalithAthulathmudali. Today, the Hon. Minister JeyarajFernandopulle has been fortunate and has worked tirelesslywith the commercial sector, the intelligentsia and allprofessional bodies in order to make this a realisticdevelopment by introducting this piece of legislation. I mustcompliment my Colleague, Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle who

[ ]

2006 1926152616

will join the annals of history for the presentation of a farreaching legislation in his capacity as the Minister of Trade,Commerce, Consumer Affairs and Marketing Development.Having congratulated him for the insight he has had and thetype of contribution that he has sought and obtained fromthe important segments of the society and the communityassociated with commerce and industry in this country, I thinkwe have done well as a Government to have presented this farreaching peace of legislation for the benefit of the commercialsector and trade in our country.

What is this legislation all about, Madam Chairperson ?What was spoken by my Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake,was without any serious objection, but more of anendorsement of the way in which this legislation has beenformatted. What we have expected from this legislation isthe overall development of a modern and contemporary, morefuturistic, commercial and convenient business operationsystem. We have to fashing it as a piece of legislation that ischaracteristic of business development and not corporatedevelopment, in the strict sense. What we saw in theCompanies Act, No. 17 of 1982 was a replica of the UnitedKindom Act of 1948. That was the Act that governed thecompanies legislation in the United Kingdom. Now, the samething was introduced in 1982 which was thought anappropriate piece of legislation, which rightly we all endorsed.That has to be changed at least after a period of 58 years,because we have discussed and we have handled our entirecommercial development process through a corporateincorporation system that was as old as the independence ofSri Lanka. So, it is very appropriate that we have now cometo the stage of having to change and that change has nowbeen brought about in terms of this Bill, as a total, completeand comprehensive piece of legislation in the year 2006.

If I may quote what the late Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali,the Minister of Trade and Shipping said in introducing theoriginal piece of legislation to the House on the 3rd ofNovember, 1981, it states :

One cannot seek to build up an economy in meaningful termsunless one provides legal and institutional frameworks. Thus, whateverform or economy you have in mind, unless you create that legal andinstitutional back-up, most of what you seek to do will not succeed.

It is in that context, today once again, I reiterate what thelate Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali went on to state on the 03rdof November, 1981. This piece of legislation we are nowintroducing seeks to address the needs of the change that weare drammatically moving towards. We are part of a bigpicture. We are part of a big picture. We cannot take Sri Lankain isolation as an island nation with slightly over a US Dollars1,000 per capita income. But as policy makers and asMembers of a Government, it is our responsibility to positionSri Lanka for the future. The United National Party which hasruled this country, the PA that has ruled this country and thePA-JVP Alliance that is ruling this country and led by HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa today as the President, wehave to look at positioning Sri Lanka for the future.

It is in that context, once again that this Bill which Icommend, is an appropriate piece of legislation, because weare now seeking to achieve more realistic goals and makingthings happen in this country in a pragmatic way. That iswhy I state that today we are looking at a business corporationdevelopment. This is a piece of legislation that addressesbusiness co-operation ; a business as a co-operation ; businessas co-operation rather than a share stake as a corporate entity.This is the shift of the entire focus from that of a traditionalcorporate body where you need a minimum number ofshareholders, you need a set of objectives in order to give lifeto a corporate creation of a legal entity and thereby youexpect that entity to perform like that of an individual. Wehave run into a series of issues including that of the ultravires doctrine where your powers, as vested in terms of acertificate given by the companies incorporation, is notgetting registered withs the drive the company has topursue, a passage or the route the company must take. Itruns into conflicts in terms of your own power as a legalperson and that of a power as an individual that has topursue a goal in terms of development.

Why do we create legislation? In order to address theseissues. This legislation too has addressed these issues in avery complacent manner and in a far-reaching way. Thisis what I want to further address whether we should notdeal with further areas for development. The legislationhas dealt with far-reaching issues to facilitate thecommercial activity rather than hindering it; to facilitatebetter management of business and to adjust to the needsof change than to bring about the role of companyperformance in modern commercial life in terms of how ithas to get adopted to realistic changes that are necessarywhen a company is growing. Now having said that, wehave to minimize barriers for entry of small businesses,seeking the benefit of incorporation which are now thelargest number of enterprises in the country.

This is why I brought in legislation to incorporate theNational Enterprise Development Authority in thiscountry in March this year because there are so manyenterprises, proprietorships, partnerships that are outsidethe normal perception of that of a corporate body. Wehave to provide for these enterprises in order to foster,develop and progress catering to the needs of the country.How can an individual who is having a proprietorshipregistered at the local level, at the Pradeshiya Sabha levelor that of a Divisional Secretariat level, in terms of abusiness registration, get elevated and graduated to ahigher level of development, go to a bank and submit hisbalance sheet and seek assistance from a bank in order toget greater infusion of capital to his enterprise? We haveto bring the culture of a corporate entity. That is what wecall Business Co-operation Development. Now this is alegislation by which we are transforming the shareholderstake into that of business co-operation development. Nowwhy should there be more than one shareholder if that isthe case? I have just discussed, with my Hon. Colleague,

[ ]

26172618

the Hon. Minister of Trade, Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle,about Clause 4 (2) of the Bill. In that, in the Incorporationof Companies, Clause 4(2) still provides for, I quote:

A company shall have not less than two shareholders, providedthat a company may have a single shareholder, where such singleshareholder is a body corporate or the Secretary to the Treasury.

With the permission of my Colleague, the Hon. Ministerof Trade, I wish to propose that we should look at it againbecause this is an area where the individual, the proposers,the proponents of this change, have strongly suggestedthat we register and we permit single shareholdercompanies to get incorporated under the new CompaniesAct. Why should we have a shift from that? Because thatwas a major deliberation that went on to address, as Ioriginally stated, the business co-operation development.Now what is our objective? Is it our objective to onceagain stifle the entire unit in terms of a creation of a legalentity to have two persons minimum as shareholders? Alot of these companies have Rs.10 shareholdings. Shouldwe recognize that type of farce that is associated in termsof the registration process? To satisfy whom? Does itsatisfy the objective for which we are bringing thislegislation? This is why I am advocating this even at thisstage. I take it this will be accepted by my Colleague, thatthe objective is to develop the corporate enterprise, thenthe shareholding is not what matters and even a singleproprietorship should be able to incorporate and thuscreate a legal entity. That can fashion, that can develop,that can pursue, that can go on the route for developmentof our entrepreneurial sector of Sri Lanka. That is thesector that is catering to the most number of jobs in thiscountry. That is the sector that is catering to the greatestnumber of per capita development contribution in thiscountry. That is the sector that is looking at far reachinginnovative schemes that should come in, in order toaddress Sri Lankas future which is in the globalized trend.If we are to look at the development of corporate entities,we should not go back to 1948 Companies Act of GreatBritain. We should look at the Companies Bill of 2006 ofSri Lanka to address the trends that have emerged in theworld in terms of making business possible and businessbetter in a location called Sri Lanka. That is what we haveto address and I want to make special note of that in mysubmissions here.

Then, Madam, we also have to encourage the efficientand innovative management of companies by conferringon the directors a wide measure of direction in matters ofbusiness judgment, whilst protecting shareholders andcreditors against abuse of management power, not toinhibit legitimate commercial activities, not to placeunnecessary limits on the ability of participants inenterprises to structure those enterprises in the mostappropriate way. It is important to make provision for thepossibility of rehabilitating businesses facing

insurmountable or temporary difficulties and to providesimple, expeditious and fair procedures for realizing anddistributing the assets of insolvent and defunctcompanies.

How do we address these things? We have seen thelimitations, as I mentioned earlier. In terms of thememorandum of articles in the incorporation of acompany, limitations have to be brought in, which is thepurpose of this new legislation. That is, to make it broad-based as something which moves in the direction that isright for the country, that can stimulate the economy andmake things happen as an individual although it has thestatus of an incorporated legal entity. That is the purposeand the direction of this Bill so that even a single-shareholder stake can succeed; it can get developed intoa better management structure. Our rural economy canget stimulated and improved because there is a corporateculture that would be brought in.

I totally agree with the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake who wenton to say that, where court intervention is necessary, we mustestablish Commercial High Courts throughout the countryso that commercial disputes could be straightway addressedat that level. At the same time, the judges as well as the lawyershave to be encouraged to advocate the resolution of theseissues. Otherwise, once again we will be saddled with moreand more protracted procedures associated with the resolutionof issues and disputes.

This is why I am trying to position Sri Lanka on a higherpedestal to attract investments into the country. I am indeedhappy that yesterday I was able to launch the WorldInvestment Report 2006 issued by the United Nations. Inthat, we have recognized that the major flow of investmentshas been centred around the Ms and As: the Merges andAcquisitions. Now for Sri Lanka to get foreign directinvestments on merges and acquisitions, we have to have ahigher level of corporate entities where the merges andacquisitions will be an attraction to the foreign directinvestors. In order to do that, we have to now lift up the baseon which we are positioning our enterprises. In that context,we need a legislative framework that could bring about thatneed because that is the need even the late Hon. LalithAthulath Mudali as Minister of Trade and Shipping at thattime advocated in presenting the Companies Bill in 1982.

Now this is the change we are trying to bring about ; this iswhat we need for Sri Lankas advancement, to make it pro -business. It was the crux of the argument presented by theHon. Ravi Karunanayake : whether Sri Lanka has a pro -business environment.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)

Order, Please! Hon. Minister, you have three minutes more.

2006 1926192620

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

May I have ten minutes more from the Government side?[Interruption.] Are you giving me time from your side? I wasvery liberal with the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake when therewas no one to allocate time for him because the ChiefOppostion whip was not there. Now, let me have ten minutesmore, Madam.

In that context, we are looking at positioning Sri Lanka ona platform where we would have a pro - business environmentcreated. This pro-business environment need not be of a totalcapitalist structure that anyone has to fear about. It is theenterpreneurship which lies within the people of this countrythat needs to be brough out. The generation of capital, asDas Kapital states, is not in the hands of the people. It is thecreativity and the innovativeness that lead to the generationof activity which stimulates in terms of monetary gains,monetary transactions and monetary development.

Now that is a total broad - based approach that ourPresident, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, is advocating.That is why we have already brought in legislation to createthe National Enterprise Development Authority under me,which is now trying to address this innovation and thedevelopment of the enterpreneurial sector of our country.Madam chairperson, in your own area, in Anuradhapura, howmany clever and creative enterpreneurs are there? But, canyou allocate lands for their needs? The land structure in ourcountry is dubious. Land is held by the State and in your owndistrict, I take it, only annual permits can be granted to lot ofenterprises. who can continue his enterprise on an annuallyrenewable permit?

These are the anomalies we have to rectify and thechallenges we have to meet. How do you rectify all thesethings? We need far - reaching changes and we have to saythat we are ready for the changes. When we change, we haveto change for the better. That is the approach of ourGovernment in making things happen and likewise, we havelifted our economy. The dismal picture that the Hon. RaviKarunanayake was trying to paint is not real. Yesterday, weargued in terms of economic growth. I did speak yesterday aswell. In that, we showed how an economy can grow at 8.1percent in the first quarter and end with an annual growth rate ofaround 8 per cent. If there is no growth in the economy, howcan a rate like that get registered? These are things that wecan always debate and argue on, but we must be realistic ; wemust be correct and we must not try to paint a picture merelybecause it has been stated so by the Opposition benches asthe tradition demands.

We have to look at positioning Sri Lanka once again. Thatis what I am trying to harp and emphasize on. The positioningof Sri Lanka is a major dilemma that most of our Governmentshave been faced with. How to position Sri Lanka? How tobrand us? How to take us forward? We have to look beyondthe shores of our country. We have to position Sri Lanka

today as a global player or a regional player. should we be amajor player in the region or should we be the springboardfor the emerging and dynamic economies around us likeIndia, Pakistan, the Far East and the Middle - East? ShouldSri Lanka be the centre once again in making a bettereconomic base and be a springboard for other economies tobenefit from and thereby, finally achive development for SriLanka? Should we not look at an integrated developmentpattern for Sri Lanka, which will bring all sectors togetherand lift up Sri Lankas economy so that the countrys revenuewill go up and the people in this country will have higherincomes? These are the dilemmas as well as the challengesthat we have to overcome. This is where the necessary changesthat we advocated today will have to, rightfully, come intooperation.

In this Bill, there are very important provisions spelledout, which we have to endorse as needed for economicstimulation and in order to create business corporatedevelopment as has been expected by the new legislation.The Companies Bill is removing the need for companies tostate the principle objects so that there is no issue of gettingconfined to the development and the progress that isassociated. The Ultra vires rules will be abolished so far asthird parties are concerned. What I am trying to advocate isthe introduction of the incorporation of single - shareholdercompanies.

Private companies are to be prohibited from issuing shares,securities to the public, but there is no restriction on thetransfer of shares with the option for the company to havesuch a requirement, if desired, in its articles. There is also theabolition of the par value of shares, the introduction of astated capital regime so that we can go for a stated capitalrather than an authorized capital or an issued capital. This ismore practical, pragmatic and more relevant to the currenttimes. There is provision for financial assistance by acompany for the acquisition of its shares in circumstancesset out in the relevant Clauses.

Likewise, we are bringing in a major development fortransactions to become more feasible, accessible, simplifiedin terms of procedure so that the entrepreneurial culture, thedevelopment of the business corporation sector in thiscountry is being backed by legislation. So, this legislationis of a far-reacing value.

I have to mention some of the aspersions cast by my learnedFriend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, on the peace process.Here is a President who said, We are ready to talk at alltimes. But, at the same time, we have to safeguard thenational ssovereignty and the territorial integrity of ourcountry. We have to safeguard the rights of our forces whoare valiantly attempting to defend our areas and to protectthe people of all communities in this country.

In that approach, we are engaging ourselves in a seriousdialogue in order to bring about lasing peace. We are hopefulof meeting the LTTE in Geneva in terms of finding a

26212622

negotiated settlement to the ongoing conflict. But, at thesame time, our stand remains: to protect the peoples rightsand the countrys rights. That has always to be the foremostduty of a Government which has a commitment to the country.That is a clear explanation of our stand in terms of ourapproach to peace, which was raised by the Hon. RaviKarunanayake.

At the same time, in terms of politics, it is well and goodthat the United National Party is attempting to co-operatewith the Government, which we have to appreciate and whichI have always been an advocater of. In that context, thehegemony of a party of the country has to be looked at; howa hegemonic approach affects the countrys requirementsand the Executive Presidency has to be considered. As I see,more of the Hon. Members of the UNP are today at the TempleTrees than at Sirikotha, which is a good trend because that ishow it has to be and that culture will prevail. After all, goodgovernance will have to come up for the benefit of thiscountry.

Once again, I must thank and compliment my learnedFriend, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, for bringing thisfar-reaching legislation and he will be remembered well forhis far-sighted approach in bringing about lastingdevelopment into the commercial sector of our country. Imust also thank all the participants of the legal committeeswho contributed to the drafting of this legislation.

Thank you.

Reforms and Deputy Minister of Constitutional Affairs andNational Integration)

Thank you Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. First ofall, let me congratulate you on your appointment as theDeputy Chairman of Committees and I am happy to speakwhile you being a person who was born and bred in my district,are presiding this House.

Any activity seeking financial rewards for effort has totake risks. After independence, the private sector was averseto taking risks. Consequently, the State had to take risks. Itembarked on a series of commercial activities which werecalled public corporations.

Increasingly the private sector was willing to take risks. Itsmain organizational form is the public company althoughthere are also sole proprietorships and partnerships. The risktakers are the owners, the shareholders and the risk averse arethe employees. The most risk averse in this country are thepublic servants. They want the certainty of the pension.

With the concept of limited liability, the risk taken by theowners, the shareholders, was limited to their share investment.The shareholder may lose the stake invested but not his otherassets. The ultimate cost of the business failure has to beborne by the creditors, the creditors who have lent moneywithout collateral losing the most, though gaining the mostif the company is successful. A public company is a business5 PL 001557 (2006/10)

26332634

organizaton with definitive legal attributes, which organizescapital for economic activity. The investors, employees,society ; all gain from the operations of a successful businesscompany.

But here is the nub. A successful business company doeswell only because the top management ; meaning the Boardof Directors, make it so. Technically, the shareholders electthe Board. But shareholders are not equal. They do not haveone man, one vote as in the political sphere. The voting isweighted by the extent of ownership ; that is, the rich dominatethe company. In a situation where investors are widespread, arich group with a Small investment could appoint their ownDirectors and use company funds for their own use. Onenotorious example is the United States company, Enron. TheBoard of Directors of Enron had used creative accountingmethods to hide losses and negative capital structure. Theyhid their liabilities in off - balance sheet accounts, thusmisleading even qualified financial analysts. Eventually,Enron went into bankruptcy, taking down with them not onlythe small shareholders but also employees with their pensionfunds.

Hon. Deputy chairman of Committees, we know, some ofthe plantation companies that own estates in our country,have about five or six sub companies. They have about ten oreleven factories. What they do is, they show that some ofthose companies have losses and one company has profitsand they would try to do exactly what Enron did.

Though the Directors of a company have responsibilitiesunder the present Companies Act, there is no clearidentification of these responsibilities and duties. If recourseis required under the present Act it is necessary to invokecase law. This means hiring expensive lawyers like my GoodFriend, the Hon. Faizer Musthapha. This is always notpossible for a small investor. The new Companies Bill correctsthis. It makes Directors; one, to act in good faith in the bestinterest of the company ; two, not to act or agree to an actionwhich is contrary to the law ; three, not to use or discloseconfidential information whithout the prior approval of theBoard of Directors.

In short there is a higher level of accountability on the partof the Board of Directors.

The companies Bill which we are discussing today infusesthis higher accountability into the business process. There isa codification of the present law relating to the duties ofDirectors with a view to adding clarity. The concept of asolvency test regime has been introduced. This increases theresponsibility of the company directors. They will be heldresponsible if the company goes into bankruptcy. If any actionthreatens the solvency of the company, then the companydirectors are debarred from carrying out that act. This,sometimes might create a danger that this provision willdissuade competent personnel from seeking to be company

[ ]directors but there has to be a trade - off. This danger shouldbe contrasted with preventing charlatan company directors -like in Enron - from ruining the company.

There are other desirable provisions in the new CompaniesBill. For example, the Memorandum of Association has beeneliminated. The MoA, the Memorandum of Association hadled to a lot of abuse. The ultra vires concept has prevented acompany from undertaking downside or upside activities,because it would contravene the MoA. On the other hand,the catch - all phrase, Any other business that the Board ofDirectors decide, makes a mockery of the MoA. In addition,the MoA, Memorandum of Association, could provide poisonpills, to prevent dissatisfied shareholders from voting outincompetent directors. Therefore, the MoA has been deletedfrom the new Companies Bill.

One problem in the old Companies Act was the inordinatetime given to settle disputes through the judicial process.The new Companies Bill establishes a Companies DisputesBoard to settle disputes through mediation. There is also asimplified procedure for application to court and the grant ofinterim relief. There is also a court power to order the provisionof security or an undertaking to make good any loss sufferedby the other party. The new companies Bill is a law of equity.

Sri Lanka is entering into a globalized economy. Theorganizations adding most value are small informationtechnology companies. These could even be one mancompanies. The new Companies Bill permits a simplifiedincorporation process, wothout having to go throughelaborate legal procedures ; even one man companies couldbe incorporated.

Sri Lanka is now in the global economy and in the 21stcentury. We cannot revert to the feudal past but need toreadjust to the future. Companies are the wealth creatingorganizations that will ensure Sri Lankas progress. Theyshould be sponsored. We should , therefore, provide inmodern legal framework for these companies to be establishedand grow, and also punish those who misuse the law.

All changes have costs. Those who have built theirintellectual capital on the old, have to painfully readjust. Itis troublesome. But the world will not wait for us. We have tochange to suit the world. These costs of change have to beabsorbed to build a new intellectual capital. I am sure ourprofessionals are up to this task.

I commend the Hon. Minister for presenting this farreaching and well though out Bill. This is a long needed Billthat the country needed. While congratulating the Hon.Minister for presenting this new Bill I would also like to wishthe Hon. Minister who is a member in the Governmentdelegation that is going to Geneva at the end of this monthgood luck. The delegation led by the Hon. Nimal Siripala deSilva who also happens to be the district leader of my Districtis going for peace talks at the end of this month in a situation

2006 1926352636

where all of us are wishing and praying that the peace talks inGeneva will be successful. I am sure the Hon. Minister, JeyarajFernandopulle who has been an asset to this House when itcomes to matters relating to standing Orders and when itcomes to guiding the House to do things in the right way,will be a huge tower of strength in that delegation to guidethe most needed peace talks in the right direction.

At this juncture, I would also like to reply to some of theissues raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. ? , , . , . , . , , . , , , . , , . . . . , . , . . . , . . , . . . , . , . , . , . . . . , , , . , _ agree to disagree _ concept . , ,

( )(The Hon. Neomal Perera)Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is a pleasure forme to speak on the Companies Bill. I would also like tothank the Hon. Jeyeraj Fernandopulle, the Minister of Trade,Commerce, Consumer Affairs and Marketing Developmentfor bringing this Bill.

Actually, we should not forget that in 1993 the then Ministerof Trade and Commerce recognized the need to reform theCompanies Act to help advance and accelerate theGovernments programme of economic liberalization anddevelopment and remove barriers for investment anddevelopment. He called upon the Advisory Commission onthe Companies Law to report on reforms to the present theCompanies Act, No. 17 of 1982, which is largely based onthe United Kingdoms Act of 1948. Today it is 58 years old.The Commission worked, identifying three important criteria,namely; clarity, accessibility and relevance.

[ ]Since the Hon. Dillan Perera is here, I would to state thatthe Hon. Ravi Karunanayake did not condemn theGovernments initiatives or decisions, but only said that thiswas starated in 1993 by the United National PartyGovernment at that time. He was only saying that an Auditor-General should be appointed, which is a must for transparencyand to stop corruption. A good person must be appointed.The former Auditor-General gave an adverse report at the endof his term about the accountability of the Government. So,it is the necessity to appoint an efficient Auditor-Generalthat the Hon. Karunanayake basically emphasized on.

For a dynamic economy, it is important to update theCompanies Act. Discussions have taken place for more thana decade. The modern limited liability company, therefore,evolved to restrict the liability of investors. The simplesteconomic legal unit is the sold trader. The liability of thesole trader or the proprietor is not limited. He could gobankrupt personally due to the decisions taken by anindividual. Partnership is a relationship between two or more,This is the same as in the case of a sole trader. It is not so witha company and a company is an ambiguous term. In acompany, the liability is limited. The fundamental goals of acompanys legislation should be to facilitate commercialactivities rather than hinder it.

Sir, I quote from the newspaper article The rationale for anew Companies Act and its salient features by K. Kanag-Isvaran P. C. Chairman, Company Law Advisory Commission,which states on the rold of a company,

*.......... small businesses seeking the benefit of corporation.*encourage efficient and innovative management of companies,.........While protecting shareholders and creditors against abuses ofmanagment power.*not inhibit legitimate commercial activities*not place unnecessary limits on the ability of the participants inenterprises to structure those enterprises in the most appropriate way.*make provisions for the possibility of rehabilitating businesses facingsurmountable or temporary difficulities.*provide simple expeditious and fair procedures for realizing anddistributing the assets of insolvent and defunct companies.

Additionally, some small companies should be able tomanage without frequent professional advice. The newCompanies Bill was long overdue and is now being mademodern, clear, accessible and relevant.

I must also thank the Mr. K. Kanag-Isvaran, PC, Chairmanof the Company Law Advisory Commission for putting thisinto order and making it a document presentable to Parliamentto make it law. Sir, Mr. Kanag-Isvaran I further says, I quote :

The new Companies Act comprises five hundred and thirty foursections with Thirteen Schedules. ............ some of the salient featuresof the proposed new regime may be noted.

They are :*Companies will not be required to state principal objects.*the ultra vires rule will be abolished, so far as third parties areconcerned : ...........*introduction of single shareholder companies : ..............*private companies prohibited from issuing shares/ securities to thepublic, but no restriction on the transfer of shares, with option for thecompany to have such a requirement, if desired, in its articles : S 27

2006 1926392640

* abolition of the part value of shares .......*the introduction of the shtated capital regime......*provision for financial assistance by a company for the acquisitionof its shares in circumstances set out in the relevant section : .......*introduction of the concept of major transactions...............provision for minority buy - out : .... special provision dealing withdirectors and secretaries : ........*codification of the present law relating to the duties of directorswith a view to added clarity : ....*duty of directors on insolvency ......*duty of directors on serious loss of capital ........*establishment of a Companies Disputes Board for settlement ofdisputes, identified therin, by mediation ......*abolition of Peoples Companies ; and*give statutory recognition to the derivative action ......prevention of oppression and mismanagement and special provisionfor interim orders in respect of applications relative thereto ...............*simplified procedure for application to court under the Act and thegrant of interim relief and the power to order the provision of securityor and undertaking to make good any loss suffered by the other partyas a consequence of such orders.

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and the Hon. RohithaBogollagama also mentioned that it is important to establishmore courts other other than those in Colombo so that thedelay will be reduced as the businessmen in different areaswill be able to go to their respective courts and get judgmentswithout a delay.

I hope the fairness, which the lawyers expect the judges togive, will be done away, because fairness to two parties couldhave ben achieved outside court. Otherwise, there is nonecessity for people to go to court if the judge is to say.Settle it out of court in fairness to both parties.

Therefore, Hon. Minister, I thank you once again forbringing this Bill and hope we will be having a non-confrontational political era instead of confrontationalpolitics. I hope this year, 2006, will be an era of consensualpolitics. Now, you are sending a peace delegation, with ouragent also in it: the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - [Interruption]Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama is in the negotiating team. Thereare many more. But he is the only one in your team which isgoing to Geneva for peace talks. - [Interruption] I wish youall success. I know you are a maestro. We can call you amaestro as you are a very good. .I wish you all the best. I hope this companies Act will comeinto effect immediately.

Thank you very much.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . .

[1.40 p. m.]

( )(The Hon. Faizer Musthapa)Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Bill beforeParliament today, which is to repeal the Companies Act, No.17 of 1982 and to bring about a new Companies Act, is a

major milestone in our legal history, as periodically thesuccessive Governments have attempted to bring about thischange and it is heartening to notetheatour Government,under the leadership of His Excellency the President MahindaRajapaksa, has been able to achieve this after a period of 14years.

We are fully aware that the business world has movedaway from carrying on businesses by way of a soleproprietorship or partnership to carry on business by way ofa limited liability company. The primary benefit in carryingon a business by way of a limited liability company is thatones business risk is being restricted to ones investment andthe failure of the business has no bearing on ones personalaassets or property. This has increased commercial activityby entrepreneurs and businessmen willing to take businessrisks by carrying out new ventures or businesses. However, inSri Lanka, due to the complexity in carrying on a business byway of a limited liability company, the majority of thebusiness community carry on businesses by way of soleproprietorship or partnership.

A major change introduced in the present Bill is the doingaway of the Memorandum of Association, which restricts acompany carrying on a business other than those specified inthe objects stated therein. The present Bill, which does notrequire a company to specify its objects, would encouragesmall and medium-scale businessmen, who engage in diversefields of business, to carry on their businesses by way of alimited liability company, which would be a very encouragingfactor. This would take away the problems created by theUltra vires doctrine when company acts outside the ambit ofthe objects.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of committees, as our presentCompanies Act requires a minimum of two shareholders, thelaw prevents a company from owning 100 per cent shares ofa fully-owned subsidiary or the Secretary to the Treasuryfrom holding 100 per cent shares in a limited liabilitycompany. This restriction has been taken away by the proposdnew Bill, permitting 100 per cent shareholding of a limitedliability company by a single body corporate or the Secretaryto the Treasury.

As at present, various difficulties are faced by parties inrelation to pre incorporation contracts, the reason being thatthe present Companies Act has no provision dealing with itand it has been left to the common law to deal with. Pre-incorporation contracts play a very vital role in setting up alimited liability company especially when joint ventures areto be carried out through local and foreign collaboration, asparties, who are to be the prospective shareholders, enterinto various agreements and give various undertakings priorto the incorporation of the entity in order to facilitate thecreation of a proposed business entity. However, theproposed Bill has expressed statutory provisions thatconsequent to the ratification by the company of a pre-incorporation contract, the said agreement shall be valid

26412642

[ ]and enforceable as entered into by the company, thus takingaway the difficulty faced by an aggrieved party in enforcinga pre-incorporation contract against the company. Anothersalient feature brought about by this Bill is the simplificationof the procedure in decision-making in a private companyby permitting decisions to be taken unanimouslynotwithstanding any provisions of the articles of the companyto the contrary. However, it is encouraging to note that thisprovision in dealing with decision-making of a privatecompany has been subject to safeguard against insolvencyas distribution by a company which fails to satisfy thesolvency test is deemed to be invalid.

A discouraging factor in persons carrying out businessesby way of a limited liability company is the various statutoryrequirements one has to annually comply with. It isencouraging to note that in this Bill, the requirement for anannual return to be filed by a private company has been doneaway with unless required to do so by the Registrar ofCompanies. As regards the holding of the Annual GeneralMeeting which is a mandatory requirement in the presentAct, this Bill introduces provisions for a shareholders to passa resolution without holding the Annual General Meetingand the decisions made by the said resolution would bedeemed to be decisions made at the Annual General Meeting.

The Companies Bill has further simplified the procedure asregards the reduction of share capital. Under the presentAct, one has to make an application to court but under thisBill, a reduction could be made by a resolution without anapplication to court.

This Bill unlike the present Act, permits a company to buyits own shares. This has been done taking into considerationminority shareholder interests as under certain circumstancesa shareholder is entitled to compel the company to buy sharesheld by him in the said company.

As manipulation and window dressing of accountsglobally have led to major financial fraud leaving shareholdersto be misled and end up in bankruptcy, the Bill beforeParliament introduces additional safeguards by making itmandatory that accounts be tendered within six months fromthe receipt of the balance sheet. In addition, to prevent theboard of directors forcing an auditor to resign as he is refusingto manipulate accounts as requested, statutory provisionshave been brought in which would require a statement to begiven by an auditor in the event he resigns or ceases to holdoffice setting out the circumstances connected with himceasing to hold office or resigning or if there is no reason, astatement that there is no reason for doing the same. A furthersafeguard introduced by he Bill is that the auditor resigningor ceasing to hold office is entitled to if he is of the view thatthe shareholders should be aware of the circumstances underwhich he resigned or ceased to hold office be known to theshareholders, it being mandatory for the company to circulatethe statement to the shareholders and to the Registrar ofCompanies.

The Bill in the interest of minority shareholders. Mr.Deputy Chairman, has also introduced a statutory provisionwhich prevents a company from entering into a majortransaction without passing a special resolution. Mr. DeputyChairman, a major transaction has been defined as anytransaction which is equal to half the assets of the companywhich is a very positive factor in the Bill.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, even though a derivative action wasnot a statutory remedy, our courts have recognized the rightof a minority shareholder to bring a derivative action to protectfraud being perpetuated against the company by a majorityshareholder. Thus it is commendable that the right to institutea derivative action has been provided for in the Bill. However,the requirement that leave of court having to be obtainedprior to proceeding with a derivate action would prevent theabuse of the process of court in initiating derivative actionsis another positive aspect in the present Bill.

May I conclude by congratulating the team of lawyers andother professionals headed by Mr. Kanag-Iswaran,Presidents Counsel, Dr. Harsha Cabral, Presidents Counsel,Mr. Nihal Amarasekera and Mr. Nihal Jayawardena, who gaveof their time and expertise to making this Bill a reality. I alsowarmly thank our Minister, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopullefor presenting this Bill and for his untiring efforts to make SriLanka a commercial hub.

Thank you.

[1.48 p.m.]

( )(The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like tocongratulate you on this occasion on your appointment, asyou are a person who is deeply involved with the estatecommunity in my district. I take it as a special honour to havea person from my district as the Deputy Chairman ofCommittees.

I also consider it an honour to follow my good Friend andColleague, the Hon. Faizer Musthapha. Although he is seatedon the other side we have been friends for a long time and Iam especially happy to make my speech soon after him.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, like the hon.Members of this House I too feel that this is a very timely Billbecause it was the late Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali as theMinister of Trade and Shipping in 1982 who presented theearlier Companies Bill in Parliament. So, it is after a period of24 years that this new Bill has been presented in Parliament.Of Course, during those 24 years much has happened.

The late president, J.R. Jayewardene, in 1977 opened up theeconomy and because of that we had the creation of wealth inthis country. You cannot dispute that fact. It is the sole

2006 1926432644

proprietorship - the private limited company and the publiccompany - and the partnership that is the engine of growth inthis country. You cannot deny that. If we have a six to sevenper cent growth rate every year, I think 90 per cent of that iscontributed by the private sector. So, it is very important foran open, free and dynamic society to encourageenterpreneurship, enterpreneurship that will give employment,create wealth and hopefully the creation of that wealth willtrickle down to the masses. So if you look at the history andthe gamut of private enterprises in this country, it is the forcesthat President J.R. Jayewardene unleashed in 1977 which arestill contributing in a major way towards the development ofour economy.

In very resourceful countries like the United States ofAmerica, China and even India now, the public sector makesbig investments in public works like roads, dams et cetera. Butunfortunately in a poor country like Sri Lanka this is notpossible. Actually we spend only about two per cent of ourGDP on health when in real terms for a developing countrylike Sri Lanka, it should be about five to six per cent. We spendonly about four per cent of our GDP on education when weshould be spending about at least five to six per cent on thatparticular field. But unfortunately because of this war, we arespending a vast amount of resources on arms and ammunitionand the three armed forces because the country has to bedefended; the countrys sovereignty has to be safeguarded.

There are large companies and also small public companiesthat have become the major dynamic engine of growth in ourcountry. I am telling this to you because it is very importantthat we understand this concept. And, after 24 years we havea new Bill that recognizes this and has kept in touch with thetrends of the modern world. The registration of companiesstarted in Ceylon, as it was then called, with the enactment ofthe Joint Stock Companies Ordinance, No.4 of 1861. Thisordinance was repealed by the Companies Ordinance, No.51of 1938. The present Companies Act, No.17 of 1982 came intoforce with effect from 2nd July, 1982. It has been amended bythe Companies (Amendment) Act, No.33 of 1991. Theprovisions relating to insider dealing - Part V, and theprovisions relating to banks - parts VII and VIII, were repealedby the Securities Council Act, No.36 of 1987 and the BankingAct, No. 30 of 1988 respectively. The Companies Act wasbased on the Companies Act of UK, 1948. Although therehave been many changes in the economy, no significantamendments to the Companies Act were introduced duringthe past 24 years.

There are three objectives expected to be achieved byamending the present Companies Act. One, to modernize thelaw relating to companies. Two, to liberalize the law to thegreatest extent consistent with appropriate safeguards forthose dealing with investing in companies; and three, to clarifythe law.

In the light of the above, the following are some of themajor changes introduced by this Bill. To introduce articlesinstead of memorandum and articles of association as in the

present Act, giving an option to the subscriber to include theobjectives or allowing them to carry on any legal businessand acceptance of single shareholder concept like mycolleague and Friend, the Hon. Faizer Musthapha pointedout. If the single shareholder is a body corporate, two othershareholders are sufficient to form any company. Anycompany which is not a private company may become a publiccompany. Private company decision - making has beensimplified. A private company may take valid decisions ifauthorized by all share holders, subject to safeguards againstinsolvency. Private companies need not file annual financialstatements. This is a major new development in the new lawunless required to do so by the Registrar.

Reduction of share capital with notice but without courtapproval. Greater protection for minority share holders byminority buy - out rights at a fair price. Tabling of accounts,reduction in period to six months. An auditor resigning orceasing to hold office has to deliver a statement to the companyregarding his reasons for resigning or ceasing in office, in theevent he feels that a shareholder or creditor should be awareof these facts. Amalgamation made easier as the Board ofeach amalgamating company may approve an amalgamationproposal without applying to court and on the basis of asatisfactory solvency test. A company board may appointand administrator to ensure the future survival of the whole orpart of the company. Clear statements of directorsresponsibility and accountability in company affairs inclusiveof all disclosure of interests.

Now here, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we knowabout certain cases in the global arena like Enron and ArthurAndersen where no matter what number of laws you have, ifthe directors of the company are not sincere, they can easilyplay out the shareholders. So the point is that no matter howmany laws you have, the companys profitability and its healthdepends on the directors of the company who must be sincereto the shareholders. But of course, even in ideal situations wesee in developed countries the shareholders are being playedout by the directors.

The company board may appoint an administrator to ensurethe future survival of the whole or a part of the company. clearstatements of directors responsibility and accountability incompany affairs inclusive of disclosure of interests. Repeal ofthe law ralating to peoples companeis and substitutingtherefore the law relating to public companies. Repeal ofcompanies Act, No.17 of 1982, Companies (Special Provisions)Law, No. 19 of 1974 and t he Foreign Companies (SpecialProvisions) law, No. 9 of 1975. Also, I would like to mentionhere that this particular companies Bill took 24 years to come.I would also like to to suggest to the Hon. Minister to have apermanent committee under his Minister to constantly reviewthe companies Act and bring amendments in the light of thefast - developing trends that are occuring in the modern globalarena. Especially, if you look at the internet and the computertechnologies that are taking place today, these are also veryimportant technologies and we should incorporate special

26452646

6 PL 001539 (2006/10)

[ ]laws perhaps not in this Companies Bill but we should bringspecial bills to regulate companies that have specialobjective in the case of science and technology. That is onething I feel strongly about. If you look at India for example,they have huge investments in the technology andcomputer fields. But unfortunately, Sri Lanka has notbeen able to capitalize on this development, mainly be-cause Sri Lanka has not got the capital and the humantechnology to invest in these large endeavours.

So, I would urge my Colleagues from the Governmentto look at these timely and very relevant new develop-ments that are taking place in the global arena. I also thankthe team of lawyers who were able to formulate this par-ticular Companies Bill and also the Hon. Minister for pre-senting this Bill in Parliament today.

Thank you.
