- - EXCESSIVE MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE NORTH-EAST

. ( )(Mr. Mavai S. Senathirajah)Hon. speaker, thank you very much for giving me thisopportunity to raise some matters of national importancein this House. It is in view of the most distressing, alarming

and acute situation prevailing in the North-East consequentto the excessive military activities unleashed , I am promptedto address this matter in this House today. However, the Ven.Member of the JHU revealed some matters in this House.Therefore, I decided to take up the matter last. I have toanswer the malicious propaganda attributed in this Houseand outside by the Government of Sri Lanka on the recentdevelopment in connection with the Ceasefire Agreement.

The GOSL and the LTTE met in Geneva on the 22nd and23rd of February 2006 for the talks on the implementationof the CFA. At the conclusion of the talks, a statement wasreleased stating that the GOSL and the LTTE will becommitted to respect and uphold the CFA. The GOSL andthe LTTE also committed themselves to take all necessarymeasures to ensure that there will be no intimidation, actsof violence abductions or killings.

Further, the LTTE committed itself to take all necessarymeasures to ensure that there will be no acts of violenceagaints the security forces and the police. The Governmentof Sri Lanka in turn committed itself to take all necessarymeasures in accordance with the CFA to ensure that no armedgroups or persons other than the Government security forceswill carry arms or conduct armed operations. The partiesalso agreed to meet again in Geneva from the 19th to the21st of April 2006. Consequent to the agreement reachedin Geneva, all hostile acts against the GOSL armed forcesand the police were brought to an end.

However, the delegation of the Government of Sri Lankano sooner they returned began to behave in a manner thatwas disrespectful, undermining the said agreement. Furtherto this the GOSL has failed to take any action whatsoeverto disarm and dismentle the functioning of the paramilitariesor armed groups. The violence and killings by paramilitariesand armed groups against the Tamil civilian population andthe LTTE have escalated extensively. The fact that theparamilitaries and the armed groups work together with theGOSL armed forces in all these activities is well known.This is amply demonstrated by the attack on the LTTEForward Defence Line in Vavunativu and the abduction offive LTTE cadres from Trincomalee in two separateincidents on 4th March, 2006. From this date onwards theLTTE has been regularly targeted resulting in many cadresbeing killed and injured. On the 5th of March 2006, with acivilian being targeted in Valaichenai, Batticalo, Killingsagainst the civilians by the GOSL armed forces and itsparamilitary groups also resumed in earnest. Up-to-date therehave been over 105 Tamil-speaking civilians killed.

It is in one such incident that on the 7th of April 2006, Mr.V. Vigneswaran, a prominent TNA member who was to beappointed as a National List Member of Parliament in placeof the late Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham was assassinated in aHigh Security Zone in broad daylight. The TNA wishes tostress that until this incident there were no hostile actswhatsoever against the GOSL armed forces or the police. It

3940

should be noted that the hon. N. Raviraj who was returningfrom Trincomalee after attending the funeral of Mr.Vigneswaran was severely attacked by Sinhala thugs whilstthe GOSL naval forces stood by.

Whilst this be the true state of affairs, the GOSL and itspeace Secretariat have been carrying on a malicious and falsecampaign to mislead the international community by statingthat the GOSL and its armed forces have been demonstratingmaximum restraint in the face of provocative action by theLTTE. The TNA condemns this duplicitous behaviour ofGOSL and its Peace Secretariat.

The TNA wishes to stress that it is after a concerted Stateterror campaign against Tamil civilians and the LTTE thatfrom 8th of April 2006, the GOSL armed forces and the policebegan to be targeted.

In addition to the above, the TNA wishes to state thefollowing, with regard to the anti-Tamil racist pogroms thathave been taking place in Trincomalee of late. The saidpogroms commenced within minutes of a bomb explosion ina market on 12th April 2006. Instantly, more than 30 Tamilshops were selectively robbed and burnt by Sinhala thugswith either the support of the GOSL armed forces or whilstthey stood by. In addition, over 20 Tamil civilians werebrutally murdered. That the Sinhala thugs who were broughtby the truck load were unleashed on the Tamil civilianpopulation should be taken serious note of. Judging from thevarious eyewitness accounts of the systemtic way in whichthe Trincomalee incidents were unfolded, the TNA has littledoubt that the whole episode was orchestrated to ethnicallycleanse Trincomalee of the Tamil people which has been apolicy of the Sri Lankan State for over 50 years.

There can be little doubt that the attack on the 25th ofApril 2006 within the Army Headquarters in Colombo was adirect consequence of the State terror that has been unleashedagainst the Tamil civilian population of the North-East despitethe Geneva round of talks. Consequent to this incident, Tamiland Muslim villages situated in Trincomalee and Mutur havecome under indiscriminate air, sea and land bombing andshelling, which has resulted in the death of at least 16 Tamil-speaking civilians inclusive of four children and a MuslimMoulavi. Apart from this, several civilians have beenseriously injured. The immense sense of insecurity that hasbeen created by the indiscriminate and blatantly anti-Tamilactions of the GOSL armed forces has also resulted in over40,000 Tamil civilians leaving GOSL controlled areas andtaking refuge in LTTE controlled areas.

The reasons for the current grave situation that is fastdeteriorating into a complete breakdown of the CFA is clearlydue to GOSL systematically sabotaging the agreementsreached at Geneva, coupled with GOSL acting irresponsiblywith regard to providing transport to the senior EasternCommanders of the LTTE, that have effectively preventedthe second round of Geneva talks from taking place.

[ . ]If the international community fails to realize this realityand take appropriate action to compel the Sri Lankan Stateto act in a responsible way in the interest of the peace process,the TNA fears that the result would be a further escalation ofviolence that would inevitably lead to the completebreakdown of the CFA.

Sir, I want to point out a grave situation that developed inthe North - East on 04.05.2006. At about 2.30 p.m., RPGrocket launchers were launched with a spraying of gunshotsfrom the army camp installed at the Navalady junction whichis situated about 400 metres from the Nelliyady junctionalong the Jaffna -Point Pedro Road thus killing seven youthwho were residents of Jaffna, Karaveddy Rasa village, namely; Selvarajah Sumanan, aged 22 ; Kovilmany Sinnamany, aged21 ; Balachandran Kirishanthan, aged 18 ; NagaratnamNaguleswaran, aged 18 ; Thamotharampillai ManjuShamilan, aged 17 ; Navaratnarajah Naganna, aged 19 andsubramaniam Subas, aged 19. I am of the candid opinion thatthey were all innocent youth.

On the contrary it is astonishing to note that the armyspokesman Mr. Prasad Samarasinghe had arbitrarily declaredthat seven LTTE men were killed while they were engaged inattacking the army and exchanging fire. He had further statedthat huge quantities of arms were recovered from the three -wheelers used by these youth. This is fabricated propogandaand is beyond any truth.

Sir, another important matter is, I have been informed bythe relatives of the victims who sustained gunshot injuriesperpetrated on them by the Sri Lankan Army during the nightof 06.05.2006 while they were remaining in the premises ofthe Rajeswary Ambal Kovil - Kerath Amman Kovil inManthuvil in the Thenmaradchi area and it is also under-stood that they were abducted. The neighbours of the templedisclosed the fact that sounds of gunshots and cries wereheard from the temple premises during the night on the dayin question. Bloodstains could be observed in the Chariotparking place. Such bloodstains which were on the floor areaof the parking place had been hidden. Empty bullets toowere found in the Chariot park and they had been hidden.The relatives of the following victims, whose names arelisted below, fear that they have been killed. In these circum-stances I wish to state further that the Kumbabishekam cer-emony was conducted on 03.05.2006 and ceremonies con-tinue for 30 days and it was for this very purpose that thevolunteers remained in the premises of this temple. The namesof the persons suspected to be abducted are as follows. Mr.Rasanayagam Sivanandamoorthy, aged 35, a teacher ofVaranni Karambaikurichchi GTMS, Manthuvil West,Kodikamam. He is also a secretary of the Volunteer Board ofthe temple. The others are ; Ramachandran Rajakumar,Vaikundavasan Vaikundakumar, Markandu Pushpakantha,Kandasamy Parimelalahan, Ponnampalam Partheeban,Selvarathnam Sivanandan, Gunarathnam Thayaruban. Ex-cept the first person referred to, all the others are masons andhail from the fishing community who have come there torender volunteer services to the temple.

Sir, I must also bring to your notice an important incidentwhich took place in Batticaloa at about 1.00 a.m. on26.12.2005. That is, the hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, TNAMember of parliament was assassinated within the premisesof the Catholic Church.

2006 094142

In Trincomalee on 07.04.2006, during duty hours, Mr. V.Vigneswaran an employee of the Bank of Ceylon and MPdesignated in place of slain Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham, wasgunned down within the premises of the same Bank of Ceylon,Trincomalee. In vavuniya, on 26.04.2006, Mr. Senthilnathan,our candidate for Parlimentary and Local Government Elec-tions was killed. In Trincomalee, on 21.01.2006 at about5.00p.m. at the sea - beach five students who were selectedfor admission to the university were mercilessly killed andthis brutality needs to be highlighted.

Similarly, it was on 12.04.2006, on New Years eve of April2006, the commercial establishments of Tamils and Muslimsin the Trincomalee town were looted and burnt down in thepresence of the Sri Lankan Army. I am only citing a few of theacts of CFA violations and genocidal activities as the fur-nishing of full details would entail lengthening of this state-ment.

It is a long episode to mention that the Trincomalee Dis-trict has been subjected to continuous genocidal attancksfrom 1958 onwards. It continued in 1977, 1981 and 1983.But it remains and indisputable fact that the Tamil popula-tion never resorted to an armed struggle to resist such at-tacks.

Recently, on hearing that five to six Sinhalese peasantswere murdered on Trincomalee at Gomarankadawela(Kumararesankadavi), a meeting took place at which Minis-ters and high ranking Army officers participated. It was de-cided at that meeting that weapons have to be provided tothe Sinhalese living in border villages to protect themselvesfrom similar attacks in future and immediate action was takenaccordingly.

At this juncture, Sir, I wish to point out that similar actionof providing arms to tha Sinhala population has taken placein several other Sinhala villages. During the last fifty years,owing to the repeated military operations of the Sri LankanArmy, Navy and Air Force and the acts of violence of theSinhala extremists, a very large segment of the Tamilpopulation has been reduced to sheer destitution anddisplacement from their ancestral residential areas. Theirhouses, properties and belongings were destroyed and theywere deprived of their means of livelihood such as agriculture,fishing et cetera. While such aggressive actions are perpetratedon the innocent Tamil population, Sinhala people areprovided with weapons to protect themselves. This salientfact has to be highlighted.

Before I conclude Sir, I would like to point out that there isa letter released to a Tamil newspaper written by Dr. BrianSeneviratne who lives in Australia. I would like to quote it inTamil.

+ + - , , ,

In conclusion Sir, I wish to mention that several highsecurity zones have been declared by the Sri Lankan Army inthe North-East where military bases are installed. As a result,the Tamil population in such areas are deprived of their meansof livelihood and are reduced to utter destitution.

Besides, the people who were affected by the tsunami tidalwave in the villages of Kudathanai and Manatkadu et ceterain the Jaffna peninsula, while they were venturing to getthemselves resettled on their own soil and resume their meansof livelihood were compelled to abandon such attempts asmassive Army bases have been established in such areas.This is according to the information received from the peopleconcerned.

This act is not only a blatant violation of the CFA but alsoan inhuman deprivation of human rights. It is glaringly clearthat over the past 50 years only at present that severe stateterrorism is being unleashed thus creating an utmost adversesituation of genocidal activities. The country is cloudingwith warring atmosphere. Under such a helpless and gravesituation the Tamil people have come to a stage that theymust protect themselves from such anarchy.

In this situation, Sir, I found out another importantinformation. That is very importnat. That is -

. ( )(Mr. Mavai S. Senathirajah)

Sir, I have to conclude now. We, from the ITAK and theTamil National Alliance, have decided not to participateany further; when the debate on the Extention of theEmergency Regulations is taken up we have decided toboycott and walk out from this House. We have alsodecided to launch a peaceful Satyagraha not inside theHouse but outside the House, within the precincts of theParliamentary Complex. Thank you very much, Sir.

Mr. Speaker, I move, That the Proclamation made by the presidentunder Section 2 of the Pucblic Security Ordinance (Chapter 40) bring-ing into operation the Provisions of Part II of the aforesaid Ordinancethroughout Sri Lanka with effect from 04th May, 2006 be approved

Mr. Speaker, the Motion relating to the state of Emergency whichwas in force throughout Sri Lanka with effect from 04th April, 2006was approved by this House on 07th April, 2006.

This honorable House is aware that His Excellency the President ispursuing every avenue and is doing his utmost to bring about peace onour troubled land not withstanding the vicious terrorist attacks that killour people and destroy property.

You all know that on 25th April, 2006 an LTTE woman suicidebomber staged an attack within the premises of the Army Headquartersin which 11persons including Army personnel died and 29 personsinclusive of the Army commander were seriously wounded. The Forcesalso detected arms and ammunition and dangerous weapons in the cityand had arrested persons engaged in such unlawful activity.

As at end of last month 58 persons from the three Armed forces andthe Police together with ordinary civilians amounting to 107 personshave been killed by the terrorists. 128 from the Police force and 130officers from the Tri forces have been seriously wounded as a result ofterrorist activities.

In the circumstances, I earnestly and sincerely hope that all hon.Members of this House would extent their unreserved support to con-tinue the state of Emergency throughout the country for a furtherperiod of one month in order to maintain law and order, public securityand preservation of state property.

Thank you.
