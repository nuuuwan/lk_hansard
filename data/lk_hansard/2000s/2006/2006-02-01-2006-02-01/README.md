Court assembled for hearing at 10.30 a.m. on 10th January 2006Written Submissions tendered by Counsel on 16th January 2006

A Bill bearing the above title has been presented as a Private MembersBill by Ven (Dr) Omalpe Sobitha Thero, Member of Parliament and ithas been published in the Government Gazette as required and placedon the Order Paper of Parliament. Fourteen Petitions have been presentedto this Court challenging the constitutionality of the Bill in its entiretyand of several of specific provisions, in terms of Article 121(2) of theConstitution. On the basis of this challenge ten petitions have been filedto intervene in support of the Bill.

Broadly, the challenge to the Bill and its provisions come fromleading manufacturers and producers of tobacco and alcohol productsand those engaged in the wholesale and retail distribution and sale ofthese products. Whereas, the intervenients represent variousorganizations engaged in activities to curb the use and consumption oftobacco and alcohol products. The Hon. Member of Parliament whopresented the Bill and who is cited as the 2nd Respondent has also filedpapers in support of the Bill. A singnificant feature is that the Billpresented by a Member of the Buddhist Clergy is supported in itscontent by sevral Bishops and Heads of Christian Churches. Counselrepresenting them submitted that there should be further provisionsincluded in the Bill prohibiting smoking in public places, which wouldbe adverted to later.

The Bill contains provisions to set up a National Authority on Tobaccoand Alcohol, for purposes inter alia

(i)to advice the Government on the implementation of theNational Policy on tobacco and alcohol;

(ii) to recommend the measures to minimize harm arising fromthe consumption of tobacco and alcohol products ;

2006 017374

(iii) to make necessary recommendations to minimize illicit druguse and to monitor progress of investigations and criminalproceedings relating to alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug trade;

The Bill also creates new offences, particularly with regard to thesale of tobacco and alcohol products and the promotion of such saleby means of advertising and sponsorship of sports and cultural events.

The Particular challenge to the Bill as a whole is on the basis thatit amounts to an infringement of the fundamental rights of thePetitioners guaranteed by Articles 10, 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of theConstitution.

It is their case that the production and sale of tobacco and alcohol,directly affected by the Bill, are lawful trades carried on by thePetitioners unlike the illicit trade in alcohol and drugs. That, sincethe lawful trade of the petitioners is sought to be restricted in themanner set out in the Bill, it is discriminatory and denies them theequal protection of the law as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of theConstitution. It is contended that the Bill would in effect be a boonto the illicit trade.

It is submitted that since the petitioners trade is lawful, anylegislative measures to control advertising and promotion of suchtrade would affect the freedom of thought and conscience asguaranteed by Article 10 of the Constitution and the Freedom ofexpression including publication guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a). That, the Bill is a restriction of their freedom to engage in a lawful trade,business or enterprise, guaranteed by Article 14(1)(g) of theConstitution.

The submission of the 2nd Respondent and of the IntervenientPetitioners in this regard is that the illicit trade that may be there inparticular in alcohol and drugs is not comparable with the permittedtrade of alcohol and tobacco products as envisaged in the Bill. That,there is no question of any regulation or control on an illicit tradewhich is per se outside the pale of law and punishable as providedin several penal statutes. On the Other hand, the measures that maybe taken in terms of the Bill to promote good health by the avoidanceof alcohol and tobacco consumption and use, would deter personsfrom use of all substances having addictive and harmful effects,whatever be their source. Finally, it was submitted that restrictionsimposed are warranted in terms of Article 15(7), which permitrestrictions of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12 and14 inter alia for the protection of public health. This submission isbased on the premise that the consumption of alcohol and tobaccoproducts is per se harmful to health.

As regards the challenge to the Bill in its entirety, we have consideredthe two lines of submissions stated above. The parties have tenderedextensive material from national and international research, studiesand publications. The limited time available does not permit the Courtto set down separately the content of these material and we wouldrestrict to a general statement of what is revealed.

The Publication, particularly of the World Bank that have beenproduced by the Intervenient Petitioners reveals certain findings thathave been made as regards the health consequences of smoking andstates in particular that tobacco contains nicotine, which substanceis recognized to be addictive by international medical organizations.Tobacco dependence is listed in the International Classification ofDiseases.

The publication proceeds to set out the manner in which nicotineaddiction can be established quickly in young adolescents who haverecently taken up smoking and states that tobacco will kill 4 millionpeople in the next 12 months and is anticipated at present level tokill 10 million people by the year 2030. It is expected that 7 millionof these deaths will be in low income and middle income countrieswhere cigarettes were once rate. As educated and prosperous peopleabandon smoking, the practice is becoming increasingly concentratedamong the poor in most societies.

The intervenient Petitioners have also produced the Statement issuedby the Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly at its plenary meeting on25.5.2005, which relates to the public health problems caused byharmful use of alcohol. The preamble of this statement sets out thataccording to the World Health Report 2002, 4% of the burden ofdecease and 3.2% of all deaths globally are attributed to alcohol whichis the foremost risk to health in low-mortality developing countriesand the third in the developed countries. The Assembly has requestedthe member states to develop, implement and evaluated effectivestrategies and programmes for reducting the negative health and socialconsequences of harmful use of alcohol.

The Petitioners who are from the alcohol and tobacco industriesand trade do not dispute the findings disclosed in these publicationsthat emanate from specialized Agencies of the United Nations; theircontention is that the health risk of the illicit trade is far worse an therestrictions sought be placed on the lawful trade would aggravatelthe health risk resulting from the illicit trade. This argument fails toaccount for the basic premise that the harmful impact of alcohol,tobacco and for that matter drugs, whether the source of supply ofsuch substance is lawful or illicit, is a common pattern of use, addictionand dependence. Undoubtedly, the heath risk of illicit use is worse.But, the behavioral tendency of use, addiction and dependece beingthe same, the lawful trade and the illicit trade would have the effectaggravating such behavioral tendency. The user would have recourseto the licensed sources as well as illicit sources when the behaviorallytrend is set in motion. Hence, from the point of public health, thereis a harmful interlink. The likely pattern is that addiction will startfrom the licensed source and get aggravated in the fold of the illicittrade. The illicit trade is per se contrary to law, punishable undervarious statutes and there is no question of regulating an illicit trade.On the contrary the trade that is carried out on the basis of a licenceor authority of the law, which is found to be harmful to public healthshould necessarily be subject to restrain in order to minimize theharmful consequences to public health. In this connection we citethe observations made by Supreme Court of India in the case ofVincent vs Union of India 1987 All India Reporter - S. C. 1 - page990 at page 995 which reads as follows :

.............................. maintenance and improvement of public healthhave to rank high as these are indispensable to the very physicalexistence of the community and on the betterment of these dependsthe building of the society of which the Constitution makers envisaged.Attending to public health, in our opinion, therefore, is of high priority- perhaps the one at the top.

Therefore the Bill taken as a whole considering its objects wouldconstitute a permitted restriction in terms of Article 15(7) of theConstitution and is not inconsistent with 14(1)(g) of the Constitutionwhich guarantees the freedom to engage in a lawful trade.

The alleged inconsistency with Article 12(1) of the Constitutionon the basis of unequal protection of the law in relation to the illicittrade is misconceived. An illicit trade and a trade that is permitted bylaw cannot be classified together for the purpose of legislation. Inthis instance what is permitted by law is classified separately in a lawintended to minimize harm to public health. It is indeed the boundenduty of the State to take such measures in the face of proven a riskto public health. The classification is therefore not inconsistent withArticle 12(1) of the Constitution.

We are also of the view that there no basis whatsoever to allegethat the provisions of the Bill are inconsistent with the freedom ofthought guaranteed by Article 10 of the Constitution. The Bill isintended to safeguard public health and would to that extent promotethe freedom of thought. The harmful effects of the consumption ofalcohol and tobacco as indicated in the publications of the WorldBank and the World Health Organization referred to above, directlyimpair the functioning of the human brain. Any measures to preventthe impairment of brain cells resulting from the use of alcohol andtobacco products as indicated in the medical research would promotethe freedom of thought. Therefore we reject in its entirety thesumbission that the provisions of the Bill is inconsistent with Article10 of the Constitution.

7576

From this point it is necessary to proceed to consider the challengemade by the Petitioners in respect of the particular provisions of theBill. The main thrust of the Petitioners was in relation to Clause 29of the Bill which makes it an offence to sell any tobacco or alcoholproduct within a radius of 100 meters of any premises, frequentedmainly by children or young adults.

Clause 29(2) defines the term Children to mean persons who areunder 18 years of age and young adults to mean persons between18 and 25 years. The phrase premises frequented by young adultsor children is defined to include schools, tutories, playgrounds andHigher-Education Institutions. The contention of the Petitioners isthat the wide ambit of the offence would make it impossible to sellany tobacco or alcohol product within the city of Colombo or anyother town in Sri Lanka, considering the there are so many schools,tutories, playgrounds and so on. The Petitioners produced detailedevidence in relation to Colombo.

It is also contended that the provision is lacking in rationality sincethe total ban on sale within the area cannot be reasonably related tothe object that is sought to be achieved, namely, the prevention ofsale to children and young adults. The wide ambit of the provisionwould prevent the sale to all persons including adults and in effectamount to a total prohibition which is not intended by the Bill. Onthis basis it is contended that the provisions of this Clause areinconsistent with Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The object of the Bill is not to impose a total prohibition on thesale of tobacco and alcohol products. As contended by the Petitioners,that long title of the Bill states specifically that it intended to makeprovision to deter persons, specially children from taking up tosmoking and alcohol consumption by reducing their access to tobaccoand alcohol products.

If the objective in relation to children and young persons is to beachieved the prevention and sale should be in relation to such personsand not in relation to the entirety of the public. The prohibition inclause 29 would in effect result in a prevention of sale to all inColombo and other cities. Therefore we are inclined to agree withthe Petitioners the clause 29 as presently formulated is not rationallyrelated to the objective that is sought to be achieved and is thereforeinconsistent with Article 12(1) of the constitution.

Since the provision would in effect prevents a sale of these products,which is now permitted by law in the city of Colombo and otherpopulated areas. We are of the view that it is also inconsistent withArticle 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

At the hearing before Court the Petitioners and the intervenientPetitioners agreed that the clause be replaced with a suitable provisionto prohibit the sale of tobacco and alcohol products to young persons.The submission of the Petitioners was that the prohibition shouldapply to those below 18 years since persons above the age of 18 areentitled to exercise of the franchise. We have to note that theconsumption and use of alcohol and tobacco on the one hand andthe exercise of franchise on the other, are not comparable instances.The exercise of franchise is not by any means harmful to health. Onthe other hand the consumption of tobacco and alcohol are per seharmful to health. Therefore a person should make an informeddecision having considerd the harmful consequences before takingto the consumption and use of tobacco and alcohol. An informedchoice as opposed to what we would call an impressionable choice.In the circumstances we are of the view that it would not beinconsistent with any provision of the Constitution to impose a totalban on the sale of tobacco and alcohol products as defined in theBill to persons below the age of 21 years. A suitable amendmentshould be made in this regard to substitute clause 29 of the Bill witha provision to prohibit the sale of tobacco and alcohol products topersons below the age of 21 years.

The next contention of the Petitioners is with regard to clause 33of the Bill which contains a prohibition of alcohol and tobaccoadvertisements. The Petitioners contended that the prohibition would

be inconsistent with Article 14(1)(a) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.We have to consider the prohibition on advertising on the basis ofthe findings stated above that the consumption and use of tobaccoand alcohol is per se harmful to public health.

The contention of the Petitioners is two fold -

i. that advertisements would give an opportunity to any personconsuming these products to make a choice of what is moresuitable to his liking and thereby promote a better choice;

ii. that advertisements would also carry a warning of risk factors,thereby promote the public to make an informed choicewhether they should use a particular product or not;

The two fold contention in our view cannot overcome the basicpremise that the consumption or use of tobacco and alcohol areharmful to health. Whether it is in the guise of promoting a choiceor making an informed decision of what should be purchased, sincethe end result is going to be harmful to public health the restrictionin our view would in any event be permissible in terms of Article15(7) of the Constitution.

Further, on the question whether a prohibition on the advertisementof any article, could per se constitute a restriction on the freedom ofspeech and expression, it is relevant to cite the findings of the SupremeCourt of India in the case of Hamdard Dawakhana vs Union of IndiaAIR 1960 S. C. page 544, In this case it was held that a totalprohibition on advertisement imposed by the Drug and MagicRemedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act was not inconsistent withthe corresponding Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Consitution. It washeld that if the prohibition merely deprives a trader from commendinghis wares it would not fall within the freedom of speech as guaranteedby the Constitution. The Supreme Court of India adopted a usefulobservation made by Justice Mc. Kenna in John. W. Rast vs VanDeman & Lewis Co., 1915 60 U. S. Lawyers Ed. 679 at 690 whereit was stated as follows :

Advertising is merely identification, and desciption appraisingof quality and place. It has no other object than to draw attentionto the article to be sold and the acquisition of the article to be soldconstitutes the only inducement to its purchase.

It was further held that advertising does not come within theobjective of the freedom of speech which is intended to safeguardthe natural right of an organized freedom loving society to impartand acquire information about a matter of common interest. We areinclined to accept this statement as to the ambit of the freedom ofspeech and expression and hold that advertising does not come withinits scope.

For these reasons we are of the view that the prohibition in Clause33 on advertisement is not inconsistent with any provision of theConstitution.

We would now deal with other clauses on which specificsubmissions have been made by the Petitioners. They are

Clause 3 As to the membership of the Authority.

It was contended that this provision is inconsistent with Article12(1) of the Constitution, since there is no representative from theAlcohol and Tobacco trade or Industry in the Authority. It wascontended that this absence of representation in the Authotiy deniesto persons in the trade the, equal protection of the law guaranteedby Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

We are of the view that questions of policy far outweighquestions of legality in determining the constitution of the Authorityand no trade or group could claim a right to secure membership.Furthermore, in this instance the object of the Bill is to limit tobaccoand alcohol related harm being per se contrary to the interests ofthe trade which is to promote its consumption and use.

2006 017778

The strenuous objections raised by the trade against theenactment of the Bill itself in its entirety demonstrates the hostileattitude of the trade to the Bill. They are certainly not inclined topromote the objectives of the Bill. Therefore they cannot demandby means of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, a right to be representedin the Authority. Accordingly we see not merit in this ground ofobjection.

Clause 2

It is submitted that the Secretary of the Ministry of Financeshould also be an ex-officio member of the Authority, since theState levies revenue on the alcohol and tobacco trade by means ofduties and fees. In regard to this matter as well we are of the viewthat representation in the Authority, especially in relation to officials,is a matter of policy. The object of the Bill does not relate torevenue measures in respect of alcohol and tobacco trade. Thereforewe are of the view that the absence of the Secretary of Ministry ofFinance from the membership of the Authority is not a matter thatcould be raised as an inconsistency with Article 12(1) of theConstitution.

Clause 3

In terms of Clause 5(2) the President may remove an appointedmember of the Authotiry for reasons to be assigned. It was submittedthat since Article 35(1) gives the President immunity from suit andit would not be possible to seek redress from any decision of thePresident to remove a Member from the Authority.

We are of the view that the immunity granted to the Presidentcannot be the basis to prevent discretionary power being vested inhim by law. The President being Head of State and Head ofGovernment would undoubtedly act for good reason in the exerciseof any discretion vested in him. In this instance the President isrequired to assign reasons for the removal of an appointed member.

We are of the view that this is a sufficient safeguard against thearbitrary exercise of power by the President. Therefore we do notsee any merit in this ground of objection.

Clause 16

Clause 16 of the Bill empowers the Minister on the advice of theAuthority to issue general or special directions to any GovernmentDepartment or Statutory Institution requiring any such Departmentor Institution to carry out such acts as are specified in such directionrelating to the use of tobacco and alcohol products. It was submittedthat existing law such as the Excise Ordinance, containcomprehensive and stringent provisions to control the liquorindustry. Therefore it was submitted that the directions the Ministeris empowered issue in terms of clause 16 may be in conflict withthe special legislation now in force covering these subjects. Althoughthis does not raise any specific issue of constitutionality there shouldnot be room for conflict in the application of different laws.Therefore we are of the view that it was appropriate, to amendclause 16 by the providing that any direction to be issued shouldnot be inconsistent with applicable law.

Clause 18(2) (a) provides for sums to be made available to theAuthority from the Consolidated Fund to be paid into the fund ofthe Authority. It was submitted that this provision is inconsistentwith Article 152 of the Constitution which required that a Bill or amotion affecting public revenue could only be presented by aMinister with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. The basis ofthis submission is that since this is a Private Members Bill, clause18(2)(a) would be inconsistent with the specific requirements ofArticle 152.

We are of the view that the provisions of clause 18(2)(a) do notprovide for any specific amount to be paid out of the ConsolidatedFund but is a mere enabling provision. It is not a charge on theConsolidated Fund. If a specific amount is to be paid out from theConsolidated Fund, such amount would have to be authorized byParliament upon a motion as set out in Article 152. In thecircumstances there is no inconsistency with Article 152 of theConstitution.

Clause 31

It was submitted that this clause, which prohibits the manufactureand sale of any tobacco product which does not generate smokemay prevent the sale of articles such as Nicotine Patches that areintended to assist people in giving up smoking altogether. Thissubmission presupposes a beneficial use of tobacco products ofwhich the Court has not been furnished with sufficient material.The material produced before Court is all consistent in the opinionthat tobacco products are harmful to public health. In any event weare of the view that if there be any tobacco product the use ofwhich is to eliminate tobacco related harm, by a process ofinterpretation, the prohibition in Section 31 would not apply tosuch article since its sale would promote the objective of the Act asstated in the long title.

Clause 33(2)(f) is an exception of the prohibition onadvertisements and it was submitted that in place of clause (f), aclause should be introduced which specifically permit the publicationof material beneficial to the public. In these circumstances we areof the view that there is merit in the submission to which all Counselagreed that in place of clause 33(2)(f) the following clause beincluded

to publish, transmit, or broadcast any scientific, educational,social, medical, technical or other material or informationbeneficial to the public pertaining to Alcohol Products or TobaccoProducts.

Clause 34

It was submitted that the use of the name only of anymanufacturer of tobacco or alcohol product be permitted to beused in connection with the sponsorship of any of the events asspecified in paragraph (a) (b). It was further contended that thereference to cultural and social activities in sub-paragraph (a) bedeleted and International Sporting events be excluded from thisprohibition.

We are of the view that the prohibition is intended to achievethe objective of the Bill. The purpose is to prevent any form ofsponsorship of educational, cultural, social or sporting events asprovided in sub-paragraph (a) since these events have the objectiveof enhancing health and the quality of life of people. Theseobjectives cannot be reconciled with the harmful effects of tobaccoand alcohol products.

In the circumstances we are of the view that the provisions ofClause 34 promote the objective of the Bill and are not inconsistentwith the Constitution.

Clause 37

It was submitted that this clause be amended to provide for teststo be done only as formulated by the Government Analyst. We areof the view that there is merit in this submission and that if noqualification is made the prescribed tests may require heavyexpenditure to be incurred as submitted by the Petitioners. In thesecircumstances we are of the view that provisions in Article 37should be amended by specifying that the tests be prescribed inconsultation with the Government Analyst.

Clause 42

It was submitted that the definition of the alcohol productscontained in clause 42 of the Bill may include some pharmaceuticalproducts and ayurvedic drugs which are said to contain as much as4% alcohol. The Petitioners have no interests in the trades in respectof which the submissions have been made. Those in thepharmaceutical and ayurvedic drug industry have not submittedany petition to this Court on this matter. The alcohol content to bespecified is a matter of policy and the Court has not been providedwith any material to demonstrate that the definition is per seunreasonable or arbitrary so as to be inconsistent with Article 12(1)of the Constitution.

7980

Clause 38

It was submitted that the provisions in this Clause for the suspensionof a driving licence where a person is accused or suspected of committingan offence under Section 151(1), 151(1)(a) or 152 of the Motor TrafficAct, would be inconsistent with the presumption of innocence containedin Article 13(5) of the Constitution. The basis of the submission is thatsuch suspension would in effect be a punishment imposed in advance.We are not inclined to agree with the submission that the suspension ofthe licence is per se a finding of guilt as contemplated in Article 13(5)of the Constitution. A person is authorized to drive a motor vehicle interms of the Motor Traffic act on the basis of a licence or authoritygranted under Law. The sections of the Motor Traffic Act included inthe clause relate to driving under the influence of liquor and thesuspension of the licence is intended to protect the public from a misuseor abuse of authority granted under the law.

In the circumstances considering the grave danger posed to thepublic by a person driving under the influence of liquor, we are of theview that provision for immediate action to be taken by the suspensionof the driving licence of such a person would not inconsistent withArticle 13(5) of the Constitution. However, this matter should be left inthe discretion of Court and of clause 38 should be suitably amended tosubstitute the word shall in line 20 with the word may.

A submission was made by counsel representing the Bishops and theHeads of Several Christian Churches in Sri Lanka that in view of theharmful effects of smoking in public places which constitute a serioushealth hazard to those who do not smoke, a provision should be includedin the Bill for the prohibition of smoking in public places that areenclosed. The evidence that has been adduced support this submissionof the harmful effects of what is described as passive smoking.

The long title of the Bill states that it is intended for the elimination oftobacco and alcohol related harm. In the circumstances we are inclinedto agree with the submission that a suitable provisions should be includedin the Bill for the prohibition of smoking in enclosed public places.Such a prohibition would not be inconsistent with any provision of theConstitution. A suitable amendment for this purpose may be made inParliament.

For the reasons stated above we make a determination in terms ofArticle 123(1) of the Constitution as follows :

(i) that the bill taken as a whole is not inconsistent with theConstitution on of the other grounds that have been urged bythe Petitioners ;

(ii) that clause 29 is inconsistent with Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g)of the Constitution. The objective of this clause could beachieved by substituting this clause with a suitable provisionthat prohibits the sale of tobacco and alcohol products topersons below the age of 21 years ;

(iii) that clause 16 be amended to provide that any direction thatmay be issued should be subject to the provisions of any lawthat is specifically applicable ;

(iv) that clause 33(2)(f) be substituted with a provision worded inthe manner stated above ;

(v) that clause 37 be amended to provide for the tests that may beprescribed to be formulated in consultation with theGovernment Analyst ;

(vi) that clause 38 be amended by substituting the word shallappearing in line 20 with the word may ;

(vii) that on the basis of the submission made on behalf of theBishops and Heads of Christian Churches, a suitable provisionmay be included to prohibit smoking in enclosed public places ;

: . : SATHYAGRAHA CAMPAIGN IN PARLIAMENTCHAMBER: STATEMENT BY MR. MAVAIS. SENATHIRAJAH

. ( )(Mr. Mavai S. Senathirajah)Hon. Speaker, I am thankful to you for giving me thisopportunity to express our concerns on a matter of nationalimportance. We have communicated to you and to the Hon.Prime Minister regarding this matter this morning. Thefollowing is what I want to say at this juncture.

During the last session of Parliament, on the 17th, 18thand 19th of January 2006 the Members of Parliament ofthe Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the Ceylon WorkersCongress (CWC) Up - country Peoples Front (UPF) and theWestern Province Peoples Front carried out a SathyagrahaCampaign the Chamber of Parliament. The reasons for theprotest were the grave situation faced by the Tamil civiliansin the North - East and the other parts of the country becausenone of the assurances given by the Government earlier onthe Floor of this House pertaining to the following threematters had been honoured and implemented.

(1) The assassination of Mr. Chandra Nehru, former TNAMember of Parliament and Mr. Kaushalyan, thePolitical Wing Leader of the LTTE for Batticaloaand Ampara.(2) The assassination of Mr. D. Sivaram, the reputedJournalist.(3) The rape and murder of Miss. Eliathamby Tharshiniat Pungudutivu Jaffna.

We strongly believe that the Government has failed tocarry out any proper and meaningful investigations intothese crimes and bring the offenders to justice. We alsostrongly believe that the Governments failure to takeappropriate timely action to prevent the recurrence of suchcrimes has led to the commission of further grave crimes inthe recent past.

Over 40 Tamil civilians have been killed within theJaffna district around 20 Tamil civilians have been killedin other districts in the North - East. around 50 Tamilcivilians have disappeared or gone missing in the North-East. Tamil civilians are being increasingly manhandled andassaulted in the North - East. Tamil civilians in the North -East are being threatened and intimidated. Tamil civiliansare being deprived of the oppurtunities to carry on theiroccupation, particularly farming and fishing and Tamilcivilians due to the above stated reasons have begun to fleeto India and to seek refuge in L.T.T.E controlled territoryand public buildings in their respective districts.

In particular, Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham, a seniorMember of Parliament of the TNA was gunned down withinthe premises of St. Marys Roman Catholic Church atBatticaloa in the early hours of 25th of December 2005 onChristmas night while he was at prayer. The road leadingto the church was manned by the armed forces while policepersonnel were on duty outside the church. This is inGovernment controlled territory. It is clear that the assailantscarried out the assassination with the involvement of somesection of the security forces. Though the identity of at leastone assailant is ascertainable, no steps have been taken toapprehend anyone.

Five innocent Tamil youth, all students engaged inhigher education were deliberately shot and killed in coldblood at Trincomalee by an identifiable group of thesecurity forces sent to Trincomalee without due authorityaround 7.45p.m. on 2nd of January 2006. This was inGovernment controlled territory. On the evidence available,both direct and circumstantial, the offenders can beidentified and brought to justice. The judicial inquest hasruled that these young men came by their death as a resultof gun shot injuries and directed that the crime beinvestigated. More than two weeks after the crime there ishardly any credible progress in the investigative process.

On the night of the 16th January at Manipay, Jaffna withinGovernment controlled territory members of the securityforces and Tamil paramilitary groups functioning together

111112

[ . ]have shot five members of a family, three of them fatally,while the other two have been admitted to the Jaffna GeneralHospital with grave injuries. This was an unwarranted attackon a Tamil civilian family. The father Mr. Bojan was thepresident of the Northern Region Scouts Association.

On the 23rd of December 2005 four Tamil civilians wereshot and killed and the bodies burnt in their house bysecurity forces at No.44, Victoria Housing Scheme at Pesalai,in Mannar. The four persons belonged to one family, father,mother, son and daughter. This was an unwarranted attackby the security forces against a Tamil civilian family, withinGovernment controlled territory.

The above stated matters reveal that the Tamil civilianpopulation in the North - East is facing a grave and serioussituation.

Members of the Tamil civilian population have beenindiscriminately arrested in large numbers, many femalesin their night clothes without any reasonable suspicion -

. ( )(Mr. Mavai S. Senathirajah)Members of the Tamil civilian population have beenindiscriminately arrested in large numbers, many females intheir night clothes without any reasonable suspicion orjustifiable reason, purely on the ground of their ethnicity,photographed in their night clothes and released afterquestioning at various police stations. This is a blatantviolation of their fundamental human rights. This hashappened in the Colombo city. Tamils in the upcountryareas have been similarly arrested.

The excessive presence of the armed forces in Tamilcivilian inhabited areas in the North-East particularly in Jaffnaand Trincomalee is most oppressive and humiliating to theTamil people. In Trincomalee this situation has continuedfor more than the past eight months causing immenseinconvenience and discomfort to the Tamil civilianpopulation.

These were the reasons that compelled us to perform aSatyagraha campaign in the Chambers of Parliament. Ourcollective dicision was to continue with the protests untilsatisfactory steps are taken by the Government.

Since the last session of Parliament, the importantdevelopment was the announcement of the talks between theLTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka in Switzerland inFebruary. However, since then incidents targeting Tamilcivilians have continued, with several people having beenkilled, and several people having disappeared, the latest beingthe abduction of five staff members belonging to the TamilRehabilitation Organization by paramilitary forces, just 100metres from the Government armed forces checkpoint inWelikanda, soon after registering at the said checkpoint. Wealso came to know that another five persons belonging to theTRO, Valaichenai have been abducted and are missing now.Before the discussions on peace talks in Vanni, a reporter ofThe Sudar oli newspaper was killed in Trincomalee. And,immediately after the discussions on the peace talks - within24 hours - one Mr. Kapilan, a LTTE political worker was shotdead and another LTTE cadre was seriously injured.

We have no doubt that the paramilitary forces and sectionsof the armed force are responsible for these continuingincidents. However, despite this most unsatisfactory state ofaffairs, we have decided to suspend our protest in the Chamberof Parliament for the sole reason that talks are to recommencein the near future. However, if there is no marked improvementin the ground situation faced by the Tamil civilians we willbe forced to recommence out Satyagraha protests. I thinkthese calculated moves by the armed forces will disturb thelatest development of the peace process. Therefore, we expressour condemnation in this House and to demonstrate ourprotest, we walk out from this House at this moment.

Thank you.

[ . . 10.32 ]

. . ( )( Prof. G. L. Peiris)Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like tocongratulate the Hon. Minister of Justice on the presentationof a very timely and positive piece of legislation.

The criminal law of a country, Sir, needs amendment fromtime to time. As society develops new offences have to becreated. Otherwise, the system of criminal justice will assumean obsolete character. In that regard, as far as the legal systemof Sri Lanks is concerned, the legislature has a specialresponsibility.

In the United Kingdom, as we all know, judges also havethe power to develop the law by adding new offences as andwhen circumstances require. The House of Lords has heldthat the judiciary has a creative role to play in evaluating thecondition of society at any particular time and supplementingthe law by creating offences which were previously notknown. So in the United Kingdom there are two sources ofthe criminal law. There is the common law and there is thestatute law. On the other hand, in Sri Lanka, there is only onesource of the criminal law. There are only statutory offences.This means that the legislature has to be vigilant all the time.The legislature has to identify gaps in the existing law andtake timely action to fill those gaps as and when needed.This is what the Hon. Minister of Justice has done. By meansof this legislation he is seeking to introduce into the criminallaw of Sri Lanka several new offences such as debt bondage,serfdom, forced or compulsory labour, slavery and engagingor recruiting a child forcibly or compulsorily for use in armedconflict. That is the effect of Clause 6. So offencesreconginized by the Penal Code have been enhanced. Theirscope has been extended by the creation of new offenceswhich were hitherto not recognized by the criminal law ofour country.

As the Hon. John Senewiratne explained to us a few minutesago, there are also very salutary obligations which have beenplaced on certain categories of persons for the purpose ofprotecting children in our country. The provider of a computerservice has an obligation to ensure that there is no misuse ofthat service in a manner which involves detriment or jeopardyto the interests of a child. Similarly, a person who has controlof the premises where this service is provided is under anequally stringent obligation to ensure that the premises arenot misused in a manner that is contrary to the interests ofchildren. These are obligations that are imposed on personswho are providing these services or persons having custodyof these premises. This is an entirely desirable change in thelaw and we all welcome the initiative of the Government inadopting a series of legal measures which cumulatively havethe result of providing children in this country with protectionthat they urgently need in view of certain distressingdevelopments which have taken place in our country in recenttimes.

There is also a very desirable feature in the provisions thatare contained in Clauses 9, 10 and 11. This has to do with theaward of compensation. Very often the criminal law focusesonly on the offender, the punishment of the offender. Theoffender has contravened a vital social interest and he ismade subject to punishment. But that is only one part of theissue. We must also concentrate on the victim of the crime.The victim has to be compensated and it is not only monetarycompensation that I am talking about. Offences of this kindhave a permanent impact on the development of the child -the childs mental condition, his state of emotional well-being and sometimes the physical development of the child.There is consequently a protective function which thesociety must undertake in relation to the child.Compensation must be awarded not only for physical injurybut also for psychological injury. Otherwise, the idea ofcompensation is incomplete. For this reason the change thatis made in the law is entirely appropriate and timely. The lawseeks to take into account the whole gamut of damage orharm that is inflicted on the child and to the extent that ispossible by an award of monetary compensation to help thechild to re-adjust to get over this problem which has beencreated for no fault of the child. It is an objective that isrelated to rehabilitation. That is a response of a caring andcompassionate society and this legislation, I would suggest,is entirely in line with the cultural traditions of Sri Lanka.These are all very desirable aspects of the law.

I would, however, like to draw the attention of the Hon.Minister of Justice and law Reform and the Hon. W.D.J.Senewiratne who presented this Legislation on his behalf totwo particular features of the law which I think areunsatisfactory. I think these need to be changed and I wouldask the Hon. John Senewiratne to give his mind to some ofthese changes which may perhaps be made at the CommitteeStage.

127128

The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne referred to the extraterritorial application of the law. He said a Sri Lankan courtcan generally deal only with a crime which has beencommitted within the territory of Sri Lanka. That is theprinciple of intraterritorial jurisdiction. However, inexceptional circumstances it is necessary to empower a courtin Sri Lanka to deal with an offence which has beencommitted outside Sri Lanka. That is the exception; it is notthe rule. But in exceptional circumstances it is necessary togive a Sri Lankan court the power to deal with offences whichhave been committed outside the territory of Sri Lanka.

Clause 2 of this legislation seeks to expand the scope ofextraterritorial jurisdiction that is available to the courts ofthe Republic of Sri Lanka. I have no criticism of many of thesub-clauses which are contained in Clause 2. For example,where the offence has been committed within the territorialwaters or air space of Sri Lanka, certainly the Sri Lankancourts must have jurisdiction.

Similarly, where the offence has been committed on boardany ship or aircraft registered in Sri Lanka, wherever it maybe at the time of the commission of such act, certainly thecourts of Sri Lanka must have jurisdiction. I also agree withthe Hon. John Senewiratne that where an offence iscommitted within the premises of a Sri Lankan embassyabroad, the premises of a Sri Lankan Mission or the residenceof the Head of such Mission, then certainly a Sri Lankancourt must have jurisdiction. But I would like the Hon.Minister to give his mind to Clause 2 (1) (e) of thislegislation. I think that is much too comprehensivelyexpressed. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is conferred on a SriLankan court in these circumstances. That is where any crimehas been committed within any premises occupied on behalfof or under the control of the Government of Sri Lanka or anystatutory body established in Sri Lanka and situated outsideSri Lanka. This means that if an offence is committed in theresidence of a minor official belonging to the Sri LankanDiplomatic Service - let us say an officer belonging to aclerical grade, a stenographer, or a minor official employedin a Sri Lankan Mission abroad - then extraterritorialjurisdiction is available to the courts of Sri Lanka. This goeseven beyond the Foreign Service of our country because itrefers to a statutory body established in Sri Lanka.

Let us think of a case where an offence is committed in theresidence of an official who is employed by a statutory bodyin this country. If Sri Lankan courts are to be allowed toexercise extraterritorial jurisdiction in those circumstances,then I think that there is a distortion of the applicableprinciple. There is a lack of balance and the principle ofextraterritorial jurisdiction is being taken too far in thosecircumstances. Certainly, the residence of the HighCommissioner or the Ambassador will be caught up by theprinciple of extraterritorial jurisdiction. But if you seek toextend it to a minor official employed by a statutory body inthis country or even a minor official employed in a Sri Lankan

[ . . ]Mission abroad, then the principle of extraterritorialjurisdiction has no substantial justification. It is extendingthe limits of extraterritorial jurisdiction beyond acceptableand defensible frontiers. So, I think that there is a deficiencyin sub clause (e) of Clause 2 of this Bill. I would like theGovernment to give its mind to this matter and to decidewhether there is really any justification for expanding theprinciple of extraterritorial jurisdiction to the extent that iscontemplated by this piece of legislation.

There is a far more serious problem with regard to clause12. Clause 12 seeks to reduce the punishment for theoffences of grave sexual abuse and grave sexual abusecommitted on a person under eighteen years of age fromseven years to five years and from ten years to seven yearsrespectively.

I think this is totally unacceptable. One of the frequentcomplaints today, Sir, is that the penalties that are providedfor by the criminal law are totally inadequate in certaincategories of circumstances. A grave crime is committed.There is a general perception in society that the punishmentthat is meted out in respect of that crime is disproportionateto the gravity of the crime. That brings about very seriousconsequences. Let us say my child is killed. I have noconfidence in the ability of the legal system to deliver. Inthe first place a trial will drag on for years and years. Thepunishment when it is meted out is thought to be grosslyinadequate. May be the person is convicted of murder orculpable homicide not amounting to murder. He is sentencedto, say, six or seven years imprisonment and then he maybe able to secure his freedom within a very short period oftime because he may not be required to serve his fullsentence.

The law relating to bail is applied with a certain degreeof laxity. Therefore, people who commit dangerous crimesare able to get back into society while the trial is going onand they have the opportunity to destroy evidence or tamperwith witnesses. This brings about a situation in which self-help is resorted to. Sometimes the father of the victim mayfeel that the best course of action is to resort to self-help.He will pay a sum of money to an assassin and many of themurders which are committed in Sri Lanka today are contractkillings. Against that back drop I think, this particularprovision is dangerous and I would ask the Governmentseriously to think about it. These are grave offences. Gravesexual abuse is one offence that is dealt with in clause 12.

The other offence that is dealt within clause 12 is garvesexual abuse committed on a person under 18 years of age.These are offences that go to the very core of social well-being. These are offences which have the potential to tearasunder the very fabric of our society. Surely societyexpects the pentalties to be enhanced, to be increased, notbe decreased. Here we have the extraordinary situationwhere given the magnitude of the problem and the publicreaction to that, which takes the form of a condemnation

2006 01129130

of the Criminal Law, the perception that the Criminal Lawis powerless. It is impotent to deal with these crimes. In thatsituation, the Government is doing simething, which to mymind, is quite unacceptable.

Instead of making the penalties heavier, enhancing thepenalties and imposing a deterrent with regard to thecommission of these offences and thereby protecting a vitaland sensitive social interest, the Government is doingprecisely the opposite. The Government is going in thereverse direction. The Government is making the penaltieslighter. The Government is reducing the penalties that areapplicable to these grave and heinous offences, offenceswhich shock the conscience of the Sri Lankan community.There is no rationale or justification for that whatsoever.

As the law now stands, the punishment for grave sexualabuse is seven years. Now, that seven years is being reducedto five years. The other offence is even more serious. Thatis, grave sexual abuse committed on a person under 18 yearsof age. There, the penalty is ten years today under theexisting law. Now, the Hon. Minister of Justice and LawReforms is reducing the ten years to seven years. I think,public opinion will certainly not support this particularchange in the law. Public opinion will certainly adopt theposition that this is counter productive. This is retrogressive.It is not progressive legislation. It is legislation that is goingbackwards. It is against the current or prevailing attitudesand values in the Sri Lankan society. I cannot for a momentunderstand why the Government wishes to reduce thepenalties that apply to some of the most obnoxious andrepugnant offences that are known to the Criminal Law ofSri Lanka.

I would therefore ask the Hon. Minister of Justice andLaw Reforms to explain to the House the reason why thisis done and to reassess and to re-evaluate the policyrationale underpinning these particular provisions. Subjectto those reservations, I would strongly support thelegislation that is now before the House. I think, it containsmany beneficial and positive features. We have no difficultyin supporting this legislation whatsoever. But in thenational interest, I would call on the Government to givetheir minds to the particular criticisms that I have made inrespect of specific provisions of the law and to consider atthe Committee Stage whether it would not be appropriateto move certain amendments to remove these excrescencesand anomalies from a piece of legislation which is entirelyappropriate at this particular juncture in the history of ourcountry.

Thank you, Sir,

[11.01 a.m.]

( [ )(Mr. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are discussingtoday some salient amendments that are being proposed tothe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure.

It is the view of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress that theimplementation of these pieces of legislation which have avery long history, dating back to our colonial period, largelyrests on the law enforcement agencies and their capabilityand credibility in investigating and prosecuting the offences.

I would like to use this opportunity to deal with the conductof our Police Department and more particularly when it relatesto communal disturbances in this country.

We saw in the morning today, Mr. Mavai Senathirajahmaking a statement on behalf of the Tamil National Allianceadverting attention to a serious situation that has arisen as aresult of the abduction of certain people in the EasternProvince. Finally, in protest we saw the Tamil NationalAlliance walking out of the Chamber.

I must say that I too am in mood to do a similar thing but Icannot be irresponsible in not using the opprtunity to bringto the notice of the Government and the respected Minister,who understands the nature of our police force and the attitudeof certain individuals in the police force.

Therefore I would like to use this opportunity to impressupon the Government the need to have a serious look at theway in which our Police Department is functioning.

A few days ago, on the 25th of January we had a serioussituation that took place in Dharga town, Alutgama. A verysmall incident blew up into a very massive communaldisturbance resulting in many houses and business placesbeing burnt, many people being injured and affected andalmost 40 to 45 households being displaced. This countryhaving seen mass scale displacement, 42 families beingdisplaced many not be a very serious matter. But today to theMuslims of this country living in the South the attitude ofthe Alutgama Police has become a matter of serious concern.

I am not for a moment casting aspersions on senior officersof the police. DIG, Mr. Pathirana ; SSP of the area ; SP, Mr.Amerasinghe ; ASP, Mr. Camillus and all of them, I think, didtheir duty perfectly. What happened was more to do withpolicemen of the lower ranks.

On the day of the incident unfortunately the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station had gone on leave. There mayhave been an acting police officer and various other policeofficers.

2006 01133134

What took place cannot be explained properly unless welook at the history of the situation. In Dharga town, in theMain Street at No. 157 was a shop called Touch Mobileselling cellular phones. On the 20th of April 2004 around 8o clock in the night, there was one person killed byunknown person in this particular shop. Thereafter on the5th of August 2005, in the same shop, some people came tocommit robbery and a brother of the owner, one Fazlan, wasstabbed and many things were stolen from the shop. Finallyon the 25th of January this year around 4.15 in the afternoon,four people came to shop and there was an argument betweenthe salesman and the people who came to the shop. As aresult of the argument there was an exchange of blows andthereafter person who came into the shop had tried to grab amobile phone and run away. The shopkeeper shouted andthen people around got hold of the man. Three of them ranaway, two of them were beaten and one was very seriouslybeaten up by the people who gathered at the time when theshopkeeper alarmed as he was, screamed for help.

Now what I am trying to bring to the notice of theGovernment here is that previously a Muslim businessmanwas stabbed and killed. Subsequently there was anotherstabbing incident in the very same shop. But it never blew upinto a communal riot. But when three others, this January,come into the shop and when one person is assaulted forhaving grabbed a mobile phone or having got into anargument with the salesman and an assault on him ensuesand is taken as a cause to commit arson, robbery and to createa very serious communal disturbance in the entire area,spreading even towards Galle, the Muslims of this areahave totally lost confidence in the police in the area. The IGPhas to take serious note of this. The Inspector General ofPolice came to the spot, had an inquiry but after all thedamages had taken place. What is worse is that many shopshave been set on fire while the police was present duringcurfew hours. All the shops have been set on fire while thecurfew was on. During curfew hours in the presence of thepolice and the armed forces, before their very eyes, whilesome of the shopkeepers were pleading for the police tointervene they did nothing to stop the mobs from setting fireto these shops. In the Alutgama town alone all the Muslimshops have been targeted and what is more interesting is theshops owned by Muslims have been set on fire. In some shopswhere Muslims have been carrying on business as tenants,things have been taken out of the building and set on firewithout damaging the building since that building did notbelong to Muslims or the building owner was not a Muslim.Then how does a Muslim in that area feel? They feelthoroughly let down and all these things have happenedduring the curfew hours. There were many GovernmentMinisters who went to that area. They saw for themselveswhat happened. I too went there. The sentiments of all Muslimleaders are the same. Some in the Government may not speakout. But, I am sure they would have taken up that with HisExcellency the President. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress isnot pointing a finger at the Government. But, the Governmenthas to look seriously into the conduct of the police during

the recent riots in Alutgama and Dharga Town. They werevery partial; they were prejudiced and in fact certain policeofficers were seen spreading rumours. A particular trafficsergeant was seen going about telling the people that theSinhala youth who was assaulted had succumbed to hisinjuries and that set off panic; that set off further trouble inthe area.

Therefore, this is a time for us to critically look at theconduct of the police and these type of incidents should notbe swept under the carpet and I am demanding that theGovernment appoints a Commission to look into this, theway in which the Alutgama police conducted itself. Theycalled for reinforcements, but, after it was too late. I spoke tothe Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Mr. GotabhayaRajapaksa. He assured me that he was sending in fiveplatoons of Army personnel to the area. In fact, they were sentand people of the area say that there was an incident in theoutskirts of Dharga Town where even two soldiers wereinvolved in looting a house.

So, such is the state of mind of the Muslims in the AlutgamaDharga Town area. To add insult to injury, some people startedspreading rumours to say that Muslims had incited violence,they were calling for people to stage an armed assault ontheir brother community the Sinhalese, and that they werearmed and they were distributing arms in the mosques andthese things have aggravated matters Finally today whathappens, the police is preparing to file a B Report and chargethe two people in the shop. The two persons who had been inthe shop are now being charged for the offence of unlawfulassembly and for voluntarily causing hurt under Section 314of the Penal Code. The charges are to be preferred - this iswhat I am told - against the shopkeeper when evidenceoverwhelmingly suggests that these people were assaultednot by the shopkeeper or the salesman in the shop but byothers. The crowds that gathered outside the shop had gothold of them and assaulted them. But, what does the policedo? They are now getting ready to file a B Report. Theshopkeeper and his assistant are in remand and they areattempting to bring charges for unlawful assembly and forvoluntarily causing hurt whereas there was no evidence tosuggest they were involved in assaulting these people. Andwhat is more? One of the two people who were assaulted,appears to be the son of two retired police officer. The fatherand mother had been retired police officers of the person whohad been assaulted. So there we can see the reason forpartiality by the local police. Ultimately the whole issue hasresulted in scores of places being burnt and set on fire. I donot say that it was only the Muslims who were affected. Therewere a few Sinhalese who had been doing business in DhargaTown, who had rented out shops from Muslims who weredoing business.Their businesses were also set on fire by angryyoung Muslim men which we do not endorse. But whathappened there happened before the curfew was clampeddown. Nothing happened during curfew hours in the DhargaTown area. But in Aluthgama while the curfew was on, whilethe police were onlookers, while some of the shopkeepers

135136

[ ]were pleading with the police, the shops had been set on fire.The Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardena had summoned a peacemeeting in the police station. My party Member of theProvincial Council, Mr. Aslam had been present and the Hon.Rohitha Abeygunawardena has undertaken to givecompensation to all the victims. Compensation needs to begiven not for anything else but since all this happened duringcurfew hours. The Government is responsible for whathappened. The Government must take responsibility.

( + )(The Presiding Member)Hon. Member, you can continue.

( [ )(Mr. Rauff Hakeem)Thank you, Madam.

I am referring to this issue not to incite trouble, but tohave a critical analysis of the way in which the police isconducting itself. Police is responsible for maintenance oflaw and order. They are looked upon as the guardians ofthe law and if the very police is not acting in an impartialmanner and if it is going to take sides at time whencommunal disturbance is taking place, that is a seriousmatter regarding which the Government must pay attention.Particulary if all these shops have been set on fire whilethe curfew was on. it is all the more important that theGovernment must pay full compensation since the peopleexpect the Government to protect their lives and propertieswhen the curfew is on.

( + )(The Presiding Member)

Hon. Member, your time is over.

( [ )(Mr. Rauff Hakeem)

Yes, I am winding up, Madam Chairperson.

There are responsible Ministers here. I am not blaminganyone here. I am not blaming government politicians. Iam only trying to bring to your notice that the people,particularly the Muslims in Alutgama Dharga Town areahave totally lost confidence in the police. That is going tohave serious consequences on all of us because it isultimately the responsibility of the police to see that theymaintain law and order. If the very guardians of the law arepartial and they are behaving in such a manner, I do notthink the minorities can have confidence particularly inview of the fact that the TNA has walked out today on anissue of concern to them. The SLMC is not doing anythingof that nature. But we are asking you to look at thisseriously and initiate an impartial inquiry. Let there be acommission. Let us go into it. Let us be given a chance topresent the case before the Government and the Governmentmust take responsibility and pay compensation to all thoseaffected, be it Muslims or Sinhalese. They all must be paidcompensation since the failure in the breakdown of law andorder in that area is largely attributable to the conduct ofthe very guardians of the law. With those commentsI conclude, Madam Chairperson.

Thank you.

[ ]Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am very happy today to bring theGeneva Conventions Bill for the approval of this Housewhich will give effect to Sri Lankas obligations to theFirst, Second, Third and Fourth Geneva Conventionsrelating to Armed Conflict. In fact, Sir, it is truly a curiouscoincidence, if I may say so, that this Bill is discussedbefore this House at a time when the city of Geneva itselfhas become a topic of great relevance to us, Sri Lankans,today especially with the discussions with the LTTEresuming after three long years, within the next few weeksin Geneva.

However, this Bill of course has no connectionwhatsoever to the impending discussions. As I said earlier,Sri Lanka became a State Party to the Geneva Conventionway back in 1959 and we are merely giving effect to someof the obligations which we have undertaken under thatAct in 1959. However, I believe that this Bill signifies thecommitment of His Excellency the President MahindaRajapaksa to the implementation of internationalhumanitarian obligations while Geneva, as a city in thecurrent context of negotiations, signifies the commitmentof His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa againto find a negotiated settlement to the ongoing conflict.

As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Deputy Speaker, theDiplomatic Conference convened in 1949 resulted in theadoption of four Geneva Conventions which harmonizedthe existing laws relating to humanitarian principles thatmust be observed with regard to a party engaged in armedConflict. In fact, the four Conventions, I will deal with itvery briefly. The First Convention deals with theAmelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and theSick in Armed Forces in the Field. The Second Conventiondeals with the Amelioration of the Condition of theWounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of ArmedForces at Sea. The Third Convention deals with theTreatment of Prisoners of War and the Fourth Conventiondeals with the Protection of Civilian Persons in Timeof War.

In fact, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Geneva Conventionwas founded on the ideal of respect for the individual andhis dignity. If war was inevitable, principles ofinternational Humanitarian Law codified in theConventions regulate the means and methods of conflictfrom the humanitarian perspective. Thus, persons notdirectly taking part in hostilities and those out of actionthrough sickness, injury, captivity or any other cause mustbe respected and protected against the effects of war.Those who suffer must be aided and cared for withoutdiscrimination.

That is why recognizing the need for the nationalimplementation of the international Humanitarian Law,my predecessor, the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, asthe Minister of Foreign Affairs initiated a National

Committee to look into this matter. The NationalCommitttee was inter - ministerial in nature and itcomprised of senior officials of the Ministries of ForeignAffairs, Defence, Interior, Social Welfare, Justice and italso included the Attorney-Generals Department, theLegal Draftsmans Department and of course thisCommittee also had the direct representation of the armedforces and the police.

The main objective of the National Committee formedin the year 2000 was to identify the principal elementswhich should be included in the draft legislation and thebasic legislative approach which should be adopted whilethe Legal Draftsman was tasked with the drafting of thelegislation. The draft was considered extensively by theinter-ministerial Commitee and the Cabinet, by itsdecision on the 14th of September 2005, granted approvalfor this important Bill to be presented in this augustAssembly today.

As you are well aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sri Lankabelieves that no cause justifies terror to be unleashedindiscriminately upon the innocent. Therefore, wemaintain the position that targeted and deliberate killingof civilians and non-combatants cannot be justified orlegitimized by any cause or grievance whatsoever and wealso recognize that any action intended to cause death orserious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants violatesthe fundamental norms of the international humanitarian law.

The State, again we believe, is responsible for the safetyand security of all its citizens and it must ensure theirprotection in the event of armed conflict. By upholding theprinciples of the international humanitarian law, States givethemselves the means of ensuring respect for humanity intimes of war. They also guarantee that human dignity will beupheld in gave circumstances that threaten it. If fact, Mr.Deputy Speaker, the proposed Bill in giving effect to theGeneva Conventions makes the following provisions: Part I,Clause 2 defines the gave breaches of Conventions to betreated as offences in Sri Lanka; Part II regulates the legalproceedings in respect of protected persons under theConventions and of course, Part III deals with the abuse ofthe Red Cross and other emblems and provides appropriatepunishment for those who violate it. Accordingly, no person,unless authorized in writing by the Minister of Foreign Affairsor by any person authorized in that behalf by the Minister ofForeign Affairs, shall use or display or cause to be used ordisplayed for any purpose whatsoever in Sri Lanka or outside,or on board any ship or aircraft registered in Sri Lanka theRed Cross and other emblems as designated in theConventions. This is an obligation cast on State parties interms of Geneva Conventions.

Sri Lanka, Mr. Deputy Speaker, has in the recent pastpursued a series of measures which reiterates our commitmentto the promotion and strengthening principles of

2006 01161162

international humanitarian law, as I mentioned earlier, whichreflect our continued engagement with the internationalcommunity in upholding respect for humanitarian values.

These measures include our session at the 60th Session ofUNGA to the Convention on certain conventional weapons,CCW Convention including Protoco II on landmines, thevoluntary submission of a report under Article 7 of the OttawaConvention on landmines, although Sri Lanka is not yet aparty to the Ottawa Convention, the implementation of acomprehensive mine-action programme to make Sri Lanka amine-free country, and our session to the internationalconvention for the protection of cultural property in the eventof armed conflict. As you know, we are also in the forefront ofthe international campaign against the use of children inarmed conflict which is a great problems faced by our childrenin the North and the East today.

For a democracy caught up in a conflict situation,international obligations imposed by internationalinstruments pose considerable challenges. Notwithstandingsuch challenges it is our endeavour to provide maximumprotection to those who are the victims of conflict, theinnocent civilians especially women and children. TheGeneva Conventions Bill which seeks to implement theinternational humanitarian obligations we have voluntarilyundertaken is yet another step in this direction.Saying those few words; Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would nowlike to commend this Bill for the approval of the House.

[1. 28 p.m.]

( [ )(Mr. Rauff Hakeem)Bisnillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are debating today the Billthat is being introduced to give effect to the First, Second,Third and Fourth geneva Conventions. In this regard, it isvery salient for us to note that we have decided today,after almost 45 or 46 years of ratifying these Conventionsto bring legislation to give effect to our countrysobligations under the Conventions. It is of course notvery surprising that such course of action is being adopted

2006 01165166

now. In facr, all over the world different countries atdifferent points of time only when they find that there isa need and a domestic compulsion to ratify some of theseConventions and bring about legislation or many yearsafter the ratification see the need to bring local legislationto give effect to those Conventions. These Conventionsare being brought into a legislative form in order toprovide safeguards and permit the civilians and non-combatants to enjoy the privileges and the comfort ofthese Conventions.

However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is pertinent for us tonote that after the Ceasefire Agreement had been signed,we have engaged the Norwegians as facilitators and wehave also monitors of the Ceasefire Agreement who arecalled the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission and they derivedtheir powers from this document, the Ceasefire Agreement.

Even the Geneva Conventions have room forrecognition for non-state actors. There are state partiesand non-state parties. They are belligerent groups whichgain recognition. We have of course, resisted giving suchrecognition to the LTTE. But, in effect we have come torealize the need to engage the LTTE in productive talksand to make a sincere attempt to usher lasting peace tothis country. We have now come to accept the absolutenecessity to maintain our obligations under the CeasefireAgreement. When we are introducing legislation to giveeffect to Conventions which we have ratified many yearsago, we should not bury our heads in the sand like thestrich and refuse to recognize that there are non-state actorsand belligerent groups in this country who may have alsogot to be involved in ensuring adherence to humanitarianlaw and to respect certain Conventions. But, since we donot want to give them such a status or any recognition,the civilian population and non-combatants are not ableto enjoy the benefits of all these Conventions that providesuch safeguards to non-combatants and the civilians.

The Sri Lankan Muslim community, particularly in theNorthern and Eastern Provinces the theatre of war, as we callit - feels that many incidents take place and even the SriLanka Monitoring Mission is unable to provide any relief tothem. It also applies to the International Red Cross which ispresent with the permission of the Government. They are in aposition to access the LTTE to find missing people. There arecomplaints regarding missing persons. There are complaintsregarding incidents that take place both in the Governmentcontrolled area and the LTTE controlled area. But many atime I, for one, as a Member representing the DigamadullaDistrict in the Eastern Province, forwarded many complaintswhich had come to me from the constituents regardingmissing persons. But the only reply we get from theInternational Red Cross is that, We will check it with LTTEand let you know. Obviously, most of these complaints havenever brought any relief to the people in the area.

So, it is in this backdrop that it is pertinent for us to onceagain state for the record in this House that the Muslims dofeel that they should also be recognized as a party to the

peace talks. I know, people would refer to the CeasefireAgreement and say, The Ceasefire Agreement is strictlybetween the LTTE and the Government. The Muslims haveno role to play and these are issues which can only be resolvedif both parties agree. In that regard I must emphasize herethat both the LTTE and the Government at different points oftime, in bilateral discussions and agreements which havebeen signed with the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, haverecognized the fact that as a matter of right we should beallowed to participate with a separate delegation in thepeace talks.

This issue has been of some public importance. Of late thismatter has been consistently agitated by all Muslim leaders,whichever side we may have taken politically during thePresidential Elections. But now a critical time has come andthe Government does not appear to be in a position to concedethis basic right that we have been agitating for.

In that backdrop we also have the deliberations that HisExcellency the President started in the form of an All PartyConference. It was widely believed that the All PartyConference was called for in order to break the deadlock thatwas in the South, to arrive at a Southern consensus to resolvesuch trivial issues. For the SLMC the issue pertaining to thevenue was a very trivial one though we participated in it.However, we are now quite relieved that finally someagreement has been reached to talk in Geneva. While bothparties have agreed to talk, the plight of the MuslimCommunity has been ignored totally in this whole process.

Of course, there have been certain statements madeyestereday to say that a Muslim representative will bepermitted in the Government delegation. That is not ourposition. Our position has consistently been that we shouldhave a separate delegation. This issue has been agitated eversince the LTTE withdrew from the talks and even before theirwithdrawal, in the deliberations that were held with the LTTEin the six rounds of talks, when I participated on behalf theGovernment, it was very clearly agreed with the LTTE.

In fact I and met Mr. Anton Balasingham in London in theRoyal Norwegian Embassy and while Mr. Solheim waspresent, it issued a paress statement saying that it is agreedbetween the LTTE and the SLMC Leader that he willparticipate in the peace talks, for the first round of talks as aMember of the Government Delegation and thereafter he willlead a separate delegation on behalf of the Muslims.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)I have given you five minutes, more.

( [ )(Mr. Rauff Hakeem)I believe that the speakers on behalf of the Governmentmay not be utilizing their time.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)It is not possible to utilize Government time. You are noton the Government side.

( [ )(Mr. Rauff Hakeem)Certainly it is so, but because of the importance of theissue I thought the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs woulpermit me to speak.

I will conclude in one or two minutes.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Yes.

( [ )(Mr. Rauff Hakeem)This issue cannot be debated within a few minutes.Probably this issue is going to result in very seriousconsequences to this country, to its people and the Muslimsin particular who are very highly disturbed about the recentdevelopments. Therefore it is important for us to bear this inmind.

I urge the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affaris to take thiscritical issue to his mind and advise His Excellency thePresident that the participation of a separate Muslimdelegation is not a concession that you make towards theMuslims but a matter of right and a matter which we haveagreed to between the parties to the talks. Even during theofficial talks this matter had already been accepted andrecorded as such. Therefore I would urge once again that theGovernment should consider this very seriously.

The SLMC may not feel inclined to continue to participatein deliberations leading to such a matter if this issue is not tobe addressed seriously by the Government.

With those comments, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thank you forgiving me the time.
