This argument fails toaccount for the basic premise that the harmful impact of alcohol,tobacco and for that matter drugs, whether the source of supply ofsuch substance is lawful or illicit, is a common pattern of use, addictionand dependence. Undoubtedly, the heath risk of illicit use is worse.But, the behavioral tendency of use, addiction and dependece beingthe same, the lawful trade and the illicit trade would have the effectaggravating such behavioral tendency. The user would have recourseto the licensed sources as well as illicit sources when the behaviorallytrend is set in motion. Hence, from the point of public health, thereis a harmful interlink. The likely pattern is that addiction will startfrom the licensed source and get aggravated in the fold of the illicittrade. The illicit trade is per se contrary to law, punishable undervarious statutes and there is no question of regulating an illicit trade.On the contrary the trade that is carried out on the basis of a licenceor authority of the law, which is found to be harmful to public healthshould necessarily be subject to restrain in order to minimize theharmful consequences to public health.

The House of Lords has heldthat the judiciary has a creative role to play in evaluating thecondition of society at any particular time and supplementingthe law by creating offences which were previously notknown. So in the United Kingdom there are two sources ofthe criminal law. There is the common law and there is thestatute law. On the other hand, in Sri Lanka, there is only onesource of the criminal law. There are only statutory offences.This means that the legislature has to be vigilant all the time.The legislature has to identify gaps in the existing law andtake timely action to fill those gaps as and when needed.This is what the Hon. Minister of Justice has done. By meansof this legislation he is seeking to introduce into the criminallaw of Sri Lanka several new offences such as debt bondage,serfdom, forced or compulsory labour, slavery and engagingor recruiting a child forcibly or compulsorily for use in armedconflict. That is the effect of Clause 6. So offencesreconginized by the Penal Code have been enhanced. Theirscope has been extended by the creation of new offenceswhich were hitherto not recognized by the criminal law ofour country.",

Very often the criminal law focusesonly on the offender, the punishment of the offender. Theoffender has contravened a vital social interest and he ismade subject to punishment. But that is only one part of theissue. We must also concentrate on the victim of the crime.The victim has to be compensated and it is not only monetarycompensation that I am talking about. Offences of this kindhave a permanent impact on the development of the child -the childs mental condition, his state of emotional well-being and sometimes the physical development of the child.There is consequently a protective function which thesociety must undertake in relation to the child.Compensation must be awarded not only for physical injurybut also for psychological injury. Otherwise, the idea ofcompensation is incomplete. For this reason the change thatis made in the law is entirely appropriate and timely. The lawseeks to take into account the whole gamut of damage orharm that is inflicted on the child and to the extent that ispossible by an award of monetary compensation to help thechild to re-adjust to get over this problem which has beencreated for no fault of the child. It is an objective that isrelated to rehabilitation. That is a response of a caring andcompassionate society and this legislation, I would suggest,is entirely in line with the cultural traditions of Sri Lanka.These are all very desirable aspects of the law.",

As aresult of the argument there was an exchange of blows andthereafter person who came into the shop had tried to grab amobile phone and run away. The shopkeeper shouted andthen people around got hold of the man. Three of them ranaway, two of them were beaten and one was very seriouslybeaten up by the people who gathered at the time when theshopkeeper alarmed as he was, screamed for help.",

The IGPhas to take serious note of this. The Inspector General ofPolice came to the spot, had an inquiry but after all thedamages had taken place. What is worse is that many shopshave been set on fire while the police was present duringcurfew hours. All the shops have been set on fire while thecurfew was on. During curfew hours in the presence of thepolice and the armed forces, before their very eyes, whilesome of the shopkeepers were pleading for the police tointervene they did nothing to stop the mobs from setting fireto these shops. In the Alutgama town alone all the Muslimshops have been targeted and what is more interesting is theshops owned by Muslims have been set on fire. In some shopswhere Muslims have been carrying on business as tenants,things have been taken out of the building and set on firewithout damaging the building since that building did notbelong to Muslims or the building owner was not a Muslim.Then how does a Muslim in that area feel? They feelthoroughly let down and all these things have happenedduring the curfew hours. There were many GovernmentMinisters who went to that area. They saw for themselveswhat happened. I too went there. The sentiments of all Muslimleaders are the same. Some in the Government may not speakout. But, I am sure they would have taken up that with HisExcellency the President. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress isnot pointing a finger at the Government. But, the Governmenthas to look seriously into the conduct of the police during",

To add insult to injury, some people startedspreading rumours to say that Muslims had incited violence,they were calling for people to stage an armed assault ontheir brother community the Sinhalese, and that they werearmed and they were distributing arms in the mosques andthese things have aggravated matters Finally today whathappens, the police is preparing to file a B Report and chargethe two people in the shop. The two persons who had been inthe shop are now being charged for the offence of unlawfulassembly and for voluntarily causing hurt under Section 314of the Penal Code. The charges are to be preferred - this iswhat I am told - against the shopkeeper when evidenceoverwhelmingly suggests that these people were assaultednot by the shopkeeper or the salesman in the shop but byothers. The crowds that gathered outside the shop had gothold of them and assaulted them. But, what does the policedo? They are now getting ready to file a B Report. Theshopkeeper and his assistant are in remand and they areattempting to bring charges for unlawful assembly and forvoluntarily causing hurt whereas there was no evidence tosuggest they were involved in assaulting these people. Andwhat is more? One of the two people who were assaulted,appears to be the son of two retired police officer. The fatherand mother had been retired police officers of the person whohad been assaulted. So there we can see the reason forpartiality by the local police. Ultimately the whole issue hasresulted in scores of places being burnt and set on fire. I donot say that it was only the Muslims who were affected. Therewere a few Sinhalese who had been doing business in DhargaTown, who had rented out shops from Muslims who weredoing business.Their businesses were also set on fire by angryyoung Muslim men which we do not endorse. But whathappened there happened before the curfew was clampeddown. Nothing happened during curfew hours in the DhargaTown area.

Iam only trying to bring to your notice that the people,particularly the Muslims in Alutgama Dharga Town areahave totally lost confidence in the police. That is going tohave serious consequences on all of us because it isultimately the responsibility of the police to see that theymaintain law and order. If the very guardians of the law arepartial and they are behaving in such a manner, I do notthink the minorities can have confidence particularly inview of the fact that the TNA has walked out today on anissue of concern to them. The SLMC is not doing anythingof that nature. But we are asking you to look at thisseriously and initiate an impartial inquiry. Let there be acommission. Let us go into it. Let us be given a chance topresent the case before the Government and the Governmentmust take responsibility and pay compensation to all thoseaffected, be it Muslims or Sinhalese. They all must be paidcompensation since the failure in the breakdown of law andorder in that area is largely attributable to the conduct ofthe very guardians of the law. With those commentsI conclude, Madam Chairperson.",
