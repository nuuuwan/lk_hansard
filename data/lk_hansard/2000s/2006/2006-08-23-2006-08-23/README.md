( )(Mr. Speaker) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)On the Answer that has been given, the first SupplementaryQuestion I wish to raise is in that case, does the Governmentwhich is supported by the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumayato have a majority in Parliament today, accept the CeasefireAgreement that was said to be so inimical to this countrywhich was signed by the UNP? They came to power sayingthat it is unconstitutional, inimical and that they would to towar. We said that that was not the case.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)That does not arise [Interruption]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)If that is the case, pelase say whether this CeasefireAgreement is valid or not.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Sir, that does not arise.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)If that does not arise, Sir, all we can say is that theGovernment which has the majority in Parliament as thePeoples Alliance, with the help of the maniac parties like theJVP, and the Jathika Hela Urumaya, today is going to armycamps [Interruption.] The people who were involved inthe killing of police and army officers in 1971, 1988 and1989 [Interruption.]

2006 23617618

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Sir, he must ask the Question. Sir, he is not asking theQuestion. Let him ask the Question, Sir.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)You can answer. I will be asking the Question the wayI want.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)You cannot make a statement. You can ask a Question byway of a Supplementary Question.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

My Question has to come through a logical sequence. I donot ask illogical Questions. [Interruption.] So, on thatparticular basis-

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

There is no logic in your statement. [Interruption.] So,do not waste our time. We have to start another Debate.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Neither is there logic in asking again.

( )(Mr. Speaker) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

So, on the same basis, today you have MPs who killed thearmy, police and navy officers in 1971, 1988 and 1989. Iwould like to ask whether the same people are accepting theCeasefire Agreement or have they told the Co-Chairs Pleasebring back peace to this country?

[12.52 p. m.]

( )( + - )(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of DisasterManagement and Human Rights)Sir, I would like to thank the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajahfor bringing to focus a very important issue concerning thepeople of the North and the East. This is an issue which

should be debated by parliament. Of course, there wouldbe different points of view expressed from both sides of theHouse. But that is indeed the hallmark of a democracy.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)What we regret most is that there is nobody on behalf ofthe Government here to listen to the Debate. You have justcome. The Front Benches are empty and most of theGovernment Benches are empty. Whom are we talking to?

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Sampanthan, he has only 10 minutes to speak.

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)I have only 10 minutes. I will ask the Hon. Member notto eat into that 10 minutes. Sir, I have to place on recordcertain information which I think will be of benefit to boththe Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah as well as the Hon.Sampanthan. I cannot answer all of the points that you haveraised in your Adjournment Motion within 10 minutes. Ihave highlighted three areas that I would like to speak about.

The first is, in respect of the relief agencies - NGOs, INGOsand other benefactors - in providing urgent humanitarianrelief to the affected people. Sir, I want to place on recordvery clearly on behalf of the Government that we are indeedvery grateful for the excellent work which is being doneby the bulk of the UN agencies - all of the UN agencies, Iwould say - and the bulk of the INGOs and the NGOs.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)I do not want to interrupt the Hon. Minister but I want topoint out to him, Sir, that even yesterday vehicles takingfood from UN agencies and INGOs to the uncleared areasin Batticaloa were not permitted to go. Only in Mankernithe Government Agents vehicles were able to get acrossbut not to any other place in Baticaloa. I spoke to theGovernment Agent in the morning today. Even the UNvehicles, the vehicles of INGOs that were to go to Vakarai,Kathiraveli and various other uncleared areas were not ableto go.

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)Sir, I would like to, through you, state for the record ofthis Parliament that from about the beginning of last week.His Excellency the President personally intervened and gavea directive [Interruption.] Wait, I will come to what youjust raised - initially for the ICRC to go in, and the ICRChas been going in with supplies.

687688

[ ]Now in addition, Sir, the GA Baticaloa has been doingan excellent job. [Interruption.] I will come to that. He hasbeen doing an excellent job. I am in contact with him on adaily basis. I have instructed him to put in place a co-ordinating mechanism which committee he is meeting ona daily basis including UN agencies as well as ICRC and Imust say, Sir, that there have been supplies taken as a resultof this co-ordinating mechanism which has been put in placeespecially in Vakarai where there are about 35,000 IDPs.

Yesterday - I agree with Mr. Sampanthan - there was aproblem. I am aware of this because the UN agencies broughtthis to my attention. I immediately got on the telephonewith His Excellency the President. I brought this to hisattention. He in turn, as soon as I finished the conversationhad spoken to the Chief of Defence Staff and had verycategorically stated to the Chief of Defence Staff that it washis decision to facilitate the UN agencies to go into Vakarai.

I subsequently spoke to the CDS and he confirmed thatHis Excellency the President had spoken to him and givena directive that the UN agencies should not be preventedfrom going in because the whole of the last week, Sir, theytook supplies. But it was only yesterday that over somemisunderstanding they had not been allowed to go in. Asof today, as a result of His Excellency the Presidentintervening and giving this directive, again they have beenable to go in. Sir, as the Minister of Disaster Managementand Human Rights as the National Co-ordinator for IDPhumanitarian assistance, I would like to see not only theICRC and the UN agencies going there but. I would alsolike to see the INGOs and NGOs which are doing some solidwork being facilitated to go there. But the problem is, Sir,as a result of the fighting there, we just cannot take theresponsibility of sending large numbers of aid workers andwe have explained this problem to them. Hopefully in thenear future, during the course of this week we may be ableto facilitate some selected INGOs and NGOs also to go there.So, I would like to reassure the Hon. Members that it is notGovernment policy to disregard the needs of the Sri Lankacitizens who are in those areas. We have been workingovertime. I have been personally supervising humanitarianassistance along with other Government Ministries in chargeof organizing these supplies. There may be bottlenecks.There may be shortcomings. But we are in the process ofrectifying it. I am not saying for a moment that everythingis perfect. There are shortcomings. Please bear with usbecause there is no deliberate, conscious, move on the partof the Government to disregard the needs of the people inthose areas. But, we have to understand, Sir, that there aresecurity matters also that need to be considered. We justcannot open the floodgates and risk the lives of thesepeople in an area of conflict.

Hopefully, the offensive which has been instigated bythe LTTE will be stopped. His Excellency the President toldthe Co-Chairs the other day - I was there when he said this

to the Co-Chairs I want peace. He said, I am willingto talk at any time. But please do not bring me messagesfrom various people. Bring me a message from the leaderof the LTTE. Let him say that he is willing to talk and thenwe can sit down and talk. I think that is very reasonable,Sir, because on behalf of the Government of Sir Lanka ifHis Excellency the President who is the Head of State cangive a guarantee that he is willing to sit down and talk,why can the LTTE not do so? Who needs this kind of aconflict? This kind of a conflict results in economicdestabilization. It gives a picture to the entire world thatthere is political instability in this country. Politicalinstability means a problem as far as the sustainabledevelopment in this country is concerned. Investment isgoing to be affected; tourism is going to be affected. So,who wants this conflict? We do not want the conflict. But,if there is an offensive, there is a justification in defendingthe lives of the people and the territory of this country. Thatis the job of the armed forces of this country and that isbeing done.

I am not saying. Sir, that everything is perfect. I am awareof the issue the Hon. Sampanthan raised a little while ago.I have admitted that something like that has happened. But,we have now rectified it and the Hon. Sampanthan, the Hon.Mavai Senathirajah and others, please be assured that if youbring to my notice any shortcoming, I will assure you ofmy commitment that is needed to rectify that shortcoming.The Hon. Raviraj has already been in touch with me aboutthe situation in Jaffna. I have been responding to his needsand requests that were placed before me. The Hon. (Mrs.)Thangeswary from Batticaloa has written to me and she hasbrougth to my notice the shortcomings, at various instances.I have addressed those shortcomings too. The Hon.Sampanthan once spoke to me regarding the ICRC, and thenas a result of him speaking to His Excellency the President,the President subsequently directed me to sort it out. Wedid sort it out. So, let us have this dialogue going. Let usnot try to score brownie points or try to score petty politicalpoints on an issue which concerns Sri Lankan citizens.Whether it be Sinhalese or Tamils or Muslims they are allSri Lankan citizen, Sir. We have, as a Government, theresponsibility to look after the interests of the Sri Lankacitizens and we are doing that.

Very quickly, Sir, I want to place on record that the shipthat we had arranged left yesterday. It is no its way now. Ijust spoke to the ICRC a little while ago and they anticipatethe ship to arrive sometime during the course of tomorrownight or early morning on Friday. I am in touch with theGA Jaffna. I must place on record the excellent work doneby the GA Jaffna. I must place on record the excellent workdone by the GA Jaffna as well. Sir, these three GAs whohave been having an enormous task before them, enormouschallenge before them have been really dedicatingthemselves with true commitment two facilitate the suppliesthat the Government has sent. Sir, just give me two moreminutes. We are in constant touch with them. I have put in

2006 23689690

place a co-ordinating committee even in Jaffna and theyare meeting regularly. We are getting reports on a regularbasis and with this consignment at least for a week to tendays there would be supplies. But, we will be supplementingthis. There will be other supplier ships which will be sentand I want to assure this House, Sir, through you, that wewill not neglect the people of the North and the East. Wegive them the highest priority and we will look after theirneeds without wavering in anyway, Sir.

I also want to place on record that we are now in theprocess of organizing a ferry to be sent from Trincomaleeto KKS. The ship, by the way, is going to Point Pedro butthis ferry service which we are hopeful of being able to starttomorrow will evacuate foreign nationals. There are about300 people who have already given us information abouttheir passport details, names, addresses and so on. Most ofthem are of Sri Lankan origin but foreign nationals. We arefacilitating the people who have foreign passports and whohave come to see their relatives, who are stuck there andwho want to get out Sir. Tomorrow, hopefully the ferry willleave-

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Hon. Minister-

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Yes

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

There are university students from Trincomalee, Batticaloaand some parts of Vanni who would also like to come out. Ispoke to the Government Agent Jaffna and to the ViceeChancellor of the University. I believe there is some effortalso to help those students. Please, try and help those studentstoo, if not on this occasion, by sending the ferry again on asecond trip.

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

I agree with you, Hon. Sampanthan. I think wh have to dothat. I am aware of this. The GA Jaffna has discussed thismatter with me. I am taking it up at the highest level. We wantto give priority to the foreign nationals to come out becausethey are the people who want to go back to their coulntry ofresidence and we will be facilitating that. But this is alsosomething that I want to give the highest amount of priorityto, because from what I understand-I do not know whetherthis is correct-most of them are from outside Jaffna. Most ofthese students are-

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

A number of them are from the Eastern Province and someare from Vanni and with the present situation in Jaffna, theparents are very anxious and desperate and they would likethem to come out for a while until things stabilize in Jaffna.So if you can kindly make the ferry available to them also tocome out, that will be very good.

( +)(The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

So, let us first get the ferry started. Unfortunately it has tostill go under the flag of the ICRC. The ideal situation wouldhave been for the Ports Authority to take the ferry withouthaving this kind of protection. But anyway the ICRC iswilling to evacuate those people who need to be evacuated.So we will use their good offices to do that.

Sir, I also want to very quickly say this. I think thisResolution also makes reference to the NGO personnel whowere killed. I think you are referring to the French NGOpersonnel in this Resolution. As soon as this came to ourattention, I took the position that we in the strongest senseon behalf of the Government, condemn this killing. We havenot stopped at that. We have started an impartial andindependent inquiry. We have even gone beyond that. Wehave got the permission and we have invited the Australiansto come and assist our special investigating team. The CID ishandling this investigation. The statements have beenrecorded from the next of kin and we are now following thedue process to ensure that no stone is left unturned, so tospeak, to ensure that we get to the bottom of wht happenedhere, Sir. Because this is the message that we must give at thiscrucial juncture to the international community. So I want toassure the Hon. Member who presented this Resolution, pleasedo not interpret our actions as a Government as being contraryto your wishes or your objectives in terms of helping thepeople in those areas. We are with the people and we will doeverything to ensure the welfare of the people of the Northand the East.

Thank you.

[1.10 p.m.]

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. I am sorry, Sir, I amspeaking to an empty House. But I would be glad if at leastmy speech is recorded in Hansard and it is available foreveryone to see, because we are debating, Sir, a very severehumanitarian crisis that is developing in the North-East whichhas already come into being in the North-East, and the purposeof this debate, I might mention, Sir, is to prevent theintensification of that crisis and to ensure that steps are takento bring this crisis under control. The Adjournment Motion,Sir, refers to several matters and I will not be referring toevery one of those matters. But I believe the AdjournmentMotion will form a part of the record and I would like to*table the Adjournment Motion to ensure that it becomes apart of the record. I was surprised, Sir, with the manner inwhich some of the Members of Parliament spoke this morning.Some of them talked about a hospital being constructed inKilinochchi as if some big favour is being done to the Tamilpeople. Some people talked about food being sent to theTamil areas as if some big favour is being done to the Tamilpeople. We were not asking you for any favours. We are askingfor equal treatment as citizens of this country.

Since you have not been according us such equal treat-ment, we have gone to the extent of saying, If you cannotgive us equal treatment, please leave us alone. So we arestill trying to see whether such equal treatment is possiblewithin the framework of a single united country. And there-fore I would request you, Hon. Memberss, who talk in thisvery patronizing way, in this very insulting way, in this veryhumiliating way, to stop such talk. I heard the Hon. WimalWeerawansa talking about it. I heard the ReverendMedhananda Thero, the monk from the JHU, talking aboutit. I even heard the others talking about it.

* . Produced at end of speech.

Sir, we are primarily concerned with the civilians living inthe North-East and that is the matter of the gravest concern tous. There are various events, occurrences and factors whithhave contributed to the situation that we have referred to inthe Adjournment Motion, a grave humanitarian crisis.Referring to the Adjournment Motion, Sir, I would first talkabout the deaths that have taken place in the North-East.According to the information that we have been able to gatherfrom various parts in the North-East, thus far, in numerousattacks, definitely over 150 civilians and up to about 200civilians have been killed as a result of aerial bombings, as aresult of heavy artillery shelling and personal assassinations.Apart from that, over 400 to 500 people have been grievouslyinjured. I will not refer, Sir, to every one of those instanceswhere killing have taken place but in regard to the individualkilling I want to point out that we are able to discern a certainpattern-certain important people are being killed.

There was a trader called Kaththamuttu Perinparajah whowas killed in Kiliveddy in the Mutur area sometime ago.There was no reson for him to be killed.There was anotherbusinessman in Trincomalee called Wijeyakumar aliasMayuran, the son of a proprietor of a big business inTrincomalee. He was shot and killed in the shop.Mr. Sinnathambi Sivamaharaja, a former Member ofParliament and a longstanding Member of the Federal Partyand the TULF had been killed in Jaffna. Yesterday, Sir, apriest by the name of Reverend Father Thiruchelvam NihalJim Brown, Parish Priest of Allaipiddi Jaffna, together withanother person in his company by the name WenceslausVincent Vimalan have gone missing. Father Jim Brown wasthe priest in Allaipiddi when the latest massacre took placeand was one of the persons responsible for the transport ofthe injured to hospital and in making the arrangements for ajudicial inquiry. It is in these circumstances that this priesthas gone missing. Some days ago, there was anotherbusinessman in Trincomalee by the name of Joseph Jebarajahwho was killed at Customs Road, in Trincomalee.

So we are inclined to the view, Sir, that some of thesepersons are being killed with the deliberate objective ofintimidating the Tamil people, of inducing the Tamil peopleto flee from their areas of residence and to make the peoplefeel that it is not safe to live in those parts in which suchattacks are taking place and there seems to be some plan.Well, I am not saying that the Government at the highestlevel is responsible for this plan. But certainly, within themilitary establishment, there is a definite plan on the part ofsome people to carry out such attacks against prominentTamil persons and thereby compel them to flee. This is avery serious matter, Sir, This cannot go on. Of course, wehave instances of indiscriminate aerial bombing and shelling.We know of the Mullaitivu incident. There have been veryclear views expressed by the International Community, theSLMM and by the UNICEF in regard to the Mullaitivuincident.

2006 23693694

Before I come to the reports of the SLMM and theUNICEF Sir, may I say this. Here were children, assembledin a building in Mullaitivu. They were not engaged incombat. At that point of time they were not fighting thearmed forces. They were not engaged in combat. Thereis nothing to indicate that they were undergoing anymilitary traning at that point of time. But they werebombed and about sixty of them were killed. A numberof them were grievously injured and according to myinformation, many of them have lost their hands andtheir legs.

The Hon. Minister, who is the Government DefenceSpokesman said, You do not expect us to cuddle thesechildren. I am sorry to state that, that was a ratherunwanted remark which seems to have some maliciouselements. We do not want the Hon. Minister to cuddlethese poor children. But merely because they are childrenand Tamil children in an LTTE controlled territory, it doesnot mean that you can bomb them and kill them in thisway. What does the UNICEF who went there on the sameday have to say about this killing. I quote;

The international child rights group UNICEF in a statementfrom New York yesterday said the youth killed in the air raidson Mullaitivu were innocent of violence said they were stayingovernight at the bombed compund attending a two-day course infirst-aid.

They went on to state Sir, in the course of theirstatenment and I quote;

UNICEF however said there was no evidence to support thoseclaims with its Sri Lankan representative Joanna van Gerten tellingAFP the children killed were from surrounding schools in the areaand were brought there for a two day training workshop on first-aid As of this time, we dont, have any evidence that they areLTTE cadres.

That is the position of the UNICEF in response to somestatements made by the Government, trying to make outthat they were LTTE cadres. Officials of the SLMM andUNICEF visited the site on Monday-the same day andaccording to the ceasefire monitors, there were no weapons.There were no weapons or rebel uniforms in the area. Thearea was just hit by about twelve to fifteen bombs leavingmore than sixty youth dead and over 130 others injuredaccording to LTTE figures.

Sir, you will see, this is the position of the UNICEF-an organization that looks after children- which had goneto the area on the day of the bombing itself and it is nota matter which the Government can ignore. There wassome effort made by the Government to make out that theSLMM people had gone to the wrong site and in regardto that this is what the SLMM has stated.

This is the statement made by ULF Henriccson, Headof the SLMM. I quote;

I m pretty sure we visited the right site. We have enoughevidence to prove this and we have also sent some of the evidenceto the Government. At least 12 fragmented bombs had beendropped at this site and our monitors have even detected oneunexploded bomb, similar to those used by the Air Force.

Mr. Henricsson told the Daily Mirror.

He said, there were no sings of a rebel arms training facilityin the area, as claimed by the Government, adding that the aerialvideo footage published by the defence authorities, to substaantiatetheir clams, was inconclusive.

So here is the SLMM Sir, once again in support of theposition taken by the UNICEF, is very clearly stating thatthere were no signs of a rebel arms training facility in thisarea as claimed by the Government.

Now, Sir, if that is the true position there is no reasonfor us to doubt that position. This comes from independentpeople who have no reason to be stating somthing untrue.I think, it is abundantly clear that they were bombedbecause they were Tamil children in an LTTE controlledarea and the attempts by the Government to make out thatthe children were engaged in combat training is not trueand has clearly been proved not to be true on the basisof the statements made by the SLMM and the UNICEF.

Then there was the other killing Sir, which I want torefer to, the killing of the 17 workers of the Action Contrela Faim in Matur, thirteen males, twelve Tamils and oneMuslim and four females. These persons had gone to theiroffice at Mutur on a Tuesday and trouble broke out thatday. I spoke to the office in Trincomalee. I spoke to thegentleman in charge of that place. He is a foreigner. Hetold me that he was in touch with the children on thewhole of Tuesday on a very regular basis. On Wednesdayhe was in touch. On Thursday he was in touch. He spoketo them last at 7.00 a.m, on Friday morning. At that pointof time they were safe. But thereafter he could not contactthem. Now it is well known. Sir, that the LTTE was incontrol of that area on Tuesday, Wednesday and untilThursday midnight. Thursday midnight the LTTE withdrewfrom that area and on Friday moring the Sri Lankan ArmedForces went into that area, and the children, 17 of themwere killed. they ceased to live. There could not be anycontact with them only after Friday morning and thathappened after the LTTE had left and the Sri Lankan Armyhad moved in.

Now, Sir, SLMM wanted to visit the scene of the crime,but they were told, You cannot go. The media went. TheSLMM repeatedly wanted to go to the scene of the crimeand see what had happened, but they were not allowedto go. Why? Why was the SLMM prevented? The Hon.Mahinda Samarasinghe was here saying that they areconduction a very independent investigation. I want toknow as to why the SLMM was prevented from going tothe site. The SLMM was prepared to take any risk andgo. They wanted to discover the truth. But they couldnot go.

Sir, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe talked about someAustralian experts who have come down here. They aresome forensic experts who will probably conduct someforensic invistagation and come up with some evidence

695696

[ . ]in regard to that matter. But, what about the investigationson the ground? Unless there are proper, independent andimpartial investigations on the ground that are useful toidentify the perpetrators of the crime, how are you goingto establish anything by merely getting some Australianpeople to come down here to conduct some forensicinvestigations? What we state Sir, is that these Australianscoming here should not be a whitewash. It should not bean eyewash. That should not be allowed, The AustralianGovernment, while being helpful, should not make itappear that there is a credible investigation, if in fact thereis no such independent and impartial investigation thatwill lead to the indentification of the perpetrators. If theAustralian Government permits itself to be used in thatway, it would result in the Sri Lankan Government beingable to conceal the truth at some point of time when onesmemory starts failing in regard to this horrendous crime.We urge the Australian Government that there should betransparency and the public at large in this country shouldbe kept informed of exactly what is happening. Thereshould not be any concealment of any evidenceforthcoming on the basis of any confidentiality, becauseif anything is concealed, then the world at large, thepeople in this country will not know whether a properinvestigation is being conducted to identify the perpetratorsof the crime. As of now we are inclined to the view verystrongly, that there is no such independent and impartialinvestigation being conducted to take the proces forwardin regard to the identification of the real culprits.

Tamils, Sir, are being intimidated in various ways,Businessmen are being called upon to fork out money.They are being threatende. It is happening in Trincomaleein the place called. Anbuvalipuram. I have beenreceiving a number of complaints from many shopkeepersand other people living in the area that the armed forceswalking around that area are intimidating the people. Infact, they have brought this to the notice of the SeniorSuperintendent of Police, Mr. Nihal Samarakoon inTrincomalee District. He assured me that he would lookinto the matter and take some action.

By these aerial bombings and artillery shelling, ourcrops are being destroyed, our plantations, our houses arebeing destroyed, other buildings are being desrtoyed,infrastructure is being destroyed. The Government ispursuing a scorched earth policy, the result of whichwould be that the people would not be able to return tothese areas in the North-East.

Having said that. Sir, I think at this point of time, I wouldlike to refer to certain important aspects of the GenevaConvention. The House should be aware that there is aGeneva Convention relating to the protection of civlianpersons in time of war. This was adopted, Sir, in 1949 andcame into force in 1950. This relates, Sir, to the protectionof civilians at times of war as between states. There is

another convention. Sir. The Additional Protocols of 8thJune 1977 deal with conflict not as between States but aswithin a State, within a country, between a liberationmovement and a government and the plight of civiliansin that context.

I would like to read out to the House certain very importantparts of those two Protocols with regard to the rights of civliansin that context.

I would like to read out to the House certain very importantparts of those two Protocols with regard to the rights ofcivilians in areas of such conflict and what the Governmentor the State should not do or what the parties at conflictshould not do as far as civilians go.

In regard to agricultural areas, it says, I quote:

Attacks against crops. livestock and agricultural areas needed forfood production for the civilian population are prohibited (PROTOCALI. ART. 54sec 2)

But our crops and plantations in the North and the East arebeing totally devastated and destroyed. It further states, Iquote:

area bombardments Area bombardments occur when a number ofclearly separated military obectives are treated as a single militaryobjective, and wheree there is a similar concentration of civilians orcivilian objects. (PROTOCAL I. ART. 54 sec 5a)

Area bombardments and other indiscriminate attacks are forbidden. (PROTOCAL I. ART. 54sec 57) An indicriminate attack affectingthe civilian population or civilian objects and resulting in excessive lossof life, infury to civilians or damage to civilian objects is a gravebreach of the Geneva Convention.

I want to submit to the House Sir, that the manner in whichthe Government is indiscriminately bombing and shellingcivilian areas in several parts of the North-East is in completeviolation of the Additional Protocols of 8th June 1977,forming a part of the Geneva Conventions.

I want to very clearly state that the inernational community,particularly; the Co-Chars, the UN, India and the rest of theinternational community should take note of the fact that theGovernment is acting in flagrant violation of importantArticles of the Additional Protocols to the GenevaConventions and that is a very serious matter gravely affectingthe Tamil civilian population in the North-East where anumber of persons are being killed, a number of persons arebeing grievously injured and where there is substantivedestruction of our crops, of our property and of our assets.This situation Sir, must not be allowed to continue.

The international community is all the time finding faultwith the LTTE and there are several strictures being imposedon them, several sanctions are being imposed on them. Theother party to the conflict is the Government of Sri lanka andif the Government of Sri Lanka is violation the Geneva

2006 23697698

Conventions in regard to the rights of civilian people, Tamilcivilian people, living in the areas of conflict we wish toemphasize that there is a duty cast upon the internationalcommunity to take cognizance of this flagrant violation bythe Government and consider the question of what action itshould take to ensure that the rights of civilians are protected.

I would only say Sir, that this bombing of children inMultativu was in violation of International HumanitarianLaw. When wars are conducted. Sir, there is a duty cast uponthe Government to act in accordance with the InternationalLaw. We want to very definitely state that the Government isbnot doing so. It is our submission that the bombing of thechildren in Multaitivu was uncivilized; it was barbaric and itwas criminal and we want the international community totake note of that matter and take appropriate action to ensurethat such things are not repeated. You cannot justify killinginnocent children by merelty calling them soldiers or personswho may be engaged in combat on some future date.

Now. I want at this point of time, Sir, to refer to a statementmade by His Excellency the President recently, even as recentas a day or two age, when he met with the diplomats of theCo-Chairs. His Excellency the President stressed that he wasfor peace and that his Government was awaiting the LTTE toreturn to talks on the ceasefire and substantive matters andthat he was merely conducting some defensive operationsand the Government was not engaged in any offensiveoperations. The President also said that the LTTE mustcommence an initiative incorporating a clear commitment toa comprehensive and verifiable cessation of hostilities bythe LTTE Leader. He also said, Sir, at this meeting with theCo-Chairs such a cessation of hostilities should includemodalities to ensure that the Sampur area does not pose amilitary threat to the Trincomalee Harbour and its environsdue to the LTTE military presence in Sampur violating theCFA.

I happen to come from Trincomalee, Sir, and I know thisvillage, Sampur, very well. Before I deal with Sampur and itsenvironment, I would like to say that though His Excellencythe President tries to make out that it is the LTTE which is onthe offensive and that they are on the defensive the wholeworld knows. I think, everybody in this country knows thatthe military operations started with the Government forcescommencing aerial bombing and shelling at Mavil-Aru toopen a sluice gate which has now been done. Despite thesluice gate having been opened the bombing was stillcontinuing or the shelling of bombs was still continuing. Wedo not know for what reason. As aI said in the course of adebate in Parliament some time ago-

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

No, Sir. My party has got time.

( + )(The Presiding Member)You started at 1.10 p.m.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Pardon me?

( + )(The Presiding Member)You have 25 minutes.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

It is only 1.35 p.m. now. I will go on. I will take mypartys time.

( + )(The Presiding Member) ?

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Yes. I will take my partys time.

( + )(The Presiding Member)Okay.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

My partys time goes on till 2 o clock or beyond that.We have got ten minutes of the CWCs time. We will sortit out.

As I said, Sir, it all started in Mavil-Aru and there wasevery possibility of the Mavil-Aru conflict in regard towater being settled without military action. But theGovernment, for some inexplicable reason not known toanybody, decided that they must commence military actionto open a sluice gate which according to my informationthey have not succeeded up to date. That is how everybodyknows the confrontation started and the Government not

699700

[ . ]merely attacked Mavil-Aru, it attacked Echchilampattai; itattacked Sampur; it attacked Kathiraveli; it attacked Vaharai;it attacked Karadiyanaru; it attacked Mullativu; it attackedKilinochchi and so it wennt on.

So, I do not quite agree, Sir, with the views expressed byHis Excellency the President that the Government is engagingin a purely defensive operation and that the offensiveoperation was commenced by the LTTE. I do not think that isin accord with the facts, as we all know them. It is oursubmission that it was the Government which commencedthe military offensive. Consequently, there has been,naturally, a response from the LTTE and the conflict is stillgoing on which we would like to come to an end as early aspossible.

Sir, since the Government has talked about Sampur andalso this question of Mavil-Aru that has come up, I want tomake it very clear to the House and I want to place this onrecord that both these areas, Sampur and Mavil-Aru comewithin the LTTE controlled territory. I will refer Sir, to Article2.7 of the Ceasefire Agreement. This si what Article 2.7 states,I quote :

In order to facilitate the flow of goods and the movement of civilians,the Parties agree to establish checkpoints on their line of control.

I lay emphasis on that, on their line of control.

It further states, I quote :

............at such locations as are specified in Annex B.

What does Annex B state in regard to the TrincomaleeDistrict? Annex B talks of a place called Mahindapura on theTrincomalee - Batticaloa Road. Mavil-Aru is south ofMahindapura. Mahindapura is the point at which the line ofcontrol exists. The Ceasefire Agreement says that on theTrincomalee-Batticaloa Road the line of control is atMahindapura. Mavil-Aru is beyond Mahindapura, furthersouth and was never under Government controlled territory.Another point referred to in Annex B is Mutur. On the east ofMutur, one gets the Kattaiparichchan Army point.

( )(The Hon. Jayantha Wijesekara) _

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Please reply later. Do not distrub me.

One the east of Mutur one gets the Kattaiparichchan ArmyPoint. That is the line of control. End of Mutur is the line ofcontrol. In terms of the Ceasefire Agreement, Kattaiparichchan,Sampur, Kunativu, Chudaikuda and all those villages are

beyond the line of control. Situated further east, Sampur, Sir,was clearly within the LTTE controlled territory and it iseven today within the LTTE controlled territory.

Now, sir, what is the historical reality in regard to Sampur?I have been to Sampur as a little child. There is a famoustemple there called Baththrakali Ambal temple. I have beento Sampur as a little child and know the village very well.What is the historical truth in regard to these areas, Sampurand Mavil-Aru? These areas have been the areas of historicalhabitation of the Tamil speaking people without question. Iwant to place it on record Sir, and I want to make it part of theHansard. Kindly include as part of Hansard* the figures,population, based upon ethnicity published in the Census ofCeylon, 1881. it is on population according to age,nationality, elducation, occupation and religion. I am quotingfrom that Census, Sir, which I want to place on record.Appendix to the Report, page 131 Koddiyarrap Pattu AGAsDivision is one of the AGAs Divisions in Trincomalee District.Koddiyarrap Pattu AGAs Division has both Sampur andMavil-aru within it. Both Sampur and Mavil-Aru come withinthe Koddiyarrap Pattu AGA Division. What was thepopulation ratio with the Koddiyarrp Pattu AGAs Divisionin 1881 according to the Census report which I have with mein my hand? I am not saying this against the Sinhalese people.No, not at all. I am not for a moment saying anything againstthe Sinhalese people.-[Interruption.]

But, we do not want these persons who came inyesterday and the day before, riff-raff, to tell us about ourrights. We certainly know our rights. That is the historicalposition of Sampur. Sampur is a historical Tamil village;historically inhabited by the Tamil people.

( + )(The Presiding Member) . . .

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)As I said before, Sir, Sampur has never been a source ofdanger to anyone in the past, not to any other territory in theTrincomalee District. Whether strategically or otherwise,

Sampur has never been a source of danger. Why now? Ourconflict has not been resolved in an acceptable way, and ifour conflict is resolved in an acceptable way, there will be noneed for any apprehension on the part of anyone, theGovernment or anybody else, in regard to Sampur or anyother part of Trincomalee. That is the reality.

The Tamils more than anyone else want that beautiful naturalharbour in Trincomalee to be protected and to be a valuableasset. My ancestral property at Trincomalee, Sir, is very closeto the harbour. I live a stones throw distance away from theHarbour of Trincomalee. That is where my ancestral propertyis. As a little boy, I used to go and stand close to the harbourand admire that harbour. I am not a man who went toTrincomalee yesterday or the day before. We have lived therefor generations and centuries. So, Sir, there is no need foranyone to think that there will be damage to the TrincomaleeHarbour as a result of Sampur being occupied by the Tamils orthe LTTE being present there. If the proper thing is done andif there is a resolution to the problem of the Tamil-speakingpeople in the North-East, then Sampur will be just a villagewhere people live and the Trincomalee Harbour will be naturalasset, which can be used by everybody for our benefit. Thatis what we want. But, if someone is thinking, because they areunable to find a solution to the conflict, that there must bemilitary occupation of Sampur, that is not something that isgoing to be welcomed by anybody. We would like the matterto be resolved peacefully, in such a way that there will be noneed for any military confrontation and in Sampur also peoplecan live in peace and peacefully. That is our only desire, Sir.

Before I conclude, Sir, I must say that my good Friends fromthe JVP - most of the seniors are not here, very unfortunately- are trying to dictate policy to the Government in regard towhat should happen in the North and the East. In regard toNorth, of course, they do not contest any elections there andwe do not have to bother about them. In regard to the East, -[Interruption.]

[ .][ ][Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

[Interruption.] He does not want me to speak the truth andput all these things on record, because then I would exposehim and his party. They contested, Sir, two seats at the lastParliamentary Elections, one in Trincomalee and one inAmpara. They contested on the UPFA ticket and managedto come to Parliament, because a lot of SLFPers voted forthem.

How did they fare at the Local Government Elections a fewmonths ago? In the Seruwila Pradeshiya Sabha, out of ninemembers, they came last and got only one member. In theKantalai Pradeshiya Sabha, where there are 11 members, theycame third and got two members. In the Morawewa PradeshiyaSabha, where there are nine members, they came last and

703704

[ . ]they got one member. In the Gomarankadawala PradeshiyaSabhathe Sinhalese people who are living inGomarankadawala are people who have lived in Trincomaleefor over 100 years, there are nine members and they came lastand got one member. In the Padavi Sripura Pradeshiya Sabha,where there are nine members, they came last and they gotone member. They did not get any members in any one of theother Pradeshiya Sabhas.

Now, I want to give you, Sir, their position in regard to theAmpara District before I conclude, because they have goneto court also and filed some papers. In the MahaoyaPradeshiya Sabha, where there are ten members, they camethird and got one member. In the Padiyatalawa PradeshiyaSabha, where there are 11 members, they came last and gottwo members. In the Lahugala Pradeshiya Sabha, where thereare 11 members, they got nothing; they did not get one seat.In the Ampara Urban Council, where there are nine members,they came last and got one member. In the Namaloya PradeshiyaSabha, where there are nine seats, they came last and got onemember. In the Uhana Pradeshiya Sabha, where there are 15members, they came last and got two members. That is yourposition politically as far as your status goes in both Amparaand Trincomalee. You people cannot be dictating to the others,to the Tamils or the Muslims or the UNP or the SLFP, in regardto what should happen in the North-East. You are getting toobig for your shoes. I am sorry to state that you are getting toobig for your shoes and you think that you can decide for usas to what should happen. That cannot be allowed. -[Interruption.]

Before I conclude, Sir, there is only one other matter I wantto refer to. There are some villages in Trincomalee, Sir, on thewest of the Trincomalee-Batticaloa Road, 13 villages in all -Mallikativu, Periyaveli, Manalchenai, Iruthayapuram,Paddithidal, Pallathadichenai, Munnampodiveddai,Narayanapuram, Bharathipuram, Meenkamam, Kanguvelli,Sivapuram, Lingapuram, Aathiammankerni, Kiliveddy,Thangapuram, Kumarapuram. They are suffering without food.We would like food to go to those areas. About 12,000 to15,000 people live in those areas. Then, there are about 8,000to 10,000 people living at Ilankai Thurai Muhathuvaram,Punnaiyadi, Kalladi, Valaithoddam, Muthuchenai on thesouthern extremity of the Trincomalee District. They havenot been able to cross to Vakarai and those people need to belooked after.

The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe referred to the freemovement of NGOs. NGOs are not moving. NGOs are beingattacked. They have come under physical attack. Many ofthem have been attacked; some of them have ben killed; someof them have been injured and vehicles have been damaged.Therefore, Sir, we would request that the Government opensthese checkpoints and enable the NGOs to work freely inthose areas and take food to all the areas in Batticaloa, all theareas in Trincomalee and similarly, in Jaffna.

I thank you, Sir, for the time given to me. The rest of thetime will be taken by my Members.

Thank you, Sir.

( + )(The Presiding Member) .

( )(The Hon. Hasen Ali)Sir, I am finishing now. , +, , + ; +, ,

( )( + - +, )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairsand Minister of Ports and Aviation)Sir, my good Friend, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah inpresenting the Adjournment Motion today, stated that heholds the Government primarily answerable and accountablefor this grave humanitarian crisis and the Hon. Senathirajahwants to know what steps the Government will take to preventits intensification. However, Sir, what is significant is that theHon. Senathirajah does not say that what he terms as thisgrave humanitarian crisis was essentially triggered off bythe offensive actions of the LTTE several weeks ago inMavil - Aru.

In fact, I feel that it would have been more appropriate ifsome of the concerns highlighted by the Hon. Senathirajahin his Adjournment Motion were brought to the attention ofhis current patron saint in the jungles of Kilinochchi insteadof, as usual, trying to justify the terror and the aggression ofthe LTTE by making the Government, as he says, primarilyresponsible.

Of course, I do sympathize with the Hon. Senathirajahsdilemma because we all know that such questions of dissentare not tolerated by the LTTE. And had my good Friend daredto ask such questions he too would have become a statistic

731732

[ ]confined to the pages of history like many of his colleagueswho have been killed in the last several years. We know thatno one should dare to question the Sun God in his abode inthe noctural jungles of Kilinochchi.

However, having said that, Sir, as a government committedto a negotiated settlement to the ethnic crisis, as a governmentcommitted to the rule of law and human rights and as agovernment committed to extending the democratic writ tothe long suffering Tamil People in the LTTE controlled areaswhere our Tamil brothers and sisters have been stripped oftheir right to dissent, have been stripped of their right tovote, where their young children are abducted, where theyare forced to pay taxes to the LTTE and where they arepunished by Kangaroo courts by the LTTE, in fact, I canassure this House at the outset that we will not shirk from ourresponsibility of continuing to provide protection andassistance to all our citizens in this country, Tamil, Muslimor Sinhalese.

Sir, first of all, I would like to point out that the recentescalation in violence was precipitated solely by the offensiveactions of the LTTE. The Government, I repeat, has notinitiated any offensive action in the breach of the CeasefireAgreement during this period. When the LTTE encroachedinto cleared areas and closed the Mavil-Aru anicut, theGovernment was left with no option, no choice other than toask the army to exert military pressure on the LTTE to openthe sluice gates as thousands of families were suffering dueto the LTTEs usage of water as a weapon of war and blackmail.It late turned out that they real strategy of the LTTE was thatMavil-Aru was a diversion to tie down the security forces sothe LTTE could engage in even more serious violations ofthe CFA by attacking Mutur and bringing TrincomaleeHarbour under threat so that supplies to Jaffna would bedisrupted or broken, It is now obvious that the presenthumanitarian crisis was ignited by the LTTEs desire tocapture and dominate the Jaffna Peninsula. Everything thathas happened since the closure of Mavil-Aru anicut now hasbeen the result of this brutal and aggressie offensive campaignof the LTTE.

As you all know and as our Muslim Colleagues know Muturis a predominantly Muslim town and this town has alwaysbeen an irritant to the LTTEs master plan of attacking theTrincomalee Harbour. Just as the LTTE in 1990 carried out ahorrendous form of ethnic cleansing by ordering the Muslimsin the Northern Province to leave within 48 hours, manyMuslims in Mutur feared this time that the present attack wasthe beginning of yet another round of ethnic cleansing after16 years. As a result, thousands of Muslims fled the area.Many residents fleeing the LTTE carnage in Mutur had giveneyewitness accounts on how the LTTE intelligence cadreshad picked out Muslim youths who were suspected of havinghelped the Government security forces. It is believed thathundreds of such youth s were massacred near Pachchanur. Infact, I am surprised that in the Motion which was presented

by the Hon. Senathirajah not a word was mentioned aboutthe plight of the Muslims of the Eastern Province. Havingfailed on the Mutur and the Mavil-Aru front, the LTTEsubsequently launched further attacks on Jaffna from the areasof Muhamalai and Nagar Kovil as well as from Kayts andMandaithivu areas. Once again, the security forces werecompelled to repulse these attacks at some cost both tothemselves and the LTTE.

As the LTTE in the last several weeks faced one setbacafter another in its usual style tried to divert attention fromits own brutal human rights violations and atrocities byaccusing the Government of various human rights violations.The First allegation immediately after the LTTE executionof nearly 100 Muslim youths in Mutur was that 17 workersattached to the French ade agency, Action Against Hungarwere executed in Mutur. The Government stronglycondemned and condemns again on the floor of this Housethe reprehensible killing of 17 Sri Lankan nationals. Andunder the directive of His Excellency the President, thegovernment has already begun to conduct an impartial andexpeditious investigation into the killings. The government,as you know most probably, my Colleague the Hon. MahindaSamarasinghe would have explained to you in his speechearlier, has requested assistance from the Commonwealth ofAustralia to provide forensic experts to assist the specialinvestigating team. In an effort to uncover the truth regardingthese killings, the Government sent a special team of judicialmedical officers to Mutur to conduct post-mortems on thedeceased.

At this moment, I must also place on record theGovernments appreciation of the valuable work done byNGOs to help the country especially in the North and theEast. The NGO workers should not be attacked by anybodyand such reprehensible acts like in Mutur should be stoppedimmediately. Investigations into this massacre will be carriedout expeditiously because the Government is determined toclear its good name from such heinous allegations. Despiteserious concerns about the impartiality of some individualmembers of certain NGOs, we know that certain members areactually using NGOs to further their own personal andpolitical agendas. Sri Lanka, which has the most liberalregime as far as the NGOs are concerned, will continue to besupportive of NGOs who have played a major role in thecountrys socio-economic development especially in theNorth and the East since the tsunami.

Then, of course, there was another allegation, anotherfantastic allegation if I may say so, made by the LTTE thatthe Government bombed an orphanage and killed schoolgoing children. This is yet another example of LTTEscampaign of disingormation and lies to cover up their ownrecord of being and organization which strengthens its cadresby forcibly recruiting children. This has been confirmed overand over again by the UNICEF. In fact, they had recruitednearly 2000 children this year alone by forcibly taking themaway from their parents. In fact, I would say, to exhibit the

2006 23733734

bodies of young persons whom they themselves haveabducted all set in a row to the world media is a reprehensibleexercise in utter cynicism by the LTTE. The very childrenwhom the LTTE abducted in the prime of thier youth to pursuetheir terrorist goals are now being exhibited, as the Hon.Douglas Devananda said, to the world amids a flood ofcrocodile tears by the LTTE and its supporters. In fact, atleast now the global community must condemn the use ofchildren and youth as cannon fodder by the LTTE and childrecruitment must be stopped immediately.

The humanitarian situation, Mr. Presiding Member, hasbeen brought under control in the Jaffna Peninsula. Eightthousand four hundred and ten refugees have fled to Indiasince the LTTE began its campaign of violence in the Northand the East. It is obvious that the LTTE is orchestrating theinflux of refugees to India by spreading false propaganda inorder to put strain on the excellent relations between SriLanka and India. In fact under President Rajapaksasdirections the Government and the UNHCR have establishedrefugee centers in Trincomalee and Mannar to accommodateand care for the people who have been temporarily displaced.There is no need for any refugee to flee across the Palk Straits.We are very thankful to the Government of India and theGovernment of Tamil Nadu for assisting those who havegone there.

During this period we also saw the LTTE extending itscampaign of aggression in Colombo. The Pakistani HighCommissioner was targeted for assassination in the heart ofColombo. This new dimension of LTTE terrorism is of greatconcern to the Government and almost certainly to theinternational community as well. Like all international terrororganizations, it is obvious that the LTTE too is now targetingother countries that are assisting Sri Lankas campaign againstterrorism. The Government has taken measures not only tostrengthen the security of the High Commissioner of Pakistan,but other members of the diplomatic community as well.At my Ministrys request, the Ministry of Defence hasdesigned a special focal point at the level of a DIG to consultthe diplomatic missions and to make necessary arrangementsfor additional security wherever necessary.

The assassination of Ketheshwaran Loganathan, DeputySecretary-General of the Peace Secretariat of Sri Lanka wasalso a great blow to our peace making process. Ironically, asyou all may remember, Kethesh was also killed on the sameday, same night and almost at the same time my predecessorLakshman Kadirgamar was killed, exactly one year ago. Theonly crime committed by Kethesh as well as former EPDPmember Sivadasan, who fortunately escaped an attempt onhis life, were to be Tamil dissident voices which challengedthe LTTE claim to be the sole representative.

However Sir, despite all these serious provocations, theGovernment is committed to a negotiated settlement withthe LTTE. That, we must stress on the Floor of this House.We do not believe that the military option is the answer.

We believe as many of our speakers have stated, while dealingwith the terrorist problem of the LTTE, it is essential that weaddress the genuine grievances of the Tamil people as well asall other people of this country.

As I pointed out, the Government has not initiated anyoffensive operations on its own to attack the LTTE except inself-defence and to maintain and protect the positionsestablished by the ceasefire. Whether it was in Mavil-Aru,Mutur, Nagar Kovil, Muhamalai, Kayts or Mandaithivu, theGovernment forces were simply trying to prevent the LTTEfrom committing aggression against the positions establishedby the ceasefire established by the UNP Government itself.The actions of the security forces were clearly designed torepulse of deter such actions.

Since the swearing-in of President Mahinda Rajapaksa onthe 19th November, 2005, until now, despite the continuouskillings, we have not yet fired a single shot in an offensivemanner. Whatever deterrent actions that were carried outalways were limited in time and scopl and the Governmentwas forced to take action in the face of serious violations ofthe Ceasefire, as I mentioned earlier, in Mavil-Aru and so on.Even the air attacks carried out, were directed at identifiedtargets to prevent the supply of cadres to the LTTE duringthe ongoing operations at the moment. In fact, this wholeHouse must commend and praise President MahindaRajapaksa for his patience and restraint. It has to beappreciated by all who value peace.

In fact we saw recently in the Middle East, where a hugecrisis was ignited by the fact that two Israeli soldiers hadbeen kidnapped which unfortunately brought untoldsuffering to both parties of the conflict. Thousands of civilianswere killed, property was lost and a country was almostdestroyed. Sir, if I may point out, since the swearing-in ofPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa, I have here, the full list ofatrocities committed by the LTTE from the 17th of November,the day of the Presidential Election, until the 31st of July,end of last month. There were 317 killings of Army, Navy, AirForce, Police personnel, STF, home guards, publicpersonalities and members of the Tamil political parties andthis is without taking into consideration the large number ofcivilians killed. In fact, 161 Army personnel were killed duringthis period. Yet, we saw that almost the world being draggedinto a war, because two soldiers were kidnapped. So, in thatcase, I ask my Friends in the TNA, should you also notrecongnize the restraint and the patience shown by ourPresident in dealing with this problem ?

In fact, Sir, I would like to table* this whole document andbecause of the important nature of the statistics, I would alsobe much obliged if you can actually include all the details inthe HANSARD itself.

[ ]It is in this context that on the 21st of August, earlier on inthis week, His Excellency the President very clearly informedthe Donor Co-chair Ambassadors that the Government willseriously consider any initiative that incorporates a clearcommitment to a comprehensive and verifiableI underlinethe word, verifiable - cessation of hostilities personallydeclared by the LTTE Leader, Prabhakaran. Such a cessationof hostilities should include modalities to guarantee that theLTTE would not violate the Ceasfire Agreement by enteringSampur and pose a military threat to the Trincomalee Harbourand its environs. Attack on the Trincomalee Harbour fromlocations in Sampur is a clear threat on maritime traffic andnaval operations. It is threrfore imperative that Sampur areabe returned to its original status in which the LTTE does nothave long-range weapons and capablities located in the area.

I said earlier that a verifiable cessation of hostilitiespersonally declared by the LTTE Leader, Prabhakaran, willcertainly be welcome and we are ready to start talkingimmediately if that is so. We say that it has to be verified byPrabhakaran and no one else, because we have seen that otherassurances given by other leaders have always been brokenby the LTTE. We saw that the LTTE going to Oslo and turningback saying that they cannot speak to our delegation havingpromised the Norwegian facilitators that they will do so. Wesaw that Anton Balasingham, during the period of the UnitedNational Party Government, going back on his word on theOslo Accord, denying that they agreed to the Oslo formula.They have always gone back on their word. So, that is whywe feel that a commitment and a guarantee by Prabhakaranare essential.

I would take just a few more minutes, Sir. However, Sir,such a cessation of hostilities should not be used by theLTTE, as they have done in the past, to regroup and strengthenthemselves militarily.

In fact, you may have seen in the newspapers today theMedia Release issued by the Department of Justice of theUnited States of America on the 22nd of August, that isyesterday. It gives a clear and unbiased picture as to how theLTTE has been using the Ceasefire Agreement to rearm andstrengthen themselves. In a tangible demonstration of supportagainst terrorism, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, theFBI of the USA, conducted an undercover sting operation toapprehend the LTTE procurement agents seeking to purchasesophisticated weaponary.

It is reported that four persons had met in Queens. In fact,let me also very briefly quote you who they are. These areSathajhan Sarachandran, also known as Satha, SahilalSabaratnam, known as Sahil, Thiruthanikan Thanigasalam,known as Thani, Nadarasa Yogarasa, known as Yoga,Murugesu Vinayagamoorthy, known as Dr. Moorthy,Nachimuthu Socrates and Vijayshanthar Patpanathan. Allthese people were arrested and what is interesting ?

Let me quote very briefly from sections of the MediaRelease issued by the Department of Justice of the UnitedSates of America.

Four of the defendants were arrested on Long Island, New York, onAugust 19, 2006, after three of them travelled to New York fromCanada to attempt to purchase from an agent acting in a undercovercapacity Russian-made SA 18 surface-to-air missiles, missile launchers,AK-47s, and other weapons to be used by the LTTE in its rapidlyescalating conflict against the Sri Lankan military.

And what is most important is, I quote:

These four defendants were acting at the direction of senior LTTEleadership in Sri Lanka.

It goes on to say, I quote:

As alleged in both complaints, the defendants are closely connectedwith LTTE leadership in Sri Lanka, and many of them have personallymet with LTTE leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, and other senior leaderof the terrorist group.

In fact, it also states; it quotes the United States AttorneyRoslynn R. Mauskopf of the Department of Justice, easternDistrict of New York, who says:

As charged, for more than 15 years, the LTTE has waged a war ofterror, assassinations, and suicide bombings in Sri Lanka and elsewhere,

We refuse to allow the LTTE and its supporters to use the UnitedStates as a source of supply for weapons, technology, and financialresources.

And also it describes how Vinayagamoorthy actuallyoffered a bribe of US Dollars one million to one of the agentsso that they could lift the proscription of the LTTE in theUnited States. While the innocent Tamils are starving in theareas the LTTE is controlling, they have enough money tobe offering bribes as much as US Dollars one million to asecret agency in the United States.

Just as Mr. Prabhakaran in educating his children in Irelandand in the West while these poor children are recruited theyare wasting a lot of valuable money with could have beenused for the benefit of the Tamil people of the North and theEast.

In fact, it also tells about outside purchasing of the LTTE.

( + )(The Presiding Member) .

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera), 3 . It also describeshow they used bank accounts and basically this gives you allthe details on how the LTTE has been using this Ceasefire

2006 23737738

Agreement to strengthen themselves. I think, this is a trueeye-opener and may I request Mr. Presiding Member, becauseof the importance of this document, which I tabled, hopefullycan also be included in full in the HANSARD.

However, having said that Sir, the Government still believesthat there is opportunity for the LTTE to give up the path ofviolence it has chosen and resume a dialogue whihout anyconditions being attached to it. It is now time for the LTTE tofocus on the substantive core issues of devolution of powerrather than chase an unattainable dream of a mono-ehtnicseparate state which does not belong in todays civilizedworld. A large majority of people in Sri Lanka includingmost Tamil people believe in a pluralistic, democratic societyand reject the concept of a separate state demarcated alongethnic lines. The only way to resolve the conflict is throughnegotiations and the Government remains fully committedto a political process to address the genuine grievances ofthe Tamil speaking people of this country. We therefore, urgethe LTTE to shum violence and become a member of ademocratic pluralistic society. (Interruption) Mr.

[ ][ ][Expunged on the order of the Chair]

I can understand your exuberance when you come herebecause you never get a chance to express your views inKilinochchi. Please do not disturb me Mr.

[ ][ ][Expunged on the order of the Chair]

Excuse me. Finally, Mr. Presiding Member, in conclusion,I would like to quote from one of my own speeches in 1996and one of my own letters to the Leader of the Opposition atthat time. I think, it is still relevant today. I quote:

What is needed today is a political solution acceptable to allcommunities affected; a solution which will take us away from thehorrors of war; a solution that dispels mistruct and suspicion....;

so that Sooththarapuncha and I could sit down and have agood drink and a long chat in the near future.

...a solution which will address the justifiable grievances of allcommunities living in this country, a solution that will enable all citizensto live with honour and dignity. In a underdeveloped country like ours,what is needed is not a war that kills people but a war to improve thequality of living of the people; a war against want; a war against hungerand a war against ignorance.

Just one more thing. I would also like to take thisopportunity to thank the Hon. Speaker for giving us theDHAMMAPADA. In fact, yesterday and today I was justgoing through it which has been left on our tables. Thankyou very much. I went through one of the verses in this bookand, I think, it is very appropriate for all of us in this countryat this moment in time. What does it say? I quote the verse 3at page 2 of DHAMMAPADA.

_ _

It means, He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, herobbed me. In those who nurxe such grudges hatred will nevercease

I think Sri Lanka has now reached the point where weshould stop pointing accusing fingers at each other. We shouldall forget the past and all communities must now unite inorder to create a new Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

Mavil Aru : Denial of Water to Civilians

SCOPP Report02 August 2006

The Mavil Aru water issue has now escalated into armed hostilitiesbetween the Sri Lankan security forces and the LTTE However itcould easily have been resolved had the LTTE been moreaccommodating and sensitive to the humanitarian needs of the peopleof the area, including the Tamil people. Since the Mavil Aru issue hasbeen analysed and interpreted extensively in the media, it is necessarythat the facts are placed before the public and the internationalcommunity.

On 20 July, The LTTE closed the Mavil Aru sluice gate, denyingwater to over 15,000 families and 30,000 acres of paddy lands. Thevillages affected as a result are Kallar, Dehiwaththa, Thoppur, Seruvila,Serunuwara, Neelapola, Dehiwaththa, Medagama, Sirimangalapura,Pallikudirippu, Kiliweddi, Kanguweli, Maingama, Thanganagar andBharathipuram. The people in the villages belonging to all ethnic groups,Muslims, Sinhalese, Tamils, depend on the water supply from the MavilAru anicut for drinking purposes as well as agriculture. The sluice gateis located in an area that was dominated by the security forces at thetime of the signing of the CFA.

On 21 July, The chief incumbent of the Seruwila Temple, as theGovernment Representative on the Local Monitoring Committee (LMC)of the SLMM for Trincomalee District, requested the Engineers of theIrrigation Department to open the Mavil Aru sluice-gate. The LTTEcadres threatened the Engineers and prevented them from gainingaccess to the sluice-gate.

On 23 July, a SLMM Monitor and an Irrigation Engineer wereobstructed from visiting the site by the LTTE.

On 25 July, Elilan, Head of LTTEs Political Wing in TrincomaleeDistrict, sent a letter to SLMM referring to the need of a water supplytower in Paddalipuram in the LTTE-controlled area. On receipt of thisletter by SCOPP a decision was taken promptly in consultation with the

Secretary to the President and Secretary, Ministry of Nation Building &Development to agree to the construction of the requested water towerwith a view to resolving the situation. This was conveyed to the LTTEby GOSL letter the same day through the SLMM. There was no reactionfrom the LTTE Peace Secretariat in Kilinochchi or from the LTTEOffice in Sampoor. The SLMM attempted on several occasions to seeka response from the LTTE to the Government letter of 25 July, withoutany succes. The LTTE had by no responding to the GOSL letter of 25July, left little choice to the GOSL to seek to restore the water supplythrough other means.

On 26 July, The Security Forces began escorting the Engineers. TheAir Force conducted an air operation against identified targets whichhad instigated the forcible closer of the Anicut.

On 27 July, The SLMM Monitors in Tricomalee received a letter,purporting to be from the community including the villages ofPallikudiruppu, Paddalipuram and Nallur seeking several developmentrelated items. The LTTE at this stage had taken cover behind thecommunity.

The Community Appeal went beyond LTTE initial demand and nowincluded safer transport in GOSL controlled areas, increase supply ofdry rations to IDPs and to lift the embargo on building materials toLTTE controlled areas. The Community Appeal was communicated tothe Government Agent (GA) Trincomalee District and a positive responsewas sent through the SLMM to the community leaders.

On 28 July, The Security Forces began ground action to access thesluice-gate at Mavil Aru purely on humanitarian grounds to restore thefree flow of water to civillians. Despite the position of the Government,the LTTE continued to obstruct all attempts at opening the sluice gate.It was abundantly clear that the LTTEs motives went beyond the waterissue and that it was resorting to dilatory tactics as well as armed hostilitiesto deny the people of the area access to drinking and irrigation water,thereby, creating conditions for their displacement and virtual evictions.

The governments subsequent actions were essentially a humanitar-ian mission designed to restore the drinking and irrigation water supplyto the affected 15,000 familles.

Brief Note on Incidents at Marvil Aru, Muttur and Muhamalai

The closure of the water supply from the Mavil Aru Sluice Gate bythe LTTEOn 20 July, the LTTE forcibly closed the water supply from theMarwil Aru Anicut, which provides water to Seruwila, Muttur andIchalampattu areas in the Trincomalee District preventing water supplyto over 15,000 families and approximately 30,000 acres of paddylands. As negotiations conducted through the good offices of the SLMMfaild ot get the sluice gate open, the Security Forces launced a limitedhumanitarian operation with a clearly defined objective of securing thewater supply to the civilian population.

The government took the view that the forcible closure of the watersupply, in an area which was recently controlled by the government, isa hostile act committed against the civilian population and is a grossviolation of the CFA, international law and long standing internationalpracitce. The Security Forces have successfully secured area and releasedwater from the Mawil Aru sluice Gate.

Two complaints were unsealed this morning in U.S. District Court inBrooklyn charging eight defendants with multiple crimes, includingconspiracy to provide material support and resources to a designatedforeign terrorist organization the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE or Tamil Tigers.) Four of the defendants were arrested on LongIsland, New York, on August 19, 2006, after three of them travelled toNew York from Canada to attempt to purchase from an agent acting inan undercover capacity Russian-made SA18 surface-to-air missiles,missile launchers, AK-47s, and other weapons to be used by the LTTEin its rapidly escalating conflict against the Sri Lankan military. Thesefour defendants were acting at the direction of senior LTTE leadershipin Sri Lanka.

In the second complaint, multiple defendants are charged withproviding material support to the LTTE that included the procurementof military equipment and dual use technology, fund raising, and moneylaundering through font charitable organization and U.S. bankaccounts. That complaint also charges that the defendants attempted toobtain classified information, conspired to bribe U.S. public officials inan effort to remove the LTTE from the U.S. State Departments list ofForeign Terrorist Organizations, and dealt in illegal financial transactionswith LTTE.

As alleged in both complaints, the defendants are closely connectedwith LTTE leadership in Sri Lanka, and many of them have personallymet with LTTE leader, Valupillai Prabhakaran, and other senior leadersof the terrorist group.

The investigation leading to the arrests announced today wasconducted by the Newark Division of the Federal Bureau ofInvestigations Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), with assistanceprovided by more than 20 of the FBIs Field Offices, including New

York, NY, New Haven, CT, Buffalo, CT, Buffalo, NY, Seattle, WA,Baltimore, MD, Chicago, IL, and San Jose, CA ; the United StatesAttorneys Office for the District of Connecticut ; U.S. immigration andCustoms Enforcement (ICE) ; the U.S. Department of State ; the RoyalCanadian Mounted Police National Security Program ; and British lawenforcement authorities.

The defendants arrested in the Eastern District of New York arescheduled to have their initial appearances this afternoon before UnitedStates Magistrate Judge Marilyn D. Go at the U.S. Courthouse, 225Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, New York.

The multi-faceted scheme by members and supporters of the SriLankan organization known as the Tamil Tigers demonstrates the needfor continued vigilance in the global war against terrorists, said AttorneyGeneral Alberto R. Gonzales. These defendants allegedly sought toobtain, through a variety of means, weapons and materials to carry outa deadly campaign of violence. We will use every tool in our power todisrupt the activities of those who seek to harm others, both here andabroad.

As charged, for more than 15 years, the LTTE has waged a war ofterror, assassinations, and suicide bombgings in Sri Lanka andelsewhere, stated United States Attorney Roslynn R. Mauskopf. Werefuse to allow the LTTE and its supporters to use the United States asa source of supply for weapons, technology and financial resources.Ms. Mauskopf added that the investigation is continuing.

Todays arrests of high level Tamil Tiger financiers and operativesare a clear example of the FBIs ability to combine long term, complexintelligence gathering, terrorism prevention, and law enforcement,stated Leslie G. Wiser, Jr., FBI Special Agent-in-Charge, Newark FieldOffice. This weekends operation has severely impaired the TamilTigers ability to acquire funding and weapons for their ongoing terroroperations in Sri Lanka.

According to the complaints, the LTTE was founded in 1976 anduses illegal methods to raise money, acquire weapons and technology,and publicize its cause of establishing an independent Tamil state inNorthern Sri Lanka. The LTTE began its armed conflict against the SriLankan Government in 1983, and utilizes a guerrilla strategy that oftenincludes acts of terrorism. With and army of several thousandcombatants, the LTTE controls most of the Northern and Eastern coastalareas of Sri Lanka. The complaints allege that over the past 15 years,the LTTE has conducted approximately 200 suicide bombings, resultingin the deaths of hundreds of victims, and carried out numerous politicalassassinations, including the May 1991 assassination of former IndianPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the 1993 assassination of the President ofSri Lanka, Ranasinghe Premadasa, the July 1999 assassination ofNeelan Thiruchelvam, a member of the Sri Lanka parliament, the June2000 assassination of C.V. Goonaratne, the Sri Lankan industry Minister,and the August 2006 assassination of the Sri Lankan governmentspeace secretariat, Ketheshwaran Loganathan. Beginning in 2002, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government operated under a tenuouscease-fire agreement, but that agreement has essentially ended, andsince April 2006, more than 1,700 people have been killed in theescalating conflict.

In 1997, the LTTE was designated by U.S. State Department as aForeign Terrorist Organization and therefore may not legally raisemoney or procure specifiede equipment or materials in the UnitedStates.

Attempts to Bribe Purported State Department Officials

According to one complaint, MURUGESU VINAYAGAMOORTHY,a senior LTTE supporter, NACHIMUTHU SOCRATES, a LTTEsupporter in North America, and other defendants attempted andconspired to bribe purported U.S. State Department officials to removethe LTTE from the State Departments Foreign Terrorist Organizationlist. Beginning in 2004 and continuing over a period of several months,the defendants met with a confidential informant (CI-1) who was

2006 23749750

operating under law enforcement supervision, and two purportedState Department officials, identified in the complaint as UC-1 andUC-2, and discussed the financial terms of the bribe, including a $1million up-front payment. During one meeting, the complaint allegesthat VINAYAGAMOORTHY said that he had traveled to the UnitedStates for the meeting on behalf of senior LTTE leadership in SriLanka, and that the LTTE leader - referring to Velupillai Prabhakaran- would make the ultimate decision as to how much the LTTE waswilling to pay the State Department officials.

During some of these meetings, UC-1 and SOCRATES also discussedthe sale of classified United States intelligence information to the LTTE.The complaint alleges that SOCRATES made interim bribery paymentsto the CI to give to UC -1 Ultimately, the defendants put the scheme onhold due to the prevailing climate in Sri Lank.

According to the complaint, in December 2005, SOCRATES metwith UC-1 and CI-1 in order to purchase a purpoted classifiedintelligence document concerning the LTTE which made reference toan investigation by the United States and a foreign government intothe Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO), a charitable organizationsuspected of being a front for a LTTE fund raising organization.Although the document was presented to the defendants as containingclassified information, it was created by the FBI for purposes of theinvestigation. SOCRATES and CI-1 gave UC-1 $ 1,000 in cash, andUC-1 permitted SOCRATES to review the document. SOCRATES, inturn, passed the information to VINAYAGAMOORTHY,

Attempt to Purchase Surface-to-Air Missiles

As alleged in the other complaint filed today, in July 2006, CI-1received a telephone call, which was consensually recorded, from aLTTE supporter, NADARASA YOGARASA (YOGA) YOGA believedthat the CI had a relationship with a black market arms dealer whocould acquire heavy military artillery, including missiles. On July 31,2006, CI-1, YOGA, and SATHAJHAN SARACHANDRAN (SATHA),a LTTE supporter, met at a location in Queens, New York, and in arecorded conversation SATHA discussed the types of weapons hewanted to purchase on behalf of the LTTE, specifically, surface-to-airmissiles to be used against the Kfir , a reference to the lsraeli-madekfir fighter jet aircraft used by the Sri Lankan military against theLTTE SATHA, a Canadian citizen who had traveled to New York fromCanada for this meeting, advised CI-1 that he was taking directionfrom Pottu Amman, who handled outside purchasing of arms. PottuAmman leads the intelligence and operations wing of the LTTE, OnAugust 7, 2006, CI-1 and YOGA met at another location in Queensand discussed various weapons that the LTTE needed, including AK-47 s and truck -mounted missile systems.

On August 18, 2006,SATHA, SAHILAL SABARATNAM (SAHIL),identified in the complaint as the financial guy and THIRUTHANIKANTHANIGASALAM (THANI) traveled to the United States by car fromCanada. SAHIL and THANI, both Canadian citizens, are LTTEsupporters.

On Saturday, August 19, 2006, CI-i met SATHA SAHIL, and THANIat a location in Queens, and then they drove to another location inLong Island, where they met for several hours with two undercoverlaw enforcement officers (identified in the complaint as UC-1 and UC-2). The meeting was consensually recorded. At the outset, UC-1 askedthe defendants what they wanted to purchase, and THANI said, Weneed something for Kfir, the Israeli-made figheter jets. UC-1 asked,You want to shoot this airplane down? THANI said yes. THANI alsosaid they wanted weaponry to destroy boats. The defendants discussedusing bank accunts in Switzerland, St. Croix, or other offshore locationsto finance the purchase, and THANI stated that the defendants wanteddelivery to occur ship- to ship in the Indian Ocean. THANI and SAHILrequested UC-2, who posed as a technical expert in militay weaponry,to travel to Sri Lanka to train the ultimate Users of the arms. THANIIndicated that in the future, they wanted to purchase between 50 and100 surface- to air missiles, but would start with the smaller quantity of10, obtain training on them in Sri Lanka and, if the missiles worked

well, buy the remainder. During the meeting, the parties discussed thequantity and price of the missiles and AK-47 assault rifles, and agreedthat an initial shipment would consist of 10 SA- 18 surface - to airmissiles and 500 AK-47s and that UC-2 would provide technical trainingon the use of the missiles. The parties also discussed a total price ofbetween $900,000 and $937,000 for the equipment and the training.SATHA, SAHIL, and THANI then examined as SA-18 missile, whichwas brought into the room in a long wooden crate, as well as themissiles firing tube and trigger mechanism, and two AK-47 assaultweapons.

Arms dealers to purchase 10 surface to air missiles, training in theuse of thse missiles and 500 AK 47 machineguns at a total cost of937,500 Dollers. Several LTTE activists have also been arrested forattempting to bribe undercover FBI agents posing as State Departmentofficials in an effort to get confidential information regarding theproscription of the LTTE in the United States. As a mater of fact, theDepartment of Justice in its press release says these four defendantswere acting on the directions of senior LTTE officials in Sri Lanka andmany of them had personally met with Prabhakaran and other seniormemebers of the terrorist group.

We welcome the support of the United States authorities inimplementing the legislative framework relating to foreign terroristorganisations. We are hopeful that other countries which have proscribedthe LTTE will also follow in the same direction and give teeth to theproscription by taking action againste the illegal activities of the LTTEcomprehensive and verifiable cessation of hostilities personally declaredby the LTTE leader Prabhakaran because in an organization led by thewishes of one man the wishes of others dont carry weight.

However such a cessation of hostilities should not be used by theLTTE as they have done in the past to regroup and strenghen themselvesmilitaryly. In fact the press release issued by the Department of Justiceof the United States on August 21st is a clear and unbiased picture ofhow the LTTE has been using the CFA to rearm and strengthenthemselves. In a tangible demonstration of support against globalterrorism, the Federal Bureau of Investigation the United States conductedand undercover sting operation to apprehend LTTE procurement agentsseeking to purchase sophisticated weaponry.

It is reported that four persons had met in Queens, New York withundercover FBI agents who were posing as black market Aru, Mutturand Jaffna. Even the air attacks that were carried out were directed atidentified targets to prevent the supply of cadres to the LTTE duringthese operations.

President Rajapaksas patience and restraint has been appreciated byfriends of Sri Lanka both here and abroad. he recent Middle-East crisiswas ignited by the fact that two Israeli soldiers were kidnapped whichbrought untold suffering to thousands of people and caused damageto property on both sides of the conflict. Yet president Rajapaksa despite losing as many as 304 soldiers remained calm and restrained andpatient.

I ask the TNA members to tell me of any other leader in the worldwho would have behaved with such restraint in the face of suchprovocation. It is in this context that on August 21st, H. E. the Presidentvery clearly informed the Donor Co-chair Ambassadors that theGovernment will seriously consider any initiative that incorporates aclear commitment to a

Prime Minister, there were twopersons who have been involved in producing a movie.They have been arrested by the Slave Island Police Stationand remanded till the 28th. They had gone to Salakato get computer graphics or somthing developed thatdepicts the army. In the story, army personnel also comein an act.

So, these are the things that are happening. Somebodyjust gives a call even a three-wheeler driver. I think theJVP has been trainig all the three-wheeler drivers tocomplain of any suspicious people. Unnecessarily, theyare complaining and immediately people are being arrested.So we, the Representatives of the Tamils, have to undergoa lot of difficulties. I am not blaming the JVP. But, whenthey advise the three-wheeler drivers, they must tell themto act with responsibility. Just for the sake of complaining,they should not say, There is a Tamil who is verysuspicious. This creates an unnecessary problem. Sir,these are the difficulties that we are undergoing in ourday-to-day life. Our day-to-day life has been distrupted.Everyday, arresting of people is going on in the City ofColombo.

What is the solution to this problem? Actually, pleasefind a durable solution to the ethnic problem rather thanengaging in or advocating war. I think the Governmenthas to act with responsibility and bring about a solutionto this, because so many problems could be solvedthrough that.

Thank you, Sir.

Thank you Mr. Presiding Member for giving me thisopportunity to speak on a very important and relevantAjournment Motion proposed by a Senior Member ofParliament , the Hon, Mavai S. Senathirajah, I am only a littledisturbed by the wording of the Motion because he does notmention a single word about the people who have beendisplaced from Mutur because of the actions of the LTTE. Hedoes not mention a single word about the killing of over onehundred Muslim youth who were fleeing for their lives, withtheir parents, children and wives. If this Motion was proposed

to discuss the plight of the people of the North and the East,it should have included the plight of the Muslims. Naturally,the Muslims who are living in the East are also part of thevoters of the Members of the TNA who are today representingthe Northern and Eastern Districts.Unfortunately, this doesnot seem to have been the prime concern on their minds.

Before I proceed with the matter under consideration, Imust reply the Hon. Gamini Lokuge, who raised the questionas to whether the Government is for war or for peace. HisExcellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has from theday he was elected, made it very clear that he stands for peaceand time and again despite provocation, he has continued tomaintain that he remains committed fro peace, but will reactto any attacks on the armed forces.

Another very disturbing feature in todays proceedingswas a statement made by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. I donot like to say that a statement made by an honorable Memberof Parliament is an untruth, but in this instance, I have nohesitation to say that what he said was absolute falsehoodand I say this with absoulute responsibility as a Member ofthe Government. He said that seventy bodies of the armedforces had been brought to Anuradhapura and buried in thedead of night, so that the people of this country would notknow. I can tell you that, this is an utter despicable untruth.There had been no such instance of bodies of armed forcesbeing buried in the dead of night without anybodysknowledge. I do not know why he said it. May be, this is whathis inner conscience wants to happen. He wants the armedforces to be defeated, their bodies to come in seventies, inhundreds and be buried in the dead of night. This may be thereason why he came out with that today.

Today, at a time when our valiant armed forces are givingtheir lives in the North and the East and are being injured, isthis the way we uplift the morale of our armed forces who arethere to safeguard us and the integrity of our country?Yesterday, we heard there was a bomb found in Borella. It wasthe security forces who found it and defused it. Who knows,one of us, either on this side or that side of the divide, couldhave been a victime of that. We know many innocent peoplehave died outside the North and the East due to bomb blaststhat have taken place. We have seen small children dying inColombo and outside Colombo. I was there in Kebithigollewaon the day the incident took place. I saw fourteen smallchildren, below the age of five, children who were one yearold and two years old, lying there for no fault of theirs. it is inthe same way, due to no fault of theirs, today 50,000 Muslimsare living in Kantale. What is the reason for the eviction ofthe Muslims? I would say this has been a pre-planned strategy.Sixteen years ago 100,000 Muslims were evicted from theNorth, having given a few hours notice and they left justwith their clothes on their backs. Today after 16 years theyare still languishing in the camps in Puttalam and other places,despite many changes in government, despite many attemptsat peace talks. So the ultimate sufferers have been the Muslimcommunity.

[ ]But more than that, I would say, when we talk here -thoughI also talk about the Muslim community - we should first talknot as Muslims, Sinhalese or Tamils. I am talking about theMuslim refugees; some Members spoke about the Tamilrefugees and some other Members spoke about the Sinhalarefugees. But should we not as legislators of this country betalking about Sri Lankan citizens? All the people who havebeen affected by this outbreak of hostilities are Sri Lankancitizens. Are we not Sri Lankans? Should we not think interms of Sri Lanka? It is very unfortunate that today. we all,even in this House, talk in terms of ethnicity. As has beencondemned by the previous speakers, I also condemn thekilling, by whoever it was, of the 17 aid workers, 16 Tamilsand one Muslim and I thank the Government for havinglaunched an investigation into this . But at the same time Iask, no, I would say I demand that the Government shouldalso launch an investigation into the brutal killing of 100Muslim youths whose hands were tied, taken behind a rockand whose bodies have not been found except for two bodieswhich the LTTE allowed. Even a decent burial was not givento them. I demand an investigation from the Government.The Government should inquire into it and bring the peoplewho killed these Muslim youths to book.

We have been talking so much about the investigationsinto various causes. Look at the cause of the eviction of theMutur Muslims. Why were they evicted? It is noticeable as16 years ago North was cleared up. Now they want to clearMuslims of this side. What is the fault of the Muslims? Thefault of the Muslims has been that they have always been acommunity which has not wanted to get involved in a war, nodo they want a separation of the country. As I heard over theradio today, that the President of the All Ceylon Jam-E-AthulUlamah, Rizvi Mupthi has categorically stated that theMuslims in Kantale are willing to go back to Mutur but theywant their security guaranteed. His Excellency the Presidenthas guaranteed their security because as has already beenmentioned there is no reason for any shelling from theGovernment side on Mutur. But the fact remains whether ourFriends from the TNA who brought this Motion today wouldbe able to speak to the LTTE and give the same guarantee onthe safety and the security of the Muslim people of Mutur sothat they could go back and start their livelihoods. Much oftheir livelihood today has been completely annihilated, Itwill take them years to get back to where they were. But atleast let us make a start. The Government through the Ministryof Resettlement, I am told, is in the process of formulating acompensatory scheme for the re-settlement of these people.But compensation alone is not enough. How are we going tocompensate them? May be Rs. 25,000 or Rs. 50,000. But isthat enough for the loss they have incurred? Is that enoughfor the suffering that they have undergone living in thesecamps? Three families were living in a four feet by six feetcamp. There is a limit to what the Government can do underany circumstances. I am sure the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath

Jayawardana who is very much experienced in hadlingrefugeeproblems is one of the first persons to visit wheneverthere is an incident or any oubreak of natural or man madedisaster. He feels the pain of people who are displaced due toeither man made or natural disaster. He feels the pain of peoplewho are displaced due to either man made or natural disasters.Should we not look at their feelings? Let us expedite. Let usall get together, hold hands and expedite the resettlementnot only of the people of Mutur, but also the Tamil peoplewho are suffering as a result of hostilities. Let us come to thenegotiating table. The best people to speak to The LTTEtoday are not Norway or the peace facilitators, but theMembers of the TNA whom we hold in high esteem. I see themost senior Member of the TNA, the Hon. Sampanthan, iscoming in now. I think there is a great responsobility on theirpart to speak to the LTTE to ensure that the Muslims inKantalai are given an assurance that they will be protectedonce they get back to Mutur.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Every Government Member wants the people to getback to Mutur. Mutur has been their historic habitationfor centuries and they must go back to Mutur. But theymust go back to Mutur in a position of safety where therewill be no conflict between the Government armed forcesand the LTTE armed forces. We want the people to livethere safely and securely.

( )(The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)Hon. Member, that is what I was saying that theGovernment

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

We must all work towards that.

( )(The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)His Excellency has now given an undertaking that theirsecurity will be assured. So what I was saying is that it isup to the Members of the TNA also to speak to the LTTEand to ensure that there is a commitment. Then the peoplewill be willing to go back. The people have told us thatthey are willing to go back if there are security guaranteesfrom both sides. Therefore, we have

( )(The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila) , . There ismuch more to say, but due to lack of time, once again letme reiterate that today, this moment is not a moment forus to be talking about sinhales, tamils and Muslims. Letus get together first as human beings and then as citizensof this country, so that we could build up a better tomorrowfor our children.

Thank you very much.
