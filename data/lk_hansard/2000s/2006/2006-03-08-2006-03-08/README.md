( )(Mr. Speaker) . [ ]

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake )Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak afew words on the National Enterprise Development AuthorityBill that has been presented by my good Friend, RohithaBogollagama.

While I basically take the liberty to say that it is a step inthe right direction, I am thinking whether it is a waste of timebecause when you read the newspapers today, you see Mr.Wimal Weerawansa saying. Send Norway home and on theother side Thamilselvan saying. We are ready for war. So

whether we have got to bring the National EnterpriseDevelopment Authority Bill to Parliament or whether toensure that we have got to get our people ready for war is thequestion that we have got to ask at the at the moment. But,sir, irrespective of that I think, There is something whichneeds to be looked at I am sure, Rohitha with his experiencewould find that there are may lacunas in this system. Thoughit is something which is necessary, what is the purpose ofbringing this Bill as of today, when you have a similar thinthrough the BOI the EDB and the IDB basically covring thesame areas? Now if you are going to abolish all of them andthen substitute this, then it is not a problem. But then youhave duplication of authorities then you are only wastingyour time. I am sure the Hon. Minister would look at this .And guiss that this is not somethin done in haster. If is toreawaken the slumber of the bureaucracy and if that is thecase I have no debate on that but frankly it is an absolutewaste of public funds. If you say, Yes this is going to supplantthe existing one. then we are not at cross purposes.

Monstrously But, today the BOI is in a monstrous bylethargic situation. And you have got a Chairman, Mr.Lakshman Watawala, an effficient and able man, once againfrom the United National Party. You are today faced with adifficult situation basically. How can we project this countryoverseas? That is the problem that is there. So, Hon. Minister,you have the BOI. Sections 16 and 17 of the Greater ColomboEconomic Commission Law, No. 4 of 1978 help not onlyforeign companies - like your colleagues in the Government,the JVP will basically assist you in marketing the country -but also Sri Lankan Companies to go forward.

Then the next thing is the EDB. What is going on at theEDB? Nothing is happening. And I hope it is under yourpurview. I donot think so becaues if it is, you would havereawakened the UNP spirit. But what has happened? TheEDB is dead. Then if you take the IDB, the IDB was there tobasically do exactly what this Act is seeking to do. But if theIDB is not doing that then there is somethin wrong with thesystem.

, . , . , . - - . . . ? , - - .

Once again it is an economic war. If we win the economicwar we have won all wars. But if you lose the economic war,we have lost all wars and that is where we are heading. Sir, asI said, I do not want to labour on what ou mentioned becauseyou have aptly mentioned all. What you the objectives ofthis National Enterprise Development Authority Bill? InClause 13, it states, I quote:

2006 08483484

(a) stimulate the growth, expansion and development of SriLankas economy by encouraging, promoting and facilitatingsmall and medium enterprise development within Sri Lanka;

(b) Stimulate and encourage the establishment and operationoutside Sri Lanka of enterprises designed with a view tointernationalize domestic enterprises capable of penetratingforeign markets for the fulfillment of the objectives of thisAct,

But the need of the hour is with regard to small and mediumenterprises. Small and medium enterprise - then what is stated inClause 13 (b) . You cannot penetrate intothe intenational market without even getting a foothold inthe local market. I salute you, if you are looking at supplantingthis for IDB, EDB and the BOI. Let us look at this. Thisshould have been brought before the select Committee hereand said, This is the way that we want to bring the investmentsinto this country. Then, we could have responded to it. Let ustake the Philippines for example. The Board of Investment inthe Philippines will tell you in one week, We want theinvestment or do not come. It is the same with Malaysia andThailand. When you come to Sri Lanka you and I know thesituation - Here, to bring in investments you take three monthsto get the application, six months to get a land and one yearto get an environmental certificate. By that time the companythat is willing to invest here will already be producing inThailand. That is what you have to realize. You have gotjokers in your party who have come from other parties whichare supporting your Government. Do you think that they willhelp you to bring investment? The little that is there also . Sir. , ? . . . . . ? . . . ? ?

So, I do not want to labour on this matter further becausethere are many other matters that need to be taken up. Hon.Minister, before this is put into actual operation please ensurethat you call all the parties and ensure that we look at thenational economy of this country. There is no point in wastingtime. Even if you go beyond the objectives as I said, how canyou ensure that you can compete with the overseas investorswhen the interest rates are 14 per cent to 15 per cent on smalland medium industries? Inflation is 16 per cent. There isunemployment in this country. There are more than 30,000to 40,000 jobs in the Free Trade Zone at Katunayake. Youand I know it. But where is the unemployment factor? It isshown as 10 per cent. But unemployment problem is takingplace regionally. So, ensure that matter is also looked at beforewe waste time on this National Enterprise DevelopmentAuthority Bill, Sir.

Then you are booking at another important matter today Iam taking up this matter in the context of economy becauseat the end of the day, you must have an economy that issound and stable. Also business acceptance should be therebefore you have any investment in place. You have theAuditor-General. You and I served on the COPE We are stillthere. Look at the indictment that comes from the AuditorGeneral. You know that he is not a person who basicallyshouts at whims and fancies of anybody. He is a man forhimself. There is an article published in The Sunday Timesof 5th March 2006 with the heading Shameful indictmenton Government institutions. Where is this happening? Weare basically moving out from CPI - Corruption PerceptionIndex which is maintained in Berlin-from 67 to 78 . . . ,2000 . . . . ? . . , . ? ? . He isindependent. This has got to be looked at, Sir. We the UnitedNational Party request that we have at least a three to fourdays Debate on this matter to ensure that we look at thesetypes of things. You and I - basically the SLFP the PA and theUNP are democratic parties. We can get things movingforward. You cannot have extremist and chauvinistic guywho have no love for the country. That is what you have gotto look at. So, please ensure that this matter is looked at . . . . . Operation room . . . . . . . ?

National Audit Commission . I think this isnot a matter only before you and I. We all have a responsibility,Hon. Minister to Ensure that we bring this matter before theCabint and the National Audit Commission is put in placebefore long.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Hon. Member, you may table it so that we can have a lookat it.

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake )Certainly. Not only that. You look at the letter that hascome from the Secretary to the Ministry and Planning ofFinance. Dr. P. B. Jayasundara is I would say very much aprofessional person. But he is trying to stymie the setting upof the National Audit Commission. There is a document thathas been sent out which I got from the Ministry of Financeand Planning. It says that it is necessary to subject the Auditor-Generals Department also to an independent audit. What onearth is this? In what country does this happen? It is somethinglike we should have another higher court to judge the ChiefJustice of the Supreme Court. Can you do this? . . We have to establish the National AuditCommission. This involves a party mechanism. You and Ihad been in the committee. When Mr. John Amaratunga wasthere as the Chairman it was he who initiated this.Unfortunately time ran out for us. But when this was proposedto the World Bank and the IMF, one thing we said was that wewill ensure that the economy is not tinkered with. That waswhat we wented. Please ensure this is done.

Then the next matter is the cost of living. I want to go intothese one by one, but due to lack of time - I know there isanother half an hour for me - I want to more on quickly

. , ? , We like the coun-try, but we hate the people . , , . . . ? , . . ? , ; ; 350 ; . . . . ; ; . ? . . . , .Today the CEB has a liability of Rs. 110 billion. The CeylonPetroleum Corporation has a liability of Rs 82 billion. Thereis an overseas company here, the Indian Oil Corporation,where Rs. 8 billion is outstanding. It is the same with PrimaCeylon Limited where the outstanding amount is Rs. 7.2billion. In the case of the Ceylon Fertilizer Company Lim-ited there is Rs. 8 billion not paid to the suppliers. Then,Sathose is having a mark up of 1 per cent and a cost of 8 percent. What economic logic is this You have got an amiableCabinet Minister, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa whogoes before the media. I am sure he can make use of thissituation. This is the new logic. Sathosa is having a profit aprofit of 1 per cent, a cost of eight per cent and the country isexpected to have a ten per cent ecomomic growth. Who istalking this rubbish ? 1 , 8 , 10 . ? ? ? . . . 11 . . . . . . . , , , . Remember that isthe strength we are extending as a party that has got 47 lakhsof votes. That is a commitment we have and that is the stylewe adopt in taking this country forward. We know things arehappening. We are there to ensure that we take the countryforward.

Then, Sir, look at the Free Trade Agreements, the IndianFree Trade Agreement the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle wastelling about the problems he has with India. I share his viewson the problems. I do not want to be mincing words becauseI know the problems he has. When you have Free Trade Agree-ments and there are people diametrically opposite trying tooppose that type of thing how can there be an Indian FreeTrade Agreement? Regarding the USE Free Trade Agree-ment, people said, We do not want the Free Trade Agreement.Now what are we going to do for the 66 per cent of textilesexported? Then the WTO, they made such a big noise. At themeeting we had in Cancun we placed Sri Lanka on the map.Back again they came and ridiculed us. At the end of the day

what happened? You went to Hong Kong on bended kneesand you went even further than we did. The world is chang-ing and that is why we say that you have to be in with this.

Then regarding the labour GSP, the hon. Prof. G. L. Peirisand I on the instructions of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghewent to Brussels and got the labour GSP. The benefits camein our administration but the final benefit came in your ad-ministration. But what has happened, Sir? Today you havethe labour GSP which at least has exports going to Europe ata concessionary duty entry. That is under threat.

I read your statement today and I am happy that once againthe UNP is awakened and has things to be done there-Rohitha dismisses fears but Apparved industries worried.Remember Ashroff Omars Brandix Apparel Limited,Amaleens apparel industries all are worried. What you say isnot what is happening. You by yourself cannot do this. Thatis why I say, do not let us lose this GSP opportunity.

Then you were also talking of borrowing Us Dollars 1000million in order to pay off the debts of this country. Today Ihave got a document that was tabled in Parliament by theHon. Minister of Finance which refers to the amortization ofthe year 2006 - that is capital repayment and the interestpayment which is rouhgly Rs. 455 billion. So, is it that thisGovernment is going to borrow US Dollars 1000 million inorder to pay this Rs. 455 billion and put the country into adebt trap? Please stop playing with the economy. This iswhat happened to Taiwan. This is what happened to Thai-land and this is what happened to Korea in 1996. You borrowmoney at 6 per cent whan your earnings are at 2 per cent andfall into a debt trap. We are warning you today. Please do notplay with the national economy of this country. The value ofthe US Dollar is sliding. Now it is Rs. 103. When we handedover the government it was Rs. 97. If you are unable to dealwith this type of national debts that are taken with foreignreserves increasing you will never be able to stop the Valueof the US Dollar even at Rs. 120. When that happens it is notthe Government but it is the entire country that has to pay forthis.

So, I am basically warning you from a national point ofview, from a countrys point of view and from the point ofview of the United National Party. We as responsible peoplehave feelings please do not let these things happen. If youare unable, say we cannot, yes, we duped the people. But donot play around with the economy. Let people shriek. Letthem stop at that. But ensure that the country goes forward.

Then, Sir, I come to an important statement which hadbeen referred to in the news papers, a statement that had beenmade in Parliament yesterday and basically a big noise hadbeen made by Mr. Wimal Weerawansa. Mr. Wimal Weerawansamade this statement with absolute lack of responsibility andforgetfulness of his memory of the past. . .

489490

. , . . . . . , , . , . As you know with the Governmentthen, we basically sense of unity with brought a nationalperspective. We thought that the North-East problem wassomething which is inimical to the country and on that basiswe said, let us look at going transcending Political differ-ences and move forward. But, then there was the JVP and theJathika Hela Urumaya that made a big noise. One signed- . . . . . , . , , . , , ?

. . . ( )

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake )Sir, under the Standing Orders, you can basically bring upmatters related to the topic that you are speaking and on thatbasis I am speaking. It is related- ? ? ? ? . . . ? Remote Control . , , . . () , . . . . . 1000 .

. . . . , . , 50,000 . . . . . . . . , .

I quote from the Agreement with Mr. Tylvin Silva. signed bythe then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa during the timehe was a presidential Candidate Sir, paragraph two of theAgreement says, I quote;

2. We believe that it is necessary to have negotiations not only withthe LTTE but also with all other relevant parties to resolve Sri Lankasnational question and that without being agreed on such lasting solutionit is agreed hereby not to grant Interim Self-governing Authority orany such political or administrative structure to LTTE or to holdnegotiations with LTTE on that basis.

Then Sir, paragraph four of the Agreement is relevant to myquestion, otherwise the hon. Member will ask what relevancehas this got with national enterprise development. yes,national enterprise development is basically reducing cost.Reducing costs means having no war. Then, no war means weare coming to the Ceasefire Agreement. If the CeasefireAgreement is abrogated then there is war. Then you will ask,where is my 20 per cent interest? why have the costs gone

2006 08491492

up? Now, do you understand the logic of the United NationalPary? Hon. Minister Rohitha Bogollagama knows what weare talking about. He talks; we talk and get things done beforeyou know what happened So, be careful. It would be better ifyou also restrain yourself and be in a more amenable situationrather than being a jumping jackass. Sir, it says, I quote:

4. It is agreed hereby that in considering the harmful and prejudicialeffects and other serious implications of the Ceasefire Agreement thatwas entered and signed by the then prime Minister Mr. RanilWickremasinghe and LTTE on 22nd February 2002, the said agreementshall be reviewed and revised fully and the said agreement shall becompletely redone on removing and eliminating all the clauses whichare prejudicial and harmful to the national security and foster andnurture separatism and are inconsistent with the Constitution of SriLanka.

This is the Agreement of the JVP signed with His ExcellencyMahinda Rajapaksa. Then Sir, look at the statement that wasmade by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the person who ledthe delegation. The delegation consisted of Hon. JeyarajFernandopulle, Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ashraff, Hon. RohithaBogollagama and many others. In the opening statement ofHon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, it was mentioned; It isprejudicial to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of theRepublic of Sri Lanka. You are talking of the CeasefireAgreement and then you basically come out with a jointstatement. Today, the JVP and JHU are just splitting hairssaying that there was no such agreement. I am asking whatMr. Champaka Ranawaka, Mr. Udaya Gammanpilla, Mr.Wimal Weerawansa, Mr. Somawansa did in the operationsroom at Temple Trees eating thosai masalavadai. . . , . . , We are asking, onwhat basis are they saying this? Is it just because the LocalGovernment elections are around the corner that these peopleare shouting? Why are they trying to make life difficult forthe President? Here we of the United National Party areextending support from the Opposition to the President, whentheir own parties are opposing. . , . . . . ? . , ? , , . ? , . . , . ? . . . . ? .

, . .

I quote the Daily Mirror newspaper of 8th March. 2006:

Q: Did you or did you not agree to amend the DFA?

A: We were totally against the CFA. WE still are. As a Muslim, I cansay that we were not even identified as a separate community in theagreement. There is mention as this other community in the preamblebut thereafter nothing!

Then it goes further, I quote: the third question:

Q: So why has it be come so difficult for the government to place itsconcerns with regards to the CFA and amend it?

A: We are all for amending the CFA! But in reality it is not possibleto amend it straight away.

So, whom are you trying to hoodwink? You got a mandatefrom the people to abrogate this . , . , , . , . . , . , ? ? , . .

I think the hon. Member Ravi Karunanayake, my goodFriend, has fast become the sole voice of the United NationalParty. I congratulate him on that. At the same time certainaspersions were cast on the peace initiative that has beentaken by His Excellency the President, during the speechmade by my good Friend.

If there are any questions that the hon. Member wishes usto respond to from the Government Benches I would like todo so in terms of the peace process keeping in line with theUnited National Partys thinking on the matter.

Sir, I was a party to the All Party Conference that was heldon Monday of this week where the United National Party ledby its Deputy Leader, hon. Karu Jayasuriya endorsed the stepsthat have been taken by the President in initiating the peace

process. Also, all the parties joined in endorsing and acceptingthe formulas that we have been working on. So if there areany specific issues on which the hon. Member from the UNPbenches wishes the Government to respond, to in line withthe serious engagement now we have made to bring aboutlasting peace in the country, I would like the hon. Member tohave structured questions put across to us, so that we will beable to respond to from the point of view of the Government.

Then Sir, in relation to the three issues that were raised inline with what I have submitted in the National EnterpriseDevelopment Authority Bill about the BOI, the EDB and theIDB, I wish to state that they are distinct and seperateorganizations, institutions that are meant to service certainaspects of different areas other than that of the SME Authority.Thereby I think the hon.

( )( - )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of PlanImplementation)Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me thisopportunity to speak on this very important Bill that hasbeen brought forward for the entrepreneurs of this country. Imust congratulate the Hon. Minister for the interest he hastaken in the entrepreneurship development of the Sri Lankanentrepreneurs with special mention of the small and mediumenterprise sector. The Mahinda Chintana has also givenvery special pride of place to the Sri Lankan businessmenand the industrialists with special notification in regard tothe small and medium enterprise sector.

The Sandhanaya Government fully conscious of the needto develop and uplift this sector has consistently over thelast two budgets made special mention and provision for theupliftment of this sector. The last year saw the formation ofthe Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank - SMEBank as it is popularly known - with a special feature thatwhile the entrepreneur has to go to the bank for any loans,this bank did not wait for the entrepreneur to come to itsdoorstep but sent its business development officers to thebusiness people to evaluate their businesses, the businesspotential and to offer them help by way of a business plan oreven finances without any need of security. The security, Mr.Deputy Speaker, was only the viability of the project. That isthe type of thing the Sandhanaya Government envisagedand as stated by the previous speakers there may be a fewhitches in the implementation. But by and large I can tellyou having worked in that Ministry for one year, generallythe progress of the SME Bank has been very satisfactory forwhich I must congratulate not only the Hon. Minister butalso his staff in the Ministry who have spared no pains toensure the success of the bank. Unfortunately today we hadto listen to many things not connected to the NationalEnterprise Development Authority. They spoke of the peaceprocess, the cost of living, though there were attempts tojustify it by saying that all these are connected to the NationalEnterprise Development Authority. We heard about theGeneva talks, questions on the Geneva talks. Now on theGeneva talks, I was present at the All Party Conference heldon Monday and the hon. Karu Jayasuriya, deputy leader ofthe United National Party was present and gave his supportto the peace process and did not refer to any of the concerns

raised by one of the previous speakers here. But I am notsurprised because that shows the division within the UnitedNational Party where one section of the party does not knowwhat the other section is doing. Here -

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake)Sir, there is a reference that is being made on the Floor ofthis House by the Hon. Deputy Minister attributed to theUnited National Party. The Leader of the Delegation, theHon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, a responsible person wouldbear testimony that the deputy leader of the United NationalParty under the guidance of the Party made a statement andthere is no pre-fabrication of things that have got to be donehere. If he wants to solicit assistance of the United NationalParty, do not distort facts. They have hoodwinked the peopleof this country, they try to hoodwink the international com-munity, do not try to hoodwink the UNP. He has got to eitherwithdraw that statement, or the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva,who is handling a very difficult situation trying to dexter-ously balance the LTTE, the Government and the Opposi-tion will basically not see any support comingforth if thistype of distortion and deliberate lies are stated.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Minister you may continue.Hon. Member, you have not raised a point of Order. You aremaking a statement hon. Member. If you want, you raise apoint of Order. You just made a statement of facts.

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)The Hon. Member has been - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)Under what Standing Order did you raise this point ofOrder? - [Interruption.]

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

You have not raised a point of Order.

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake)The statement he made is incorrect.

2006 08519520

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Under what Standing Order are you making the point ofOrder?

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake)The statement he made is incorrect. There is no truth -

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)What is the incorrect statement?

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Minister, do you take responsibility for yourstatement?

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)Yes, I take responsibility.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Okay. You may continue.

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake)And he takes full responsibility. Hon. Nimal Siripala deSilva who is seated silently would bear testimony that theUnited National Party took cognizance of the fact and this isa deliberate lie that you told Parliament.

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)The amount of untruths you have told, I can now show -[Interruption.]

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Deputy Minister, you may continue - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)The amount of untruths you told on the Floor of the House- [Interruption]

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Deputy Minister, you may continue your speech.

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)Yes. Sir, there were statements made, I am happy that theyare always talking of the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama as beinga member of the UNP. It is now that they have realized theimportance of the Hon. Minister. I am sure they have notforgotten the way they unceremoniously sacked him fromthe party but justice prevailed and the Supreme Court restoredhis membership.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Minister, you should stick to the subject withoutgetting into unnecessary complications

( )(The Hon. Hussein Ahamed Bhaila)I am just answering the hon. Member, Mr. Deputy Speaker.Earlier when the Hon. Speaker was in the Chair. Extraneousmatters were raised by the Opposition and this matter wasalso raised. But in any event in deference to you. I willcontinue with my speech on the subject.

Now let us look at the objectives of the National EnterpriseDevelopment Authority. It is to stimulate the growth,expansion and development of Sri Lankas economy byencouraging, promoting and facilitating the small andmedium enterprise development within sri Lanka. Is this thesort of thing that the Opposition is opposing? Is theOpposition opposing the development of an Authority tofacilitate the small and medium sector?

The previous speaker spoke about Brandix ApparelLimited and Mahesh Amaleen and Ashroff Omar going toIndia to set up factories. Here we are talking of stimulatingand encouraging the establishments outside Sri Lanka ofenterprises designed to internationalize the domesticenterprises. Are they objecting to our trying to develop othersmall industries, small businessmen going abroad to workfor the country, to get money for the country? Is it that theywant to keep it within a cartel of a few multinationalbusinessmen or a few big businessmen in Sri Lanka at theexpense of small and medium entrepreneurs of this country?This is wht I fail to understand.

We heard people talking about the thosais and the vadaisbeing eaten at Temple Trees. Yes, I am sure they would not behappy because they are the fish and steak eating people whodo not want our small thosai and vadai eating people tocome forward. These are the facts which remain even today.

[ ]Mr. Deputy Speaker, the growth of the economy of anycountry depends to a larger extent on the business sector.The establishment of the National Enterprise DevelopmentAuthority will help to stimulate growth and development ofthis country.While congratulating the Hon. Minister for bringing thislegislation, I wish the Hon. Minister all success in hisendeavous to uplift the economy of the country and Icommend this Bill to the House.Thank You.

issues in Geneva? If you could raise such issues in Genevawhy cannot I ? You have not learnt lessons from Dr.Balasingham who taught you political science for two dayscontinuously? You have still not learnt your lessons. Youwant to live in extreme ignorance. If that is the wish, you canlive in ignorance. Be careful of all what I say. Every word ofmine is measured. we are not here to stimulate a kind ofhatred. What was our JVP Friend saying yesterday? He saidthat we have not honoured and all such things. He speaks ofsovereignty of the country. What is the sovereignty? There isno sovereignty when you speak of Sri Lanka. This is an islandconsisting of two sovereign nations.

Remember the words I uttered. Theyare all prophetic utterances. I am a man who have been in thispolitical game for the last 50 years, brought up and nurturedby Chelvanayakam. This Chandrasiri our friend - - He dared to tell the educationists, Youhave to behave well. Your children cannot go out and doanything or get onvolved in any kind of study. Our schoolsare blocked, shattered to pieces. Children are killed in schoolsand colleges. How many schools and colleges do not functionin Tellippallai, Mavitapuram, and in Mathagal?

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Mr. Eelaventhan, can you please on the subject matter thatis on Debate?

. . ( )(Mr. M. K. Eelaventhan)If you do not allow us to speak in a free way we will cometo a place where we have already challenged and createdscenes. We want to be democratic. We believe in democracy.We believe in decorum. We believe in decency. We believein discipline. But we do not want to be suppressed andoppress our facts. You want to kill and butcher our people.You are forcing us to enter into violence. Violation of humanrights will lead to violence. Violence breeds violence, re-member Sir. You are a Buddhist. I think, you are a Buddhist.If that is so, where does Buddha damma say Kill the Tamils,but do not kill animals? Your Mahawamsa justifies that, Sir.This is Buddha Adharma. I am sorry. This is what we aretrying to teach you. We will not succumb to the pressuremoves of any of the Sinhala hoodlums. I want to make it veryvery clear. We are not to create scenes here. We love ourSinhalese brethren.

Are you prepared to take action against this Chandrasiriwho has created enough problems? I am afraid his conduct isgoing to be a total embarrassment to the Hon. MahindaRajapaksa. Mahinda is trying to pose as a gentleman. Whetherhe is a gentleman or not, only events will tell us. I thinkChandrasiris conduct and the conduct of the other person,Wanni Arachchi in Chavakachcheri are creating havoc. People

live in perpetual fear. Our dearest children who are at the ageof 10 and 15 cannot go to school. They cannot stay at home.My house at Colombothurai is surrounded by the armedforces. So this is the fate of the MPs.

How many years ago, Kiruhanthi a student, her mother, herbrother and her neighbour were killed? I cannot mention theway the girl was killed. As an old man I cannot mention theinhuman way this girl was butchered. So why are you silent?Only the court can decide. Why is there an undue delay onthe Kiruhanthis case? Who is Kiruhanthi? A student. Herbrother was also a student. You have done the worst and aretrying to justify it. I can understand the back bench MPsindulging in this, Sir. I give you respect as a man of somecalibre with an academic background. Your behaviour shouldbe better than their depreciatory behaviours. We feel deeplypained by this kind of behaviour.

I get back to my main speech. We are worried about theTRO people. Seven people have gone missing in the last onemonth. Nothing is heard of them. Why are you silent andwhy are the mass media who speak of democratic rights,freedom of the press silent? Comments are free. Facts aresacred. What is the Daily Mirror doing? What is TheIsland doing? What is the Daily News - the voice of theGovernment - doing? Why are they suppressing facts?

What I say is- [Interruption] No. I amnot blaming the Auditor-General but look at this article. Theyhave taken certain parts of the report and are trying to tarnishthe image of the Supreme Court Judges, trying to tarnish theimage of the Speaker and trying to tarnish the image of thePresident.- [Interruption] No, no.

( +)(Mr. John Amaratunga)You will never get the co-operation of the Auditor-General.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)We are with the Auditor-General. We want him toinvistagate. He has done a very good job. We have tostrengthen him. There is no question about that but what Isay is that certain things which have happened have happenedeven under your regime. But you try to highlight this assomething which has been done by this Government.

( +)(Mr. John Amaratunga)I also that it happened during our time as well but it is now our dutyto take remedial measures.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)Yes. So, Let us get together and do that. We are there tostrengthen the Auditor-General. Let us bring in whateverlegislation that is necessary. At the same time, let us strengthenthe institutional aspect, Sir, whereby , the Government is notat cross swords wih your views. We have to make the necessarymodels to ensure that these things are invistagated and at thesame time, the necessary punitive measures are being taken.But, of course, to publish articles of this nature, to take certainextracts and highlight only a few things and put names inthis manner, I think is not fair by the Supreme Court Judges,by the Parliament. For example the Commissioner of Electionshas been doing a very good job and he is a very dedicatedpublic servant. This article under the subheading ElectionsDepartment states, I quote:

Rs. 825,000 at the rate of Rs. 1,000 per day had been paid for15 days to 55 foreign Observers. However the particulars ofthe observations of five Observers were not made availableto audit officials.

This article has been published as if the whole ElectionsDepartment is corrupt. Under very difficult circumstances,the Elections Department had been performing a good job.But, at the time, we have to appreciate it. This wil demoralizethe Elections Commissioner and other people. There are otherthings which have to be highlighted. It is the duty of theAuditor-General to highlight even smalll matters. But whatthis article has done is-

( +)(Mr. John Amaratunga)That is a matter for of the news paper.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)That is what I say. They are creating this problem. That willdemoralize the Elections Department. What can the poorElections Commissioner do about the fleet of 44 whicleswhich had been deployed during the period 19th March to8th April 2004?

58 . . , . , . 18 . . . . . , . . , Country Financial Accountability Assessment Study . . . key findings ?

Parliamentary control of the public purse has become ineffectiveand does not currently meet the expectations set in the Constitution.

. , . , . .

This can be restored by strengthening the oversight functionprovided by the public accounts and public enterprises committees(COPA and COPE) and establishning a standing committee to focus onthe annual budget. The recent initiative taken by the COPE to probeinto the performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board is noteworthy inthis regard.

. . . .

The accountability of the executive at present is too focused onspending to budget, rather than on managing for results.

. . . FR AR . . . .

. Auditor-General . .

The public audit function does not currently meet the standardsexpected of the auditing profession, and consequently, its impact onfinancial accountability is below its potential.

, , motivation - - .

( +)(Mr. John Amarathunga)

Quality people.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama)

Yes, quality people. And this is what they are recommending.I quote further:

This can be strengthened by making the Auditor General moreindependent of the executive and by building his capacity to providemore relevent audit information to Parliament.

. , , . . . . , , . , . , .

.

The lack of clarity over the accountability relationships of thecentral, provincial and local governments and financial reporting andoversight arrangements not being well aligned to the needs of a moredevolved system of governance.

So this is the reality. You know that. You know the level ofauditing that is going on is the Central Government. There ishardly any auditing in the Provincial Councils and I would

2006 08555556

say that there is no auditing whatsoever in the PradeshiyaSabbhas. So we are creating an environment. hon. Membr,which I know you will appreciate, where we are creating thebackground for corruption. We are looking at so manyantiquated laws. We do not know who is going to enforcethise laws. Consequently I fully agree with the Auditor-General that we are creating an environment in which therecan be a lot of corruption and maladministration and wehave to seriously look at it.

Now what is the burden of this study? What is the burdenof their song?. The burden of their thinking is that Parliamentshould think more of the performance aspect of Government.i think all of us, whichever side of this isle we sit on, are moreand more worried about the handouts we are going to give.We are more and more worried whether these handouts areactually delivered. If you look at some of the interventionsmade in this House, that was also the theme of the song, thatthe Government has allocated these funds but they are notgoing. But now we have to move to a different type of auditwhich is a performance oriented audit. So I am very gratefulto you for raising this matter,Madam. I give you the assuranceon the part of the Government that we will not countenancecorruption and maladministration.

Already I have proposed some measures to the Cabinat sothat those gray areas where people can use their authority tomake money will be reduced. I can give youan assurance thatwe are fully committed and I am willing to believe that youare also committed to create a better environment becausefinally corruption is a tax on the poor man.

( +)(Mr. John Amarathunga)And it increases the cost of living - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)Yes. it increases the cost of living and corruption does notaffect the rich man. In fact he welcomes it. Or course richpeople are your supporters. that is a different matter.

( +)(Mr. John Amarathunga)That is not one sided.

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)No, I was teasing you. But the fact of the matter is thatwhen there is corruption and maladministration you will agreethat it is the poor man who has to pay the price. so, I thinkirrespective of our political divisions - they are also becomingless and less from what I understand - we must all get togetheerand try to solve this problem. Thank you very much.
