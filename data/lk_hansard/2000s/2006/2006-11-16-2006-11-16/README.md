2007 2007 +ENGLISH TEXT OF THE BUDGET SPEECH - 2007

Section I

Mr. Speaker, I am presenting this Budget having completedone year of implementation of economic policies based onMahinda Chintana, which is designed to empower ourselvesthrough our own initiatives, based on our own initiatives. Itaims at increasing the income of the poor and the regions ata far more rapid pace than that achieved in the past, andplaces its thrust on building a strong economy with socialjustice. Many of our commitments and developmentinitiatives were put into practice through the 2006 Budget.However, right from the inception our Government confrontedmany challenges affecting our performance.

In spite of our sincere commitment to pursue a negotiatedpolitical settlement, the LTTE resorted to increas violence afew days after I was elected and continued to engage inprovocative actions including the killing of over 70 civiliansin kebithigollewa, many suicide attacks, forcible closure ofthe Mavil Aru anicut and attacks on security forces. Althoughthese acts warranted calibrated defensive responses to protectcivilian lives, public property and national security, we haveremained steadfast to our commitment to peace. We havesuccessfully persuaded all democratic political parties to worktogether towards addressing genuine grievances of the Tamilpeople of our country. The political consensus reached withthe Opposition on common concerns pertaining to our countryhas given new hopes to our people. It is only the LTTE whichhas still not entered this process that respects human rightsand democracy. Therefore, I once again request the LTTE togive up violence altogether, surrender arms, and restore themutual trust that our communities enjoyed and work towardspromoting peace, democracy and development, in the interestof building a new Sri Lanka. Our Government values theefforts of the international community to endeavouring topursue the LTTE in this direction and we are ready toreciprocate and continue with a dialogue to solve nationalproblems.

Increased violence compelled the Government to channelmore resources for security and humanitarian relief operations.Construction of houses, water supply schemes, power lines,roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and many entrepreneurialactivities have been denied in the conflict affected areasincluding Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Batticaloaand Trincomalee. Government officials and security forceshave faced many difficulties in sending humanitarianassistance and regular supplies of food and medicine to theinnocent people in the affected areas due to hostilities by theLTTE, denying basic needs and human rights of the affected.

Mr. Speaker, economic challenges were too formidable.International oil prices escalated far beyond the affordability11 - PL 001602

139140

of our nation, which was struggling to recover from the effectsof the tsunami. The continued increase in oil prices whichexceeded US Dollars 70 per barrel by early this year put oureconomy on a great strain. The foreign exchange cost ofpetroleum imports alone is estimated to be around US Dollars2.2 billion - an increase of US Dollars 550 million in 2006alone. The Government also spent Rs. 25 billion for the fuelsubsidy in 2005 and a further Rs. 12 billion up to June 2006.In this background the Government ultimately had no choicebut to remove the VAT on diesel and kerosence and adoptcost recovery pricing in order to reduce unmanageable losses.Regrettably, people had to pay much higher prices for theirenergy needs, escalating the cost of living.

Another major challenge that our economy had to managewas the adjustment towards global competition. The apparelindustry is in the post Multi - Fiber Aggreement (MFA)transition and the impact of removal of restrictions is alreadyfelt. The challenges will be greater when restrictions on Chinaand Vietnam expire over the next two years. Many otherindustries are facing similar difficulties in sustainingindustrial competition due to domestic cost of fuel, electricity,transport and low productivity. Our country has also deepenedits commitment to free trade arrangements with India andPakistan, requiring our entrepreneurs to adjust to severecompetition. Our industries are also under threat from under- invoicing, dumping and cheap imports. All these have madea severe transitional burden to our economy.

Mr. Speaker, against all these odds there is a silver lining.Our people have collectively contributed towards generatingover 7 per cent growth in our economy this year, demonstratingresilience. This has been realized after 1978, generating fromagriculture, livestock, fisheries, manufacturing, constructionand a wide range of service activities. Growth is wide spreadin the country, including regions which are lagging behind.Benefiting from favourable weather, the increased fertilizersubsidy, removal of the flour subsidy and better farm - gateprices, framers have made our country self - sufficient in rice.Fruits, vegetables, poultry and fresh milk, have also shown asimilar trend reflecting prospects of being able to reduceimports of such commodities whilst also ensuring foodsecurity.

The manufacturing sector has generated around 6 per centgrowth. Production of food, beverages, chemicals, rubber,plastic and leather goods has grown over 6 per cent. Exportshave increased by 9 per cent. Exports represent manydiversified sources such as value added tea, fruit and vegetable,gem and jewellery, ceramics, high value garments, leatherproducts, software and a range of new export goods andservices. Total exports this year is expected to reach USDollars 6.9 billion. Machinery, equipment, constructionmaterial, other investment goods and intermediate goodsimports have increased considerably in support of higheconomic growth. Expansion of telecommunication, tourism,trade, transport, construction and financial services and ahigh growth in agricultural and industrial activities havereinforced each other to boost the service sector growth toover 6 per cent.

Mr. Speaker, all three revenue departments have madecommendable progress. Improved tax administration, bettercompliance and significant success in curtailing illicit liquor,cigarettes, smuggling and under invoicing have contributedto increase revenue by 22 per cent by September this year.We have embarded on a modernization programme of therevenue departments to strengthen the tax administrationand sustain the high revenue growth. Investigations are inprogress with regard to the scandalous VAT fraud which hastaken place during 2002-2004. The suspects have beenbrought to justice and proceedings will be concludedexpeditiously.

Timely action on investment decision making is importantto encourage investment. A Cabinet Sub - Committee hasbeen setup under my chairmanship to facilitate this process.I have also set up a high level committee to resolve investmentdisputes expeditiously. Sri Lankan Missions abroad are beingrestructured and strengthened to promote economicactivities, trade, investment and foreign employment. Foreigninvestment is expected to exceed US Dollars 600 millionduring this year. Total earnings from tourism are expected toexceed US Dollars 400 million. Our aim is to exceed USDollars 1 billion per annum from each of these two areas,within the next two years. Remittances from overseasemployment would reach US Dollars 2.4 billion, this year.The overall investment to GDP is expected to reach 28 percent, a further improvement from 26.5 per cent in 2005.Countrys inflows and outflows of foreign exchangetransactions are expected to generate a surplus of about USDollars 200 million in the Balance of Payments. The CentralBank commands US Dollars 2.5 billion reserves as at present.

A salutary feature in the present trend of development isthat unemployment has declined to around 6 per cent. Recentfigures indicate that creation of employment during this yearin the domestic agriculture, industry, construction and servicesectors is over 250,000. Moreover, around 200,000 peoplehave secured overseas employment. WE proposes to increasethe skills of those who are leaving for overseas employmentand to provide incentives for professionals providing servicesfor foreign currency, so that our economy can becomestronger, based on our own skills.

Mr. Speaker, Randora - the Governments megainfrastructure initiative is our priority. In this effort we havemade arrangements to commence the construction of thePuttalam coal power plant, Trincomalee coal power plant,Kerawalapitiya power plant and related infrastructure totransform all fuel based plants to generate LNG based power.Several hydro power plants and renewable energy sourceshave also been encouraged. We are working with ourdevelopment partners to accelerate early completion of thefour lane Southern Expressway and have begun theconstruction of the outer - circular expressway with threetownships in Kadawatha, Kottawa and Kaduwela, expansionof the Colombo Port capacity and the construction of a new

2006 16141142

port, the second International Airport and an InternationalConvention Centre. The Government is committed to build aNorthern Expressway and several other main roads andbridges in districts in the North and East to promoteTrincomalee as an investment and tourism zone. Thereconstruction of the tsunami affected coastal highway fromkatukurunda to Pothuvil and several other highwaysconnecting major townships are also in progress.

The Government also spent about Rs. 12,000 million, thehighest ever for rural infrastructure development programmessuch as Maga Naguma, Dahasak Maha Wav, new irrigationschemes and rural electrification programmes. The fertilizersubsidy of Rs. 11,000 million, paddy purchases of Rs. 2,900million, pharmaceuticals of Rs. 8,000 million, assistance toschool children of Rs. 3,600 million are also highest everexpenditure provided by any Government. The Governmenthad to provide funds to complete unattended andunderperformed post-tsunami reconstruction activities bycertain NGOs. As of date 62,000 houses have been completedand about 43,000 houses are under construction. The totalexpenditure for post-tsunami activities is around Rs. 9,200million. These programmes were not compromised althoughpressure was high due to increased expenditure on securityand humanitarian work, salaries, pensions and the fuelsubsidy.

Amidst several adversities and increased terrorist threats,we were able to successfully complete the South Asian Gamesand the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting in Augustand September this year. It was for the first time that such ameeting was held in Sri Lanka since the Commonwealth wasformed. These events demonstrated our capacity to host suchevents despite great difficulties in our country and alsoreflected our deep commitment to consolidate a democraticenvironment to promote development and peace.Nevertheless, we should not be complacent.

Cost of living Index has increased by an annual average of12 per cent. This is largely due to increased fuel prices andconsequential changes in the cost of transport and electricity.Increased salaries for Government employees and pensioners,the large credit expansion by the banking system to theprivate sector, increased taxation on wheat flour and severalimported agricultural products and the expansion inconstruction activities caused increased demand for material,labour and domestically produced agricultural commodities,resulting in high prices. Some of these changes were necessaryto encourage domestic production in place of imports andbuild a national economy. However, credit expansion on non-essential consumer items and demand pressure on prices needto be kept under close surveillance.

In dealing with inflationary the Central Bank increased itspolicy rates by 2.625 per cent and tightened the monetarypolicy. Treasury Bill rates were increased to sustain savingsand curtail consumption demands. Many domestic bankshave not balanced their credit expansion parallel with deposit

mobilization. Some banks are engaged in the unethicalpractice of maintaining higher spreads and margins. Havingobserved a rapid and uneven credit growth, the Central Bankincreased capital provisions for market risks, particularly fornon-priority retail lending and imports. Imposition of adeposit margin on selected non-priority items is a short termmeasure taken to reduce the import demand as well as theunwaranted credit expansion in the banking system.

In the absence of a proper institutional mechanism forgovernment intervention, market manipulations and anti-competitive practices have widespread. The closure of theCWE and the paddy Marketing Board and the rundown inthe cooperative system are reflected adversely in our marketstructure. The new Budget Shop concept which is basedon a private-public partnership arrangement was implementedto provide infrastructure facilities for suppliers to be able tooffer essential commodities at wholesale prices. Lak Sathosaoutlets are also being setup in several densely populatedareas to promote competition. Taking the advantage of thedownward trend in international oil prices the Governmentalso reduced the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs. 7-9 perlitre. The Government would continue to allow monthlyadjustments to retail prices of petroleum products in linewith international prices, under the supervision of the publicUtilities Commission.

Section IIA 10 Year Horizon - National Development Strategy

Mr. Speaker, this is a decade that a global commitment hasbeen made to achieve Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) - a commitment to eradicate poverty. This requiresus to formulate a long-term strategy based on a clear vision.When I presented the Mahinda Chintana to the people, myvision was to cerate a new Sri Lanka - a country with modernroads, ports and airports, water supply and irrigation,townships and community facilities, transport services,technology, skills and knowledge. Such physical and humaninfrastructure is essential to build a diversified economy thatwill take development beyond the Western province,eliminate poverty and promote a caring society with law andorder and an eco-friendly environment. (nille piruna kethak,bathen bulethen piri ratak)

Mr. Speaker, we must look at hard economic, political andsocial realities in our country. Most of our provinces remainpoor. Agriculture predominantly remains at subsistence leveland needs considerable diversification and modernization.Plantation sector needs productivity improvements and highvalue addition. Many production and service activitiesperform at suboptimum efficiency requiring technologicalinfusion, new skills, practical policy strategies andinfrastructure support. Educated youths are still not capableof securing gainful employment, compelling a reorientationof our education system to meet diversified skills demandsof our economy. Poverty is concentrated in eight districts inthe North and East, Six districts in the South and three

143144

districts in the plantation area. Colombo lacks infrastructureessential for a modern capital city. We must therefore formulatea more meaningful development strategy with localownership to make a change.

The centerpiece of this new will be the development ofmodern infrastructure throughout the country to provide abasis for development of agriculture, industry, construction,tourism, trade, financial and transport services that will bringabout new earning avenues and gainful employment to ourpeople. Over the next four years, our public investmentstrategy will provide about 5 per cent of GDP per annum forinfrastructure development. Private - public partnerships mustbe exploited in all sectors as this is not sufficient. Ourdevelopment strategy will aim at positioning Sri Lanka toinitiate providing a wide range of value added internationalservices. Prospects of promoting insurance, shipping,entrept trade, many logistic industries and petroleumexploration are particularly encouraging. The Governmentis in the process of preparing relevant agreements andregulations on environmental, production and geo- physicalaspects relating to petroleum exploration, to proceed withoil exploration by early 2007.

Empowering people at grass rootslevel is equallyimportant, if we are to succeed in poverty reduction. TheMahinda Chintana proposed Gama Naguma - an initiativeto empower the community. This is an initiative to adoptbottom-up programmes originating from communities,reflecting their needs. All such activities will relate to JanaSaba which will navigate rural development. A series ofrural development initiatives that are currently in operationneed to be refocused permitting the community to prioritizetheir needs objectively without political considerations.These initiatives will be monitored by community leaders toensure that a larger volume of resources are productivelyused for the betterment of the rural community. Re-balancingthe allocation of resources towards the development oflagging districts can also be achieved throuth this process.

Sri Lanka has traveled a long way towards creating aglobally integrated export oriented liberal economy.However, this process has brought about a combination ofpositive and negative results. The Mahinda Chintana becamean alternative development strategy mainly due to the failuresof certain policies followed during the past 30 years. Therefore,while recognizing the strengths of a globally - integratedeconomy, we need to re-engineer certain policies and createan incentive structure conducive to our country to be builton the strength of local resources and skills, in a competitiveenvironment.

Mr. Speaker, the Government spends approximately one -tenth of the revenue on salaries alone of the education service.While our country has achived commendable progress inhuman resources development, the contribution of educationfor economic development is challenged when degrees andother qualifications awarded through our education system

often do not meet national employment needs. As aGovernment, it is our responsibility to ensure that studentsin learning centres pass out with skills required to be able tocontribute to the national development process as well as tofurther their own career. Therefore, we need to change ourcurricula and engage university undergraduates ininternships for skills acquisition. Universities need to beimproved and made partners in implementing developmentprogrammes by using their research skills and talent.Technical and vocational education need to focus onproviding skills demanded by the domestic as well as theglobal economy.

We need a people-friendly administration. About 15 percent of Government revenue is spent to provideadministrative, regulatory and other extension services byministries and departments. The public service deliveryprogramme in agriculture, industry, livestock, fisheries andseveral other areas should be repositioned to be able torespond to public needs. The e-governance structure needsto integrate the public service delivery mechanism. Legalinfrastructure and the judicial structure should be geared toaddress laws delays and transaction costs associated withdispute resolution. All State enterprises should be compelledto perform at maximum capacity and contribute towardsdevelopment. The trade unions and the managementhierarchy should work together towards a total transformationin railways, petroleum electricity, water supply, postal andport services and bank to strengthen performance.

Sri Lanka has a vibrant and diverse private sector. It consistsof small farmers, fishermen, SMEs and the large corporatesector. While almost all commercial and production activitiesare open to the private sector, their expansion is constrainedby inadequate infrastructure, limited access to capital andthe high cost of finance. The success of private sector andgovernment sector development initiatives depends onsavings available for investment. A. ten-years strategy for thepromotion of the capital market and other financialinnovations has been formulated to generate more capital forinvestment. The Government needs to increase revenue toprovide infrastructure, develop human resources and othersupport services, reduce poverty and stabilize the economy.Towards this objective we have committed to a fiscaltransformation within a medium term budgetary frameworkto raise revenue to around 19 per cent, reduce the deficit to 5per cent and national debt below 85 per cent of GDP, by2009.

In summary Mr. Speaker, our long-term road map for SriLanka is to create and economy that will sustain over 8 percent annual growth over the next 10 years and raise incomeof our people to around US Dollars 3,000 per capita level. Itis an economy that will reflect a corresponding level ofincome even in the pover districts. The economy will havestrong connectivity within the courntry as well as across theglobal economy, particularly in the region. Through thisdevelopment process, Sri Lanka will be transformed into a

2006 16145146

knowledge -based economy. The country will not only beeconomically advanced, but will also create a society that isreligious and respects its culture, environment and the valuesystem, when it climbs the ladder of economic progress.

Underpinning this overall vision, line ministries and theMinistry of Finance and Planning have together formulateda discussion paper on the long-term development strategy tostimulate a wider debate on our development framework. Iam tabling this document so that Members of Parliament canuse the Budget debate to address related issues constructively.I request the professionals, private sector, Trade Unions andthe civil society also to devote their time and make acontribution to refine this strategy. Mr. Speaker, this is thefirst time that we are formulating a development strategythrough such a consultative process.

Section IIIThe 2007 Budget

Mr. Speaker, the 2007 Budget has been formulated withinthe 2006-2009 medium term framework, having recognizedsectoral priorities, needs of lagging regions and resourceconstraints. The entire regional development strategy,national infrastructure and human resource developmentprogrammes and other sectoral programmes have beenincorporated into this framework. However, multiple regionaldevelopment initiatives will be consolidated within fivepriority areas namely; rural roads, electricity, water supplyand irrigaion, housing and livelihood development. Theseprogrammes will be implemented by the relevant agenciesunder the overall co-ordination and monitoring so thatprovisions can be productively used while eliminating wasteand duplication. Priority will be given to complete activitieswhich have been already initiated by spending agencies,before venturing into new work. The unspent provisions willbe rolled over to the ensuing year to facilitate effectiveimplementation of our development programme.

Mr. Speaker, let me also mention that the persent positionof each of the proposals in the 2006 Budget is explained inAnnexure I hereto. Several of these proposals have beensuccessfully implemented but some have shown slowprogress. They will be completed on a priority basis in 2007.The overall fiscal performance of 2006 and related isues areexplained in the 2007 Fiscal Management Report, which Ipersent to the Parliament today.

Section IVProposals

Mr. Speaker, Government revenue in 2007 is estimated atRs. 584 billion against a total sum of Rs. 597 billsion forcurrent expenditure. Therefore, there is a deficit of Rs. 13billion in the revenue account. This is not desirable and mustbe eliminated.

I. Proposals to Reduce Expenditure* Mr. Speaker, the provision of salaries for education,healthe, important public services and national

security cannot be avoided. However, expenditureincurred on account of telephone and water bills,fuel, vehicle repairs and maintenance, furniture andequipment are far from satisfactory. Therefore, Ipropose a 2 per cent cut on such provisions.

* The losses of underperforming enterprises are farbeyond what the Govenment can afford. The relevantagencies must use their own assets to generate revenueand cut down 5 per cent of the provisions made forthem from the Treasury in 2007.

* Mr. Speaker, I propose to impose strict audits onprocurements relating to food, pharmaceuticals andfertilizer which cost over Rs. 30 billion. A specialaudit unit will be set up under the supervision of theAuditor Generals Department to undertake rise -based audits.

* Several people and the media have drawn attentionto many unfinished, partly completed and substandadwork connected with roads, rural tanks, market places,housing projects et cetera. Therefore, line agenciesresponsible will be required to complete such workfirst and ensure the full utilization of relatedprovisions before embarking on new projects. Releaseof funds for new projects will be made only upon thecompletion of such work.

* Rural level development work needs closersupervision to ensure that projects implemented byGoverment agencies, provincial councils and localauthorities are done in the interests of the community.I propoes to set up Peoples Vigilance Committeesconsisting of persons with high integrity and respectrecongized by the people within the relevant localarea, to monitor all such projects.

* The main development expenditure of eachDivisional Secretariat area has been identified toenable Divisional Secreatries and local ProvincialCouncils to steer development activities. All suchprojects will be implemented with communityparticipation to ensure that funds are usedproductively. Members of Parliament are requestedto use 50 Per cent of their, Decentralized Budget onroads, as rural development is our priority in 2007.

* I also count on around 8 per cent under expenditurein capital votes in 2007 on account of duplicationand rollover provisions to the next year.

II. Revenue Proposals1. Port and Airport Development LevyM. Speaker, Government has committed for a rapiddevelopment of Ports and Airpots over the next threeyears. I propose to increase the Port and AirportDevelopment Levy from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent so

147148

that local expenditure of theese projects can befinanced. However, I proposes to create aconcessionary rate of 2.0 per cent for selected plantand machinery imported for high value addingindustries and for pharmaceuticals.

2. Value Added Tax and Excise Special provision TaxThese two eaxes are expected to generate overRs. 306 billion in 2007. We have already colsedseveral loopholes that prevailed in the VAT system.In order to curtail leakages further, I propose to limitcreadit for input tax to actual input tax or to 85 percent of the output tax paid or allowable input tax,whichever is lower. VAT paid on motor vehicles willnot be allowed as input credit. I also propose that allgovernment agencies will withhold one-third of theVAT payable to contractors and other serviceproviders. Small suppliers operating below the VATthreshold turnover will not be liable for thiswithholding tax.

In order to mitigate the impact of undervaluation, Ipropose to raise the markup applicable in thecomputation of VAT and Excise (Special Provisions)Tax to 10 Per cent. The same mark-up will also bepresecribed for the computation of the CESSCarbonated drinks and paints will be liable to a 5 percent Excies Tax.

In order to broaden the VAT base, any small ormedimum business which is on the border of the VATthreshold of Rs. 1.8 million and is not registered forVAT purposes and continues to expand, I porpose tointroduce a 5 per cent non-refundable VAT on itsturnover for a period of there years or until turnoverreaches Rs. 2.5 million, whichever occurs earlier.

Income Taxation

This year, We have seen an increase in income tax revenueto 2.7 per cent of GDP from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2005. Wewill aim at raising this ratio to around 4 per cent to reach theSouth - East Asian level of income taxation. Therefore, Ipropose the following:

(a)At present insurance companes set off their lossesfrom life insurance business against the profits fromgeneral insurance businesse. I propose that these twooperations breated separately for tax purposes.

(b)In the interest of capital market development, Iconsider that every company should aim at adividend payout of 50 per cent ofprofit available fordistribution. In order to encourage all companies tomove in this direction I propose that any companywhth a dividend payout of less than one-third shouldbe taxed aat 15 per cent for the difference betweensuch one-third and the dividend paid out.

(c)In the 2006 Budget, I lowered the tax rate for smallcompanies generating a taxable profit of less thanRs. 5 million to 15 per cent. However, I propose thatthe applicable tax rate would be the normal rate, ifthe company is a subsidiary or an associate company.

(d)The Government loses about Rs. 4 billion byallowing income tax relief for specific loan lossprovisions in banking and financial institutions. Ipropose that loan loss provisions be limited topercent of outstanding loan amounts at the end ofthe tax year or to the actual provision for losses,whichever is lower.

(e)ESC can be set off against income tax. In order toexpand the tax base further, I propose to reduce thethreshold liability for ESC from Rs. 40 million to Rs.30 million. The three-year non-chargeability of ESCwill apply only in respect of manufacturingindustries. However, the set-off duration of ESCincreased from 3 years to 5 years to provide furtherrelief. ESC charged on wholesale and retail tradewill be reduced to 0.25 per cent other than on motorvehicles and liquor. ESC charged or retail leveldistributors will be reduced to 0.05 per cent.

(f)A tax free threshold of Rs. 600,000 will be introducedto provide relief particulary for medium scalepartnerships

(g)In order to promote Unit Trusts, stamp duty ontransactions involving units will be removed andincome from sale of shares will be exempt fromincome tax. ESC charged on Unit Trusts will bereduced to 0.5 per cent.

Passport and Visa fees

The Department of Immigration and Emigration hasexpanded its regional offices for the convenience ofapplicants in ourstations and in the normal course a passportcan be obtained within 10 days. Therefore, the nomal passportfee will be reduced from Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 2,500. Consideringthe cost involved with fast procession and scrutinizingdocuments, the fee on passports issued with one working daywill be fixes at Rs. 7,500.

A visa fee of US Dollars 10 per tourist visiting Sri Lankawill be imposed at the time of purchase of the air ticket andpenalties for violation of visa regulations will be increased.The fee charged on Dual Citizenship Certificates for SriLamkans living abroad will be reduced from about Rs.400,000 to Rs. 200,000 per family, provided a three-yearyear fixed deposit in foreign currency to a value exceedingUS Dollars 25,000 is made in a bank in Sri Lanka. No fee willbe charged if the value of a 3 (three-year) fixed depositexceeds US Dollars 50,000.

2006 16149150

provincial Council Revenue

The average revenue generated by provincial councilsduring the last several years is around 0.5 per cent of GDP. In2007 the related Government transfers are estimated at aroundRs. 100 billion as compared to their estimated revenue ofabout Rs. 20 billion. The devolved taxes and duties have notbeen fully exploited at provincial level. A realistic valuationneeds to be applied for the computation of rent for residentialand business premises by local authorities. The collection ofTurnover Tax by provincial councils needs to be improved. Ipropose to set up a close co-ordinated mechanism betweenthe provincial councils. The Finance Commission and theTreasury to assist provincial councils to raise revenue to atleast 1 per cent of GDP over the next two years. I target anadditional revenue of at least Rs. 2 billion in the next yearitself.

Collection of Tax in Default

Mr. Speaker, recognizing the difficulties faced particularlyby the small and medium business sector. I propose to waiveall penalties accrued on any tax in default for the past fiveyears and give a period of three years to settle all such arrearsin installments. Any party who fails to comply with thisarrangement will be liable to pay the full amount withpenalties.

Regional Infrastructure Developent Levy

In the context of serious infrastructure deficiencies, weneed to allocate more funds for the development of regionslagging behind. Therefore, I propose to impose a 2.5 per centlevy under the Finance Act in respect of motor vehicles ontheir value inclusive of all taxes and duties levied at thepoint of Customs. Transfer of money from those who canafford to purchase a motor car to those who cannot at leastfind even a days livelihood is our social responsibility. Anannual declaration will be made mandatory for all vehicleowners who have imported a vehicle on a concession or duty- free basis.

III. Incentives for Savings & Investment

With holding Tax on interest from Banks and FinancialInstitutions

Mr. Speaker, at present an interest income of Rs. 108,000and above is subject to a 10 per cent With holding Tax onindividual deposits. I propose to raise this Rs. 300,000 andreduce the tax rate to 5 per cent on interest where the totalincome is between Rs. 300,000 to 600,000. If the total incomeis in excess of Rs. 600,000, a 10 per cent With holding taxwill apply on the interest in excess of Rs. 300,000 to giverelief to those who are dependent on interest income.

Taxation of Terminal Benefits of Retiring Employees:

In order to provide relief for those who retire after 20Years of sevice, I propose to raise the tax - free threshold for

terminal benefits from Rs. 2 million to Rs. 5 million. The taxthreshold for others will be raised from Rs. 1 million to Rs. 2million. The tax slab will also be increased to ease the taxburden.

Tax relief to Employees Shares

At present capital gains and employment benefists fromshares owned by employees through Employee Share Optionsare taxed I propose to remove tax on both capital gains andemployment benefits to encourage employer-employeepartnership in their business development

Incentives for Professional

In my last Budget, I offered a tax concession forprofessionals to engage in foreign currency earnings..Exchange control regulations have been issued, enabilingprofessionals earning in foreign currency to open foreigncurrency accounts in our banks. I propose that expenditureincurred on acquiring international accreditations over andabove standard professional qualifications be allowed as adeductible expenditure to further enhance the internationalstanding of our professionals.

Bus Transportation

Private bus operators provide nearly 70 per cent of bustransportation services to commuter. I propose to exempt fromduty and VAT, the importation of a bus by any bus owner witha route permit to replace the bus being used. VAT on ticketmechines will be reduced to 5 per cent.

Housing

I propose to grant title and take steps to write-off loansabout 5,000 low income householders who have obtainedsuch loans from theNHDA. The 60,000 housing developmentinitiative to increase the number of houses for shanty dwellersin Colombo will be continued over the next three years.Shanty dwelling is also a common problem in several othermunicipal areas. Therefore, UN agencies. donors and non -governmental agencies will be invited to resolve housingconstraints of shanty dwellers in such areas. A contributionfrom shanty dwellers is also expected to reflect theirinvolvement. A scheme to rebate VAT and other local taxes inrelation to construction of social housing will be formulatedto encourage the private sector, donors and NGOs toparticipate in this process.

Health

Mr. Speaker, in order to promote the availability ofadvanced medical facilities within our country, I propose toreduce the VAT on high - tech medical equipment andmachinery to 5 per cent

Establishment of SPMC/ SPC managed drug stores

The cost of providing medicinal drugs to governmenthospitals is around Rs. 12 billion and is expected to rise eachyear. It is, therefore, proposed to set up SPMC.SPC managed

151152

drug stores to provide drug requirements of large hospitals.Such stores can also serve as pharmacies to the general publicto obtain essential drugs at competitive prices. The capacityof SPMC to supply essential drugs to hospitals will beincreased to reduce associated imports.

Imposition of Standards

The SLSI Import Certification Scheme will be expandedto ensure that sub-standard products will not enter the country.Regulations will also be put in place by the Food AdvisoryCommittee of the Ministry of Health relating to food itemsincluding all confectionary, chocolate - based products, fish,meat et cetera and products nearing the expiry date. A 5 percent Excise Tax will be imposed on environmentally harmfulpolythene bags to discourage the use of such products.

Promotion of Local Value Added Industries

Mr. Speaker, we encourage a high content of value additionin local businesses. In this regard, BOI approval in the futurewill be granted on the basis that duty - free imports to will belimited project related material which are not availablelocally in adequate quantities or in the required quality. SuchBOI projects will be granted a VAT deferment facility for thepurchase of material from local industries. A special foreigncurrency account will be opened by the Central Bank tofacilitate BOI companies to purchase inputs from localcompanies for payments in foreign currency.

Construction Industry

The construction of flyovers in Colombo and townshipswith 10,000 houses on a DBT basis have been assigned tothe local construction industry, placing trust on itscapabilities. I propose to increase the depreciation allowanceon machinery used in the construction industry from 12.5per cent to 25 per cent and to reduce the Withholding Tax ontheir construction fee from 5 per cent to 1 per cent so as toimprove their cash flow. Licensing requirements for theimportation of used construction machinery and equipmentwill be relaxed. The cess imposed on construction will becollected together with Withholding Tax on constructionfees in order to simplify teh collection procedure andstrengthen the Construction Industry Guarantee Fund. A jointskills enhancement programme will be implemented throughthe vocational training institutes and construction industryassociations to fill skills shortages. Construction companiesengaged in Government projects will be given dutyconcessions to import cement.

Consolidation of Lankaputra Development Bank

Mr. Speaker, in order to build a premier development bank.I propose to amalgamate by an Act of Parliament, all regionaldevelopment banks and the SME Bank with the LankaputraDevelopment Bank to ensure that the bank will have a capitalin excess of Rs. 5 billion. My vision is to raise its capital toRs. 10 billion within the next five years. The existing branchnetworks of the SME bank and regional development banks

and their employees will be absorbed into the LankaputraDevelopment Bank. Credit facilities provided by the NationalBudget to government agencies will be channeled tobeneficiaries through this bank network.

National Wealth Corporation

Mr. Speaker, prime Government properties are not fullyutilized in the development efforts of the country. Valuablelands are being allocated for various projects without gettingproper value. Government stake in privatized enterprises arenot well managed. On the other hand opportunities have notbeen created to secure income earning avenues for a majorityof our rural people and for those who retire from Governmentas well as from the private sector. I, therefore, propose to setup a National Wealth Corporation which will own prime landand other assets belonging to the Government and use suchassets to generate income. Sri Lankans will be permitted tobuy income units of this corporation with a minimum depositof Rs 500 that can be increased . A regular annual income inexcess of the prevailing Treasury Bill rate will be guaranteedby the Government on such investments.

National Insurance Trust Fund

Mr. Speaker, the National Insurance Trust Fund has beenset up by an Act of Parliament. This Fund will develop thepublic hospital system in the country to provide best medicalassistance to public servants. The Trust Fund has alsoabsorbed the Civil Riots and Civil Commotions Fund toprovide risk insurance for affected properties. This fund hasthe potential to develop a reinsurance market. Therefore, Ipropose to make it mandatory that 50 per cent of reinsurancebusiness be done by all insurance companies with theNational Insurance Trust Fund, which is fully owned by theGovernment.

Taxes on Electricity and Industrial Fuel

Many of our industries are fast losing their competitivenessdue high tariff on electricity and industrial fuel. While newpower plants will reduce long-term cost of electricity, it isnecessary to provide competitive inputs to promote themanufacturing and value addition processes in the near termin the context of acute competition. Therefore, I propose toexempt heavy fuel oil, furnace oil and electricity from VAT.Machinery and equipment imported by the CeylonElectricity Board will also be exempt from VAT to reduce itscash flow burden. A new electricity tariff schedule reflectingthese changes and reducing industrial tariff to around UsDollars 0.07 cent equivalent, will be issued accordingly.

Local Film Industry

Mr. Speaker, I propose to exempt from VAT, producers,distributors. exhibitors and suppliers of laboratory facilitiesfor film production. Customs Duty on items imported to beused in the film industry will be removed. VAT on such itemswill be reduced to 5 per cent. Films or teledrams sent sbroadfor further processing will not be liable for PAL, CustomsDuty or VAT. A ten - year tax holiday will be granted for

2006 16153154

cinemas to be newly constructed with advanced technologicalfacilities. A five - year tax holiday will be granted to anyexisting cinema, if upgraded with advanced technologicalfacilities. The tax relief by way of a deduction in respect ofcost production of any frim will be increased from Rs. 5 millionto Rs. 25 million.

KRUSHI NAVODAYA

,Mr. Speaker, we have restored duties on the importation offlour, sugar, rice, onion, chilli and potato, but we still have aduty waiver on milk powder. As a policy, I propose to removethese waivery gradually to encourage local production, toencourage our farmers to achieve self-sufficiency and ensurefood security. In order to promote high value agriculture andprocessing activities, I propose to implement a comprehensivepackage, providing credit and tax rebate for machinery,equipment and extension services for farmers engaged insuch activities. This package will be available for agriculture,livestock, inland fisheries, prawn farming, fruit, vegetableand organic fertilizer production, floriculture, seeddevelopment et cetera. I propose to earmark Rs. 2 billioneach year over the next three years for loans to be grantedunder this package. I propose to divert Rs. 300 million fromthe cess to assist in the cost-sharing operation with banks, toprovide such loans at 8 per cent interest. In order to increaserice flour processing, rice millers will also be given additionalincentives under this package. Identified machinery whichare not manufactured locally will be exempted from VAT andimport duties to modernize rice mills. Nucleus farms will beencouraged through tax and other incentives to develop fruitand vegetable cultivation based on out grower system.

Plantation Agriculture

,Agriculture income including income from agriculturalprocessing and value addition has been exempt from IncomeTax. I propose further incentives for processing of tea, rubberand coconut.

* The Economic Service Charge applicable to tea, rubberand coconut processing industries will be reduced from0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent.

* Machinery imported for the modernization of tea, rubberand coconut processing factories will be exempt fromVAT and Custom Duties.

, * The reduction of VAT on electricity will also bebeneficial for these industries.

Fisheries

The construction of a state - of - the - art fish marketcomplex including facilities for an inland fish and ornamentalfish exchange proposed in the last Budget has commenced.Funds have been allocated to complete the Diyawarahousing projects. I propose to implement an insurance schemefor fishermen as well as for their boats and vessels to insuretheir risks. A natural disaster relief fund will also be set up bythe National Insurance Trust Fund on a contributory basis forthe benefit of the fishing community.

Prawn Farming,

Since a large number of small farmers are engaged in prawnfarming, I propose to exempt from VAT the supply of prawns.In order to support local farmers, a cess will be imposed onthe importation of prawns and fish to regulate such importsparticularly to ensure health requirements. The Dutch Canalrehabilitation programme and disease control measures forthe benefit of prawn farmers in the Puttalam District will becompleted in 2007.

Livestock

Mr. Speaker, enhanced availability of animals with geneticpotential is necessary to improve livestock production.Therefore, the importation of cattle, buffaloes, goats, andother animals, semen and embryo to be used in livestockbreeding will be exempt from VAT and duty.

SME Sector Development

There is a surge in local value addition due to assistanceextended by the Government for locally manufactured orprocessed products. In order to provide required localassistance including research, extensions and qualityassurances and to support food processing, an additional cesswill be imposed on meat and poultry, jewellery, shoemanufacturing, ayurvedic products, strawboards, cosmeticsand toilet perpetrations, diaries, envelopes, telephone, tradedirectories et cetera. To support the acquisition of advancedmachinery and equipment exclusively used for themanufacturing and processing of high value products fromtea, rubber and coconut and for animal husbandry,pharmaceutical and giftware production import duty on suchmachinery and equipment will be removed and additionalcredit facilities will be provided.

23. Entrepot Trade

In our effort to promote various service activitiesoriginating from Sri Lanka, profit from offshore tradingactivities are exempt from income tax. I now propose thatoffshore activities will also be exempt from the EconomicService Charge. The spectrum of articles coming withinonshore entrepot trade would be widened to embrace anyarticle in place of the few selected articles now specified inthe law. Profit from onshore activities will continue to beliable at 10 per cent. Liability to ESC will be on FOB at 0.1per cent rate.

24. Jewellery Industry

The taxation strtegy has to be reformulated to transformthe gem and jewellery industry to generate high valueaddition, employment, foreign exchange earning andGovernment revenue. Therefore, the Port and AirportDevelopment Levy (PAL) on gems, diamond and gold willbe removed. VAT on jewellery will be reduced from 20 percent to 5 per cent. A 15 per cent cess will be imposed onimportation of jewellery. An annual registration fee of Rs.5,000 will be imposed on jewellery manufactureres in order

155156

to support technoloby development for the manufacture ofhigh value items. ESC of 1 per cent will be applicable forlocal jewellery manufacturers. In the case of exporters of gems,diamond and jewellery, the per cent ESC will apply only onthe value addition.

25. Apparel Industry

Sri Lankas apparel industry is expected to raise its exportsto US Dollars 5 billion by 2010. Further, there is a considerablepotential to establish backward linkages to textile processingand thereby increase domestic value addition. Two largeTextile Processing Zones at Tulhiriya and Horana targetinginvestments of about US Dollars 300 million in textileprocessing are now being developed. In order to boost thisindustry further, I propose to reduce the ESC in respect of alltextiles, apparel manufacturers and trading houses to 0.1 percent. In order to discouage unnecessary and poor qualityimports of garments, local sales by garment manufactureswill be encouraged subject to a payment of a consolidatedduty inclusive of cess, of Rs. 25 per piece on their local sales.

26. Leather Industry

Local leather industry has a vast export potential andenjoys same prospects that the apparel industry enjoyus inthe global market. Therefore, in order to encourage leatherand related industries in Sri Lanka, all material imported forprocessing and manufacturing of leather and leather productswill be exempt from import duty and VAT. Futher, advancedmachinery and equimpment identified for this industry willalso be made duty free. In order to overcome under-invoicingproblems and channel funds for required research and otherservices to the industry, the cess on imported shoes will beraised to Rs. 300 per pair.

27. Reopening of Closed Factories

Due to variety of difficulties, several private factorieslocated in backward areas have remained closed for the pastserveral years. Approximately about 30-40 of such factoriescan be revived and enabled to provide about 10,000 jobs insuch areas. In order to revive these factories, I propose togrant Rs. 2,000 million to Lankaputra Development Bankwhich will in turn provide either equklity or debt to suchfactories on the basis of a solid restructuring plan. Their taxliabilities, Provident Fund and gratuity payments should besettled first. Financial assistance will be provided forimmediate working capital requirements. Existing debt willbe restrucured to provide debt relief. Such industries willalso be given a 3 year tax-holiday and an exemption fromESC for the same period. The land title of these factories willbe suitably converted into longterm leases so that suchfactories could commence operations with a clear title. Prioritywill be given to revive all closed garment factories withemployment potential in excess of 200 in each factory.

28. Shipping Industry

Sri Lanka being an island nation and depending haveilyon international trade has prospects to promote shipping as

thrust industry to generate foreign exchange earnings,employment and promotion of logistic services. Therefore, Ipropose to remove import duty applicable for ships registeredunder the Sri Lankan flag. VAT and other levies on charteringof vessels will also be removed. Stamp duty on ship mortgageswill be removed. Remuneration Sri Lankan seafarers will beexempt from income tax. Depreciation allowance for shipswill be increased to one-third. and restrictions on offshoreborrowings will be removed.

29. Promotion of Nanotechnology

The application of nanotechnology will improvecompetitiveness in textiles, rubber, ayurvedic medicine,elecronics, minerals and raw material. Therefore, ananotechnology institute and an associated nano-science parkwill be set up as a public private partnershlip project underthe overall supervision of the National Research Council.The Government spends about Rs. 2 billion for research anddevelopment through various research institutes. Allocationshave been increased in the 2007 Budget to promote researchand development in the country. National Research Councilwill Co-ordinate all these research institutes and supervisetheir budgets to ensure that funds allocated for research willbe utilized on national priorities.

30. Stipulated minimum Salaries for OverseasEmployment

Minimum salaries prescribed Sri Lankans leaving foroverseas employment for the first time remain grosslyinadequate. The Foreign Employment Bureau together withevocational traning institutes and other skills developmentagencies will be required to accelerate skills developmentprogrammes for those Sri Lankans leaving for overseas jobsto ensure that they will secure employment with a minimummonthly income of Rs. 50,000 (US Dollars 500) within thenext three years. As a first step the minimum stipulated salaryfor employment abroad next year will be fixed at Rs. 25,000(US Dollars 250). All employment agencies will be requiredto comply with this requirement.

31. Provincial High Court Infrastrucure

The Government proposes to expand the Provincial HighCourts with appellate jursdiction. Accordingly, 3 model HighCourts with modern technological facilities will be set up inHomagama, Nuwara Eliaya and Dambulla to giveexpeditions redress to litigants and avoid laws delays. PhaseII of the Legal Reform Projects is being finalized to sustainextensive legal reforms.

32. Presidential Task Force on National ProductivityImprovement

Sri Lankas economic development requires considerableimprovement in productivity. In order to address variousfactors lowering productivity of our people, I propose to setup a Presidential Task Forse for National ProductivityImprovement. This Task Force will first identify the obvious

2006 16157158

constraints and address them on a priority basis. The TaskForce which will work closely with Trade Unionrepresentatives, will be given full authority to removeimpediments on productivity improvements.

33. Negenahira and Ruhunu Reawakening

Mr. Speaker, we all know that development since 1977 hasbeen concentrated in the Western Province. We need to changethis. The Urban Development Authogity and the Board ofInvestment (BOI) have already finalized an infrastructuredevelopment plan for Trincomalee as an Investment andTourist Zone and will provide risk guarantees, taxexemptions, foreign exchange and other incentives to attractinvestment. The Trincomalee Harbour will be used foractivities associated with domestic commercial cargo to easethe pressure on the Colombo Port. A new coal power planthas already been negotiated as a joint venture between Indiaand Sri Lanka. Civil work of the Greater Dambulla Townshippogramme is ready to commence. A new dedicated economicentre with all marketing and storage facilties will be set upin Vavuniya and be linked with the Dambulla dedicatedeconomic centre. The Weerawila Air port, Hambantota Port,International Convention Centre, Southern Expressway, thenew railway line and investment zone will provide requiredimpetus to Ruhunu Reawakeing.

IV. Public Service

1. National Salaries Policy

The absence of a national wages policy has led to anomaliesand discrepancies in salaries causing disputes. In order toresolve these issues, in 2006 initial steps were taken towardsintroducing a new national salary structure on a 1 : 4.2 ratioto the public service. Salary scales were regrouped andreduced from 126 to 37. A performance based promotionprocedure has also been worked out. Work is in progress inrespect of resolving remaining discrepancies including theproblem of stagnation at maximum salary points. Anomaliesin the increments structure are also being addressed to ensurethat the salary ratio of 1 : 4.2 will not be distorted. Acomprehensive salaries policy based on a standardoccupation classification and linked to the growth of GDP isbeing worked out. A recruitment policy based on examinationswill be formulated in order to have a uniform system ofrecruitment at national as well as provincial levels. Humanresource capacity of the Salaries and Cadre Committee willbe increased in order to resolve issues expeditiously.

2. Salaries to Public Servants

Mr. Speaker, I offered generous package for publicservants including employees in the armed forces and thepolice in the last Budget. The package included a Rs. 1,000per month initial cost-of-living allowance and consequentialadjustments subject to a limit of Rs. 375 for each six monthperiod and an incentive payment equivalent to a maximum

of one months salary for unutilized leave. 50 per cent ofthe proposed increase based on the new salary structure wasgranted. Salary revisions of statutory agencies will also bedone by December 2006. I now propose to implement thebalance increase effective from January 2007. Cost-of-livingadjustment for the second half of 2006 and the first half of2007 and leave encashement subject to stipulated limitswill also be granted in 2007. Budget estimates have providedfor these increases and accordingly the total cost of wageswill increase to Rs. 196.7 billion and pensions to Rs. 68.2billion.

3. Distress Loans to Public Servants

Under the present system, distress loans are given on thebasis of the 2004 salary structure. However, as a matter ofpolicy, starting from 2007, distress loans will be grantedon the basis of the salary structure of the respective year.However, in order to ensure that the lower ranking employeesas well as first time applicants will get benefits, I proposethat distress loans be given to those employees who havenot got any distress loan before and subject to a maximumlimit that the Government can afford. I also propose that afresh distress loan should be given only after two-thirds ofthe existing loan is settled. Employees in security forces,police, education and health services will be given prioritysince a large number of employees in such institutions havenot so far benefited from distress loans.

4. Pensioners

I granted an allowance of Rs. 500 to all pensioners withadjustments every six months. Accordingly, they are nowgetting a cost of living allowance of Rs. 687.50 per month.This will be increased again by Rs. 375 in January and Julynext year. The balance arrears payments to those who retiredbefore 01.01.1997 will also be given in 2007.

5. Graduate Employment

The last year Budget proposed to recruit 10,000 graduatedto fill vacancies in various Government agencies. Out ofthis 3,000 graduates have been recruited through a properrecruitment procedure to Government agencies such as theInland Revenue Department. The Government has alsoidentified about 8,000 vacant positions in teaching,planning and in extension services available in schools andDivisional Secretariats located in remote areas. Area specifiedappointments will be given in 2007 as trainees for a periodof 2 years at a Rs. 7,500 monthly salary and confirmationwill be made on the basis of the normal salary. They arerequired to complete 5 years of service in the appointedplace. Unemployed university graduates will be givenpriority.

V. Welfare

1. Estate Community Welfare

Mr. Speaker, in my last Budget, I proposed to improveestate roads and housing. These programmes will be

159160

expanded in 2007. The proposed vocational training collegeat Nuwara Eliya will be operationalized in 2007. In orderto upgrade estate community health conditions, I proposeto upgrade all health centres in the estate sector as a specialproject under the Ministry of Health. I also propose todistribute rice flour at a subsidized price to the estatecommunity.

2. Welfare of Displaced Persons in Unsafe Areas

Special programmes focusing health and nutritionalstandards of displaced persons in unsafe areas, particularlytargeting women and children will also be implemented.

3. E-villages

I propose to develop e-villages in selected rural locationsas a pilot project to popularize computer usage to promoteaccess to information to people living in distant locations.

VI. Religion & Culture

Promoting Religious Values

Mr. Speaker, I have dealt with the economy, businessand finance so far. No economic development will bemeaningful unless we preserve and promote our religiousand cultural values. While the Government has taken drasticmeasures to curtail the consumption of liquor and the useof narcotics, the ultimate success of such measures dependson public awareness. Therefore, I propose to select 1,000temples as nucleus to promote awareness in the communityto discourage such habits. The enhancement ofcommunication and teaching skills of teachers providingreligious education will be undertaken to promote religiouseducation through in-service training.

Mr. Speaker, there is quite a large number of BuddhistTamils living in and out of Sri Lanka, particularly in India.Teaching of Buddhism will be extended to suchcommunities and promoted among Buddhists in otherethnic groups. I also propose to set up an InternationalInstitute for Buddhist Studies to promote internationalinterest on Buddhism and Buddhist culture with theassistance of donor funding. Land and local logistics willbe provided by the Government. Sri Lankan heritage willbe preserved through special programmes.

30.Mr. Speaker, revenue and expenditure implications ofmy proposals are given in Annexure II and the technicaldetails of revenue proposals which will be incorporated intothe relevant statutes through enabling amendments are givenin Annexure III. A list of documents that I am tabling withmy speech today is given in Annexurte IV. Final BudgetOutur is given in Annexure V. A resolution will be submittedto the Parliament to recognize the Post Tsunami medium

term fiscal framework. The final budget outcome indicatesthat there is a small surplus in the revenue account andconfines the deficit to 7.2 per cent of GDP. With specialDBT projects, we must attempt to have at least 8 per centof GDP for overall public investment in 2007. The countryat present is blessed with favorable weather and allreservoirs are spilling. These are indications of another yearof successful agriculture. I have also offered severalincentives through this Budget to provide a further stimulusto SMEs, industries and services. Several large infrastructureprojects are under construction. They will pave way for rapiddevelopment. Budget itself has been designed to reduceinflation to around 9 per cent and sustain a growth in GDPat 7.5 per cent.

Section V

Conclusion

31.Mr. Speaker, our challenges are formidable. The globaleconomic environment is volatile. The oil prices remainvulnerable and risks are high. Inflation is high. Nationalsecurity cannot be compromised. The development of muchneeded infrastructure cannot longer be delayed. Thereforethe Government, the private sector and the Trade Unionsmust make some sacrifices to overcome these challenges. Irecall the day that I laid the foundation stone of theinternational stadium at Homagama. When I mentioned thatthe cost-of-living is high, the spontaneous response fromthe crowd was that they would bare it, and that I shouldlook after the country. I believe that this is the shared viewof the majority of out people. The message is that themajority is ready to make sacrifices in the interest of thecountry. I make a special request from Sri Lankans livingabroad to make their contribution too, to the motherlandat least by choosing Sri Lanka as a destination for theirsavings. As meant by Gama Naguma - Gathe Saviya, MageRate Nangweema Sandaha, Gunagaruka SamajayakataMangpethVivarakaramu; is our way forward.

32.Mr. Speaker, many people contributed to formulatethis Budget. Instead of engaging in mere criticism, severalpolitical parties also submitted their proposals. People fromvarious parts of the country as well as several organizationsexpressed their views. Trade Unions, Trade Chambers andprofessionals not only submitted written proposals but alsoparticipated in intensive discussions to exchange views. Ithank each one of them for their participation in thisconsultative process. I thank the entire team of officials whoworked hard in preparing comprehensive materials for thepresentation of this Budget. I thank my Deputy Ministerand the Secretary to the Treasury for their wholeheartedassistance, to discharge my responsibilities as the Ministerof Finance at a most difficult and challenging time of ourhistory. Mr. Speaker, I thank you, and your staff, forproviding the necessary facilities to present this Budget.

Thank you.

For an average family this application fee is in therange of Rs. 200,000/ to Rs. 400,000/.

A large number of such persons have expressed their desireto come back to Sri Lanka. As a mode of encouragement itis proposed to reduce the levy imposed when applying fordual citizenship to Rs. 200,000 per family unit, irrespectiveof the number of members in the family provided that theapplicant makes a deposit exceeding US Dollars 25,000 fora three year period in a bank in Sri Lanka. A family whichdeposits US Dollars 50,0000 and above for a period of threeyears will be exempt from this levy. Age, educational andwealth criteria hitherto applied in granting dual citizenshipwill not be imposed in the future, if the above requirementis met. However, their applications for dual citizenship haveto be scrutinized to ensure that only those who are havingunblemished record will receive dual citizenship.
