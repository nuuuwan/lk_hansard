Hon. Minister, we have been all the time asking forRegistrars of Marriages for our areas but still we have not gotsufficient staff for that. Will you take some action on that? Ithink, you have to discuss with us and finalize this, becausethis has been going on for years and years now. We do nothave Registrars -

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)I fully agree. That is why I said at the very beginning thatwe should all be ashamed that five per cent of our population,mostly drawn from the estate areas, have not been registered

though on a regional basis we are very good at 95 per centregistration as against India which has less than 50 per centand Bangladesh less than that. But we cannot be proud ofthat because five per cent of our own citizens have not beenregistered.

You know this very well as a fellow MP from Kandy weeven set up mobile units. mobile services . , . . , .

You sometimes face security problems when you arestopped at a security point because you cannot produce youridentity card. Then you cannot get employment in Colombobecause the person who is empoloying you is asking for theidentity card. I fully realize that.

I want to before long, may be in an year or two, see that wehave a world record that 100 per cent of our people will beregistered. I give you that assurance.

(+ )(The Presiding Member) . . .

. . ( () )(The Hon. Prof. G. L. Peiris)

Madam Chair, I consider it a privilege to take part in thisDebate under your distinguished chairmanship and I wouldlike to congratulate my Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) SarathAmunugama, Minister of Public Administration and HomeAffairs on the five short pieces of legislation which he hasintroduced in the House today. The Hon. Minister explainedthe reasons why these changes are necessary in the law. Hespoke of certain sociological factors, in particular thephenomenon of urbanization. He also referred to certaincultural changes. In the context of all of which he suggested,quite correctly in my view, that these are changes whichare timely and beneficial. We have no problems with thesechanges that are proposed and we would support theamendments that are proposed by the Hon. Minister.

As far as the scale of remuneration is concerned, it isobvious that the value of money changes from time to timeand the attempt by the Hon. Minister to increase these feesin keeping with those changes is entirely commendable.

With regard to the four other pieces of legislation whichhe has introduced this morning, they appear to have acommon objective. The objective, Madam Chair, is tospecify the disqualifications applicable to persons whoserve in the office of Registrar. The Hon. Minister hasexplained the reasons why he thinks it desirable that paidofficers of the State should be excluded from thesepositions. He has also given the House the assurance thatthese changes will not be retrospectively applicable. Theywill apply only for the future.

I would however like the Hon. Minister to give his mindto one particular aspect of the changes that he is proposing,

2006 2818851886

namely Clause 2(2)(e) that is incorporated in the MarriageRegistration (Amendment) Bill which is to amend theMarriage Registration Ordinance (Chapter 112). It states, Iquote:

is engaged in a profession that would prejudicially affect the dutiesof a Registrar.

There appears to be some lack of clarity in that regard.This appears to be a subjective criterion - who would decidewhat would constitute a profession that is prejudicial to theduties of a Registrar. I think, there is a point there whichrequires some consideration.

The Hon. Minister also referred to the cultural traditionsof different communities. In that context, I would like todraw his attention to a problem that the Muslim communityis confronted with at the present time. I am certain that myFriend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama is familiar withthe decision by the Privy Council at the time when that wasthe highest Court for Sri Lanka in a famous case that wasknown as Attorney-General vs. Reid. In that case, theirLordships of the Privy Council made a certain ruling withregard to a second marriage that is contracted under theGeneral Marriages Ordinance. The situation is this. A personis married under the General Marriages Ordinance. Duringthe subsistence of that marriage he converts to Islam andenters into a second marriage. After a great deal of debatethe Privy Council decided that if the conversion is notcolourable, if it is a conversion that has been made in goodfaith, then the second marriage is valid although the GeneralMarriages Ordinance, of course, generally constitutes amonogamous regime.

That decision was overturned later by the Supreme Courtof Sri Lanka in a case known as Abeysundara vs.Abeysundara which took up this position. That is, at thetime the first marriage was entered into, the intention of theparties was that this should be a monogamous marriage andit is not possible for a party subsequently to change hisreligion and enter into a second marriage. According toAbeysundara vs. Abeysundara, the second marriage isillegal. That is contrary to the position of the Privy Councilin Attorney-General vs. Reid and there is a very serioussocial consequence that has been brought about as a resultof the decision in Abeysundara vs. Abeysundara. That is,imputation of the taint of illegitimacy to the children ofthat marriage. So at the time the marriage is entered into,according to the decision by the Privy Council in Attorney-General vs Reid, it is a lawful and a valid marriage.Subsequently the law is changed by a decision of theSupreme Court and what was earlier regarded as a lawfulmarriage now becomes illegal. The result is, that the rightsof children are affected. They become illegitimate. This, ofcourse, constitutes a serious social stigma particularly in thecontext of the cultural traditions of Sri Lanka. It also has adecisive impact on property rights, intestate succession anda whole range of matters arise for consideration in that

regard. So I would respectfully submit to the Hon. Ministerthat there is an anomaly, a serious injustice, arising fromthat situation and as part of a general endeavour tomodernize and to retionalize the laws relating to marriagein this country. I think this is a matter that warrants theconsideration of the Hon. Minister of Public Administrationand Home Affairs.

I would also like, at this point, to mention that whenevera legislation pertaining to the law of this country, to thelegal system and the constitutional regime has been broughtbefore the House by the Hon. John Senewiratne, by the Hon.Amarasiri Dodangoda, by the Hon. Dew Gunasekera, andnow by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Oppositionhas been exceedingly co-operative. We have madeconstructive suggestions and I think the Government willconcede that in many cases the changes that we proposedwere incorporated into the law and the law has been enrichedby the suggestions that were made from the OppositionBenches on each of those occasions. I think it is nowappropriate Madam Chair, to expand the ambit of thatco-operation. We have worked very cordially andproductively in relation to legislation falling within thiscategory but I think the imperatives of national policy atthis time call for an enlargement and an expansion of theambit of that co-operation and I would identify that as theneed of the hour as we participate in this Debate thismorning, Madam Chair.

Today we are confronted with the situation where theproblems of the country are of such magnitude that a newapproach in necessary. We have to think out of the box.We have to adopt innovative approaches. The tried andtested methods of the past do not serve the nationadequately at this time. I think we can derive inspirationfrom the manner in which leaders of other countries haveresponded to these challenges. I am certain that the Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama would agree with me when I saythat Nelson Mandelas Long Walk to Freedom is one ofthe most inspiring autobiographies of our time. There hediscusses a very innovative and courageous experimentwhich he embarked upon during the period 1993 to 1996when South Africa as a nation was emerging from theshackles of colonialism. And from all this strife, the hatredand the bitterness that characterized the apartheid regime,there was a widespread recognition throughout the politicalspectrum in the emergent nation of South Africa that a newapproach to the resolution of problems was necessary. Thatwas the situation, Madam Chair, in which a successfulattempt was made to bring together all the politicalgroupings in the country and to formulate a commonnational agenda for the benefit of all the people of SouthAfrica. In my view, that task was a good deal more difficultthan the problems that we are grappling with in our owncountry at the present time. Take the degree of enmitybetween the Inkatha party led by Buthelezi and the AfricanNational Congress of Nelson Mandela and also the degreeof oppression that was inflicted on the coloured people by

18871888

[ . . ]the White Government led by Frederik de Klerk. But allthese people were able to forget their differences temporarilyin search of a common national agenda for the benefit ofthe nation as a whole. This is precisely what happened inIndia in 2004 after the Congress Party under the leadershipof Sonia Gandhi achieved an impressive victory at the polls.Sonia Gandhi decided to enter into an alliance with no fewerthan 14 political formations and the Government of Indiapublished in May 2004, a document under the title ANational Common Agenda. I think it is a very usefuldocument which I am sure my distinguished Friend wouldhave pleasure in reading. Of course, it has to be adapted tosuite the circumstances of our own country. But, we on ourpart have derived very considerable assistance from muchof the material that is contained in that exceedingly valuabledocument.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Hon. Member, I would strongly appreciate, If you couldtable that document.

. . ( () )(The Hon. Prof. G. L. Peiris)Yes. Certainly I would be-

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

When it gets into Hansard all of us will have an easy way ofreferring to it.

. . ( () )(The Hon. Prof. G. L. Peiris)I would be very happy to do so, Hon. Minister.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

I shall be very grateful, if you would do that.

. . ( () )(The Hon. Prof. G. L. Peiris)I would be very happy to do so, Hon. Minister.

I would also like to mention that Pundit Jawaharlal Nehruwhen he presided over the first Cabinet of independent India,pointed out the dire necessity of agreeing upon a nationalprogramme in respect of industry, agriculture, electricitygeneration, education, labour-all these areas which wouldcommand acceptance by as larger a segment of the Indianpolity as possible and he pointed out that these are not matterswhich should be discussed entirely within the forum of theParty which had been successful at the polls.

I think, Madam Chair, that many of us are not aware thatthese precedents are in no way incompatible with the politicalexperience of our own country. I would like to refer to theConstitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka Bill which I hadthe privilege of presenting in this House on the 3rd of August2000 as the Minister of Justice, Constitutional Affairs, EthnicAffairs and National Integration of the Government ofPresident Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

I would refer in particular to Article 134 which has a directbearing on some of the matters which are being agitated inthe country today. As you are aware Madam Chair, thecenterpiece of that legislation consisted of the structures forpower sharing in this country and Article 134 dealt with thecomposition of the Regional Board of Ministers. Theprovision contained in Article 134, as the Hon. (Dr.) SarathAmunugama would be aware was this. Let us take the RegionalCouncil of the District of Kandy. The election is held and theresult is as follows. Party X has 40 per cent of the seats inthe Regional Council. Party Y has 35 per cent. Party Zhas 25 per cent. According to Article 134 of that Bill the seatsin the Regional Board of Ministers will be allocated amongthese three parties according to that proportion. So, we aredeparting in that instance from the principle winner takesall which is the cornerstone of the Westminster System ofgovernment.

What is important for our purpose, Madam Chair is that theprinciple contained in Article 134 was agreed by the Sri LankaFreedom Party and the United National Party at that time.There were a series of discussions at Temple Trees presidedover by the former President. I was associated with thosediscussions as the Minister of Justice, Constitutional Affairs,Ethnic Affairs and National Integration. Although that Billwas not accepted in the House as it did not secure two-thirdsmajority for other reasons, as far as this particular principlewas concerned, it commanded acceptance both by the UnitedNational Party and by the Sri Lanka Freedom party. This isnot in any way consistent with the doctrine of collectiveresponsibility because these are different political partiesthat are coming together to work on the basis of a commonagenda which has been previously agreed by the differentparties. I want to emphasize that institutional structure is notlimited to co-operation between the United National Partyand the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The doors are open for allpolitical parties represented in the House, if they are willingto come in, to share executive power in accordance with theprinciple reflected in that provision. Now, today in thecountry at large, there is a strong sentiment that is supportiveof the institutional structure that is contained in Article 134.There is a strong feeling that since we achieved independencethere have been bona fide attempts by successiveadministration to come to grips with the problems confrontingour nation.

It goes back to the Bandaranaike - Chelvanayakam pact of1958 which the late prime Minister was forced to tear up withhis own hands. Then we had the Dudley-Chelvanayakam

2006 2818891890

Pact of 1965 and under president Jayawardene we had theThimpu Talks, the Bangalore Talks and the Delhi Talks. Underpresident Ranasinghe Premadasa we had the All PartyConference in which yeoman service was rendered by thelate Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Shahul Hameed towhose memory I paid a tribute recently. Under PresidentKumaratunga we had the draft constitution presented to theHouse on the 3rd of August 2000. All these attempts provedunsuccessful for one reason and one reason only, MadamChair. Notwithstanding the genuineness and the commitmentof the incumbent administration, these attempts did not reachfruition because of the obstruction by the party on oppositionat any given time. It is historically inaccurate and morallyunfair to impute blame to any one political party. The tragedyof this nation has been that it has been a recurring pattern ofconfrontation, acrimony and rancour.

Now, today there is the deep and widespread feeling in SriLankan society that the time has come to depart from thistradition and to search for a political culture that is foundedupon consensus and collaboration. It is in response to thatfeeling that the current exercise has been undertaken, MadamChair. On the very first occasion when representatives of theSri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party meton the 15th of September, a Committee was appointed toidentify the particular areas in respect of which co-operationwas necessary. It is not possible for these two parties to agreeon everything. In the document which the Hon. Ministerwanted me to table, there was a definite and a focused attemptby Sonia Gandhi and her advisors to select the areas vital tothe well-being of the nation, the irreducible core of publicpolicy which call for a consensus between and among themajor parties. So one has to be selective. Now that task wasaccomplished by the two delegations within four days. Atthe second plenary which was held on Tuesday the 19th ofSeptember, six such areas were identified. We are now engagedin an exercise of endeavouring to formulate in respect ofeach of those areas a common minimum national agenda inrespect of which the two political parties could agree to worktogether for a stipulated period of time. We are also workingon a structure that would enable implementation of thisagreement once it has been reached and it is our expectationthat when we meet again on Tuesday the 3rd of October wewould have made very considerable progress with regard tothe formulation of a common national policy in respect ofthe six priority areas which have now been identified. I donot wish to speak much longer Madam Chair. I wouldemphasize again that this country has shown remarkableresilience during the most turbulent periods of our history. Iam sure my Friend the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama wouldagree with me that the singular strength of our country consistof the calibre of human resources. I think it is time to exploitto the full, the creativity and the genius of our people inevolving structures however unorthodox and unconventionalthey may be, structures that respond creatively to the needsof our time. That is precisely the task in which we are engagedat present. A new structure is taking shape and form in theminds of the delegations. We have had extensive discussions

with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday, I had adiscussion with the Hon. Prime Minister and there is now anemerging consensus between the two parties with regard tothese core issues. I think that is a very refreshing developmentin the contemporary history of our country.

Before I conclude, Madam Chair, permit me to identifywhat I regard as the principle characteristics of the innovativestructure, which I would strongly recommend has beenrequired by our country at the present time. First of all wemay have the political will to work together at this moment,but that will must be buttressed by an appropriate institutionalstructure which enables fruitful collaboration on the ground.This country has a very rich and pragmatic constitutionalheritage. We had the Donoughmore Constitution which wasoperative in the colony of Ceylon between 1931 and 1947.We had the Cabinet system of government from 1948 to 1978and we have the Executive presidential system from 1978 tothe present day. We do not, therefore, have to travel far afield. The ideas, the concepts, the value systems that we werelooking for are embedded in the cultural, the constitutionaland the legal heritage of our nation. Let us now search deeplyfor what we need in our own contemporary history. I think, itshould not be beyond our capability by any means to identifythe principle characteristics of the structure which wouldenable such collaboration given a genuine political will towork together in the circumstances that prevail in our countryat the present time.

Secondly, Madam Chair, I think a passing reference wasmade in some of the previous exchanges that took place inthe House today. There is an imperative need to preserve thevitality of the Opposition. A vibrant Opposition is anindispensable requisite of a functioning democracy.Therefore, the changes that are contemplated should not inany way lead to the weakening or the debilitation of the roleof the Opposition. Therefore, the Constitutional or otherchanges that we have in mind should always focus upon theneed to preserve, to strengthen, to invigorate the Oppositionparticularly in respect of the control of public finance. Article148 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka declares that theParliament of the country shall have full control over publicfinance. So, whatever we do we must take care to ensure thatthe Opposition is not weakened, that the opposition has arole and that must be an integral part of the political structuresthat we constuct for our country at this time.

Another very important feature is that there must be ameaningful role for every Member of Parliament. To my mind,one of the great weaknesses of our political system at thismoment is the marginalization of Parliament. The vastmajority of Members of Parliament on both sides of the Housefeel that they are not making a worthwhile contribution tothe public affairs of our country. We need, therefore, to carveout for every Member of Parliament a constructive anddefinite role, to attribute to every Member of Parliament adefined responsibility, a function which will enhance theself-esteem and the motivation of every Member of Parliament.

18911892

[ . . ]The Donoughmore Commissioners had a very perceptivecomment to make, Madam Chair, about the political cultureof our country. I am sure the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugamawould be interested in this. As early as 1929, the DonoughmoreCommissioners said that these Ceylonese have a certainpeculiar genius and that peculiar genius on the part ofpoliticians in our country, according to the DonoughmoreCommissioners, was a fact that they were embroiled inadministrative detail. The Donoughmore Commissioners saidthat the typical politician in our country would feel distancedfrom political reality if he were to cease to take an interest, anintense and continuing interest in administrative detail. Theytherefore, said in their report, Let us make a virtue out ofnecessity. Let us give every Member of Parliament a rolewith regard to administration. That is unfortunately notpossible in that form because Article 4 of the presentConstitution implicitly recognizes the separation of powersamong the three principal branches of Government, theExecutive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. But, we musthave the resilience to adopt those models to suit thecircumstances of contemporary Sri Lanka, today.

The final point is this. If at all possible, Madam Chair, inorder to make this work, in order to achieve something withina reasonable timeframe, let us try to choose a simple method.The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama in presenting these fiveBills said that these are simple. They are simple but they arenecessary, they are effective. Simplicity therefore is a cardinalvirtue with regard to this exercise. Let us therefore not thinkof Constitutional reforms. It is complex. it is elaborate, it istime consuming. It would be far preferable, if at all feasible,to think of some other method of implementing the proposedreforms as swiftly and as easily as possible. If it is possible toeffect these changes through an amendment of the StandingOrders, that in my view, would be the most desirable vehiclefor achieving the purposes that we have set ourselves.

Madam Chair, I do not wish to continue much longer. Iwould like to end by congratulating my Friend the Hon. (Dr.)Sarath Amunugama on the sagacity and pragmatism that hehas shown in formulating these amendments which no doubt,will enrich the legal system of our country. I would thereforerespectfully suggest to the Hon. Minister and to the House,let us use this spirit of co-operation which encapsulates thedeliberations of this House with regard to the whole range ofmatters connected with the legal system of our country, theConstitutional system, as a launching pad. Let us strengthenthis approach, let us expand its contours and in doing so letus construct for our country a political and a constitutionalsystem that would enable us with wisdom and with strengthto confront the challenges of our time and I hope that we willnot be found wanting in serving the interest of posterity inSri Lanka.

Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)

Thank you, Madam Chairperson.

It is with great pleasure, today, I am joining a debate thatdeals from birth to death and the richness of todays debatehas been widely contributed to by the learned speakers whospoke before me. I must compliment my Colleague the Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama for bringing in these five Bills thatdeal with a variety of relevant issues from birth to marriageand to death of the people in Sri Lanka.

These important pieces of legislation are relevant as saidby my Learned Friend the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris and at thesame time simple in its approach as repeated by him and isalso important for us to go for the necessary changes. This isthe change that we are all here to advocate as representativesof the people. It is also regretful to see the deprivation that isbeing demonstrated by our other Colleagues representingthe TNA, who are now seated on the Floor of the House and itis also a matter for us to address. As much as we wish tocontribute to the needs of our people as set out in the missionof this legislation, their requirements too, are a matter that wemust keep on addressing regularly. This is where HisExcellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa has broughtin a new culture to this country. Having been elected asPresident only 11 months ago, we have today fast growntowards looking at a consensus emerging agenda for thecountry as a whole. The consensus that is needed for co-operation to get established, consensus that is needed for usto address the burning issues confronting our nation,consensus that is needed to bring in the economicadvancement for Sri Lanka is an agenda that we have set inmotion.

I am particularly happy that I am making my speech, havinglistened to the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris, in terms of what hewent on to explain to the House about the need for a nationalagenda to emerge in this country. He would recall theassociation I had with him at that time as a Member of theUnited National Party, being outside Parliament, as a Memberof the Working Committee of the United National Party whenhe was the Hon. Minister for Constitutional Affairs. We hadregular discussions at Visumpaya on reaching a nationalconsensus in terms of building this country, meeting thedemands of the people and that of the conflict that was therein some parts of the country due to the lack of addressing thebasic requirements and the needs of the people in that part ofthis country. It has been a long time since we have gone

2006 2818931894

through all these phases and today I must compliment thecontribution coming from the Opposition and the delegationwhich is discussing with the Government delegation, onbringing this agenda to a fruitful conclusion and trying toestablish a working relationship. Whatever form it is goingto take, even if there is a need for us to change and if thatneed has to be accommodated through a passage ofconstitutional reforms, why not we do it when we have thewill to achieve the purpose? So I would like to encourage thetotal process to be continued in terms of realizing the largerobjectives so that the confrontation and the acrimony thathave been associated with the political fabric of this countrycould be only a matter of history and the future generationswill not have to suffer due to the lack of our decision makingcapability when the time was right for the right decision tobe made. This is something I would like to address alongwith the necessity for us to look at the fundamental needs ofour people as set out in the Bills that have been broughtbefore the House in terms of the registration process of theirbirths, marriages and deaths.

I also did contribute in a debate that was associated withthe registration of births and marriages that came up in theHouse in the month of June, 2005. In that debate, I didmention the need for us even to look at the estate sector.The Hon. Saarath Amunugama went on to explain todaythe lack of registration of births in the estate sector os dueto infrastructure not in place. We have to address this issueof registration and expand the facility to accommodate thebasic requirements of issuing a birth certificate to a childfollowed by a marriage certificate, and a death certificate.Now how do we meet that requirement? We must establishadditional registration units. It does not cost money. I wasjust wondering if I could share this thought with the Hon.Minister? Whether the superintendents of the estates canbe conferred with the right of administering the Registrarsduties. Is it not a possible way?

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

It is a good idea.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

This is how the British administered the country with theleast amount of expense.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

That was the old practice.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Yes, it was the old practice. Here is a superintendentmanaging an estate with two-three thousand people and

sometimes two-three thousand workers live in that estate.Their children have to have easy access to the registrationprocess and here is an authority that we could easily adoptas a unit towards building up this so called requirement offast and convenient registration.

So, I strongly advocate that we look at conferring theRegistrars status on superintendents of estates. Also inother areas even if it is Jaffna, Batticaloa, the North, theEast or the South, we should look at some other agenciesthat we could confer this status on so that it becomesaccessible and convenient. We are today moving to aninformation technology era. One day we must have a masteridentity card in this country and that identity card shouldbe able to say when you were born, when you were married,whether the marriage still exists or divorced, and to theextent of the death certificate having to be finally filed ofrecord of every citizen of this country.

In fact I did mention this. This is where the lack ofimplementation at times, concerns our development agenda.I said this on the 08th of June 2005 joining the debate atthat time relating to the Births and Deaths Registration Act.Even at that time the amendments were necessary, wherethey went on to charge some additional fee. I think Rs. 5became Rs. 50 for a registration to be effected. In that debate,I said, if I may quote:

- - . , , , . .

I want to repeat the same submission today. This is what Isaid in June, 2005. In September, 2006, I wish to repeat mysubmission that I made at that time, because in the absence ofthis unifier we spend so much of money for the process ofdocumentation in this country. The learned Arun Soley - Iwonder whether the Hon. Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) SarathAmunugama has read this book in terms of administration -was one time a Minister in the Indian Government. He wenton to say how many in Asian countries, particularly in theIndian sub-continent, use document after document, but stillwith very little convenience to the people. Now, we have tochange that because the electronic age has come. Today thedevelopment of e-governance has become one of the keyroles of our Government directly handled by His Excellencythe President. So, the monies that we get must go for thedevelopment of our requirements, the convenience of ourpeople - this is something that I would like to advocate nowso that the learned Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama,could take note of it - and to find an easier way of dispensingthose requirements to our people.

Then again coming back to the Registrars of Marriages,sometimes when we are called upon to sign the registrations

18951896

[ ]in the villages, we find that the same registrar has to attend tomany functions at about the same times because auspicioustimes are being believed in very strongly in this country.Sometimes, even to travel short distances take time. Due tothe high number of marriages that occur on a given day resultin the number of available registrars not being able to attendthose at the auspicious times to the inconvenience of theparties.

In that regard too, I would like to encourage you to haveparticularly in the rural sector as much as in the urban sector- because of the urbanization that has taken place, theconcentration of people in certain localities has got increasedlike in the Colombo suburbs and that of the Gampaha District- more registrars available to the people so that they couldalways go and get married at a convenient time. Gettingmarried should not become a hassle and it is a contract thatthe parties enter into at an auspicious time. But it becomes amajor hassle. I think sometimes they have to queue up andsometimes, they may have to even go through various otherchannels in order to encourage the registrars presence at thecorrect time. So, this is a need once again. Therefore, let usagain address that need and have more registrars becausethese are things that would not cost the Government money.This is a matter of giving the correct people the due status,the recognition in society to be an official on behalf of theGovernment, who handles some of the most auspiciousoccasions and also the most important event of ones life:both, birth and marriage. Death, of course, is an eventualityand one cannot help it. In that context, this is relevant toinheritance and statistical records of the people of Sri Lanka.

Today we have entered into an era where the needs of thepeople are being addressed. Economic advancement underour Government is being made with a very resilient economy.Today we are reaching a growth rate of around 8 per cent andwe should be able to maintain this growth rate throughout,thereby addressing the issues of the people of the country.Today we are in a better position than any previousGovernment because the divide has got narrower and apolitical consensus has emerged.

At one time, I recall, the late President Premadasa used tosay that there are three important Cs in Sri Lankas politics:the first C being Consensus, the second being Consultationand the third being Co-operation. I take it that we can use thethree Cs once again: a consensus for a consultation processto emerge and the co-operation to get established in thiscountry so that our contribution today in this House will getrecognized in the years to come, where persons would getelected as representatives of the people to address the issuesthat confront them and give solutions and resolve those issues,not to carry the issues forward either for political advantageor in order to deprive the people who have already beendeprived of their rights in this country for another decade ormore. Why should we as politicians and representatives ofthe people leave a legacy behind so that the future generationswould only blame us for not having addressed the issues thatconfront the conutry?

Therefore, what has emerged today, coming from the Hon.(Prof.) G. L. Peiris, which I greatly appreciate, will set thetone for us to look at a very serious dialogue, an engagementtowards bringing about a Southern consensus, as alreadyspoken of and advocated by His Excellency the PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa to solve the burning issues of our country.

I thank you, Madam, for giving me time to speak.

Mr. Presiding Member, the famous historian, Dr. K. M. deSilva, referring to Muslims said this. I quote :

The story of the Muslims in post-independence Sri Lanka is thestory of how a small minority converted their intrinsic disadvantagesinto positive advantages in their struggles to strengthen their position inthe Sri Lanka polity.

When you look at the Personal Laws in this country,particularly when it relates to the Muslims, we are debatingtoday one of the important pieces of legislation which isalso sought to be amended. Unfortunately the amendment,in my opinion, is a very trivial one. It deals with somesections to be amended when registrars assume politicalpositions that they have to vacate their posts as registrars.Well, this, in my opinion is quite a consequential amendmentin keeping with the other amendments that have beenbrought to the other pieces of legislation today.

However, this particular Muslim Marriage and DivorceRegistration Ordinance was first promulgated as anordinance in 1886 and thereafter, Akbar Committeeproposals embodied some changes and they repealed theoriginal Ordinance and brought about the subsequentMuslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Ordinance, No.27 of 1929.

Here some important features of these amendments havebeen gone into by a group of social activities who haveformed themselves as the Muslim Womens Research and

2006 2819131914

Action Forum. They have started their research on MuslimPersonal Law Reforms since 1986 and have alreadysubmitted their recommendations to the ShahabdeenCommittee. Since no action has been taken on thosereforms they appear to have now set up an independentcommittee on Muslim Personal Law Reforms and they havewritten to us, Members of Parliament, saying that theywould like to officially make a presentation of theirproposals somewhere in end of October. I think once thosecomplete amendments are made available to us we willcertainly talk to the Hon. Minister and try and initiate someaction to bring about the necessary changes.

I must also say that when I was twice Minister in chargeof the Subject of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairsboth under the PA Administration and under the UNPAdministration we also set up some Consultative Committeeto go into some of these reforms. But unfortunately sincemy term of office was prematurely ended because of suddenParliamentary dissolution none of those reforms could bebrought into effect. However, since time has now lapsedunfortunately I will not be able to go into the details ofthos. I would certainly be preparing a detailed report basedon these reforms that are necessary and would submit it tothe Hon. Minister for his consideration. Thank you verymuch.

. Madam Chairperson, I am pleased to speaka few words on the Muslim Marriage and Divorce(Amendment) Bill and in particular on the Muslim law.Regarding the Muslim Law, there are a number of weaknesseswhich have to be rectified. In the past, by successivegovernments, committees were appointed but there were noresults. No action was taken. Even in 1992 ShahabdeensCommittee was appointed and it recommended amendments,but nothing has taken place. Amendments are very urgentlyneeded for the following reasons.

The first is, as you know, there is a compensation schemewhen a non-Muslim marriage breaks. When there is a divorce,the lady gets compensation through the courts. But for theMuslims, there is nothing like that. The Quazi courts do nothave the power to decide on the compensation. But in theShariya law, which is called Matha, it is available in theMiddle-Eastern countries and even in non-Muslim countrieslike in India. Compensation has to be paid to the Muslimdivorced lady. I think, it is a weakness.

2006 2819411942

The second is, the dowry system prevailing in the Muslimmarriage system. When there is a divorce the dowry whichwas given is irrecoverable. There is no law empowering theQuazi courts to deal with issues relating to dowry. So thisalso needs some amendments. Even the maintenance thathas been decided on by the Quazi court is not implementedin a proper manner. The affected party is unable to recover itfrom the person concerned. Even to consider these matters,you need to appoint a committee and obtain itsrecommendations.

Likewise most properties belonging to mosques are beingmisused. They are misused sometimes by the trustees, butthere is nobody to question it. So even there we need someamendments.

Another point I wish to raise here is about the last wills. Alast will has precedence over the Muslim Law. According tothe Muslim Law when somebody dies, his property has to beshared among his wife, children, father and all of them. Butof course if somebody purposely writes a last will, it hasprecedence over the Muslim law. So you need amendmentsthere as well.

Therefore, we propose that a committee go into the MuslimPersonal Law and make it recommendations. The setup in aQuazi Court is l like a pavement business. So what we want isa proper court system with qualified Quiazis with properqualifications have to be appointed. The minimumqualification has to be that he is qualified in the Shariya Law.They must have a basic knowledge about the Shariya Law.They should have a certificate from an institution or youmust appoint lawyers who are familiar with the Shariya Law.Today decisions are taken on an ad hoc basis. It is not donein a proper manner.

In the morning, the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris mentioned acase where a non-Muslim had converted and got married asecond time and it was nullified in the Abeysundara vsAbeysundara case. I suppose it is detrimental to the genuinecases. So you have to bring a law and restore the decisiongiven in the Reid vs Reid case.

These are a few weaknesses in the Muslim Law. Wewelcome the amendments you have brought forward in thisBill. But in the meantime I would like to tell the Hon. Ministerthat Muslim Law very urgently needs some more amendments.

I appeal to the Hon Minister to consider this and appoint acommittee or go into the recommendations that were madeby the previous committee in this regard.

Thank you very much.
