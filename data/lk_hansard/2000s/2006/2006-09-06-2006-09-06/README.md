PETROLEUM RESOURCE OF SRI LANKA : STATEMENT BYTHE MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND TRANSPORT ANDMINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND PETROLEUM RESOURCESDEVELOPMENT

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Hon. Speaker, this is in reference to the Question raised bythe Ven. Athuraliya Rathana Thero, Member of Parliament on18th July, 2006. First, I would like to give the backgroundinformation.

In 2001, TGS-NOPEC under an agreement with the CeylonPetroleum Corporation (CPC) acquired 1000 line kilometers of2D seismic data in the Mannar Basin. (Phase 1 data).

These data indicated that the basin could host oil and gasaccumulations. Encouraged by these findings TGS-NOPECwanted to collect more 2D seismic data in the basin. That iscalled Phase II data. On February 13th 2002 CPC and TGS-NOPEC signed an agreement that identified TGS-NOPEC asthe exclusive agent to collect non-exclusive seismic data (2Dand 3D) in the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. Under this

agreement TGS-NOPEC also had the exclusive right to marketdata and recover their cost and a 182 per cent return on theirinvestment. From February to August 2005, TGS-NOPECacquired approximately 5000 line kilometres of 2D seismic datain the Mannar Basin. That is called Phase II data. The cost ofPhase I and Phase II seismic data was reported as US Dollars5.5 million.

As per the agreement TGS-NOPEC was to submit to CPCwithin 30 days from completion of processing, one set of data;that is deliverables described in the agreement, free of cost.TGS-NOPEC submitted the data and an interpretation reportfor Phase I but did not comply with this provision with respectto Phase II. The agreement also contained clauses wherebyCPC agreed to publicly announce a bid round covering thephase areas, which in this case is the Mannar Basin, and aschedule for sharing data sales revenue wit the CPC.

Towards the latter part of 2004 Petroleum ResourcesDevelopment Secretariat (PRDS) was formed and it becamethe successor to CPC in the contracts with TGS-NOPEC. Ona visit to TGS-NOPEC offices in Perth, Mr. SaliyaWickramasuriya, the then Chairman of the Board of Investmentof Sri Lanka (BOI), discovered that the Phase II data havebeen processed. In September 2005 TGS-NOPEC submitted aNotice for Phase III seismic. Which constituted more 2Dseismic data in the Mannar Basin. This was not approved bythe PRDC.

In February 2006 Mr. A. P. A. Gunasekera, Secretary to theMinistry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources wrote to TGS-NOPEC and requested that they submit the Phase II data tothe Petroleum Resources Development Committee (PRDC). InMarch 2006 TGS-NOPEC representatives visited the Ministryfor a meeting with the Ministry officials. In that meeting theMinister revealed that the GOSL is planning to award twoexploration blocks, one each to India and China, outside a bidround; that is, direct award of blocks. In a letter dated April05, 2006 TGS-NOPEC complained that the direct award ofexploration blocks will reduce the industry interest in the basinand thereby adversely affect the economic return to TGS-NOPEC through data sales. They wrote that the decision forthe direct award of exploration blocks by the GOSL is countaryto the agreements previously entered into between TGS-NOPEC and CPC. In May 2006 TGS-NOPEC requested ameeting with the Minister of Petroleum and PetroleumResources Development to seek further clarification. Thismeeting was held on May 08, 2006 and again TGS-NOPECcomplained that their return on investment regarding Phase Iand II seismic will be affected by the direct award of explorationblocks and that they need to be compensated by the GOSL forthis loss. TGS-NOPEC stated that they will not give PRDC thePhase II data or the Phase II interpretation report or the GOSLshare of revenue unless a suitable solution to the loss of datasales as a result of direct awards was found. They alsopresented a map suggesting a configuration of explorationblocks in the Mannar Basin. They invited the Secretary to

11491150

[ . . . ]the Ministry and the Director General of PRDS to come toPerth to hold further discussions on the question of revenuereduction due to direct awards and to look at the data andfinalize the exploration blocks map.

The Secretary and the DG visited the TGS-NOPEC officesin perth during May 28 to june 03, 2006. After lengthydiscussions TGS-NOPEC proposed an AmendmentAgreement that would allow TGS-NOPEC to get a 182 percent return on their investment even with the direct awards.As per the agreement all agreed upon data will be given tothe PRDC and the two parties will collaborate on a call forbids to be announced in September, 2006. The minutes of themeeting is *attached here with Annex 1). Subsequently, theDG-PRDS inquired as to whether TGS-NOPEC will give allthe data to us and cancel all agreements for a payment of USdollars eight million. TGS-NOPEC in a fax dated june 14,2006 indicated that they will be willing to do so if it can beexecuted prior to end of june, 2006. It was concluded by theMinistry that the US Dollars eight million could not be foundbefore the end of june.

On june 27, 2006. the Ministry of Petroleum and PetroleumResources Development submitted a Cabinet Paper*(AnnexII). This was passed on the SEMA by the Cabinetand on July 05, the SEMA observations with the approval ofHis Excellency the President was sent to the Ministry. *(AnnexIII). This was followed by a Cabinet decision dated August08. 2006 that followed the SEMA observations.

The SEMA observations and the Cabinet decisionapproved the direct award of exploration blocks to India andChina but advised against a call for bids until proprietary 3Dseismic data are acquired by the GOSL. The meeting, whichis the subjet of this memo, was convened by the President sothat all concerned parties can discuss the situation and agreeupon a way to go forward towards offshore petroleumexploration.

The Meeting

The meeting was held on August 24, and was attended byHis Excellency the President, The Hon. Minister A.H.M.Fowzie, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara (Secretary to the Treasury),officials of the Ministry of Petroleum and PetroleumResources Development officials of the SEMA, officials ofthe Attorney-General office, officials of the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, Presidents legal advisors and one Memberof Parliament. Minister Fowzie stated that the purpose of themeeting is to find a way forward in view of the existingcontrasting views as to how to proceed with offshorepetroleum exploration. The Director-General of PRDS gavea presentation on the bid round proposed by the Ministryand why we should not delay exploration in the Mannar

* . Produced at end of speech.

Basin. His Excellency the President reiterated the need to goahead with exploration without delay and opened the floorfor discussion seeking a practical solution to the problem.The President stated that it is necessary to have all TGS-NOPEC seismic data with us prior to a call for bids as we mayhave to answer to future generations as to what was theinformation base for the proposed exploration blockconfiguration and the bid selection. A lengthy discussionfollowed that led to the following decisions.

Decision

1. A negotiating team that will include officals of theAttorney-Generals office and other suitablegovernment officials to be appointed to negotiatewith the TGS-NOPEC to get all seismic data and toterminate all agreements between the TGS-NOPECand the CPC.

2. The Secretary to the Treasury to find funds(approximately US Dollors 10 million) that may beneeded to pay out TGS-NOPEC.

3. The negotiations and data purchase to be completedby September 30th 2006.

Implementation Plan

1. Appoint a negotiating committee through NPA.

2. Chairman of the negotiating committee to contactTGS-NOPEC, convey Presidents decision and inviteTGS-NOPEC for negotiations with the aim ofobtaining all data that belong to GOSL andterminating all agreements between TGS-NOPEC andCPC. Identify data that need to be submitted to GOSLby TGS-NOPEC (Field tapes, different versions ofprocessed data, interpretation reports et cetera

3. Select a data broker, who will verify along with DG-PRDS, all data submitted by TGS-NOPEC. Data brokerwill store one set of data tapes and handle all datasales on behalf of the GOSL. Since we do not havefacilities to store, copy or interpret seismic data thedata broker need to be a foreign company.

(Another option is to set up a seismic data bank in SriLanka with capabilities to store, copy and interpretseismic data. This will cost US Dollers 1 million andcan be done in three months.)

Other Activities

There are many other activities that can be done in parallelwith the above so that a call for bids can be expedited. Theseinclude;

1. Finalization of the Production Sharing Contractdocument (e.g. Meetings with Saudi Aramco andEgyptian officials);

,2. Finalization of all other documents and maps that areneeded for a call for bids including printing ofdocuments and making CDs

and

2006 0611511152

3. Preparation of necessary regulations and guidelines.(geophysical regulations, drilling regulations andenvironmental regulations and the associated guide-lines as a start).

Thank you Sir.

Memo to: Uon. A.J.L.M. Fowze, Minister of Transport, Railways, Petroleum &Petroleum Resources Development

From: Neil DeSilva, D. G. PRDS and A. P. A. Gunasekerea,Chairman PRDC

Date: June 08, 2006

Subject: Meeting with TGS NOPEC, Perth, Australia, May28 June 03, 2006

On several occasions, TGS - NOPEC has stated that the GOSLsdecision to give exploration blocks to India and China has greatlydiminished their ability to earn an adequate return. As a result, theyhave stopped keeping to their obligations under the non-exclusiveseismic Date Agreement signed between TGS NOPEC and CPE onFebruary, 13, 2002. This situation would have a negative impact onthe planned call for bids. Primary purpose of the meeting was toseek a solution to the problem created by the GOSL decision to awardexploration blocks outside a bidding round.

2. TGS NOPECs main concern is earning US$ 10 million throughdata sales or other means to recover cost (5.5 million) and to earn areturn of 82 percent. TGS NOPEC believe this is not possible asper their pricing structure unless a lump sum of US$ 7.0 million isreceived from the GOST. This money to be raised via signature bonusesof the two direct award blocks. The other US$ 3.00 million to bemissed from data sales. However, under the revenue sharing clausesin the original agreement a total revenue of US$ 12.75 need to beraised before TGS NOPEC gets 10 million. Under this scenarioTGS NOPEC wanted the GOSL to give an undertaking that if theshare of siguature bonuses and data sales do not amount to US$ 10million the shortfall to be paid by the GOSL. TGS NOPEC is willingto remove the requirement of a GOSL undertating if the profit sharingrequirement is suspended until TGS NOPESs revenue reaches US$10 million. Any subsequent revenue will be shared 50/50 with theGOSL.

3. TGS NOPEC is willing to drop the term territorial walesfrom the agreement. However, they will retain exclusive rights tocollect 2D 3D marine seismic data in areas covered by Phase I, PhaseII and the proposed Phase III until February 13, 2012. They willhave exclusive rights to market Phase I and II data for 10 yearsfrom June 2006. For Phase III this period will be 10 years and 3months from the end of field acquisistion.

4. Once Amendment Agreement is signed by the parties TGS NOPEC will carry on their obligations. In addition to the deliverablementioned in the original agreement paper copies of all seismic lineswill be provided with shot point maps.

5. TGS NOPEC will fully cooperate with respect to the plannedbid round and will assist preparation of documents, announcements,road shows and consulting services.

6. TGS NOPEC agreed to the configuration of exploration blocksproposed with the two most northerly and the most southerly onesavailable for direct awards to India and China. The direct awardannouncement to be made prior to the call for bids.

7. Agreements to be governed by the law of the Democratic Sociallist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Dr. Neil R. De Silva,Dirctor General,Petroleum Resources Development

A. P. A. GUNASEKARA,Secretary,Ministry of Petroleum &Petroleum Resources Development.

12. Whenever needed TGS NOPEC will provided professionalassistance to Sri Lanka at their cost.

13. Other than the instances, which require revealing confidentialinformation under the existing law of Sri Lanka, GOSL agreesnot to divulge any confidential information which aregoverned by the said Agreements without the concurrenceof the TGS NOPEC.

In view of the above, the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers issought for the following,

1. To sign the sub - Agreement, which has been preparedincorporations the conditions referred to in items I to 13and consequential matters thereof between TGS - NOPECand PRDC (on behalf of the GOSL) after obtaining theconcurrence of the Attorney General and implementaccordingly.

Cabinet Memorandurn No : 06/1200/217/019

Exploration of Petroleum Resources in Sri LankaMinister of Petroleum & Petroleum Resources Development

The following observations in regard to the above CabinetMemorandum have been made by the Strategic Enterprise ManagementAgency (SEMA), which functions under me.

Observations

(1) We concur with the recommendations made in the CabinetPaper to offer exploration rights to China and India, subjectto restricted tine frame for both exploration and developmentrights.

(2) Negotiate with TGS - NOPEC to obtain Phase I, Phase IIseismic data (2D) immediately and terminate all contracts(current and proposed) after obtaining the data. After perusingthe CPC agreement with TGS - NOPEC if necessary, obtainthe data by making a final negotiated payment.

Background Note

It is important that any future offer of exploration and developmentrights of Petroleum Resources in the Manner Basin or other regionis done only after GOSL has obtained 3D seismic data. The collectionof the 3D seismic data should be done on proprietary basis to GOSLand not on any revenue sharing or other partnership basis with thesurvey carrying party.

The current Manor Basis exploration blocks (excluding the twoparcels given to China and India) should only be auctioned after thecompletion of the 3D survey and in 2 stages with sufficient timegap to evaluate the development potential after the proof of theexploration potential of the first stage. First auction should be for 03blocks and the balance 04 blocks in the 2nd stage, respectively.

Now, Sir, I would like to speak a few words in English ona few matters which, I feel, are of serious concern. That is,to bring to the notice of this House and the Governmentsome of the serious problems that have arisen in the South.One is regarding the abduction of journalists. We see dailyin the newspapers and other journals that there is a serious

concern expressed by journalists about the abduction of theirbrethren. The other is, the abduction of rich and wealthybusinessmen in Colombo. The question is whether this is areturn of the disappearance era. You remember that therewas an era when people disappeared and their whereaboutswere not known. The question now is whether we arecoming back to that same era.

As regards the journalists, I have got here some names,which I would like to bring to the notice of the Hon. PrimeMinister. I have a list. Iyathurai Nadesan, a journalist of theVirakesari, disappeared and was murdered. Then therewere Balanadarajah Iyer, Dharmaretnam Sivaram, Mrs.Relangi Selvarajah, Subramaniam Suhirtharajan, SampathLakmal and a several other journalists. Now the problemis, some of them had been murdered, some of them havebeen abducted and some of them have been released.

There was a detailed article in The Sunday Leadernewspaper of 3rd September, 2006 about the abduction ofthe News Manager of the Sooriyan FM, NadarajahKuruparan, the incident being the highlight of the week.Fortunately for this man, after some days he was released.He relates the story of how he was taken and how he wastreated.

In that same newspaper report, there is reference toabductions of two, three other persons. There is oneLogenthirarajah Komathy. Then, there are Lal Premaratneand Nishanthi Premaratne, a couple related to Komathy.The former had been working for Aero Lanka Private Limitedwhere Komathy was Director, Finance. Nobody has heardso far as to what has happened to these people. So, this isof very serious concern.

The Government should take the responsibility, becauseour Constitution guarantees the safety of the individual,freedom of expression and freedom of speech. If thesepeople are publishing reports which are not welcomed bythe Government, I do not know whether the treatment metedout to them should be, bumping them off or murderingthem or abducting them creating problems. Of course, weknow that recently the President invited all the journalistsand addressed them. I do not know whether this is inkeeping with the covenants of the United Nations to whichwe are signatories.

Then, the next question is with regard to the abductionof rich and wealthy businessmen, more particularly of theTamil community in the City of Colombo. An articlepublished in the Daily Mirror newspaper of 05th September,2006, states that it is a move to break the economicbackbone of the Tamil community in the South. This isnot only in the North, but mostly in the South, particularlyin the City of Colombo. There are not only abductions, butkillings and extortions as well. All this is being carriedout in broad daylight.

The same article gives out the details of some of thepeople who have been abducted. It states, I quote:

....Tamil community which has in recent months witnessed withhorror, killings, abductions and extortion of Tamil businessmen.

In the past few months several prominent Tamil businessmen hadbeen abducted in broad daylight on Colombo roads. Many havebeen released after payment of ransom running into millions ofrupees.

Sir, the matter is very well known to the police and certainMembers of the Government. But very unfortunately,nothing tangible has been done in regard to ensuring theirsafety and preventing the repetition of such abductionsand extortions that are going on. Complaints have beenmade, but no action has been taken. What happens is, whenthe complaint is made to the local police and when the localpolice is about to embark on the investigation, the InspectorGeneral of Police sends an order asking them to refer it tothe CID. After that no one knows what happens. It goesunderground and nothing is known after that. So, this issomething very suspicious, because there are various storiesas to the groups that are responsible for this. One groupoperating, they say, is run by the IGP. Then, there is anothergroup, they say, run by some army soldiers and the thirdgroup, they say, by some Tamil paramilitary organization.So, this is a very serious situation.

This same article states, I quote:

A well-known jeweller in Sea Street was abducted from his homein Bambalapitiya a few months ago. He was released after paymentof a large ransom.....

Probably, he had been told not to divulge how much hepaid. But, the man was forced to pay. It is not only him,but also there are several others.

It further states, I quote:

One of the largest property developers in Colombo; an engineer,who built some of the more famous apartment condominiums andbusiness super structures in Colombo has coughed up over Rs. 100million as part of a deal to avoid kidnapping ....

Finally what happened was, that man, having paid that,left the shores of Sri Lanka, vouching no longer to comeback and live in this country.

Then again, it states, Sir, I quote:

One of the largest importers of a daily-consumed food item, .

I think he was a sugar importer, if I am not mistaken, hewas engaged in trading to the value of billions of rupees.

It further states, I quote:

. was kidnapped from the heart of Colombo 7 about amonth ago.

11611162

[ ]He was taken to a border village in the Batticaloa District.They say that Welikanda is the place, generally, where thesepeople are being taken and kept until the ransom is paid.Not only them - these are only a few incidents that Ihighlighted - but there are a large number of people, middlelevel businessmen, who have been kidnapped in theColombo area and released on payment of a ransom rangingfrom Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 2 million. So, this is a continuousthing that is going on. They say the kidnappers come inwhite vans or expensive jeeps, the type used by politicians.They come with automatic weapons, the businessmen areforced to get into the van and taken away. According tothe same article, the victims have complained to the TNAMembers, who say, without evidence, they cannot take anyaction.

Now the question is, Sir, today they may be abductingthe Tamil businessmen; tomorrow they will go for theMuslims; thereafter, they will go for the Sinhalese. Thiswould become a pattern of enriching themselves at theexpense of other people and the danger is, according to thesame article, I quote :

This pattern has been observed in other plural societies thateventually collapsed, giving way to anarchy, disorder and civil warbecause the political leadership in the countries concerned were unableor unwilling to step in favour of those under threat.

So, this is a very dangerous situation. If you allow thisto continue, there would be very serious repercussions andthe whole country would have to suffer.

Then, Sir, next I would like to make a few comments aboutthe killing of the seventeen aid workers working in theFrench NGO. The European Parliament has expressedserious concern. The UN representatives in Sri Lanka andthe SLMM have expressed their views as to who wasresponsible. Whatever the Government may have said, theseviews have now gone to Europe and other parts of the world.Whoever may have done it, it is the Government of the daythat is responsible. The Government has to ensure thesecurity of all citizens, whoever it may be. If not, we donot need a Government. A Government is there to ensurethe security and safety of its citizens.

Our Constitution very clearly enumerates and it isenshrined in the Constitution that the Government of theday shall guarantee the safety of individuals, of all citizensand the freedom of speech and expression. So, these arethings that the Government cannot put behind. Thesituation in Sri Lanka today, sad to say, is like somethingthat is in Iraq or for that matter, like the crisis the MiddleEast has experienced for the last several years.

Now to add to this, there is harassment of genuine NGOO,which are performing urgent humanitarian services to therefugees both in the North and the East. These NGOO arenow finding it very difficult to continue their humanitarian

services in view of this harassment. In times of crises suchas war or that of tsunami, it is the NGOO which looked afterthe innocent citizens, who suffered without any support fromGovernment officials. A large amount of foreign funds wasbrought into the country and that was used for immediaterebuilding and rehabilitation of the masses. We haveexperienced the great service that the NGOO have rendered.I do not know why, without adequate proof and withoutadequate evidence, they have come to a conclusion to throwout these NGOO from the humanitarian services they arerendering.

Even in the Israeli-Lebonese War, it was the CaritasInternational, which is a Christian organization, that helpedand assisted all the Sri Lankan housemaids and workers whowere stranded without food and shelter, because ourembassy did not have the resources to give them a hand orhelp them in their distress. It is of regret to note the mannerin which these NGOs are treated. They are now being orderedto leave their work sites and funds have been confiscated.Therefore what has happened is the goodwill between theGovernment on the one hand and the NGOs and the aidworkers on the other has now disappeared. I do not knowwhether we would have any assistance forthcoming fromthe International Non-Governmental Organizations in thefuture.

Then as regards the violation of human rights and theproblems that the Non-Governmental Organizations have toface, there is a serious situation that has arisen in the UN andthey have taken up this matter. The headline of an articlethat appeared in The Sunday Leader newspaper of 3rd

September, 2006 reads as follows. I quote:

Top UN official arrives to study human rights situation

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga) 10 . .

That article states, I quote:

.....the UN under secretary for humanitarian affairs Jan Egeland tostudy the situation in Sri Lanka and forward a report especially on themassacre of the 17 aid workers.

Now it has got internationalized.

It further states, I quote:

Special emissary Denis McNamara was expected in Sri Lankayesterday and is tasked with reporting on the massacre of the aidworkers, disappearances and extra judicial killings and the investigationscarried out

2006 0611631164

And a reported is to be submitted.

It further goes on to state, I quote:

McNamara will make an assessment whether it is safe for UNagencies to continue its operations in Sri Lanka.

Sir, this is a very serious matter. We have never had thissituation. It is also learnt that the reports from the expertgroups which are studying this situation will be before theCo-Chairs when they meet on the 11th of September. This isthe most serious situation. We need to discuss how to respondto the current developments in Sri Lanka. The question iswhether the aid group meeting will consider and take seriouscognizance of the violation of the fundamental rights andthe atrocities that are committed in Sri Lanka in approvingaid for the year 2007. This is a very serious matter. Of course,His Excellency the President himself has invited the UN andother foreign humanitarian agencies to come and investigatewhat is happening in the North and East. That is very usefuland there is a suggestion that the Government in that eventshould tell the UN agencies to follow the example with regardto what took place in Nepal. I am not going to give details ofwhat took place in Nepal. But if we follow that procedure,we will be able to arrive at some solution.

Next, I would like to speak on the situation which isprevailing in South India. I mean Tamil Nadu. The politicalparties including the Congress and all other Oppositionparties have now come together. They have joined to decideon the Sri Lankan issue. So much so they are trying to usepressure on Delhi, particularly on the Prime Minister to callupon the Centre to intervene and try to bring about a peacefulsettlement in Sri Lanka. Sir, there is much love and affectionfor Sri Lanka in Tamil Nadu and we see that the Sri Lankaissue has come to the agenda of the Tamil Nadu politics andtheir governance. There are so many Tamils in Jaffna andother parts of the country whose origin is Tamil Nadu. So,there is so much of love and affection shown by the people inTamil Nadu for the people of Sri Lanka. There are over 65million Tamils who are emotionally linked with the Tamilsof Sri Lanka and for that matter even the Muslims, on thebasis of language. Over 9000 Sri Lankans have gone acrossto India in spite of the great danger in travelling by sea.Women, children and all are going to India for safety whichwe should be ensuring for them in Sri Lanka.

I am not trying to make it a point or trying to hold a brieffor India. But the fact is, when we were in government duringthe period 2001-2004 we brought the situation to normalcywhere a large number of people who had taken refuge inIndia for similar reasons prior to 2001, in fact started comingback to Sri Lanka. Large numbers came back which bothTamil Nadu and the then Delhi Governments appreciated.We, in the UNP are proud about this achievement.Unfortunately today, for their personal safety, these peopleare risking their lives in the sea to go to India. They knowthat the living conditions in those refugee camps - food,

shelter et cetera - are poor. They know they are not evenwelcome. Yet, sadly they go to save their lives and theirchildrens in the hope that they can return to their countryonce peace returns.

Sir, the current Sri Lankan situation is creating difficultiesto the Chief Minister in Tamil Nadu. As we learn from thepress, Mr. Karunanidhi has to now face daily demonstrations,hartals and bandh that dominate the news in various parts ofTamil Nadu. Members in the State Assembly are demandingthat a group of MPs be permitted to visit Jaffna andTrincomalee - this matter was highlighted in the press recently- and see for themselves the situation prevailing there.Another proposal is for an all party group of Tamil Membersof the State Assembly of Tamil Nadu to visit Delhi and meetthe Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh and presenta resolution for immediate action on the Sri Lankan issue.

So, this situation, I do not think is a healthy one. TheGovernment should take very serious note of what is takingplace and bring about a peaceful settlement by way of a set ofproposals. If the Government is genuine in calling for peacetalks or peace proposals, I am sure that at the last SLFPConvention His Excellency the President would have madea statement in this regard. We all were expecting that hewould do so but very unfortunately it was not done. If theGovernment of Sri Lanka has obtained military aid fromPakistan including pilots - they say for bombing - can itsincerely call upon India to help Sri Lanka? This is a bigquestion that is now looming in the South Asian capitals.When His Excellency the President himself states that Indiashould play a much bigger role the question is, will the requestbe answered in the affirmative or negative? We all know thatthe relationship between the two countries, India andPakistan, is not as it should be. We cannot afford toantagonize our immediate neighbour. We have been repeatingthis over and over again. As I see, India should come first andthe others second.

I would like to suggest to the Government, if Mr.Karunanidhi, the Chief Minister in Tamil Nadu, is preparedto do the brokering of the peace settlement on the North-Eastquestion, why not we try to explore that possibility? Evenin the early stages of the Sri Lankan conflict, Gandhi requestedthe present Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Karunanidhito go and meet Prabhakaran and bring about a peacefulsettlement between the Government of Sri Lanka and theterrorists. So, still there is the opportunity. Look at thisproblem today. There are 2,255 people who are displacedwithout housing, without shelter, without food and withoutproper medical facilities. The situation is precarious. Thenthere is the problem of people who are moving to Tamil Naduand there are about 9,000 people who have settled there.

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga)Sir, give me two more minutes.

Therefore, in view of this situation we still like to urge-

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) 10 .

( +)(The Hon. John Amaratunga) , . Thequestion is, forms had been circulated particularly to theTamil people in Colombo and its suburbs asking them todisclose particulars in regard to their households. Now, Sir,this is a terrible form because it asks for all sorts of informationcreating a lot of problems. They have to go to the GramaSevaka, get it certified and then disclose the information.All that is not necessary. A simple form would be sufficient.

Therefore, I would urge the Government to look into thismatter, to tell the Police Department which has beenresponsible for this form to simplify it and rid the people ofthe confusion of filling these forms which create enormousproblems.

Thank you very much.

[. . 11.25]

( )( - )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike - Minister of Tourism)No Sir, I will not take 15 minutes. I will try and finish inabout 10 minutes. May I congratulate the new DeputyChairman of Committees however brief his stay may be there.We had a raucous session yesterday in appointing the DeputyChairman of Committees, which was quite unnecessary butas you are there we would like to congratulate you on yourtemporary elevation to the seat of Deputy Chairman ofCommittees.

Now, Sir, I would like to begin my speech by saying thatwe would like to congratulate the armed services of thiscountry particularly, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force andthe Police on the tremendous victories that they have gainedin the last few months. These are historic victories againstterrorism, not against the Tamil people. May I say that again.This is a war not against the Tamil people but it is againstterrorism and the victory at Sampur was indeed a tactical anda marvellous move by the army. But, let the army also keep inmind that what you capture you must learn to keep. That is

2006 0611751176

why Napoleon Bonaparte repeatedly said for me to conqueranother nation is very simple but for me to hold on is ratherdifficult. Therefore, in the words of Napoleon Bonapartemay I say that it is a great victory at Sampur but you mustconsolidate it and make sure that it will not go back to thehands of those who held it before. Now Sir, we have done thisat a great cost. We have lost hundreds of soldiers. They alsohave lost hundreds of their men. There are 200,000 refugees,Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils alike. There are children whowere murdered at Kebithigollewa, harmless, innocentSinhalese children and women who were butchered like cattleby the LTTE in the heart of Medawachchiya , the electorateof former Deputy Leader of the SLFP, the late Mr. MaithripalaSenanayake. I would also like to congratulate the Police forkeeping the incidents in Colombo to a minimum becauseColombo gets a battering whenever the LTTE gets a batteringin Jaffna or in the North and the East. They tend to dosomething in Colombo. This time we have been able toprevent not totally but to keep it down to a minimum andthe police have acted with great restraint and we mustcongratulate all our forces for what they have done.

As a family that has commanded the armed services of thiscountry for 28 years of this countrys Independence both myfather and my mother and my sister who have beenCommanders-in-Chief of the armed services would have beenproud today at the way in which our armed services havereacted. May I also extend my congratulations to PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa for his pragmatic, for his intelligent andpatient approach and encouraging the army to go forwardand defeat terrorism and bring about peace in this country.Therefore, I speak with some emotion because we as SriLankans - I do not want to say we as Sinhalese - are proudthat we have been able to even make a dent, I will not say atotal victory, in the armoury of the LTTE in their strategyand in their murderous path that they have been carrying onfor so long. It is the valiant soldier who has paid all thepenalties. We politicians come here and pontificate, and onplatforms we pontificate but it is they who do the fighting.They lose their lives or they lose their limbs. Recently, in theattack on Sampur, I believe, some 20 odd soldiers have losttheir legs for land mines. So, they have to live with one legall their lives and our hearts and minds go out to them morethan to the Commanders and to the Generals who have alsocontributed a great deal. But, it is those soldiers who havepaid the penalty. So, Mr. Deputy Chairman, may I once again,having congratulated the army and President Rajapaksa saythat this is a victory against the inhuman terrorism.[Interruption.] I do not want to go into an argument with Mr.Maheswaran. because this Debate is certainly above a pettyargument across the Floor of the House which I am quitecapable of taking on. I have taken on much greater peoplethan you. I have taken on Mr. J. R. Jayewardene, Mr. R.Premadasa, Mr. Gamini Dissanayake, Mr. Lalith AthulathMudali, Mr. Ronnie de Mel, Mr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne, Mr.Ranjan Wijeratne. Taking you on is a kajjak for me . But,I will not do that because I am not here to score points. I amhere to drive a point to the House. The purpose of my speech

Sir, is that the battle cannot be won in the battlefield. Thewarmongers who want to instil a sense of war amongst thepeople will continue to do that for political expediency. But,the battle must be won not in the battlefields, but in winningthe hearts and the minds of the Tamil people. That is thepoint I want to make. Whether it is a victory in Sampur or adefeat in Sampur, the problems and the grievances that forcedthe Hindus of the North and the East to this must beconsidered. The Hindu religion is something which is veryclose to my heart though I am a Buddhist. I worship yourGods: Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesh, Lord Skantha, Lord Vishnu.It is a compassionate religion composed of some of the finestmythology in the world and Hinduism is a religion whichpreaches compassion. As a believer in certain aspects ofHinduism, as a follower of certain aspects of Hinduism, mayI say, let us stop for a moment and think, Mr. Prime Minister,why these conservative, caste-conscious Hindus were forcedinto taking up arms and forced into a war, for which, probably,we are at fault.

It is true that the Tamil leaders have misled them. From thetime of Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam, they were saying one thingin Colombo and another thing in Jaffna. It was the same withMr. Amirthalingam; it was the same with everybody else.But the two major parties that have ruled this country for 55years, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United NationalParty, are responsible equally or in part for the plight of theTamil people. That, I say and I say it with all seriousness -that we have, both, contributed consciously or unconsciouslyto this great tragedy that Sri Lanka had to face for the last 25years. I think my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella,would understand better than most others - he had been alongstanding Member of the SLFP - that we have both, forpolitical expediency at times of national disaster, used theTamil problem for political purposes and now we are payingthe price.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, we do not also forget that we cannotbe complacent. You may have won Sampur; you may havedefended Colombo to a greater extent; you may havecaptured other areas, but to be complacent is very foolishbecause you have only wounded the Tiger. A tiger woundedis worse than a tiger not wounded. There is a saying in Sinhalawhich in English is, Do not wound a tiger for it bites evenharder. So, let us keep that in mind. Let us be ever vigilantthat the LTTE can strike at will wherever they want,particularly in the South, in the capital City of Colombo andalso in the North and the East and we should not be lulledinto a sense of complacency because you have won Sampuror you have captured some LTTE territory.

Sir, let us not cheer, let us not overstate our case for thestate of the war. Take the example of President George W.Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair. Both gentlemensratings are down to 32 per cent. When President Clintonretired eight years ago, his rating was 63 per cent. PresidentBushs ratings, in seven years of his presidency, have comedown to 32 per cent. Prime Minister Blair is hanging on tohis premiership whilst his whole party wants him to go; hisentire party wants him to go. Why? Because of the war inIraq. A very popular Prime Minister, three times electedPrime Minister of England.

11771178

. ( )(The Hon. T. Maheswaran) .

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)Leave His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa out of this. Iam talking about Blair, Tony Blair and George W. Bush.What happened to them? They went and put their fingersinto a war which should never have started. Iraq never hadweapons of mass destruction. Iraq had no intention ofattacking anybody. Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush, you went andattacked Iraq; you decimated an independent, free, sovereignnation; you went and antagonized Saddam Hussein and todayIraq is a battlefield of corpses. It is a cemetery; the wholenation is a cemetery! Now you are trying to threaten Iran forthe possession of nuclear weapons. If the IranianGovernment, which is a democratically elected Government,assures the world that they will not use it for destructivepurposes, for Gods sake, believe them! You cannot declarewar on the whole world. You declared war on Vietnam. Whathappened? The Americans had to flee Vietnam and learnt abitter lesson. And today they are the biggest investors inVietnam, Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne.

What happened in Afghanistan? Afghanistan is today thebiggest opium producer in the world, which is also beingtransported to the United States. You go and get involved inIraq, Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush, you had no business to getinvolved in. Now you are trying to threaten Iran, which isnot going to be as easy as Iraq. I mean, how many fronts areyou going to fight on?

The ratings of both President Bush and Prime MinisterBlair have reached the low depths they have reached becauseof the unnecessary killings, an unnecessary war for politicalexpediency. I say this bravely because I have visited boththose countries more than three dozen times at my ownexpense. I hardly travel at Government expense. I havebeen to America about 40 times and only twice I had been asa guest of the Government when I accompanied my sisterwhen she was President and I was Foreign Minister. So, donot kindly put me into the category of politicians who travelgratis on State account.

Sir, may I once again say that war is not a solution. War isonly to combat terrorism. The solution lies in a politicalsolution. Just because you have won Sampur or you havewon something else or you have wiped the LTTE out, assumethat you do that, even then a political solution is absolutelynecessary. Because even if you wipe the LTTE out, the seedswhich caused the original grievance, which caused the LTTEto take up arms and for a placid Tamil people to become warmasters will remain and will grow and the future generations,after we are no longer in this House, after we are no longeramongst the living, will have to face a worse time, worseterrorism than we have ever faced before.

So, let us now at least, that we have had these victories, bemagnanimous; let us be generous and let us stand aboveparty ground. I congratulate President Mahinda Rajapaksafor being pragmatic in offering his hand of friendship acrossthe political divide to the United National Party to join himin an effort to solve this problem for all times. This must bean effort which is sincere; it must be an effort which gives theUNP a place which they deserve; it must be an effort to bring85 per cent of the Sinhalese people together, which you andwe represent. Let us reach across the board to the TNA andthe Sri Lanka Muslim Congress because the Muslims have avital role to play in this. I am one politician who hasconsistently said that the Muslims will have to be an integralpart of the talks. It is absolutely essential that their grievancesare taken into account because they are the ones who havesuffered and amongst those 200,000 refugees, most of themare Muslims. Sir, on that matter, I agree with my Friend, theHon. Rauff Hakeem. Therefore, let us reach to all the othercommunities. Let us even reach to our Friend, the Hon.Maheswaran, who is with one leg in the Elephant camp, theother leg in the Tiger camp -

( )( - )(The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva - Deputy Minister of Labour)

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) I am sorry, Sir. Thank you,Mervyn.

So, Sir, if we are responsible for this major tragedy, we areresponsible for finding a solution to this. I do not want todrag this argument any further. I have stated that defeatingterrorism is one thing; finding a solution to the Tamil problemis another.

My father in 1938, in the State Council as Member forVeyangoda, long before we had Independence and when thelate Mr. D. S. Senanayake, the late Mr. J.R. Jayewardene, thelate Mr. Dudley Senanayake were all present with Mr. S.J.V.Chelvanayakam, Mr. Ponnambalam and all the Tamil leadersthere, was the only Sinhalese who had the courage to advocatefederalism publicly 60 years ago and we are still at squareone; still we are talking of a federal solution.

The Indian Government has told us very clearly as friends- We do not have to take orders from anybody. India is ourclosest friend and we must be aware of the constraints ofIndia: India has 70 million Tamils in Tamil Nadu; they are apart of the Government; they have a very fragile coalition,like the one we have here. So, in that situation, you cannotexpect the Indian Government to do more than what theyhave done. Now, may I say that if you know how to handlethe relations with India, half the battle is won. Unfortunately,the goodwill that my father developed with Prime MinisterNehru and my mother had with Prime Minister Indira Gandhiwas ruined by the UNP in 1977 because you bad-mouthedher, you abused her and she nurtured and trained the terroristsbecause she wanted to teach the UNP a lesson. You areresponsible for the relations with India, it came to such astate where President Jayewardene had to invite the IPKF tocome here. For that, you must be held responsible. I havesaid this on the Floor of this House on many occasions, thatyou have mishandled relations with India from 1977 to 1987when you got your act together under force because Rajivcame and landed rice packets or parippu packets on Jaffna.

Sir, India has a key role to play in this, but a role that islimited because nobody wants to be Indias lackey. I am agreat admirer of India; I am a great admirer of the Nehru family.I have known the grandfather, the mother and the son andonly the Holy Ghost I do not know. I have known them all.They have been our close friends and the Indian CongressParty has been very close friends of the Sri Lanka FreedomParty. We congratulate Madam Sonia Gandhi for having wonthe elections. It is the first time that a ninety per cent Hinducountry voted for an Italian Catholic as their Prime Ministerwhich shows tremendous emancipation of the Indian people.Let us take a cue from India. I think federalism may not bebased on the Indian system. With alterations if necessary,with amendments if necessary, some kind of federalism has tobe evolved in Sri Lanka.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

Is the SLFP accepting a federal solution?

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)That is my view. The view of the SLFP is not known yet.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

The UNP has openly stated, Hon. Member, that they are fora federal solution. We have openly said so.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)Yes, I know that.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

So, if you accept a federal solution, may be you coulddiscuss matters. I mean, the Alliance.

( )(The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike)Yes. Well, the view of both the former PresidentKumaratunga and myself is that we should go for a federalsolution and I am sure the SLFP would consider that veryseriously. If you are agreeable to that we can discuss on thoselines. There is no problem about that. Obviously, that is onealternative that we have got, the only alternative we havegot. In that situation, Sir, may I say that where India isconcerned, we have to get their assistance, we have to beguided by them. But we are free to have our friends.

Being friendly with India does not mean that we are goingto fight with Pakistan. I am sorry that the ex-Pakistani HighCommissioner in Sri Lanka has gone back to Karachi or

11811182

[ ]Islamabad and made a statement that India was responsiblefor the attempt on his life. Without a shred of evidence thisman goes and accuses India. We do not want to become theplayground of our neighbours problems. India is fightingPakistan over Kashmir. They are not fighting in Sri Lanka.So, why should Mr. Wali Khan or whatever his name is dragin India on to Sri Lankan soil? I am totally against that.Equally I am against the role that the Indian HighCommissioner is playing. Let me make it clear and clear asthe sound of a crystal bell that we had a High Commissionerhere called J.N. Dixit, the late Mr. J.N. Dixit, the last Viceroyof India. He earned the name through his absolute obduracy,his arrogance and his absolute stubbornness. He went andbuckled Sri Lanka-India relations forever and Rajiv Gandhipaid with his life for the mistakes of J.N. Dixit, who is nolonger amongst the living. So I will not say anymore.

I note that the Indian High Commissioner is now dabblingin Sri Lankan politics trying to forge links. Dear MadamRao, please look after your Embassy; we will look after SriLanka. Give us your assistance, give us your advice, but donot dabble into the political affairs of your neighbours. We,Sri Lankans are proud to be Sri Lankans. We do not wantforeign ambassadors here telling us whom to form allianceswith and to kind of interfere in the internal affairs of SriLanka. So, let not the new Indian High Commissioner herefollow the footsteps of J.N. Dixit. The charming Mrs. Rao,I am sure, would be more amenable to reason than Mr. Dixitwas.

Now, Sir, whilst congratulating the President on invitingthe UNP to discuss these matters, let us hope that the UNPtakes it in the same spirit. My good Friend, Mr. RanilWickremasinghe, I have known him for the last fifty yearsbecause we started our friendship in the kindergarten and Ihave known him for, probably, much longer than anyone inthis House. He is a practical, intelligent man and I hope hesensibly reacts to this and accepts our hand of friendship infinding a solution to not only the ethnic problem, but eventhe economic problems that we are facing today because theaverage man is finding it impossible to live. We, as politiciansmust understand that more than anything else - [Interruption.]I saw that and I am very happy about that. I sincerely hopethat both the major parties will be able to sink theirdifferences, forget their pettinesses, forget their personalityclashes and get together in the greater interest of this nation.

Now, Sir, in winding up I thank my good Friend, the Hon.Mervyn Silva, Professor Mervyn Silva - I am sorry, Sir, Iforgot his appendage- for parting with his five minutes. I donot intend to take any longer. May I say, Sir, finally thatwhatever happens in the battlefield, the war must be won bywinning the hearts and minds of the Tamil people. Let usbring back the glory that Sri Lanka had. Let us not be knownas brutes who have slaughtered UN refugee workers, whohave bombed churches with children inside, who have burntTamils alive. That also goes equally to the LTTE. Let the

LTTE not show the world that they are brutes and animals bykilling innocent Sinhalese men, women and children whohave nothing to do with this conflict like what happened atKebithigollewa.

Therefore, Sir, let us reach for the stars. Let us reach for theunreachable because those who make those moves are theones whose names are written in history. Let us not go downas those who sat in this House for ten years and spoke rubbishand did nothing. Let us not go down in history as a nation oftalkers, make-believers and war mongers. Let us go down inhistory as a great nation it was once. So to do that, let all ofus in this House, whatever party we belong to, work together,the Government and the Opposition, the minority partiesand solve this problem once and for all. Having dealt withterrorism let us now deal with the political realities of theproblem and to do that you need courage, you need sagacityand you need pragmatism. I am sure that both PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa and the Leader of the Opposition, theHon. Ranil Wickremasinghe have that with their years ofpolitical experience. The Hon. Prime Minister himself hasbeen in this House from 1960 and he is a man of great patience,great tolerance and great understanding. Let us be guided bypeople like these who can think above their noses, see beyondtheir noses. He is one person whom I have known for the last25 years. He is a person who has never ever nurtured orharboured ill-feelings towards the minorities. In publicplatforms, we may say various things. Those are not what wereally mean. But, he is a person who can guide the Presidentand all of us on our path towards peace and I am sure that theGovernment would take that initiative and I am sure myFriends in the United National Party would also see reasonand extend their hand of friendship and so would the Muslimsand so would our Friends in this House to whichever partythey belong.

Thank you very much, Sir, for the time that has beenallocated to me.

I want the Minister, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle tolisten to me for a while. [Interruption.] I do not knowwhether I have time. But, anyway I will tell the Hon. PrimeMinister later. There are 13 checkpoints, there are barriersand so on. At certain checkpoints they allow the people topass through without any difficulty. But particularly at thePaddirippu Bridge, they ask the people to walk across it.They do not allow even a push-bicycle to proceed on thatBridge. So people have to walk across the bridge to get tothe other side. It is not good to do a thing like that to thosepeople. Tomorrow we are having a big festival at theMandur-Kataragama Temple. It is not actually Kataragama,it is sinna-Kataragama. It is a small Kataragama temple. Ifthe Hon. Prime Minister can order the STF to liberalize thesearrangements, these people can move about without anydifficulty. They allow only the Government officials toproceed.

The other matter is the case with regard to the death of17 aid workers of Action Contre la Faim which is a FrenchNGO operating in Mutur. We understand that this case hasbeen shifted to Anuradhapura Courts. This is a politicallymotivated move. Why do you want to shift it toAnuradhapura? Do you not have any faith in Trincomalee?Trincomalee is a town where all three communities livetogether. ? ? ? , + 17 ? , ? +, + +
